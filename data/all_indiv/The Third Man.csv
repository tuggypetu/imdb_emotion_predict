10.0,fantastic film that takes place in postwar Vienna,"Even today in Vienna, one can take the ""Third Man Tour"" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn't go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double. Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.Western novelist Holly Martins (Cotten) comes to Vienna at the behest of his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives, he learns that Lime is dead after being hit by a car. He investigates and finds the circumstances very strange indeed, especially when learning there was a third man that helped carry Harry's body to the sidewalk, a man who has since disappeared.He then meets Harry's girlfriend (Alida Valli). And he also meets a police officer in the British section of Vienna, Inspector Calloway (Trevor Howard), who tells him that Harry was a murderer and a racketeer, and it's better that he's dead. Holly is shocked and demands proof.One of the most atmospheric films ever made, with its zither music, cinematography, and Vienna at nighttime. Then there's some brilliant dialogue, particularly the ""cuckoo clock"" speech made by Orson Welles.The cinematography is particularly striking: odd angles, back lighting, and shadows on empty streets. And who can forget the man hidden in the doorway, when the light from an apartment goes on and shows his face - certainly one of the great appearances of a star in a film.One feels Lime's presence throughout the film, though he only has five minutes of screen time.Though none of these actors were the first choice to play their roles, they are all excellent.There was a Third Man TV series in 1959 that ran for six years and starred Michael Rennie as Lime. In the series, Lime is a hero. He's no hero in the movie, but it is a powerful story and film, never forgotten once seen.",fantastic film that takes place postwar vienna,even today vienna one can take third man tour der dritte man except course that orson welles wouldnt go into viennese sewers those scenes were done england there were actual sewer scenes with double never mind it is still magnificent black white film 99 filmed vienna directed by carol reed it stars joseph cotten orson welles alida valli western novelist holly martins cotten comes vienna at behest his old friend harry lime but when he arrives he learns that lime is dead after being hit by car he investigates finds circumstances very strange indeed especially when learning there was third man that helped carry harrys body sidewalk man who has since disappeared he then meets harrys girlfriend alida valli he also meets police officer british section vienna inspector calloway trevor howard who tells him that harry was murderer racketeer its better that hes dead holly is shocked demands proof one most atmospheric films ever made with its zither music cinematography vienna at nighttime then theres some brilliant dialogue particularly cuckoo clock speech made by orson welles cinematography is particularly striking odd angles back lighting shadows empty streets who can forget man hidden doorway when light apartment goes shows his face certainly one great appearances star film one feels limes presence throughout film though he only has five minutes screen time though none these actors were first choice play their roles they are all excellent there was third man tv series 1959 that ran six years starred michael rennie as lime series lime is hero hes no hero movie but it is powerful story film never forgotten once seen,0.4470518207282913,0.1548809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Simply Beautiful,"I don't know why this movie always hooks me the way it does; it's obviously a masterpiece and a revered piece of British/American cinema - but that alone is not the reason (there are other such masterpieces which fail to have that effect on me). Maybe it's the setting: the beautiful city of Vienna right after World War II, the scars of the most devastating conflict in human history still visible at every corner. Or it's the contrast between the eerily happy music tune - which plays throughout the entire film - and the dark, tragic story of murder and betrayal which I find so strangely captivating. Whatever it is, I just love this movie.'The Third Man' now has more than 60 years on its back, but its age hardly shows. Despite the story's dark themes, the general mood of the narrative is rather light, sometimes darkly funny, and the slightly cynical tone and morally ambiguous characters give the movie a very modern feel. What also stands out and makes the film memorable - in addition to the fantastic soundtrack - is the outstanding, Accademy Award winning cinematography. Black and white has rarely looked better. The way DOP Robert Krasker plays with unusual angles and virtually ""paints"" this city of Vienna with light and shadow, he adds an almost expressionistic quality to the film. I always felt that the city plays an essential part in the story, - a key character if you will - with its damaged buildings reflecting the damaged human characters. The recent war is a looming presence throughout the film, and to me this is as much a story about the desensitizing effect of war on people as it is a murder mystery. And there is yet another quality to the film which needs to be mentioned: it's very entertaining. 'The Third Man' has fantastic pacing and there is simply not a dull moment in it. To sum up my overall impressions, this is one of those rare occasions where everything just falls right into place and helps create a unique film experience: Carol Reed's masterful direction and the wonderful performances by the fantastic actors (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli and Orson Welles); the beautiful soundtrack by Anton Karas; the gorgeous cinematography by Robert Krasker, and, perhaps most importantly, the story and screenplay by Graham Greene with its unexpected twists and turns (although the unusual, iconic ending wasn't Greene's idea).

10.0,Confused ethics in a devastated world,"""The Third Man"" is widely considered as the best British film ever (e.g. British Film Institute 1999 poll, Sight & Sound polls). It is a landmark in worldwide cinema notably for its unique mix of genres: historical, thriller, tragedy, comedy. And it is a brilliant reflection about ethics.The movie is not adapted from a pre-existing book: when Graham Greene was tasked to write the screenplay, he wrote a novel to have a fully consistent plot that he immediately adapted for the screen. As Greene modestly admitted in the foreword he wrote afterwards: ""The film, in fact, is better than the story because it is in this case the finished state of the story."" The book and the movie plots are similar, although there are a few significant variances: for instance, the novel is narrated by Calloway and ends differently (on the latter, see below).HISTORY & TRAGEDYThe movie starts as a historical account of post-war Vienna: the opening speech portrays chaos in Europe; we see footage of the destroyed city, divided into four zones. The plot revolves around black market, some relatively harmless (clothes, watches, cigarettes, etc.), some deadly like penicillin, which is historically accurate. Depiction is first realistic; we are lost like Holly is: many dialogues are in German without subtitles. Some scenes are tragic, notably the one in the children's hospital. Also, Anna's grief about Harry's death is touching.THRILLER & COMEDYRapidly, the movie evolves into a thriller with most ingredients of Noir genre: murders (the porter, Harbin), chases (Holly and Anna, Holly, Harry), numerous night scenes, plot twists, mysteries. Was Harry victim of an accident or a murder? Who was the third man? (This mystery remains unsolved, although it probably was Harry himself.) Where is Harry now?Nonetheless, comical elements are continuously present, except at the end. Holly is a small-time writer of cheap novellas, getting drunk, attracting trouble and failing with women. Many dialogues are funny. Some figures are farcical: Kurtz, customers at the club, Anna's landlady, the balloon-seller, etc. The excellent score adds a sarcastic tone to the whole story (although it is sometimes too present, which partly spoils scenes that would have been better off silent and conversely reduces the impact of music when appropriate).The combination of these styles is easy but efficient. A few examples: The police come twice to Anna's apartment for serious matters (search, arrest)... and each time they are lengthily slammed by the grumpy landlady.The annoying child pointlessly accuses Holly... which triggers a chase against Holly and Anna.Holly is brutally driven by a taxi to an unknown destination and thinks he will be killed. But he is actually dropped at a conference... that is a comical disaster. However two killers show up so he has to run... and gets bitten by a parrot!The police are waiting to arrest Harry. He seems to be coming around the corner... but it is a balloon-seller! The Sergeant has to buy a balloon to drive him away.ETHICSAbove all these elements, the motif of good versus evil is dominant. We see a shattered world that has lost its moral compass: material distress breeds ethical crisis. References are blurred. The porter points up to designate hell and down for paradise.Anna tells the Major ""You have everything upside down.""She twice calls Holly ""Harry"".She symbolically casts dice in Harry's apartment: fate is random.A key scene occurs in the Ferris wheel where the world seems to turn around.The sewer with its foul smell ends up in the romantic blue Danube, as the Sergeant highlights.In this chaotic environment, some cynically take advantage, some stick to their values: Harry and Holly, once friends, are antagonists. But is it so simple? Characters are ambiguous. Holly is on the good side, yet changes his mind three times about helping the police (no/yes/no/yes). And because of his blunders the porter and the Sergeant get killed.The Major who enforces the law blackmails Anna: information or deportation by the Soviets.Anna who is decent loves the criminal Harry regardless. She even says: ""He is still a part of me."" She wears his pyjamas. This double-sidedness is shown by the fact she is an actress playing a different person on stage, with a blonde wig.The main villain is seducing. He first is mysterious: he briefly appears after 1h05 and disappears. He fully shows 10 minutes later and turns out to be extremely intelligent. His speech in the wheel is at the same time ignominious and rhetorically impressive. It is not easy to answer the question: why do we stay virtuous? Revealingly, the ""honest"" Holly remains silent at that moment. Orson Welles' performance is so outstanding that we think he appears on screen for longer than an actual cumulated five minutes. On top of being a great director, he was a great actor.Visually, the historical and moral instability is expressed by frequent darkness, disproportionate shadows and tilted shots, where we constantly feel buildings and characters are going to fall (these shots being too recurrent, by the way). Side note: for night scenes, the cobblestone streets were systematically watered to enhance contrasts.DAZZLING DOUBLE ENDINGEventually, the movie rightfully ends in the sewer. Aesthetically stunning, this sequence is metaphorical in different ways: The underground is where criminals escape the law by crossing borders: it represents the vile underlying part of this confused society. Evil is not East or West; it is not related to countries; it is everywhere. When everybody but Anna goes down there, they want to extirpate evil from its roots.Harry in black and policemen in white sometimes are only a few meters away, illustrating the above-mentioned ambiguity about good and evil.When Harry is looking for a way out, voices emerge from dark tunnels that look like funerary steles: it is as if he guiltily heard the people he murdered talking to him.The sewer feels anthropomorphic: complex, dark, liquid, with different levels and small tubes. Hence figuratively characters dive inside their subconscious to be confronted to their evil part: Holly faces his alter ego Harry for the last time. Their gazes are similarly intense. Harry nods to Holly, a sign of agreement. In the final image, Holly's silhouette in the tunnel resembles Harry's previously.This famous climatic sequence is followed by one of the greatest closing shots in cinema history: after the funeral, Holly waits for Anna. The image is deep, in the axis of the road; music plays softly; leaves are falling; Anna is a small figure that progressively grows bigger. Slowly, she just walks past Holly without looking at him and moves out of the frame. He is left alone. (It constitutes an important difference with the novel, which ends happily: Holly and Anna eventually walk together arm in arm. But Carol Reed thankfully imposed his ending. Greene ultimately admitted it was better.)It is a dazzling shot, sharply contrasting with the previous sequence: bright, slow, silent, empty, melancholic, whilst the sewer sequence was dark, hectic, noisy, suffocating, cruel. It perfectly crowns this masterpiece: Anna despises Holly for his law-abiding betrayal. That's one of the banes of life: we sometimes prefer charismatic devils to honest fools, and love is blind.",confused ethics devastated world,third man is widely considered as best british film ever e

9.0,Vienna Without a Waltz,"Although I am as old as this movie, produced in 1949, I have not aged nearly as well. This film, directed brilliantly by Carol Reed (""Odd Man Out"", ""The Fallen Idol"") and written by Graham Greene, who created a long list of memorable cinematic scripts, ingeniously captures the prevailing atmosphere of disruption and chaos that Vienna, a once highly civilized city, experienced during the years that followed World War II. The upheaval is physical, social, economic, political, moral, spiritual. You name it. Vanquished Vienna, conquered by the Allies, was crippled by turmoil in every imaginable way, and we viewers are given the opportunity to experience it up close, right here.I spent a number of months in Europe after I graduated from college in 1971. Although the war had been over for more than 25 years by then, I was struck by a very pronounced attitude of cynicism on the part of many Europeans regarding uniquely American ideals and principles, which were widely considered to be naive. To me, this film accurately captures this cultural and moral conflict, which lasted for decades and may even survive to this day. ""You and your American principles,"" they would often scoff at me with mocking derision. In many ways, the character of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American who crashes into post-World War II Europe, is a victim of a serious cultural divide. Unlike the Europeans, Martins always has the option of fleeing from the chaos and returning to the United States. For that alone, he may be resented by the local Viennese.What does Anna (Alida Valli) know about the illegal activities of her lover, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), which includes the sale of diluted penicillin to Vienna's hospitals? For children with meningitis, watered down penicillin was not only useless, but it created an immunity from full strength penicillin so that these afflicted children could never receive effective treatment. Corrupted penicillin is a glaring symbol of a totally corrupted Vienna. Harry surely understands the consequences of his business, but what about Anna? Even after the truth about Harry's conduct is clearly revealed to her, she still sticks by him to the bitter end. Love conquers all? Stand by your man, regardless of the misery that he is causing to his innocent victims? While I don't blame her for rejecting the romantic overtures of Martins, who is somewhat of a schnook, what's with her anyway? She reminds me of the Europeans who never once caught a whiff of the burning flesh from the overworked crematoria of the concentration camps that blackened the air all around them. She is deeply in love with Harry, so just shut up about children with meningitis. OK, Anna, whatever you say, sweetheart. Perhaps those silly 18th century costume comedies in which you appear will provide the escape from reality that you so desperately seek. At least you manage to crack a weak, forced smile on stage, which is the only smile that we will ever see from you.From beginning to end, the unusual camera angles, the dark, somber, haunting sidewalks of Vienna, and the conquered city's eerie, drenched cobblestone streets contribute to the overall foreboding atmosphere of the film, which was remarkably photographed by Australian Robert Krasker (""Odd Man Out"", ""Brief Encounter""). From every direction and without advance notice, unforgettable images and characters appear before us, emphasizing an overall mood of mayhem and unpredictability. We witness, for example, Anna's landlady, draped in a bedspread for warmth in a state of deep distress by the sudden invasion of her house by ""officials"" representing not one foreign nation but four of them. Then we observe a ludicrous, bureaucratic ""cultural re-education conference"" offered to the Viennese by the allied victors, presumably to rehabilitate them after seven years of Nazi domination. And from where on earth did the balloon seller come as he pathetically peddles his merry merchandise on the dark, abandoned streets of Vienna, which are not only completely void of children at the time but of all people?And what of the inquisitive, confused character of Holly Martins, played with the usual, smooth agility of Joseph Cotten? As the writer of mass marketed western novels that even a young British sergeant happens to read, why is he broke, and what kind of job would Lime have offered him in an unfamiliar, German-speaking Vienna that is gripped by post-war disorder, unemployment, and foreign occupation? Construction work, perhaps?While some reviewers disliked the zither music of Anton Karas, I think that the unique, high pitched sound contributes to the general atmosphere of nervous tension and uneasiness that prevails. Would you prefer Strauss waltzes instead? They wouldn't be nearly as effective in conveying the overwhelming atmosphere of chaos, even insanity, that plagues Vienna on so many levels at the time.Finally, we are brought to the hidden network of grand Vienna's underground sewers. What could be a more fitting symbol of the underlying foulness that lurks beneath the thin, shallow surface of what we call ""civilization""? This subterranean labyrinth provides the perfect setting for the ending of an extraordinary film that very effectively portrays a world that has succumbed to a state of disorder, misery, and even madness. Ultimately, it is all destined for the sewer.

9.0,That Terrific B&W Cinematography,"In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.But in searching for details of Lime's death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don't add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film's plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.The film's story is okay. But what makes ""The Third Man"" really interesting is the B&W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame's geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.All of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly's disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime's absence. In most outdoor scenes there's a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows.""Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this"", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.The script's dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.The film's acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the ""zither"", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.My one complaint about this film is that it's hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion.""The Third Man"" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&W cinematography.",that terrific b w cinematography,bombed out vienna just after wwii novelist holly martins joseph cotten arrives america renew friendship with his childhood buddy harry lime orson welles much dismay holly freak auto accident has recently killed his friend according those who knew harry but searching details limes death holly gets contradictory stories that dont add up one persons who knew lime is attractive woman named anna schmidt alida valli whose continued presence story invites suspicion films plot has holly searching truth about his friend while trying stave off city detective major calloway trevor howard who tries persuade holly leave vienna films story is okay but what makes third man really interesting is b w cinematography by robert krasker unlike most films camera movement here is restricted so as draw attention each frames geometry typically this film frame is tilted at angle so that both vertical horizontal points reference are off kilter frame images thus become series diagonal straight lines curves further very high contrast lighting especially outdoor scenes at night creates bizarre almost nightmarish look feel are suggestive german expressionism all which results visual disorientation viewers that parallels hollys disorientation both streets vienna his understanding circumstances surrounding limes absence most outdoor scenes theres conspicuous lack crowds lack hubbub one would expect bustling city instead only few secondary characters appear night scenes this sparseness characters streets conveys impression that hidden eyes are watching holly ready pounce at any moment out dark shadows everybody ought be careful city like this says one character holly as implied threat soon man who wants give holly some valuable information is murdered scripts dialogue is quite impressive with some interesting lines points view some dialogue is german which enhances authenticity films acting editing are very very good adding slightly romantic at times melancholy tone this dark film is music zither instrument similar guitar but sounding quite different my one complaint about this film is that its hard keep tabs some background characters trying connect names with faces can be difficult resulting some confusion third man tells interestingly bleak story set bleak desolate urban environment rendered truly mesmerizing by creatively surreal b w cinematography,0.4816739130434783,0.056369565217391324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,The real mccoy when you want to talk serious screen legends!,"What IS it makes THE THIRD MAN the classic most everyone agrees it is? (And lets face it, voted no 35 in the top all-time films gives it MORE than just some passing credibility!) Is it Orson Welles' menace? The whiff of corruption in occupied post-war Vienna? the cuckoo-clock speech atop the big wheel? even Anton Karras' zither? Perhaps ALL these things? If however, you had to nominate just a single influence within the whole production that elevates it to greatness I suggest that would be Robert Krasker's cinematography. The finished product innovatively, was years ahead of its birthright. Time and time again the viewer is bailed up by stunning camera angles and back-lighting. The eerie shadows around the deserted streets and of course the unforgettable first glimpse of Harry Lime (Welles) himself as he skulks like the rat he is, in the corner of the building, lit in close-up suddenly from the light in an adjacent apartment. Offhand I cannot think of a character's more dramatic entrance to a film.Welles in fact has minimal screen time, though his dark presence and influence infiltrate proceedings like an insidious disease.

,A Flawless Classic,"This is a rare film that is flawless in every respect. It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score. ""The Third Man"" is remembered for many things - for Orson Welles' wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises. Adding to these is Joseph Cotten's fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together - it is his character who initiates most of the action, and also through whom we view everything and everyone else.The story starts, after a nicely done prologue, with Martins arriving in Vienna, and finding out that his friend Harry is not only dead but is accused of running a particularly destructive black market racket. Martins sets out at once to prove his friend's innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend - but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better. It is just right that Martins is an innocent who writes cheap novels for a living, and he gets a pretty memorable lesson in fiction vs. reality. There are some great scenes (the Ferris-wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins. The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.This is a fine, flawless classic, and while obviously belonging to an earlier era, it deserves a look from anyone who appreciates good movies.",flawless classic,this is rare film that is flawless every respect it combines great acting memorable characters with fascinating story taking place interesting setting adding creative musical score third man is remembered many things orson welles wonderful performance his appearances as harry lime its wonderfully appropriate musical score its nicely conceived plot surprises adding these is joseph cottens fine portrayal holly martins which holds rest it together it is his character who initiates most action also through whom we view everything everyone else story starts after nicely done prologue with martins arriving vienna finding out that his friend harry is not only dead but is accused running particularly destructive black market racket martins sets out at once prove his friends innocence getting into immediate scuffle with police it seems at first set up conventional plot about clearing name friend but actual story that follows is much deeper much better it is just right that martins is innocent who writes cheap novels living he gets pretty memorable lesson fiction vs reality there are some great scenes ferris wheel confrontation being as good scene as there is classic cinema leading up memorable climactic sequence good supporting cast with alida valli as anna being very good complementing lime martins setting crumbling post war vienna distinctive zither score go very nicely with story this is fine flawless classic while obviously belonging earlier era it deserves look anyone who appreciates good movies,0.5824392614188534,0.37856171039844516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,A movie ahead of its time,"The Third Man is a movie that looks and feels not like a movie of the 40s, but like a neo-noir of the late 60s/early 70s. This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.Of all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).The cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns. So The Third Man is not only a wonderful film noir, but a unique look at the brief time between WWII and the height of the Cold War.",movie ahead its time,third man is movie that looks feels not like movie 40s but like neo noir late 60s early 70s this wonderful example classic noir is one all time greatest films it combines amazing visuals sounds dialogue acting tell thrilling story comment about atmosphere after wwii all movies durring studio era pre 1960ish there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out my mind gregg tolands work citizen kane russel metys work touch evil robert kraskers work third man all starring orson welles funny enough i just recently saw restored 35mm version third man crisp black white visuals bombed out vienna are so breath taking shadows are everywhere unique way krasker tilts camera some shots adding disorientation plot who can forget first close up welles with light apartment room above splashing onto his face one great entrances movie history lime gives his old friend smile that only welles could give cinematography is backed by strong performances by welles cotten italian actress vali writing greene is wonderful you can see plot twisting around cotten tightly but what makes third man so great is its historical commentary well not really historical since it was commenting its own time but us it is historical one level third man is story betrayal corruption post war occupied vienna other hand its giving audience glimpse mood europe after great war uncertainty that cold war was bringing is evident through out film cotten is constantly trying figure out who trust vienna is frontier new communist bloc we even see communists infiltrating vienna trying bring vali back her native czechoslavakia zither music score combined with stark images bombed out vienna are reminiscent frontier towns american westerns so third man is not only wonderful film noir but unique look at brief time between wwii height cold war,0.4738728252879196,0.15219104794576493,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.23}"
7.0,cinematic art work,"Pulp western writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in post-war Vienna to work for old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) but is told that Harry is dead.

,Atmospheric British thriller,"American author Holly Martins arrives in Vienna to meet old friend Harry Lime. On arrival he finds Harry was just killed in an accident and attends his funeral. The police are happy that his death was an accident and are also closing crimes by attributing them to him. Martins begins to investigate the accident and finds out things that lead him to a shocking discovery that will eventually challenge his values and friendship.This is a classic bit of British cinema that owes a lot to the source material (Graham Green) and the slanted, moody cinematography throughout. The story is quite straight forward and can be perceived more complicated than it is. The best bits of the story come early, with Martins investigating the accident against a backdrop of secrecy and cover-ups, and later when he confronts Lime briefly on a Ferris wheel. The story is mainly a story of friendship and morals packed into a mystery setting. The final shot of the film is really good and gives a realistic (if not happy) end to the story.Joseph Cotton was always good around this period and seemed to be on a roll when he teamed up with Wells. Here he is good as Martin, even if his character is not as interesting as Harry Lime is. Orson Wells is excellent, casting a huge shadow (literally!) over the film despite having a very short time onscreen compare to Cotton. The director and the writer fought the producer to cast Wells in order to make the film more sellable to the American audience (the producer wanted Noël Coward) and the film is much better for their choice. His character hugely lacks morals and, despite being a small hustler, is almost a demonic figure - most notably in his speech on the Ferris wheel where he defends his actions to Martin.The film is given a great mood of shadows throughout. The city itself is shown as both beautiful and in ruins and is constantly slanted and shadowy. The final confrontation in the sewers of Vienna is excellent. The score is also good - at first it doesn't seem to fit, as it seems out of step with the mood, but it does work well with the culture that exists in the city at the time - I can't really explain it better than that but it does work.Overall this is a classic. The story may not be enough to support repeat viewings but the moody, the cinematography and a towering performance by Wells all make this essentially viewing for film fans.",atmospheric british thriller,american author holly martins arrives vienna meet old friend harry lime arrival he finds harry was just killed accident attends his funeral police are happy that his death was accident are also closing crimes by attributing them him martins begins investigate accident finds out things that lead him shocking discovery that will eventually challenge his values friendship this is classic bit british cinema that owes lot source material graham green slanted moody cinematography throughout story is quite straight forward can be perceived more complicated than it is best bits story come early with martins investigating accident against backdrop secrecy cover ups later when he confronts lime briefly ferris wheel story is mainly story friendship morals packed into mystery setting final shot film is really good gives realistic if not happy end story joseph cotton was always good around this period seemed be roll when he teamed up with wells here he is good as martin even if his character is not as interesting as harry lime is orson wells is excellent casting huge shadow literally over film despite having very short time onscreen compare cotton director writer fought producer cast wells order make film more sellable american audience producer wanted no l coward film is much better their choice his character hugely lacks morals despite being small hustler is almost demonic figure most notably his speech ferris wheel where he defends his actions martin film is given great mood shadows throughout city itself is shown as both beautiful ruins is constantly slanted shadowy final confrontation sewers vienna is excellent score is also good at first it doesnt seem fit as it seems out step with mood but it does work well with culture that exists city at time i cant really explain it better than that but it does work overall this is classic story may not be enough support repeat viewings but moody cinematography towering performance by wells all make this essentially viewing film fans,0.46679999999999994,0.2353333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Time for Lime,"Who was Harry Lime (Orson Welles)? An evil man, devil in the flesh who was responsible for the unspeakable crimes, yet brilliant, cheerful and charismatic. His most famous words, a short speech written by Welles himself, say a lot about his character and motivations:""In Italy for 30 years under the Borgies they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""No wonder, we like him, even though we know what he'd doneIt has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever  but what about his 'exit'  the fingers on the street? I think it is one of the greatest, tooA beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so antiHollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.Amazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had  the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose  instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place  cheerful but melancholy in the same time Criterion DVD is wonderful  the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available  British and American, and a lot of extras.",time lime,who was harry lime orson welles evil man devil flesh who was responsible unspeakable crimes yet brilliant cheerful charismatic his most famous words short speech written by welles himself say lot about his character motivations italy 30 years under borgies they had warfare terror murder bloodshed but they produced michelangelo leonardo da vinci renaissance switzerland they had brotherly love they had 500 years democracy peace what did that produce cuckoo clock no wonder we like him even though we know what hed done it has been said thousands times about greatest movie entrance ever but what about his exit fingers street i think it is one greatest too beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was love with him unforgettable ending so anti hollywood so true film was about her love that goes beyond grave i read that both selznick producer author graham greene had initially argued something more upbeat holly anna walking off arm arm but reed disagreed i am so happy that reed won i am sure millions fans are too that was way finish movie make it much more than just typical noir makes viewer think about love friendship betrayal loyalty price one pays them amazing film perfectly shot almost flawless it looks feels like welles himself couldve made it influence citizen kane is undeniable only problem i had music i like it but it was very strange hear it film like third man maybe that was purpose instead somber moody ominous music that would be expected noir film something completely different out place cheerful but melancholy same time criterion dvd is wonderful restored version film shines there are two openings film available british american lot extras,0.6602222222222222,0.33420833333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Possibly the best British movie ever,"Widely considered one of the best movies ever made, The Third Man is a prime example of how great storytelling combined with the sad setting of postwar Vienna can produce a cinematic masterpiece. The movie is about Holly Martins, someone from the US, going to Vienna in Austria shortly after the second world war is over. The war has had a noticeable effect on the city's architecture, and many of the buildings are gutted and in ruins. Amid this depressing location (which has been divided into four occupation zones by the victorious allies), Martins tries to seek out one of his childhood friends, Harry Lime. Later on, Martins is told that he should give up his search because his friend is dead, hit by a car when he was crossing a street. Even after attending his so called funeral, Martins is not so sure that his friend is dead, and along the way of his search, he meets Major Calloway and Lime's girlfriend, Anna. She, like Martins, starts to become convinced that Limes ""death"" was faked on purpose, and they both come to the conclusion that you don't create fake evidence unless you're trying to hide something. Later on, Martins goes to see Lime's doctor, who says he only arrived at the scene of the accident once Lime was dead. Shortly afterwards, someone willing to give Martins information dies suddenly, which only adds to the suspicion. Major Calloway tells Martins to leave Austria, but he doesn't want to until he can determine once and for all if his friend is dead. Calloway tells Martins that Lime had been stealing penicilin from the army and then selling it after it was downgraded, which is very dangerous. Now aware that his friend is a criminal, Martins notices someone outside his apartment one day watching his house. It turns out to be Lime. Martins tries to chase him, but Lime loses him in seconds. Towards the end of the movie, Martins finally comes face to face with Lime on a ferris wheel, where Lime threatens him. After Lime flees to the sewer tunnels, the cops are already there in large numbers. After killing one of the officers, Lime's luck finally runs out, and he is fatally shot. We now know that Harry Lime is dead for good. This movie is awesome. It makes use of a lot of strange camera angles that I have hardly seen in movies until now, such as putting the camera between the bars on a railing. The protagonist of the movie may be Martins, but Lime is the real main character of this film, since the whole narrative revolves around finding him, and Orson Welles does a great job. What makes this movie special in another way is the ending, where Martins waits on a long street to talk to Anna, but she walks right by him without saying anything. Most people would have expected her to stop, but the movie wasn't afraid of having a cruel ending. One of the best British movies ever made, no question about it.",possibly best british movie ever,widely considered one best movies ever made third man is prime example how great storytelling combined with sad setting postwar vienna can produce cinematic masterpiece movie is about holly martins someone us going vienna austria shortly after second world war is over war has had noticeable effect citys architecture many buildings are gutted ruins amid this depressing location which has been divided into four occupation zones by victorious allies martins tries seek out one his childhood friends harry lime later martins is told that he should give up his search because his friend is dead hit by car when he was crossing street even after attending his so called funeral martins is not so sure that his friend is dead along way his search he meets major calloway limes girlfriend anna she like martins starts become convinced that limes death was faked purpose they both come conclusion that you dont create fake evidence unless youre trying hide something later martins goes see limes doctor who says he only arrived at scene accident once lime was dead shortly afterwards someone willing give martins information dies suddenly which only adds suspicion major calloway tells martins leave austria but he doesnt want until he can determine once all if his friend is dead calloway tells martins that lime had been stealing penicilin army then selling it after it was downgraded which is very dangerous now aware that his friend is criminal martins notices someone outside his apartment one day watching his house it turns out be lime martins tries chase him but lime loses him seconds towards end movie martins finally comes face face with lime ferris wheel where lime threatens him after lime flees sewer tunnels cops are already there large numbers after killing one officers limes luck finally runs out he is fatally shot we now know that harry lime is dead good this movie is awesome it makes use lot strange camera angles that i have hardly seen movies until now such as putting camera between bars railing protagonist movie may be martins but lime is real main character this film since whole narrative revolves around finding him orson welles does great job what makes this movie special another way is ending where martins waits long street talk anna but she walks right by him without saying anything most people would have expected her stop but movie wasnt afraid having cruel ending one best british movies ever made no question about it,0.4913619614512471,0.05554421768707483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Four men on a bridge,"A great deal has been said about ""The Third Man"" by contributors to this forum. Having seen the restored copy that was shown at the Film Forum, recently, I could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by TCM, the other night.This movie owes a debt of gratitude to Graham Greene, a writer who had the most developed sense of intrigue among his contemporaries and one of the best writers of the last century. It also helped that a great director, Carol Reed, brought it to the screen. Mr. Reed was a director who had an eye for detail, as he demonstrates here, as well as in the rest of the body of work he left for us to enjoy. The screen play is faithful to the original novel. If to all of the other elements we add the fabulous cinematography of Robert Krasker, the result has to be the masterpiece we see today. Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here. Mr. Krasker's wonderful night vision of this city enhances the story as we are taken along for a fantastic trip of the post war Vienna of 1949.The casting of this film is amazing. Never had so many excellent actors been thrown together in a film, as it is the case as with this picture. Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Ernst Deutsch, Paul Horbiger, Erich Ponto and Wilfred Hyde White are splendid in their roles. It is hard to imagine these characters played by other actors.Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short. This must have been one of the best roles in which Welles appeared. Of course, there are so many others, but his Harry Lime is an original and could have fitted perfectly in one of his own films.The music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.This film will live forever.",four men bridge,great deal has been said about third man by contributors this forum having seen restored copy that was shown at film forum recently i could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by tcm other night this movie owes debt gratitude graham greene writer who had most developed sense intrigue among his contemporaries one best writers last century it also helped that great director carol reed brought it screen mr reed was director who had eye detail as he demonstrates here as well as rest body work he left us enjoy screen play is faithful original novel if all other elements we add fabulous cinematography robert krasker result has be masterpiece we see today never before has city taken center stage development story that is presented here mr kraskers wonderful night vision this city enhances story as we are taken along fantastic trip post war vienna 1949 casting this film is amazing never had so many excellent actors been thrown together film as it is case as with this picture joseph cotten alida valli trevor howard orson welles bernard lee ernst deutsch paul horbiger erich ponto wilfred hyde white are splendid their roles it is hard imagine these characters played by other actors orson welles has perhaps best part even though his time before camera is short this must have been one best roles which welles appeared course there are so many others but his harry lime is original could have fitted perfectly one his own films music by anton karas is still haunting with exception few times at beginning couple scenes when it startles viewer actually doesnt add anything what we are about see this film will live forever,0.5023809523809525,0.3672294372294373,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Zither Thou Goest,"The Third Man refers to another witness to a crime that no one seems to know anything about. The crime of course is the hit and run murder of Harry Lime played by Orson Welles. But is Welles dead.One of the things I like about The Third Man is that it makes a nominal hero out of one of the biggest bunglers ever put on screen. Let's just say that if Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotten were bumping into furniture on top of everything else, he'd be Inspector Clouseau.Holly arrives in occupied Vienna in the late Forties at the invitation of an old college classmate Harry Lime. Literally upon arriving in Vienna, Martins learns that his friend Lime was the victim of a hit and run accident and the funeral is going on at that moment. He goes to the funeral and is smitten by Lime's girlfriend, Alida Valli.Martins is a writer of western stories and it's bad when a writer starts believing he's one of his own heroes. Maybe Jessica Fletcher is capable of it, but not Holly Martins. Martins decides to start his own investigation into Lime's death much to the consternation of the British occupying force which doing its own inquiry. Trevor Howard plays Major Callaway of the British Army in charge of the investigation.Martins turns out to be right that there is something more afoot than a simple traffic accident. But he's so terribly wrong about everything and everyone else it is frightening. I really can't say more at this point.Someone reading the plot description I've given might think The Third Man is some kind of comedy, but it is not. It is in fact one of the most finely crafted dramas ever put on the screen. The location photography in Vienna is fabulous and contributes so much to the authenticity of the story and its characters. Joseph Cotten gives one of his best performances as the bull-in-the-china-shop amateur detective.As for Orson Welles, it's a virtual tie in my opinion with Compulsion for the distinction of his finest performer as an actor without working for director Orson Welles.

He finds out Lime is dead, but that there is more to his old friend than he knew since before the war, along with Lime's girl Anna (a sympathetic character?). Then when the revelation is shown of Lime's face on a darkened street, the film reaches an elegance rarely seen today in pictures. Orson Welles, who plays Harry Lime, has in fact a role much like a cameo, having a speech with Cotten on a Ferris Wheel.

6.0,I'll be honest... I didn't get it.,"Currently ensconced in the top fifty movies of all time on the IMDb, I just don't see it. Sure, The Third Man looks absolutely gorgeous and the ending is superb, but the rest is just passable. Beautiful to look at, but lacking any real drive or urgency.The stuff in the sewers is good and there's some nice discussions of morality, but the film drags terribly for the first hour, where the casting (and, in a modern age, VHS covers) clearly signpost that Welles is to be expected.Coming from the director of the superlative ""Odd Man Out"" and the writer of the equally superb ""Brighton Rock"" then I was expecting more.

10.0,Haunting and Poetic; A True Masterpiece...,"Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" strikes all the right cords, establishing itself on so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable. It has an underlying tone of darkness that not only thrills but chills. It grabs the viewer from the start and never lets go. It opens with Anton Karas' startling zither music and quickly propels the viewer into a world of evil and lies. The tale is familiar to any film lovers: A pulp Western writer named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is invited to post-war Vienna by an old friend of his, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). The city has been divided into American, British, French and Russian zones. The city exists as a shattered remnant of the past - haunting and horrifying, dark and mysterious.  Upon his arrival, Holly discovers to his horror that his old college pal is dead - hit by a car in the middle of a street. But for Holly, the circumstances don't add up - everyone involved in the accident was related in some way or another to Harry. So Holly searches for clues, much to the chagrin of the British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard), whose name is misused as Callohan by Holly many times throughout the film. (""It's 'Calloway,' Mr. Martin, I'm not Irish."") Holly Martin does begin to stumble upon some vital clues as to the real story behind Lime's death - and finds out more than he bargained for. Lime's old girlfriend is a stage actress. (""Always comedy."") She accompanies Holly throughout the film, and we expect an underlying romance to blossom, but yet in the end it does not - one of the many surprises of the film. I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime reappears, or even give away the fact that he does, for that matter (though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and therefore turns out to be alive). But for those who have seen the film, we all remember that terrific scene where the cat meows, and suddenly he appears, an evil smirk on his face like a child who has gotten away with the cookie from the jar. And then the ferris wheel scene, and the chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an Oscar for cinematography. These are all some of the most memorable of film scenes. The director of ""The Third Man,"" Carol Reed, stumbled upon the film's musician, Anton Karas, one night in a trashy bar in Vienna. It is no wonder that out of all his candidates he chose Karas - the film's tune is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a film and its music I have ever seen (although ""JAWS"" is up there with it). To go into the music is pointless - it must simply be heard in synchronism with the film for you to understand where I am coming from. When I think of film noir, ""D.O.A."" (1949) and ""The Third Man"" (1949) are the first two films that come to mind. Both accomplish what they set out to do, but ""The Third Man"" exceeds even farther than the former - it is haunting and almost poetically vibrant in the way it displays its story and the outcome of its characters. It is a film that will be around for years and years. ""Citizen Kane"" is often thought of as the greatest American motion picture of all time. But if I had to choose between the two, I would most likely choose ""The Third Man."" It's just my opinion, of course, and many may not agree, but as far as I see, ""The Third Man"" beats ""Citizen Kane"" - for me - on more levels than one.  Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was an artistic film that rarely used close-ups. It would almost stand back from the scenes and let the viewer focus on what he or she wanted to focus on. ""The Third Man"" has many close-ups. I do not take this as a director trying to give the audience what he wants them to see, but rather a director in touch with his feelings and ideas. Director Carol Reed knows just how to evoke characters' feelings from scenes and close-up shots. The camera tilts at awkward angles more often than not. The more and more paranoid and afraid our hero becomes the more and more intense the close-ups and angles. There is some haunting material in ""The Third Man,"" some material the most novice of filmgoers might not expect. And the music and direction only makes it all the more terrifying and haunting. This is a film that you must witness to believe. 5/5.",haunting poetic true masterpiece,carol reeds third man strikes all right cords establishing itself so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable it has underlying tone darkness that not only thrills but chills it grabs viewer start never lets go it opens with anton karas startling zither music quickly propels viewer into world evil lies tale is familiar any film lovers pulp western writer named holly martin joseph cotten is invited post war vienna by old friend his harry lime orson welles city has been divided into american british french russian zones city exists as shattered remnant past haunting horrifying dark mysterious upon his arrival holly discovers his horror that his old college pal is dead hit by car middle street but holly circumstances dont add up everyone involved accident was related some way or another harry so holly searches clues much chagrin british officer calloway trevor howard whose name is misused as callohan by holly many times throughout film its calloway mr martin im not irish holly martin does begin stumble upon some vital clues as real story behind limes death finds out more than he bargained limes old girlfriend is stage actress always comedy she accompanies holly throughout film we expect underlying romance blossom but yet end it does not one many surprises film i suppose it would be sin me give away how harry lime reappears or even give away fact that he does that matter though by now i am sure you realize orson welles is this movie therefore turns out be alive but those who have seen film we all remember that terrific scene where cat meows suddenly he appears evil smirk his face like child who has gotten away with cookie jar then ferris wheel scene chase through sewers that no doubt helped win film oscar cinematography these are all some most memorable film scenes director third man carol reed stumbled upon films musician anton karas one night trashy bar vienna it is no wonder that out all his candidates he chose karas films tune is literally most perfect example matching harmony between film its music i have ever seen although jaws is up there with it go into music is pointless it must simply be heard synchronism with film you understand where i am coming when i think film noir d o 1949 third man 1949 are first two films that come mind both accomplish what they set out do but third man exceeds even farther than former it is haunting almost poetically vibrant way it displays its story outcome its characters it is film that will be around years years citizen kane is often thought as greatest american motion picture all time but if i had choose between two i would most likely choose third man its just my opinion course many may not agree but as far as i see third man beats citizen kane me more levels than one welles citizen kane 1941 was artistic film that rarely used close ups it would almost stand back scenes let viewer focus what he or she wanted focus third man has many close ups i do not take this as director trying give audience what he wants them see but rather director touch with his feelings ideas director carol reed knows just how evoke characters feelings scenes close up shots camera tilts at awkward angles more often than not more more paranoid afraid our hero becomes more more intense close ups angles there is some haunting material third man some material most novice filmgoers might not expect music direction only makes it all more terrifying haunting this is film that you must witness believe 5 5,0.462175764614789,0.10754936120789778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,Classic and immortal thriller-mystery set in Vienna during the Cold war,"The motion picture concerns an American writer of pulp Western named Holy Martin (Joseph Cotten), he arrives in a post-war devastating Vienna to see his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but Holy discovers he has been killed. In the funeral meets a gorgeous scene actress (haunting Alida Valli). Manipulative Harry is a known delinquent and drug-dealer, smuggling adulterated penicilin in black-market as well as a master-criminal at large in a Vienna of nightmare divided in four zones, the city is plenty of ruins, trash, devastation , rubbish and debris. Lime is allegedly dead , but is finally pursued throughout the sewers by military authorities (Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee, Geoffrey Keen).Based on Grahame Greene novel, this classic noir thriller is an excellent story lavishly produced by the great American producer David O'Selznick and Hungarian producer Alexander Korda. This is a deeply satisfying and intelligent picture to not be missed, using a considerable talent in acting, as main cast as secondary actors formed mostly by foreigner players of various countries and utilizing the cream of the cream of British experts in writing and technical departments. With a plethora of anthological images and dialogs, such as the scenes about conversation in the marry-go-round between Harry Lime and Martin, and the underground-sewers pursuits. Magnificent Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, great friends in real life ; Welles reportedly intervened in direction mainly on his scenes, though at an interview he explained that Carol Reed directed totally this outstanding movie. Extraordinary Anton Karas' musical score , though insistent and sometimes irritant zither which hooked itself into the people all around the world. Robert Krasker's gorgeous cinematography , reflecting splendidly the shapes , lights, shadows in sophisticated, elegant use of camera angles and deservedly winning an Oscar and nomination for film-making and edition.

10.0,"Murder, Mystery & Harry Lime","Post-war Vienna. A dangerous city, full of intrigue, crime & sudden death. Notorious American racketeer Harry Lime starts to cross a street. There is an accident and he is killed instantly. Or is he? His body is carried to the sidewalk by two friends. Or does another man assist them? If so, who is THE THIRD MAN and what does he know about Lime's suspicious death?Such is the puzzle at the beginning of what many consider to be the greatest film ever made. Its glories are so obvious that it is almost futile to pick out any for observation: the marvelous sewer chase, the balloon man, the little boy with the ball, the giant wheel, the cuckoo clock speech & the long closing walk across the cemetery. All of these linger in the mind, becoming permanent residents of our cinematic subconscious.The entire cast is excellent: Joseph Cotton as Lime's American friend trying to piece together what has happened; Trevor Howard as the stalwart British Major of Police; gorgeous Valli as Harry's faithful lover; Bernard Lee as the tragic Police Sergeant; Wilfrid Hyde-White as a dithering English cultural attaché. And then there's Orson Welles...The character of Harry Lime, alive or dead, on-screen or not, is one of cinema's most fascinating villains. Charming & deadly as any cobra, he attracts & repels at the same moment. It is interesting to note that BBC Radio resurrected the character for the series 'The Lives of Harry Lime' very shortly after the film's release. Harry was not allowed to stay in his grave for long...Three more items of note: (1) The cinematography is first-rate, making Vienna by night look almost lunar. (2) Orson Welles' first appearance on screen is a real dandy. (3) Above & around & through everything is the famous zither music of Anton Karas, which becomes like a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action. Its complete silence during the sewer chase only underscores the starkness of the sequence.",murder mystery harry lime,post war vienna dangerous city full intrigue crime sudden death notorious american racketeer harry lime starts cross street there is accident he is killed instantly or is he his body is carried sidewalk by two friends or does another man assist them if so who is third man what does he know about limes suspicious death such is puzzle at beginning what many consider be greatest film ever made its glories are so obvious that it is almost futile pick out any observation marvelous sewer chase balloon man little boy with ball giant wheel cuckoo clock speech long closing walk across cemetery all these linger mind becoming permanent residents our cinematic subconscious entire cast is excellent joseph cotton as limes american friend trying piece together what has happened trevor howard as stalwart british major police gorgeous valli as harrys faithful lover bernard lee as tragic police sergeant wilfrid hyde white as dithering english cultural attach then theres orson welles character harry lime alive or dead screen or not is one cinemas most fascinating villains charming deadly as any cobra he attracts repels at same moment it is interesting note that bbc radio resurrected character series lives harry lime very shortly after films release harry was not allowed stay his grave long three more items note 1 cinematography is first rate making vienna by night look almost lunar 2 orson welles first appearance screen is real dandy 3 above around through everything is famous zither music anton karas which becomes like greek chorus commenting action its complete silence during sewer chase only underscores starkness sequence,0.4596598639455782,0.14948979591836734,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Astounding Visuals Make It A Treasure,"Story - pretty good.Cinematographry - amazing! If you want to enjoy the camera-work, please see this on the Criterion DVD. That's not a plug for the company. It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears. In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets.

4.0,You may need a cuckoo clock to wake you up,"Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy.The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh – is anybody going over the edge?A mention must be made of the music – it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French café accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror.The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting – we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as – it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers – a plot device that was done a year before in the better film ""He Walked By Night"" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.",you may need cuckoo clock wake you up,author joseph cotten holly is invited vienna by his friend orson welles harry lime there is major problem with this set up outset as it is revealed that welles has just been killed cotton attends burial but sticks around vienna as there seems be great deal suspicion surrounding death his buddy film has interesting setting idea story but im afraid that it just drags its drawn out never gets moving cotten is dreary lead role but welles is best thing film delivers his amusing famous quote comparing italy with switzerland scene ferris wheel is standout scene as audience experiences only real moment tension as carriage door is opened at top ride uh oh is anybody going over edge mention must be made music its all zithery throughout further clarify it sounds like mixture between greek music french caf accordion music it provides moments over exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical it is also just basically out place belonging more art film or 1960s camp comedy horror story is not bad film could have been so much more interesting we are given about 30 minutes plot stretched out nearly 2 hours definitely not classic that everyone blindly labels it as it is vastly over rated right up final chase scene sewers plot device that was done year before better film he walked by night 1948 which provided far more tension better sewer chase,0.5589285714285714,0.19577752976190477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.55}"

The cinematography is just outstanding, and helps fashion a city full of menace and the score is jaunty and flawlessly echoes the film's wit and drama. Then there is a dark yet playful script(two other words to describe the film itself too), impeccable direction from master of place, angle and shade Carol Reed and a gem of a story that grips you right up till the ending. The Third Man is also blessed with performances more perfect than you can ask for from Joseph Cotten and especially Orson Welles.

,A Few Personal Notes,"No need to recap the oft-repeated plot. So why bother commenting after 500+ reviews. I guess it's because I'm a movie lover and want to enter my little note of appreciation. What sticks in my mind from the movie's first release are the visuals. They're among the most memorable if not the most memorable in film annals. In sum, they're a nightmare world of emptiness-the streets, the walkways, the dead hulking edifices. It's a communal world emptied of community, leaving only ruins and shells. The metaphor for a post-war Europe is unmistakable, while only the morally destitute like Harry Lime have thrived. I can't imagine that filming in color was actually entertained (IMDB). Had that happened, the film would have passed into semi-obscurity unlike its now celebrated status. Note too, that no one ends up happy, in contrast to narrative norms of the day. I think what brought many folks to showings at the time was the unfamiliar zither music. As I recall, a commercial cut was heard regularly on the radio. Still, I expect a lot of folks left the theater put-off by the bleakly unhappy world they had just seen.

4.0,Clearly overrated,"I read many wonders about this film, considering the very positive reviews it gets. It even is considered one of the greatest films ever. Judging by the general descriptions regarding this motion picture, it was even said to be a great story of suspense.I was expecting a noir film comparable to 'The Window' (1949), which is one of my favorite films. It turned out to be disappointing, nothing of what I expected.It isn't until the last 10 minutes that something begins to happen at all, but that's just so little, especially comparing to the rest of it where nothing special happens. It's just way too slow-paced, boring and dull, made me yawn of boredom. Suspense? Zero suspense!It was one of those films that left me indifferent. It's very far from being one of the best ever, being clearly far more praised than it really deserves. Not even the fact that it takes place in Vienna can save it. While Vienna is a beautiful place, the movie doesn't show that much of Vienna. On the other hand, the film has both English and German language.'The Fallen Idol' (which is from the same director) was better than this and had more suspense than this (even if still very little).",clearly overrated,i read many wonders about this film considering very positive reviews it gets it even is considered one greatest films ever judging by general descriptions regarding this motion picture it was even said be great story suspense i was expecting noir film comparable window 1949 which is one my favorite films it turned out be disappointing nothing what i expected it isnt until last 10 minutes that something begins happen at all but thats just so little especially comparing rest it where nothing special happens its just way too slow paced boring dull made me yawn boredom suspense zero suspense it was one those films that left me indifferent its very far being one best ever being clearly far more praised than it really deserves not even fact that it takes place vienna can save it while vienna is beautiful place movie doesnt show that much vienna other hand film has both english german language fallen idol which is same director was better than this had more suspense than this even if still very little,0.5267909509844994,0.15273163664292697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.12}"
