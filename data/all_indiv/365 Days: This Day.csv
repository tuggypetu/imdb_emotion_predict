2,Mindless garbage,"I think everyone who watched this movie wasn't expecting anything good, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. The first one was garbage too, but at least it had some kind of story to drive it, this movie is basically as 2 hour music video with sex.... yes, that's all it is. The relationship between the two leads is as mindless and unrealistic as the first, and another man joins the scene, who is just as dull as the first.Nothing happens in this film until roughly half way through, and if you even managed to endure the pain that is the awful dialogue, directing and acting, you then have to suffer a boring thriller-wannabe. It's a shame really, because with a good director and writer, you could have had a compelling story with good characters, but no...we get this. The main actors, (I can't even be bothered to look up their names) have little to no chemistry between them, and half of the time they are just standing there looking pretty.I understand that 20-40 something men aren't this movies target audience, but at least make it bareable for us.If you were to take out all the music and sex, you would have a 40 minute short film. Seriously, it's that bad. So many usless scenes that add nothing. The only good thing about this movie is its cinematography, which is surprislingly very good, which is the only thing stopping this from getting a 1.",mindless garbage,i think everyone who watched this movie wasnt expecting anything good but i wasnt expecting it be this bad first one was garbage too but at least it had some kind story drive it this movie is basically as 2 hour music video with sex yes thats all it is relationship between two leads is as mindless unrealistic as first another man joins scene who is just as dull as first nothing happens this film until roughly half way through if you even managed endure pain that is awful dialogue directing acting you then have suffer boring thriller wannabe its shame really because with good director writer you could have had compelling story with good characters but no we get this main actors i cant even be bothered look up their names have little no chemistry between them half time they are just standing there looking pretty i understand that 20 40 something men arent this movies target audience but at least make it bareable us if you were take out all music sex you would have 40 minute short film seriously its that bad so many usless scenes that add nothing only good thing about this movie is its cinematography which is surprislingly very good which is only thing stopping this getting 1,0.5920833333333333,0.013463541666666676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"

1,Had enough.,"Blame Italy, or Poland, or Netflix? No just blame people. Nowadays it's about a thrill, not a story meaning the movie was a cringe fest and a laughing stock. Now it's not the dialogue that was bad, the woeful unrealistic story, or the acting, what's bad is the fact people can make excuses for this throwing lot of clever cinematic views and shall we say steamy moments. A movie isn't about the thrill. It's not about filters and fancy clothes, being spoilt as a woman and loaded as a man. No actually that actually is all this is. Netflix throws this at us because of the demands to please the audience with this sort of thing. Any pathetic, girl power, snap chat fish for likes love myself type of person will adore this. As too will any unhappy coupled or bored individual. Point blank doesn't matter how disgusting the male lead is, how bad the story or dialogue, how bad the female leads acting is, it's all about what is pleasing on the eye. That's why a Netflix original cannot be trusted or half of the reviews left by these so called adults. Many of whom are probably underage by the way or only care about a good time and no doubt have everything easy. This isn't about an escape and it's not about putting yourself in the polish girls shoes, or underpants, it's about what is wrong with the every day person these days and how so long as they're enjoying their life nothing else especially not this stuff matters. Shame. A woeful woeful film.",had enough,blame italy or poland or netflix no just blame people nowadays its about thrill not story meaning movie was cringe fest laughing stock now its not dialogue that was bad woeful unrealistic story or acting whats bad is fact people can make excuses this throwing lot clever cinematic views shall we say steamy moments movie isnt about thrill its not about filters fancy clothes being spoilt as woman loaded as man no actually that actually is all this is netflix throws this at us because demands please audience with this sort thing any pathetic girl power snap chat fish likes love myself type person will adore this as too will any unhappy coupled or bored individual point blank doesnt matter how disgusting male lead is how bad story or dialogue how bad female leads acting is its all about what is pleasing eye thats why netflix original cannot be trusted or half reviews left by these so called adults many whom are probably underage by way or only care about good time no doubt have everything easy this isnt about escape its not about putting yourself polish girls shoes or underpants its about what is wrong with every day person these days how so long as theyre enjoying their life nothing else especially not this stuff matters shame woeful woeful film,0.5411458333333333,-0.1231770833333333,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.26}"
3,Actually two years,"Well two years since the original came out - and I am going to talk about that movie here too. Especially how it ended - because ... well it kind of was supposed to have an effect on the characters ... but more on that on the next paragraph - you have been warned more than enough about spoilers that are upcoming for both movies.The previous movie ended in an accident - actually the movie made it appear as if it was going to be a deadly accident. But as this starts it looks like it was nothing like that at all. I even thought ""is it supposed to be a dream?"" - something that might have happened but didn't? Am I thinking way too much about this? Especially considering this does not have that much plot.And let's be honest, this and the other movie got such a low rating ... and yet everyone seems to have watched it. It is like guilty pleasure for some ... and if you accept the cringe and cliche this includes ... and relish in how bad certain things are ... even the fact they talk in different languages, being unable to emote emotions ... especially crazy considering how many ... love scenes are involved.And yes this starts off with after the wedding ... and while the first movie was way more explicit, that first (I am going to keep calling them that) love scene is setting a tone. This is not a romcom - so even if you haven't seen the previous movie, you know what is up ... no pun intended. Though I would be wondering why you keep reading this.This time around the beauty and the beast theme is kind of gone - the marriage blues has substituted that. For the first half hour there is almost nothing more than ... love scenes and ridiculous issues made up from thin air. Even the mother of our main character is getting it on. But when it comes to showing skin, she leaves that up to her daughter.There seems no conflict at all until ... and again more spoilers to follow ... until the end third of the movie. The gardener ... you couldn't make this up ... maybe it does know how ridiculous it is after all? We keep watching anyway ... but maybe there is some genius in making this so bad, it actually is enjoyable.Anyway this gardener is apparently someone from a different gang/mafia clan or whatever. Why he was hired is beyond me ... there is no reason or logic for it. And to top things of, the ending goes completely off rails ... and this time around not only hints at a sequel but really sets it up nicely. I would be surprised if there won't be another one ... we have to find out who survived (probably everyone the way they were shot to be honest ... but hey, let's wait and see), right?",actually two years,well two years since original came out i am going talk about that movie here too especially how it ended because well it kind was supposed have effect characters but more that next paragraph you have been warned more than enough about spoilers that are upcoming both movies previous movie ended accident actually movie made it appear as if it was going be deadly accident but as this starts it looks like it was nothing like that at all i even thought is it supposed be dream something that might have happened but didnt am i thinking way too much about this especially considering this does not have that much plot lets be honest this other movie got such low rating yet everyone seems have watched it it is like guilty pleasure some if you accept cringe cliche this includes relish how bad certain things are even fact they talk different languages being unable emote emotions especially crazy considering how many love scenes are involved yes this starts off with after wedding while first movie was way more explicit that first i am going keep calling them that love scene is setting tone this is not romcom so even if you havent seen previous movie you know what is up no pun intended though i would be wondering why you keep reading this this time around beauty beast theme is kind gone marriage blues has substituted that first half hour there is almost nothing more than love scenes ridiculous issues made up thin air even mother our main character is getting it but when it comes showing skin she leaves that up her daughter there seems no conflict at all until again more spoilers follow until end third movie gardener you couldnt make this up maybe it does know how ridiculous it is after all we keep watching anyway but maybe there is some genius making this so bad it actually is enjoyable anyway this gardener is apparently someone different gang mafia clan or whatever why he was hired is beyond me there is no reason or logic it top things ending goes completely off rails this time around not only hints at sequel but really sets it up nicely i would be surprised if there wont be another one we have find out who survived probably everyone way they were shot be honest but hey lets wait see right,0.5481261022927689,0.10833333333333331,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"

1,Makes 50 Shades of Grey look like a masterpiece,"Well, here it is. The sequel to one of the most uninspired, least-sexy, and tacky movies in recent years, 365 Days. The sequel commits the cardinal sin a movie can make: not learning from its mistakes. The movie is a blatant cash-grab that hardly costs anything to make, and an excuse for actors and crew members to film in luxurious locations.

1,365 Days : Dumpster Fire ðŸ”¥,"YALL KNOW I'M RIGHT ON THIS.I'm aware why we tuned in the first time. No, it wasn't the Oscar worthy performances, the breathtaking photography, the gorgeous music score, the thrilling plot or the spectacular and innovative direction.IT WAS THE SMASHING YOU CAME FOR. It was semi better last time and that kept you wanting more. Yet, this time it's miserably underwhelming and dull. The joke's on us.If the previous movie overdid it with the soundtrack, this one takes it to another level of obnoxious. This sequel is one big music video with random, unexciting, poorly edited sex scenes stitched together in between bizarre frolicking montages that serve no purpose other than stretch out the screen time due to the lack of actual storytelling. They outdid themselves by making the sequel even less of a movie than the first one. Congrats!There's no build-up, no sensuality, no decent choreography, just the two leads humping ungraciously in several locations with horrible, wordy reggeaton music in the background by unknown artists because they spent all their budget on drones and couldn't afford famous people on the OST. 24 songs every 4 minutes, people. 24 songs! Seems like someone from the editing team wanted to include their favourite Spotify party playlist at all cost.The no plot of this sequel is Laura being moody just 3 days after her wedding because her mob boss husband/ kidnapper has ""work things to do"", despite having all the time in the world for endless bang sessions in his musty dungeon.Laura behaves like another Mary Sue, being mad at her husband for cheating on her of course, not because he kidnapped, drugged, cut her off from her family , threatened and sexually assaulted her at any given chance. We're over the kidnapping in this movie, there are bigger issues here and nope, none of that has anything to do with Massimo's dirty ways and complete disregard of autonomy and consent. This franchise does not understand what these things are. If they did there we could have had some storyline. It's actually insulting to DV victims how the immensely abusive nature of this relationship gets downplayed. Yikes.Laura has wet dreams about the gardener/ rival gangster now, who cares about any conflict or character development? She's there to get passed around like a plaything , having zero agency and being controlled by anyone with a penis and a gun. Your body, your choice, our asses!Oh, look, we get to see Laura naked a lot again, straight female demographic that this saga is appealing to, i hope you're happy!!!Miki is as hot as ever yet we don't see much of his naked glory and he can't act to save his life either. It's a lose lose situation.The garbage plot is so ridiculous that average Telemundo productions could have a chance at an Emmy award. I lost it at the contrived twin brother drama storyline, seriously, did a toddler come up with this nonsense? It's not only riddled with plotholes but it's also pure unintentional comedy.Michelle Morrone's hilarious interpretation as the scorned, coked out brother provided some needed entertainment in what seems the biggest trash Netflix has put out yet and there's more to come.And if you are a fan of this series getting heated by this review , are you honestly satisfied with lukewarm sex scenes with Youtube pop music and ridiculous tiger roar sound effects? I've seen porn films with much better direction, execution and acting. Let's not lie to ourselves here; it's hot trash and one good looking guy cannot save this.If they can't deliver semi decent sex scenes what else is there for viewers to anticipate? Laura's deadpan expression and her ability to get kidnapped by any guy she finds attractive? Massimo's cringeworthy tongue flicking and his babygorl phrase? The materialism overload in each scene? The toxic, creepy cues in every dialogue?This reads more like a soft porn parody than a 50 shades knock-off that gets progressively worse with each installment.

2,I'm sorry.. whatðŸ˜‚,"I just don't know what to say!I saw someone comment about this movie pretty much being a two hour long music video and that's exactly what it is LMAOI can see why majority of the ratings are 1/10. The other half is mostly people rating it 10/10 in hopes of boosting the movies on IMDB (but its still so low)I caught myself wondering what the plot was throughout the whole film, and in WHAT WORLD would this actually happen???I'm sorry but I would never watch again,Sticking with 2/10 because the cinematography is the only good thing about the movie.",im sorry what,i just dont know what say i saw someone comment about this movie pretty much being two hour long music video thats exactly what it is lmaoi can see why majority ratings are 1 10 other half is mostly people rating it 10 10 hopes boosting movies imdb but its still so low i caught myself wondering what plot was throughout whole film what world would this actually happen im sorry but i would never watch again sticking with 2 10 because cinematography is only good thing about movie,0.5208333333333333,0.05416666666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
2,Rushed and lackluster.,"The first movie was pretty good. Characters had stories, there was a decent plot, and a cliffhanger ending making you want to see the 2nd movie.This, however, was just bad.The cliffhanger of Laura getting into some sort of accident was not even acknowledged until halfway through the movie, and only mentioned in passing. The sex scenes we're passionless, unlike the first movie. You can tell the sole purpose of the sex scenes was ""shock"" factor, push the boundaries more than the first film.This movie was rushed, hardly any plot, and just a disappointment. I'd be shocked if they made the 3rd. Music was the best part.",rushed lackluster,first movie was pretty good characters had stories there was decent plot cliffhanger ending making you want see 2nd movie this however was just bad cliffhanger laura getting into some sort accident was not even acknowledged until halfway through movie only mentioned passing sex scenes were passionless unlike first movie you can tell sole purpose sex scenes was shock factor push boundaries more than first film this movie was rushed hardly any plot just disappointment id be shocked if they made 3rd music was best part,0.4828125,0.06718750000000001,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.17}"

2,The storyline starts 30 mins in...,"...but doesn't really get going until 40 mins in.
