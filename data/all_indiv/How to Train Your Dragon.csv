10.0,A Nutshell Review: How to Train Your Dragon,"If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he's deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent.In a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it's a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup's secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation.The story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup's peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there's the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don't fully comprehend, but it's the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first.For those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I'm betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its ""stitch""-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it's co-director Chris Sander's previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that's always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well.Action junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.How to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight.

10.0,One of the most Breathtaking Animated Films of all time.,"I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.10/10 Highly Recommended",one most breathtaking animated films all time,i watched how train your dragon about 5 times now it never gets boring it actually keeps getting better better with with more more views this is huge accomplishment dreamworks animation it might actually be its best animated feauture it yet it is amazing experience watch this film cinema 3d is amazing at times breathtaking i may had most fun that ive ever had cinema watching how train your dragon script is really good is has lot dramatic depth this movie is everyone adults kids will enjoy it equally will love it at end this movie will probably become series like shrek but im hoping this film doesnt get bad sequels like shrek 3 shrek forever after anyways this film will be most recognized its beautiful animation 10 10 highly recommended,0.5862666666666665,0.3550666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.12}"
9.0,Will enamour kids and enthrall adults,"With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.The latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the clich√©) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.The texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.On the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.Joining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.Along with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",will enamour kids enthrall adults,with somewhat unwieldy tile lack winning pixar storyline that has dominated oscars decade dreamworks animations latest could have been clunker not only is how train your dragon best film year so far but it even eclipses quality last years duel academy award winner up latest 3 d film fly into theatres so many weeks is also best its format story wise making burtons overblown misfire alice wonderland look even more pitiful dragon will no doubt enamour kids excuse clich all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled this movie is sure tug hearts anyone who has ever loved pet will undoubtedly draw tears those who are so inclined texture that can be created todays cg technology never ceases amaze consider beautiful tracking shot downed dragon where twisted wing that protrudes towards screen is actually out focus as if you yourself were staring awestruck at giant lizard that lay before you real tangible life i did not have pleasure viewing how train your dragon 3 d but i have heard great things even without having paid surcharge film does no way suffer as result narrative visuals writing voicework is ample reason seek out dragon frankly is real heart movie anyways island berk viking community that lives there does not fear rival tribe weather or disease but rather much more toothy threat dragons nightly raids by winged beasts have forged great hatred upon tribe led by aptly named stoik vast gerard butler they wage war with intent rid themselves dragons once all this is not feeling shared by stoiks scrawny son hiccup jay baruchel who favours non lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing much hiccups surprise during one aforementioned raids he is able down dragon with one his contraptions intent proving his manhood stoik he seeks out find dragon know as night fury but finds himself unable slay his scaly foe so begins unlikely forbidden friendship with later named toothless that follows time tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching joining butler baruchel both whom give excellent performances with butler recapturing some his 300 mojo are likes craig fergusson as viking blacksmith america ferrera as feisty object hiccups affections whole slice apatow gang including kristen wiig christopher mintz plasse jonah hill as other young warriors much like wall e toothless exhibits oodles personality is endlessly endearing achieve this level depth is perhaps even more impressive due fact that he never utters word must emote through non verbal means along with kung fu panda this movie represents highest ilk dreamworks repertoire that is not backhanded compliment by any means like panda there are thrilling well choreographed action sequences compliment heart plenty humour keep this becoming too much dramatic slog younger theatre goers teenager or adult fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema you will not be unsatisfied by how train your dragon read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies blogspot com,0.5621717171717172,0.28474747474747464,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Truly Moving Picture,"I saw this film in early March, of 2010 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""¬Öexplores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.It's in 3-D and it's gorgeous animation. But what really matters is the story. And it's a good one. At first it seems the main story is about a Viking colony equally distant from nowhere, which is being constantly attacked by a wide variety of marauding dragons. It's a full time job trying to keep the dragons at bay and the Viking warriors are often out on their boats hunting their wily and ferocious opponents.But really the story is about a father and chief of the Vikings who has a young son, Hiccup, who is small and who is a slick, sarcastic talker and who doesn't take orders well, but still seeks respect from his impressive father. At first, his Father will not let his son be a warrior Viking, but later relents to have Hiccup train with the other youngsters. But the young boy gets sidetracked and instead of wanting to kill dragons, the boy befriends them and seeks to understand them.A young and inexperienced son seeking approval of a strong father is an often-told tale. Sons often act foolishly trying to impress their fathers. And fathers often ignore the strivings of their sons. In this case, there is honor and courage on all sides and it is inspiring to watch the father and son wrestle with their relationship.And yes, about the dragons ‚Äì they ARE ferocious and talented and aggressive warriors. But their motivations are a mystery that unfolds slowly. And that's the fun of this film.FYI ‚Äì There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",truly moving picture,i saw this film early march 2010 indianapolis i am one judges heartland truly moving picture award truly moving picture explores human journey by artistically expressing hope respect positive values life heartland gave that award this film its 3 d its gorgeous animation but what really matters is story its good one at first it seems main story is about viking colony equally distant nowhere which is being constantly attacked by wide variety marauding dragons its full time job trying keep dragons at bay viking warriors are often out their boats hunting their wily ferocious opponents but really story is about father chief vikings who has young son hiccup who is small who is slick sarcastic talker who doesnt take orders well but still seeks respect his impressive father at first his father will not let his son be warrior viking but later relents have hiccup train with other youngsters but young boy gets sidetracked instead wanting kill dragons boy befriends them seeks understand them young inexperienced son seeking approval strong father is often told tale sons often act foolishly trying impress their fathers fathers often ignore strivings their sons this case there is honor courage all sides it is inspiring watch father son wrestle with their relationship yes about dragons they are ferocious talented aggressive warriors but their motivations are mystery that unfolds slowly thats fun this film fyi there is truly moving pictures web site where there is listing past truly moving picture award winners that are now either at theater or available video,0.45522971652003913,0.174266862170088,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,One of my favorite films of the last decade...,"...not that this is necessarily saying much, since the films of the past decade are either made for the Academy Awards with some social message that hits the audience over the head with a social justice sledgehammer, or they are action films with lots of car chases and explosions and comic book heroes or they are 50 shades of obscene. But I digress. This animated film is beautiful to watch, but that is not the main drawing point. The drawing point are the characters. Even though this is set in some fictitious land full of Vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock, you can easily relate to everybody. The main character, Hiccup, is the son of the warrior king of the Vikings. Hiccup is mild mannered, lanky, awkward - your typical teen of about age 14. He likes to build and invent things. Dad wants his son to be a dragon slayer. So one day, during an attack by the dragons, Hiccup actually catches one with one of his inventions. He grabs a knife and runs into the forest to kill the dragon to make dad happy. But he just can't. This ""fearsome"" dragon is tame, passive, dog-like before people had dogs. And so ""Toothless"" as Hiccup names him, becomes like a pet to Hiccup. The pair develop this beautiful unbreakable bond. And Hiccup learns about dragons.Hiccup is signed up for Dragon Killing class with the rest of the island's teens. Hiccup quickly rises to the top of his class but manages to not kill even one dragon. Instead he uses the techniques of bonding with dragons that he has learned from Toothless to subdue them into harmless pets. Nobody questions what is going on but Astrid, a tomboyish teen girl who just knows Hiccup is up to something.This film has genuine laughs, thrills, the real problems of sons and fathers disappointing and misunderstanding one another, the awkwardness of that first romance, and the idea that sometimes your enemy may be your enemy for reasons you don't understand. I watched this for about the tenth time last night and I have to say it just never gets old. Highly recommended.",one my favorite films last decade,not that this is necessarily saying much since films past decade are either made academy awards with some social message that hits audience over head with social justice sledgehammer or they are action films with lots car chases explosions comic book heroes or they are 50 shades obscene but i digress this animated film is beautiful watch but that is not main drawing point drawing point are characters even though this is set some fictitious land full vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock you can easily relate everybody main character hiccup is son warrior king vikings hiccup is mild mannered lanky awkward your typical teen about age 14 he likes build invent things dad wants his son be dragon slayer so one day during attack by dragons hiccup actually catches one with one his inventions he grabs knife runs into forest kill dragon make dad happy but he just cant this fearsome dragon is tame passive dog like before people had dogs so toothless as hiccup names him becomes like pet hiccup pair develop this beautiful unbreakable bond hiccup learns about dragons hiccup is signed up dragon killing class with rest islands teens hiccup quickly rises top his class but manages not kill even one dragon instead he uses techniques bonding with dragons that he has learned toothless subdue them into harmless pets nobody questions what is going but astrid tomboyish teen girl who just knows hiccup is up something this film has genuine laughs thrills real problems sons fathers disappointing misunderstanding one another awkwardness that first romance idea that sometimes your enemy may be your enemy reasons you dont understand i watched this about tenth time last night i have say it just never gets old highly recommended,0.43505050505050497,0.15535353535353538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,A Beautiful Tale Of Adventure And Friendship For People Of All Ages,"Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it.And although it's very funny, this really isn't just an accumulation of gags and one-liners loosely held together by a paper-thin story: this is a great adventure and touching coming-of-age tale where the protagonist has an actual arc; it tells an intelligent and compelling story about people who are not just one-note characters, and they're wonderfully realized through the great voice-work of such actors as Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson. The animation is fantastic, and there's so much playful creative energy at display in the design of the characters - especially in the design of all the different dragon species - that it's simply a joy to watch. 10 stars out of 10.",beautiful tale adventure friendship people all ages,warning this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive as soon as its over youll immediately want watch it again im grown man but somehow this movie managed ignore all layers cynicism fake toughness we grown ups tend build around ourselves cope with life it cut right through wide eyed adventure loving boy me right through heart its impossible not fall love with this movie with these characters especially if you love wild animals this beautiful story very unlikely friendship between boy whos bit outcast dragon is just so well done its never cheesy yet full passion theres simply not dull moment it although its very funny this really isnt just accumulation gags one liners loosely held together by paper thin story this is great adventure touching coming age tale where protagonist has actual arc it tells intelligent compelling story about people who are not just one note characters theyre wonderfully realized through great voice work such actors as jay baruchel america ferrera gerard butler craig ferguson animation is fantastic theres so much playful creative energy at display design characters especially design all different dragon species that its simply joy watch 10 stars out 10,0.6927960927960928,0.2721853378103378,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"Wonderful movie, a must see 3D","I saw the trailer and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that all the good parts from the movie will be there and that will be all, like it was with many films lately. That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.I didn't read the book, so I don't know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldn't hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. I agree it's not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once it's finished bot it's not meant to be. It's just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I'm 22). The film wasn't too long, it didn't have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.I don't know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again.

His clumsy and inventive son Hiccup works as a blacksmith and dreams on becoming a dragon killer.After a raid of dragons during the night, Hiccup uses the weapon he had invented and he hits the Night Fury. However, he has no witness and nobody in the village believes on his words. Stoik the Vast sails with the Vikings to look for the dragon nest and Hiccup decides to seek out the dragon in the woods, and finds it with a severed tail and can not fly again. Hiccup calls him Toothless and they become friends. The boy uses his skill and manufactures a prosthesis for Toothless and he leans how to control the flight of Toothless.Hiccup learns why the dragons attack his village and finds that his own people had misjudged them. But his great defeat is to prove his father how intolerant the Vikings have been against the dragon.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a delightful animation with a wonderful message of friendship, intolerance, misjudgment, peace and harmony. The directors and writers succeed in telling how important is to understand other people using the metaphor of the dragons in an original way and with an unusual conclusion.

9.0,Genuinely superb and a step forward in 3D films,"HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one ""action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects"" after another. But wait...HTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer ""gratuitous"" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That's not to say that there isn't effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it's just not all the film has to hold attention.Second, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well! Third, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won't spoil it now.

10.0,It's so good it boggles the mind!,"When I saw this film tonight, I was completely bowled over from start to finish. I have simply never seen a better looking computer generated film nor a film that used 3-D to such wonderful effect. Finally--a film that doesn't look like the 3_D doesn't look like it was tossed in as an afterthought--but was clearly intended as one all along. However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry. Now I know some of you will think I am a total sap for saying this, but the film literally brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. I simply couldn't believe how special and artistic this movie was--it completely exceeded my expectations. This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's ""Up""! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film!UPDATE: I saw this on a huge home television. While the wonderful 3-D was missing, the film still had the nicest CGI and was nearly as entertaining as it was in the theater.",its so good it boggles mind,when i saw this film tonight i was completely bowled over start finish i have simply never seen better looking computer generated film nor film that used 3 d such wonderful effect finally film that doesnt look like 3 d doesnt look like it was tossed as afterthought but was clearly intended as one all along however i will warn you not waste your time seeing it 2 d film loses too much its artistry now i know some you will think i am total sap saying this but film literally brought tears my eyes because it was so beautiful i simply couldnt believe how special artistic this movie was it completely exceeded my expectations this is because advertising campaign make this movie look like its just another kids movie nothing more but with lovely plot interesting characters best cgi earth terrific sound track lots surprises this simply is joy watch nornally when i review film i try talk about films flaws but i simply couldnt find any at last 3 d cgi film that actually manages be better looking than last years up it is hard imagine film being any better though i am sure five years now i will be seeing even better 3 d computer generated films it boggles mind see this film update i saw this huge home television while wonderful 3 d was missing film still had nicest cgi was nearly as entertaining as it was theater,0.5118940368940368,0.3013191763191763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.51, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.14}"
10.0,"Amazing, the best Dreamworks film in a long time","I love animation, always have done, always will do, and I was blown away by How to Train Your Dragon. Granted, not all Dreamworks movies are bad, Prince of Egypt is one of the most stirring and evocative films let alone animated films I have seen, Shrek was very original and funny and Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is their most underrated I feel. I will say too, How to Train Your Dragon along with Prince of Egypt is my absolute favourite of Dreamworks, and one of the best of 2010.The story is very engaging; there is nothing too sophisticated for kids and nothing too childish for adults. It is instead an intelligent, moving story that moves along at a good pace, and I for one didn't find it that predictable, and I loved the bonding scenes between Toothless and Hiccup which were suitably poignant. The script is also very strong, it is thoughtful and touching at times but also amusing when it needs to be.The characters are another strength. Hiccup is appealing as a protagonist, and Toothless is really quite cute for a dragon. Hiccup's father Stoick is a good character too, he is gruff and such but you can tell he cares for his son. The voice acting too I had no problem with, to me they did fit well with the characters, Jay Baruchal's excitement and enthusiasm contrasts wonderfully with Gerard Butler's restrained, gruff yet sensitive performance.Where How to Train Your Dragon really excels though are in its visuals and music score. The animation is outstanding, while the characters are modelled convincingly the real revelations are in the stunning flying sequences and the beautiful lavish backgrounds. Oh and the fight sequences are equally spectacular, haunting but also very gripping and almost epic. John Powell's score is a revelation, and one of my favourite scores in a film of recent times. Sometimes soaring, sometimes dramatic, sometimes energetic, in fact no matter what mood is conveyed, the score compliments it to perfection.So overall, there is very little else to say about this film, other than to say it is a must-see in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",amazing best dreamworks film long time,i love animation always have done always will do i was blown away by how train your dragon granted not all dreamworks movies are bad prince egypt is one most stirring evocative films let alone animated films i have seen shrek was very original funny spirit stallion cimarron is their most underrated i feel i will say too how train your dragon along with prince egypt is my absolute favourite dreamworks one best 2010 story is very engaging there is nothing too sophisticated kids nothing too childish adults it is instead intelligent moving story that moves along at good pace i one didnt find it that predictable i loved bonding scenes between toothless hiccup which were suitably poignant script is also very strong it is thoughtful touching at times but also amusing when it needs be characters are another strength hiccup is appealing as protagonist toothless is really quite cute dragon hiccups father stoick is good character too he is gruff such but you can tell he cares his son voice acting too i had no problem with me they did fit well with characters jay baruchals excitement enthusiasm contrasts wonderfully with gerard butlers restrained gruff yet sensitive performance where how train your dragon really excels though are its visuals music score animation is outstanding while characters are modelled convincingly real revelations are stunning flying sequences beautiful lavish backgrounds oh fight sequences are equally spectacular haunting but also very gripping almost epic john powells score is revelation one my favourite scores film recent times sometimes soaring sometimes dramatic sometimes energetic fact no matter what mood is conveyed score compliments it perfection so overall there is very little else say about this film other than say it is must see my opinion 10 10 bethany cox,0.6338043478260869,0.34497282608695645,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,"More mature than ""Shrek""-probably one of the best animated features ever made.Worth seeing","This was one of the moments, when you feel so overwhelmed by a movie, that you want to see it again immediately.And when i think of how the whole movie-going began-a theater, full of annoying, noisy kids, 3-th graders mostly.But in the end, you realize you haven't spent any time listening to them, because you are so fascinated by the movie.You feel you are alone in the otherwise overcrowded theater.This feeling is very precious and when you realize it, you know you loved it.The whole idea is very interesting-alternate Dragon-fighting times, an era of vikings and so many kinds of winged creatures.The main character, Hiccup, is the son of a mighty Dragon fighter-Stoick, who is the vikings chief as well.He wants to teach his son the Dragon fighting ways of the vikings, but the boy befriends one of the Dragons, a very rare kind, almost impossible to find.He names it Toothless and they are in for a lot of adventures.The movie is very fresh, but solid and strong as well.And considering it is an animation, the voice performances are very good.That is also important.But the truly strongest sides of the movie are the heart of the movie-it is really a moving picture, but i think, that the level of maturity of the movie is higher, than DreamWorks's previous efforts like ""Shrek"".It is more meaningful, and although it is a Dragon-fighting story it is more real than most of the studio's previous tries in this genre and definitely a step up in animation.The feelings, the emotions, that were expressed throughout made this animation such a memorable experience, and i'm sure, i won't be able to forget it, at least not soon.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a new, fresh, different start in the animation genre, with a lot of heart and emotions.I think, that's one of the best animations ever made.I recommend it to everyone-from parents with children to more experienced moviegoers and for the more mature audiences as well.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is the best movie this year so far, and a honestly moving picture.An animation masterpiece!*****/*****",more mature than shrek probably one best animated features ever made worth seeing,this was one moments when you feel so overwhelmed by movie that you want see it again immediately when i think how whole movie going began theater full annoying noisy kids 3 th graders mostly but end you realize you havent spent any time listening them because you are so fascinated by movie you feel you are alone otherwise overcrowded theater this feeling is very precious when you realize it you know you loved it whole idea is very interesting alternate dragon fighting times era vikings so many kinds winged creatures main character hiccup is son mighty dragon fighter stoick who is vikings chief as well he wants teach his son dragon fighting ways vikings but boy befriends one dragons very rare kind almost impossible find he names it toothless they are lot adventures movie is very fresh but solid strong as well considering it is animation voice performances are very good that is also important but truly strongest sides movie are heart movie it is really moving picture but i think that level maturity movie is higher than dreamworkss previous efforts like shrek it is more meaningful although it is dragon fighting story it is more real than most studios previous tries this genre definitely step up animation feelings emotions that were expressed throughout made this animation such memorable experience im sure i wont be able forget it at least not soon how train your dragon is new fresh different start animation genre with lot heart emotions i think thats one best animations ever made i recommend it everyone parents with children more experienced moviegoers more mature audiences as well how train your dragon is best movie this year so far honestly moving picture animation masterpiece,0.5282723461025347,0.3099313893653517,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.28}"

I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes.

This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE.

10.0,Do Not Let the Trailer Discourage You. This is Very Good!,"The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.The first one-fourth of the movie was very static and slow for me, all talk. I felt very sleepy and was in fact, drifting off. I did not really immediately like the appearance of the kids, which I found generally annoying. However, when time came that our hero (with the improbable name of Hiccup) met his cute dragon pal (with the equally improbable name of Toothless), the movie picked up pace and from there, it never looked back.The next three fourths of the film was alive with beautiful 3D animation and very heartfelt and touching writing. I know we have all seen flying dragons before (like in ""Shrek""), but the additional animated depth and the fantastic background scenery gave this one a breath-taking quality that made it distinct. The very meticulous and larger-than life scenes of the Viking armada at sea, the Vikings running from the exploding mountain, and especially the final climactic battle, were truly in a class of their own. That is saying a lot in these times when 3D animation seems to be the standard already, and not the exception.The story of the rough tough father and his weakling son has been played in out in various ways in so many various movies before. But somehow, the way it is played out here still managed to be effective in drawing out genuine emotions. The straightforward storyline and familiar conflicts were successfully brought to a higher level by the original vision and masterful direction of Dean de Blois and Chris Sanders (of ""Lilo and Stitch""). This is a shoo-in for one of the nominee slots in the Best Animated Feature Oscar for the coming year.",do not let trailer discourage you this is very good,trailer this movie was so unpromising unattractive it did not make me want watch this 3d no less however my kids all wanted watch it so course my wife i had go with them first one fourth movie was very static slow me all talk i felt very sleepy was fact drifting off i did not really immediately like appearance kids which i found generally annoying however when time came that our hero with improbable name hiccup met his cute dragon pal with equally improbable name toothless movie picked up pace there it never looked back next three fourths film was alive with beautiful 3d animation very heartfelt touching writing i know we have all seen flying dragons before like shrek but additional animated depth fantastic background scenery gave this one breath taking quality that made it distinct very meticulous larger than life scenes viking armada at sea vikings running exploding mountain especially final climactic battle were truly class their own that is saying lot these times when 3d animation seems be standard already not exception story rough tough father his weakling son has been played out various ways so many various movies before but somehow way it is played out here still managed be effective drawing out genuine emotions straightforward storyline familiar conflicts were successfully brought higher level by original vision masterful direction dean de blois chris sanders lilo stitch this is shoo one nominee slots best animated feature oscar coming year,0.540482456140351,0.24945906432748538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,If you feel that Toy Story and Shreck are missing SOMETHING IMPORTANT - this movie is for you,"It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other ""renewing"" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and ""for all"". It's not one of those ""hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy"" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way.I have seen a lot of 3D animated movies - American, European, Asian. This one hits 10 in my opinion, because it's by far the most complete vision enclosed in a 3D animated form. But - in addition - it's a pure fairy tale in the core. And I mean PURE - from the cores of fairy-telling, which is the most polite, elegant way of TEACHING important stuff. I think that 3D movie is not only craftsmanship behind creating artificial environment, animating believably, lighting sets with care, etc., etc. Like any other movie - it should be a well told story, which will left you ...CHANGED a bit (that's what fairy tales do, right?) Only those kind of stories will matter in your life. Rest is just ""fun"".'How to train your dragon' is a modern fairy tale. It's modern because - like other mainstream 3D movies - it's excellently crafted. We have here great animation (Toothless, the dragon is ""made of life"", so to speak - you actually just want to HAVE one), lighting and cinematography (splendid flight scenes, which take your breath away, and make you climb your chair), effects, etc.... But it's a fairy tale because - above all that - we have here a master degree directing by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders too. All those decisions made by them - from very basic (like the look of Toothless and other characters, or editing), to more important (like balancing the amounts of fear, sadness, seriousness and fun tones in the story) are marks of wisdom. And those decisions made a difference between this movie and ""the rest"". Those decisions crafted a SOUL in it. And achieving this ""soul level"" should be a goal of every director.Summing up: great movie in at least two aspects. Technically (character design, animation, cinematography, editing) and emotionally (great simple story with surprisingly 'non-hollywoodish' wise moral, fantastic heart-touching score by John Powell, and mature directing which guide you to be changed a bit after watching).Best achievement in 3D storytelling since Euclide :)",if you feel that toy story shreck are missing something important this movie is you,its far better then all those shrecks toy stories ratatoulies puss boots mega minds other renewing concepts why its simple honest this movie doesnt try be funny modern super wise all its not one those hey lets make movie about cat who is super spy concepts this movie just tells simple yet very good story most proper way i have seen lot 3d animated movies american european asian this one hits 10 my opinion because its by far most complete vision enclosed 3d animated form but addition its pure fairy tale core i mean pure cores fairy telling which is most polite elegant way teaching important stuff i think that 3d movie is not only craftsmanship behind creating artificial environment animating believably lighting sets with care etc etc like any other movie it should be well told story which will left you changed bit thats what fairy tales do right only those kind stories will matter your life rest is just fun how train your dragon is modern fairy tale its modern because like other mainstream 3d movies its excellently crafted we have here great animation toothless dragon is made life so speak you actually just want have one lighting cinematography splendid flight scenes which take your breath away make you climb your chair effects etc but its fairy tale because above all that we have here master degree directing by dean deblois chris sanders too all those decisions made by them very basic like look toothless other characters or editing more important like balancing amounts fear sadness seriousness fun tones story are marks wisdom those decisions made difference between this movie rest those decisions crafted soul it achieving this soul level should be goal every director summing up great movie at least two aspects technically character design animation cinematography editing emotionally great simple story with surprisingly non hollywoodish wise moral fantastic heart touching score by john powell mature directing which guide you be changed bit after watching best achievement 3d storytelling since euclide,0.5352456538170824,0.25336167800453513,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10.0,My favourite animated film,"There's a reason why I watched How To Train Your Dragon 7 times when it was still playing in theatres. No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless.Throughout the movie, you see each of them grow in awareness about one another, but also in awareness about themselves. This, I think, is what makes their relationship so much more than what meets the eye: before they even know it, they are accepting themselves for their own insecurities and learning not to judge others by first glance. To top off the many hidden lessons, the screenplay is nicely paced and super quirky/funny (a lot of laughs in all the right places). I also think John Powell did an excellent job with the soundtrack (and when I'm not watching the movie, I sometimes just listen to the soundtrack--yes, you could say I'm just a little obsessed). Ever since I was little to today, I have always managed to feel the same childish wonder and magic that I felt that first time I saw HTTYD in a movie theatre.

10.0,The best 2010 release I've seen so far ‚Äì and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a very long time,"I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.While watching Dreamwork's new masterpiece, How to Train Your Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the similarities between both it and the aforementioned Lilo & Stitch. Toothless, the lead dragon character from the new film resembles the alien Stitch in shape as well as in behavior. Hiccup, the main human character which befriends Toothless despite warnings from his fellow Vikings, is a semi middle-age teenage version of the character Lilo. A trip visit to IMDb cleared things up for me - Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the same people who directed the 2002 wonder (L & S) are behind the new and awesome How to Train Your Dragon.Fortunately enough, the similarities end here, and this is not a carbon copy of that film - even though the bottom line (tolerance toward people who are different, etc.) is the same. However, this new film takes place in the middle ages, in a small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons. Stoick (voiced by the almighty Gerard Butler) is the head of the village, a pumped up manly Viking who leads the counter-attacks against the fierce dragons. His teenage son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), however, doesn't quite fit in. Unlike the older Vikings, who speak in an Irish accent, he sounds like your average American teenager. He's also skinny and small and not exactly the material Viking warriors are made of.After a nightly battle between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup discovers Toothless, a supposedly lethal dragon, which has lost its ability to fly after being injured in the fight. Without anyone knowing, Hiccup slowly gains Toothless' confidence, and the two gradually learn to know each other. After the primal fears disappear, they realize they actually have a great deal to learn about one another ‚Äì and that friendship is always better than hostility. Soon enough, Hiccup trains Toothless and learns how to approach dragons in general, something that doesn't quite fit in with his father, friends, and the society he lives in in general. But when a greater threat reveals itself, the Vikings and the dragons discover their only hope is to put aside their prejudice thoughts and fight together ‚Äì with Hiccup and Toothless being their best hope for victory.Bottom line ‚Äì How to Train Your Dragon is a major victory for the guys at Dreamworks. The film is truly inspiring, with a story that feels self-contained and complete, one that doesn't need to rely on pop culture references to succeed (unlike many of their other products). After a long period of mediocre products (in my opinion) that pale next to their Pixar counterparts, Dreamworks Animation finally came out with the winning formula ‚Äì which contains just the right amount of relatable characters and true emotions, stunning visuals (including Nordic landscapes and various species of beautiful dragons) and a 3-D element (that uses InTru technology) that really works for a change.Despite the similarities to Lilo & Stitch, I came out feeling that Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders actually managed to improve on their winning hit, and create the best 2010 release I've seen so far ‚Äì and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a long long time.",best 2010 release ive seen so far one best animated films hit theaters very long time,i remember watching adorable disney flick lilo stitch at theater back summer 2002 after truly exhausting week film which tells story small girl that befriends wacky alien she mistakes dog managed put enormous smile my face made me forget all my other worries while while watching dreamworks new masterpiece how train your dragon i couldnt help but think about similarities between both it aforementioned lilo stitch toothless lead dragon character new film resembles alien stitch shape as well as behavior hiccup main human character which befriends toothless despite warnings his fellow vikings is semi middle age teenage version character lilo trip visit imdb cleared things up me dean deblois chris sanders same people who directed 2002 wonder l s are behind new awesome how train your dragon fortunately enough similarities end here this is not carbon copy that film even though bottom line tolerance toward people who are different etc is same however this new film takes place middle ages small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons stoick voiced by almighty gerard butler is head village pumped up manly viking who leads counter attacks against fierce dragons his teenage son hiccup jay baruchel however doesnt quite fit unlike older vikings who speak irish accent he sounds like your average american teenager hes also skinny small not exactly material viking warriors are made after nightly battle between vikings dragons hiccup discovers toothless supposedly lethal dragon which has lost its ability fly after being injured fight without anyone knowing hiccup slowly gains toothless confidence two gradually learn know each other after primal fears disappear they realize they actually have great deal learn about one another that friendship is always better than hostility soon enough hiccup trains toothless learns how approach dragons general something that doesnt quite fit with his father friends society he lives general but when greater threat reveals itself vikings dragons discover their only hope is put aside their prejudice thoughts fight together with hiccup toothless being their best hope victory bottom line how train your dragon is major victory guys at dreamworks film is truly inspiring with story that feels self contained complete one that doesnt need rely pop culture references succeed unlike many their other products after long period mediocre products my opinion that pale next their pixar counterparts dreamworks animation finally came out with winning formula which contains just right amount relatable characters true emotions stunning visuals including nordic landscapes various species beautiful dragons 3 d element that uses intru technology that really works change despite similarities lilo stitch i came out feeling that dean deblois chris sanders actually managed improve their winning hit create best 2010 release ive seen so far one best animated films hit theaters long long time,0.47202029572159426,0.14677924888963845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Visually Stunning,"An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint.Our protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesn't possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe.What I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action.The 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear sea's and jaw-dropping backdrops.Whilst this is a film that may seem as if it's solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied.",visually stunning,animated feast eyes is brilliant description this film jaw dropping visuals beautifully rendered 3d flawless animation characters dragons this was one film that didnt disappoint our protagonist is hiccup boy viking who doesnt possess much common with his dragon slaying dad however when he finds new friend toothless most feared dragon its species he learns that dragons are not fearful creatures he was brought up believe what i enjoyed most was relationship between hiccup toothless dragon this was dealt with wonderfully we see their relationship develop over series scenes which were done with great humour action 3d holds its own every sense i would go as far as saying that some scenes rival groundbreaking avatar scenes that especially stood out were flying segments where dragon soars over crystal clear seas jaw dropping backdrops whilst this is film that may seem as if its solely directed at younger generation its stunning visuals well told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied,0.7232323232323232,0.4207792207792207,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Night Fury; Flight,"The first major film where the agent takes a stake. This is sending shivers through CAA whose power resides in control of the performing talent. The old school agents and the performing talent have distorted the product. This business of animation studios and literary agents is likely to distort things in an equally damaging way. But for now, the shift is visible, welcome and exciting as getout.This is actually written. It grows from within as good writing should rather that seeming like a desired shape made of chicken wire and filled with ordinary bits. Yes, we still have the moralizing because otherwise parents wouldn't think they were parenting. The rendering is cutting edge.But what sets this apart is the use of space. Most folks don't notice this, but we have come a long, long way in five years. I have been following the advances in this. I'll say that if you have not been watching movies in that period, this could make you a bit dizzy because you will not have been walked through the incremental steps in our new spatial imagination.The core quality of cinema is that the filmmaker gets to design your eyes. From the beginning, intelligent filmmakers have experimented with what character the camera might have. This is behind all the filmmakers I believe are great; each added and exploited some new character of eye.With animation, and 3D modeling, it became feasible for the camera to behave in ways that a physical camera could not. Some filmmakers deliberately made their artificial cameras behave like old fashioned ones; perhaps they did not have the skills to move into unusual territory, but I think in most cases the decision was to make the fake world seem real by having the eye treat it as if it were real.Two centers of innovation were WETA (Peter Jackson's shop) and Pixar. Both experimented heaving with vertical motion and depth. Much of this was in flight, sometimes through water. We have precedents, starting with Hell's Angels and slowly working through Star Wars (the original). Then an explosion, and experiments in often overlooked films: King Kong, Treasure Planet, Van Helsing. Now we have the two schools in full bloom.Independently, Dreamworks just couldn't get its groove in animation. Heaven knows they tried to catch up, but they always seemed to be working in space left over from someone else. Here the agent-producer seems to have hired some real spatial talent and let them have control. Even the opening sequence where we see the village and then an attack is spatially thrilling.Luckily, we have two 3D dragonflight movies playing side by side so we can see the two camps compared. Avatar uses WETA and the WETA philosophy. This has the camera as a companion in flight with its own distinct flight path. The excitement is in jumps not in the motion being shown, but the place of the camera.This film adopts the Pixar philosophy which uses POV and POV-inspired notions heaving. In this notion, we are ghosts that can place ourselves anywhere we wish so as to see thing better. We do move, and our eyes do, but motivated by discovery rather than participation.Compare in particular the idea of falling in love as shared, dangerous flight.Thrilling. Simply trilling. We are seeing the birth of a new medium and will dream differently tomorrow.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",night fury flight,first major film where agent takes stake this is sending shivers through caa whose power resides control performing talent old school agents performing talent have distorted product this business animation studios literary agents is likely distort things equally damaging way but now shift is visible welcome exciting as getout this is actually written it grows within as good writing should rather that seeming like desired shape made chicken wire filled with ordinary bits yes we still have moralizing because otherwise parents wouldnt think they were parenting rendering is cutting edge but what sets this apart is use space most folks dont notice this but we have come long long way five years i have been following advances this ill say that if you have not been watching movies that period this could make you bit dizzy because you will not have been walked through incremental steps our new spatial imagination core quality cinema is that filmmaker gets design your eyes beginning intelligent filmmakers have experimented with what character camera might have this is behind all filmmakers i believe are great each added exploited some new character eye with animation 3d modeling it became feasible camera behave ways that physical camera could not some filmmakers deliberately made their artificial cameras behave like old fashioned ones perhaps they did not have skills move into unusual territory but i think most cases decision was make fake world seem real by having eye treat it as if it were real two centers innovation were weta peter jacksons shop pixar both experimented heaving with vertical motion depth much this was flight sometimes through water we have precedents starting with hells angels slowly working through star wars original then explosion experiments often overlooked films king kong treasure planet van helsing now we have two schools full bloom independently dreamworks just couldnt get its groove animation heaven knows they tried catch up but they always seemed be working space left over someone else here agent producer seems have hired some real spatial talent let them have control even opening sequence where we see village then attack is spatially thrilling luckily we have two 3d dragonflight movies playing side by side so we can see two camps compared avatar uses weta weta philosophy this has camera as companion flight with its own distinct flight path excitement is jumps not motion being shown but place camera this film adopts pixar philosophy which uses pov pov inspired notions heaving this notion we are ghosts that can place ourselves anywhere we wish so as see thing better we do move our eyes do but motivated by discovery rather than participation compare particular idea falling love as shared dangerous flight thrilling simply trilling we are seeing birth new medium will dream differently tomorrow teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.5359006734006735,0.11104797979797983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.41}"
