9.0,Live your dream!,"If you loved Dil Chahta Hain, there's no way you'd not like 'Rock ON'. I have just returned from a small screening of the movie last night and it was 'Fantabulous'. I had been waiting for it since long and the wait was worth it. If you think that the movie is all about Rock and being cool, its not. It's about desiring something and breaking all the rules to get there.I don't want to speak out the story here as it is among the best written screenplays I have seen in any movie so far  be it Indian Cinema or Hollywood. The flashbacks and the montages and the cuts were brilliantly placed. There are a few things that I'd specifically ask you to watch out for. First is Jason West's cinematography; absolutely commendable. Then there is the music and sound design which is powerful yet sweet and the star attribute of the movie  the performances. They are flawless, Farhan is good, Prachi is amazing, Suhana is complete and Arjun Rampal has delivered the best performance of his life (watch out for the climax).The live performances in the movie were well done, Magic could have been more aggressive but they had good presence. 'Shair n Func', came and went and their song was pretty catchy. Chakravhyu was super sexyand sheer evil and none the least RADIO were rocking as usual with 'Musafir'  beautiful song that one.In the end Rock On is a really sweet movie and a must watch for the people, both young and old, who dare to dream and are willing to walk that road in order to achieve it. I absolutely loved the movie and am definitely going for it again. Indian Rock Bands rule!!!!!!!",live your dream,if you loved dil chahta hain theres no way youd not like rock i have just returned small screening movie last night it was fantabulous i had been waiting it since long wait was worth it if you think that movie is all about rock being cool its not its about desiring something breaking all rules get there i dont want speak out story here as it is among best written screenplays i have seen any movie so far be it indian cinema or hollywood flashbacks montages cuts were brilliantly placed there are few things that id specifically ask you watch out first is jason wests cinematography absolutely commendable then there is music sound design which is powerful yet sweet star attribute movie performances they are flawless farhan is good prachi is amazing suhana is complete arjun rampal has delivered best performance his life watch out climax live performances movie were well done magic could have been more aggressive but they had good presence shair n func came went their song was pretty catchy chakravhyu was super sexy sheer evil none least radio were rocking as usual with musafir beautiful song that one end rock is really sweet movie must watch people both young old who dare dream are willing walk that road order achieve it i absolutely loved movie am definitely going it again indian rock bands rule,0.6094017094017092,0.2975912975912975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.02, 'Fear': 0.4}"

Rock On meets, surpasses and blows the expectations of the viewer out of the window. Brilliant.This movie is one of those rare ones that actually focuses just on the music. It doesn't move of into some romantic tune or dramatic effect. It stays true to it's heart and soul. The Music.All the actors perform brilliantly with a special mention to Arjun Rampal and Prachi Desai who shines out in her debut film. But best of all is the showstopper. Farhan Akhtar. This man is a genius! He can sing (only rock!) act and direct (not this one though). Brilliant. By far the shining star of this move. He carries his role out with exceptional ease and actually seems as good as any seasoned actor of a high caliber. Hats off.In the end, this movie is what it is: "" Brilliant as it is, the message is heard as if in stock, this movieends in bliss, but only after making you ROCK!""Superb!

8.0,Rock On!! - A Movie None Should Miss!,"Easily my fave movie of this year.Rock On!! portrays the essence of friendship albeit in a different narration, does call for a round of applause for a theme which might not be so popular in India i.e. Rock.The story revolves around four friends forming a rock band called Magik with Aditya ( Farhan Akhtar) the lead vocalist and lyricist, Joe ( Arjun Rampal) the guitarist, KD ( Purab Kohli) on the drums and Rob ( Luke Kenny) on the keyboard, out to cut out an album. Somethings go awry and the friends who shared the same passion drift away, each leading their own life.A decade later, some circumstances bring these four friends together and Magik is in action again to give the most memorable performance ever.The story of course has more to it but you rather watch the movie to learn that.Director Abhishek Kapoor has captured the fragility of relationships on the celluloid with compelling ease. Farhan Akhtar has emerged as an actor and as a super singer, with no signs of débutant syndrome to be seen in his performance. Arjun Rampal surprises with one of his finest performances till date. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy;s music just rocks.The movie Rock On has the blended concoction of some outstanding performances, engulfing emotions and topping it is the execution of the entire theme. I have a gut of the film Rock On is going to rock the box-office as well.",rock movie none should miss,easily my fave movie this year rock portrays essence friendship albeit different narration does call round applause theme which might not be so popular india i e rock story revolves around four friends forming rock band called magik with aditya farhan akhtar lead vocalist lyricist joe arjun rampal guitarist kd purab kohli drums rob luke kenny keyboard out cut out album somethings go awry friends who shared same passion drift away each leading their own life decade later some circumstances bring these four friends together magik is action again give most memorable performance ever story course has more it but you rather watch movie learn that director abhishek kapoor has captured fragility relationships celluloid with compelling ease farhan akhtar has emerged as actor as super singer with no signs d butant syndrome be seen his performance arjun rampal surprises with one his finest performances till date shankar ehsaan loy s music just rocks movie rock has blended concoction some outstanding performances engulfing emotions topping it is execution entire theme i have gut film rock is going rock box office as well,0.5816666666666668,0.27777777777777773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,"Rock On: Live your dreams, live your ambitions","I had been waiting to see this movie ever since the promos and trailers hit the theaters. This is the first proper Indian rock band movie, and with a compelling star cast this was bound to be a joy to watch. And I was not disappointed. It was 140 minutes of pure fun. This is finally a movie where we don't have any catchy item numbers or some stupid unwanted songs. Its a movie about a rock band, so we have rock songs. Songs with guitar riffs, drum solos, and kick-ass vocals.The story is quite simple. 4 college buddies dream big, they dream high. They want to form a band and become the next big thing in the upcoming rock culture. They do all that, against all odds, going against their careers their parents chose for them. But somewhere along the line, we have ego clashes amongst the band members, which results in the band breaking up, even before they released their first album. Years later, things have changed. But they make a last gasp reunion, and leave the stage on a high.Whilst the story is critical, for any movie, its not something which is flashy. Its your regular story, one which you can expect out of a Bollywood movie. But the presentation makes the difference. Coupled with some wonderful songs and a brilliant background score, and some superb acting, Rock On! gives you a startlingly different flavor from the regular Bollywood masala movies. The acting has been overall brilliant, there were some patches were it was becoming evident that most of them are newbies in front of the camera, but we can bother to overlook that small mistake. Farhan Akhtar debut performance as the lead singer, Adi, the successful investment banker, the one with the flamboyant vocals, gives a brilliant performance. He is the protagonist of the story, and he controls the tempo of the movie.Add to that he has sung most of the songs himself.Arjun Rampal, as the lead guitarist, Joseph ""Joe"" Mascarenhas is another complicated character. He is another central character to the story and he gives the movie far more credibility. He's this brilliant guitarist, who has rock in his blood. But he's financially insecure, and this results in his poor family background, his family's fishing business. He has a great sense of pride in his musical talent and like the forefathers of rock, he refuses to sell his pride. He refuses to play in pubs and clubs, and insists on playing for his own happiness rather than for cash, in spite of his family troubles.KD,""Killer Drummer"", he's the heart of the band. Purab Kohli, makes it a point to play the drums, and make an honest effort to look credible enough. He's the wacko junkie, with the weirdest possible fashion sense, like wearing a tie over a tee shirt to every gig. Like all others after the Magik era he's wasting away in his family business.Last and definitely not the least Luke Kenny as Rob. He was the manager/keyboardist of the band. He organized gigs for them, and he was the one who became successful musically, recording with Anu Malik on small time jobs. And he was the one who brings the band together after 10 years, amidst tragedies.Special mention must be made of Prachi Desai and Sahana Goswami. Both have been brilliant at the roles they have reprised. Prachi as Sakshi, the wife of Adi, and Sahana as Debbie, Joe's wife gives a superb performance. Especially Sahana, she did a brilliant brilliant job, portraying two very different characters in the two eras. The acting, the music, the camera work, has all been superb, excellent. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy bring forth their magic as the amazing music directors, so does Javed Akhtar with the catchy lyrics.One negative aspect may be, that this movie is somewhat shortened. We could have explored certain characters more, but the makers probably thought to leave this at that, and not make the movie a bit more predictable. For example, Dalip Tahil as Adi's boss has basically just 2 scenes. And Nicollete Bird as the old flame of Adi is almost an extra. Those 2 characters could have been explored a bit. I'm sure there will be long deleted scenes in the DVD.Apart from the brilliant music, the acting, and the character portrayal, the movie also follows a important message. To always follow your dreams and your heart. We see that with Joe, a financially insecure person, who leaves behind a job where hes guaranteed a large sum of money to play with his old band, to ignite his flame, his passion for playing on stage in a proper rock gig. We see Rob, who's dieing away slowly, to overcome all odds and play with his old buddies for one last time, on stage. And lastly KD, in his last lines, ""I don't care what you fellows think. But I've been among your personal ego clashes for a long time, and I'm going out there on stage even if I have to drum all alone for 20 minutes, I'll do it."" This movie might not appeal to the older audience who might shun this as a youth film. Yes, this movie is based on today's youth, but it carries a message which is universally applicable. It uses the rock culture to promote this meaning, this message. Kudos to Farhan Akhtar again for treating us to another delight. 10/10.",rock live your dreams live your ambitions,i had been waiting see this movie ever since promos trailers hit theaters this is first proper indian rock band movie with compelling star cast this was bound be joy watch i was not disappointed it was 140 minutes pure fun this is finally movie where we dont have any catchy item numbers or some stupid unwanted songs its movie about rock band so we have rock songs songs with guitar riffs drum solos kick ass vocals story is quite simple 4 college buddies dream big they dream high they want form band become next big thing upcoming rock culture they do all that against all odds going against their careers their parents chose them but somewhere along line we have ego clashes amongst band members which results band breaking up even before they released their first album years later things have changed but they make last gasp reunion leave stage high whilst story is critical any movie its not something which is flashy its your regular story one which you can expect out bollywood movie but presentation makes difference coupled with some wonderful songs brilliant background score some superb acting rock gives you startlingly different flavor regular bollywood masala movies acting has been overall brilliant there were some patches were it was becoming evident that most them are newbies front camera but we can bother overlook that small mistake farhan akhtar debut performance as lead singer adi successful investment banker one with flamboyant vocals gives brilliant performance he is protagonist story he controls tempo movie add that he has sung most songs himself arjun rampal as lead guitarist joseph joe mascarenhas is another complicated character he is another central character story he gives movie far more credibility hes this brilliant guitarist who has rock his blood but hes financially insecure this results his poor family background his familys fishing business he has great sense pride his musical talent like forefathers rock he refuses sell his pride he refuses play pubs clubs insists playing his own happiness rather than cash spite his family troubles kd killer drummer hes heart band purab kohli makes it point play drums make honest effort look credible enough hes wacko junkie with weirdest possible fashion sense like wearing tie over tee shirt every gig like all others after magik era hes wasting away his family business last definitely not least luke kenny as rob he was manager keyboardist band he organized gigs them he was one who became successful musically recording with anu malik small time jobs he was one who brings band together after 10 years amidst tragedies special mention must be made prachi desai sahana goswami both have been brilliant at roles they have reprised prachi as sakshi wife adi sahana as debbie joes wife gives superb performance especially sahana she did brilliant brilliant job portraying two very different characters two eras acting music camera work has all been superb excellent shankar ehsaan loy bring forth their magic as amazing music directors so does javed akhtar with catchy lyrics one negative aspect may be that this movie is somewhat shortened we could have explored certain characters more but makers probably thought leave this at that not make movie bit more predictable example dalip tahil as adis boss has basically just 2 scenes nicollete bird as old flame adi is almost extra those 2 characters could have been explored bit im sure there will be long deleted scenes dvd apart brilliant music acting character portrayal movie also follows important message always follow your dreams your heart we see that with joe financially insecure person who leaves behind job where hes guaranteed large sum money play with his old band ignite his flame his passion playing stage proper rock gig we see rob whos dieing away slowly overcome all odds play with his old buddies one last time stage lastly kd his last lines i dont care what you fellows think but ive been among your personal ego clashes long time im going out there stage even if i have drum all alone 20 minutes ill do it this movie might not appeal older audience who might shun this as youth film yes this movie is based todays youth but it carries message which is universally applicable it uses rock culture promote this meaning this message kudos farhan akhtar again treating us another delight 10 10,0.5282106102514267,0.21514687693259127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,ROCK ON touched my HEART... Watch this movie with heart full of friendship and eyes wet with emotions,"Four friends share a common passion for music and form a rock band called Magik. Aditya (Farhan Akhtar) is the lead vocalist, Joe (Arjun Rampal) is the guitarist, KD (Purab Kohli) is the drummer and Rob (Luke Kenny) handles the keyboard. They get a chance to cut out an album but things don't work out and the group splits to go their separate ways.A decade later Aditya's wife Sakshi (Prachi Desai) attempts to reunite the group. After some initial hiccups and ego clashes, the band members bond and blend to brew good tunes. Predictably the climax is set in a rock concert where the band performs to perfection.Despite such patented predictability, one still relates to Rock On. You noticeably know that Arjun Rampal would make a late entry in the climax concert but your heart still goes out on his appearance. You aren't surprised when one of the band members is diagnosed of cancer but you still feel for him. That's because the simplicity and sincerity of the direction and performances touch you.The storytelling is somewhat slow and drags in the preliminary portions. The film gets into frequent flashback episodes and at times you are caught unaware on the instance where it ends. Even the back-story takes a tad bit long to reach to the point where the band disperses. Unimaginatively the screenplay uses the same scheme of a rock concert for its first key plot-point and also the climax. But seemingly that was inevitable since the genre of the film restricts its creative scope. Also Farhan Akhtar's breakup with his girlfriend doesn't come across quite convincingly.On the upside, the musical theme of the film is ably supported by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's rocking score. For once you don't feel that songs are forced in a Bollywood film. There's also a splendid spoof on how the band merges rock with dandiya to gain some quick money. How one wishes the film had more of such lighter moments which would have accentuated the youthful appeal to Dil Chahta Hai extents. The director also manages to pull off a subtle satire on Anu Malik, while casting him at his own expense.Rock On seems to be clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery. Arjun Rampal looks mature in his character but isn't quite credible while handling the guitar. Purab Kohli has a natural flair for comedy and Luke Kenny is persuasive in his role. From the female leads Shahana Goswami as Arjun's wife comes up with the most compelling act and adds some depth to the drama. Prachi Desai justifies her poised presence.It's interesting how director Abhishek Kapoor attempts to make commercial entertainers on subjects that are not much prevalent in our country. His last film Aryan was on boxing, a sport not much popular in India and now he tries his hands on rock culture, which again isn't much recognized here. At least this time he succeeds in creating a realistic rock feel.Rock On strikes a chord on that note.",rock touched my heart watch this movie with heart full friendship eyes wet with emotions,four friends share common passion music form rock band called magik aditya farhan akhtar is lead vocalist joe arjun rampal is guitarist kd purab kohli is drummer rob luke kenny handles keyboard they get chance cut out album but things dont work out group splits go their separate ways decade later adityas wife sakshi prachi desai attempts reunite group after some initial hiccups ego clashes band members bond blend brew good tunes predictably climax is set rock concert where band performs perfection despite such patented predictability one still relates rock you noticeably know that arjun rampal would make late entry climax concert but your heart still goes out his appearance you arent surprised when one band members is diagnosed cancer but you still feel him thats because simplicity sincerity direction performances touch you storytelling is somewhat slow drags preliminary portions film gets into frequent flashback episodes at times you are caught unaware instance where it ends even back story takes tad bit long reach point where band disperses unimaginatively screenplay uses same scheme rock concert its first key plot point also climax but seemingly that was inevitable since genre film restricts its creative scope also farhan akhtars breakup with his girlfriend doesnt come across quite convincingly upside musical theme film is ably supported by shankar ehsaan loys rocking score once you dont feel that songs are forced bollywood film theres also splendid spoof how band merges rock with dandiya gain some quick money how one wishes film had more such lighter moments which would have accentuated youthful appeal dil chahta hai extents director also manages pull off subtle satire anu malik while casting him at his own expense rock seems be clearly designed by farhan akhar as his own acting debut he doesnt let himself down lending voice all his songs helps him get into his character with effortless ease one could certainly overlook lisp his dialogue delivery arjun rampal looks mature his character but isnt quite credible while handling guitar purab kohli has natural flair comedy luke kenny is persuasive his role female leads shahana goswami as arjuns wife comes up with most compelling act adds some depth drama prachi desai justifies her poised presence its interesting how director abhishek kapoor attempts make commercial entertainers subjects that are not much prevalent our country his last film aryan was boxing sport not much popular india now he tries his hands rock culture which again isnt much recognized here at least this time he succeeds creating realistic rock feel rock strikes chord that note,0.45083943833943824,0.11939865689865692,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,Spot On!!,"I didn't have many expectations from this one before the release. Then, came the reviews and they were surprisingly positive which raised my expectation bar. And after watching the movie, I realized that both (moive and the reviews) were Spot On!! Abhishek Kapoor's 'Rock On!!' is indeed a rocking and a refreshing film.It tells the story about four young friends who put together a wonderful band called 'Magik' but could never make it big. The movie brilliantly depicts the life of aspiring rock stars in India and carefully handles their rise, fall and reunion. The whole movie see-saws between the past and the present which keeps the viewer interested.Acting is also nice. Frahan Akhtar acts well and is a capable singer. Though I hope he doesn't become Himesh #2 and keeps his singing within limits. Rest of the cast- Arjun, Purab, Luke, Prachi and Sahana also do well.As for the negatives, the movie was a little lengthy. Plus, I believe the incident with ""Rob"" was unnecessary which didn't suit the general ""feel-good"" mood of the film.Despite some shortcomings, Rock on!! is indeed a noteworthy attempt and needs to be applauded.

9.0,Rock On!!...bring it on!,"Rock is all about employing electric and bass guitars, thundering drums with a mix of organ or piano or synthesizers giving you all a severe head-banging session. Well, that's what rock means to me and Rock On! is a great attempt bringing the same feel to 70MM! Rock On! is an ideal example of bridging cult with mainline Hindi cinema. Kudos! The movie is about how 4 talented friends with same passion for music creates a band called Magik and wanted to become 'somebody' in music industry. The movie focuses on how they stay together, achieve what they want to, broke up with each other and re-unites one last time. Director has done a marvelous job in bringing all characters alive. He didn't allow more characters floating all around and coming in between. He simply focuses on Magik and their select close ones.Soul of this movie lies in its music. The music of Rock On! is packed with extremely catchy kick ass numbers. Though all the numbers are rocking but my top three favorites are 'Zehreelay' 'Pichhle Saat Dinon' and 'Ye Tumhari Meri Baatein'. 'Zehreelay' is the heaviest soundtrack of any Indian movie so far. It's wild, full of energy and extremely noisy. Lyrics are weird and the interesting part is the vocal. You can do extreme screaming when you sing in English but when it comes to Hindi, it's a different ball game. It is tough to sing so loud and extreme that too with perfect vocals in Hindi. Simply hell yeah! 'Pichhle saat dinon' is a song that grows on you and later, you can't live without. The song is so popular that they have made a spl video for it. 'Ye Tumhari Meri Baatein' is beautiful song with a tinge of jazz to it. It will make you feel as if it is made for you and your love. Another wonderful track is 'Socha hai'. It's like back to roots, real rock song where lyrics come out from no where. Title soundtrack 'Rock On!', 'Sindbad the sailor' and 'Fir Dekhiye' are simply outstanding. Another special song is a slow rock ballad 'Tum ho to'. In age of one song wonder soundtracks Rock On! is a surprise package. Each and every song is a chart buster. In fact, I'm now so used to listening Rock On! songs where ever I roam! Office, Pubs, Music stores and channels, Radio its every where! It's like rock music in its purest form with a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody! The movie is well crafted but the plot is not something new. It's a predictable movie and you know exactly what will happen next. Also, dialogs don't have that punch like the songs and its theme. I like Farhan Akhtar as a director, singer, and actor but excluding his voice. I do not know why but some how he is not that great when he talks.There are so many well crafted scenes that had lit up this movie. My favorite scene is where Magik performs at a local society to raise money. I will not reveal much of it but I just couldn't stop laughing like mad while watching it. Also, the scene where Magik performs at a music contest then fights with each other and split. Its sheer delight as director sketched those scenes brilliantly.Rock On! truly justifies its title with some heavy dope of rocking music and acting. More important, it's the simplicity of the movie which will make you happy while coming out of the movie screen with a message to all- know matter what may come... keep rocking!",rock bring it,rock is all about employing electric bass guitars thundering drums with mix organ or piano or synthesizers giving you all severe head banging session well thats what rock means me rock is great attempt bringing same feel 70mm rock is ideal example bridging cult with mainline hindi cinema kudos movie is about how 4 talented friends with same passion music creates band called magik wanted become somebody music industry movie focuses how they stay together achieve what they want broke up with each other re unites one last time director has done marvelous job bringing all characters alive he didnt allow more characters floating all around coming between he simply focuses magik their select close ones soul this movie lies its music music rock is packed with extremely catchy kick ass numbers though all numbers are rocking but my top three favorites are zehreelay pichhle saat dinon ye tumhari meri baatein zehreelay is heaviest soundtrack any indian movie so far its wild full energy extremely noisy lyrics are weird interesting part is vocal you can do extreme screaming when you sing english but when it comes hindi its different ball game it is tough sing so loud extreme that too with perfect vocals hindi simply hell yeah pichhle saat dinon is song that grows you later you cant live without song is so popular that they have made spl video it ye tumhari meri baatein is beautiful song with tinge jazz it it will make you feel as if it is made you your love another wonderful track is socha hai its like back roots real rock song where lyrics come out no where title soundtrack rock sindbad sailor fir dekhiye are simply outstanding another special song is slow rock ballad tum ho age one song wonder soundtracks rock is surprise package each every song is chart buster fact im now so used listening rock songs where ever i roam office pubs music stores channels radio its every where its like rock music its purest form with strong insistent back beat catchy melody movie is well crafted but plot is not something new its predictable movie you know exactly what will happen next also dialogs dont have that punch like songs its theme i like farhan akhtar as director singer actor but excluding his voice i do not know why but some how he is not that great when he talks there are so many well crafted scenes that had lit up this movie my favorite scene is where magik performs at local society raise money i will not reveal much it but i just couldnt stop laughing like mad while watching it also scene where magik performs at music contest then fights with each other split its sheer delight as director sketched those scenes brilliantly rock truly justifies its title with some heavy dope rocking music acting more important its simplicity movie which will make you happy while coming out movie screen with message all know matter what may come keep rocking,0.5783098845598845,0.21165524290524296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Dil Chahta Hain meets Jhankaar Beats,"Ode to Dil Chahta Hain:: √ Farhan Akhtar plays an extended version of Akash.√ Arjun Rampal reprises Sid.√ Turn Dimple Kapadia into a male character and add them into a trio  voila, you have DCH of four! √ The misunderstanding/ breakup.√ The final moments before the credits rolls.√ The past narrated in flashback.Well, one should appreciate the makers were honest to admit publicly that the movie was DCH Part Deux.Performances:: √ Farhan Akhtar:: He doesn't falter a bit and delivers an eye-opener performance in terms of the subtle nuances and body language he bring in. Of course, his distinct voice is his his greatest asset. Hindsight, he should have done ""Lucky"" in Main Hoon Na, at least the role would have been more memorable.√ Arjun Rampal:: Probably first time one would take notice of his performance as it is very matured and restrained. Lets hope it does what DCH did to Akshaye Khanna.√ Purab Kohli, Luke Kenny & Shahana Goswami:: Should capitalise on the success of the movie to get a strong foothold in Bollywood. Good performances otherwise.√ Prachi Desai is good in her ""Miss Goody Two Shoes"" role. BTW  why was her character a bit pushy towards male bonding? √ Koel Purie is as usual OK.Too many flashbacks hinder the narrative.

8.0,Finally... Rock Hits Bollywood!,"Sure, sure. There has been numerous attempts at adapting the greatest music genre of all time into the Hindi arena; at getting rock music to blend in with Indian songs. But while some attempts were partly successful, most of them were as ridiculous as dressing up an elephant in a ballerina costume and expecting a successful ballet.While some original Indian songs (yes, there ARE original un-plagiarized Hindi songs...) have had their own charm about it, it seemed completely alien to the tone and touch that embodies rock. But this movie brings with it some of the first successful merges between the two giant. The ballerina costume doesn't look out of place at all ;) Since I've started out with the songs, let me get a few things clarified first. The lyrics are eclectic. Sporadic, random yet not gibberish. It could have been better, but it's NOT bad at all per se. But the music, and Farhan Akhtar's voice and compelling screen presence all build the songs to a well deserve hype.Performances were amazing. No ham acting, no glitzy deviations, no bullshit It was a honest and down to earth approach, and I, for one, applaud the trend in Bollywood. The plot was simple enough - for a while, it felt like the sequel to 'That Thing You Do' - and it was delivered very powerfully. I have to make a special mention about the cinematography. It was awesome. It used the restricted depth of field approach in several shots, and yet did not give a feeling that it was overused.At this point, I should probably mention something about me. The last Hindi movie I really liked was Taare Zameen Par the one before that was Dil Chahta Hai, and the one before that was probably Mr. India. So you should understand that I am typically not generous with praises for Bollywood. So when I say Rock On rocked on, it means something.Now's the time to nitpick. And here on, there's gonna be some spoilers. This basically means that if you HAVEN'T watched the movie yet, you should probably throw a rock at the monitor, cover your eyes, and jump behind the couch over there so that you get to enjoy the movie properly when you DO see it. Alternatively, you can use this time to actually go get the tickets and hop in a theater seat with popcorn. When you return, you'll be well equipped to read the rest of this article.The plot was smooth, except for a few things that detracted my attention. Firstly, the big fight  What was that all about? For guys who are all that pally with each other, the situation had NOT developed into such a state as to demand a ten year hiatus. They took a guy fight and treated it like a darned girl fight.You know what I mean Except for certain really extreme lines getting crossed (such as stealing each other's make up or not) guys get over such fights after two days and a mug of beer. And while I can understand that Farhan Akhtar has a short temper, it's still a far stretch to imagine that when one of his closest friends hit him, he just packs up and leaves music and starts over a new life...?? The build up to the fight kept implying that it was something huge... We were dropped hints of Farhan betraying friends, great ego clashes building up, and something mysterious that was so sinister that everything turned topsy turvy after the fight. And the fight actually didn't give anything on that scale. OK, things were turning sour, Farhan was starting to build an ego, sure.. but it was just starting... I expected something AT LEAST as heated as the band split in 'That Thing You Do'.... The lead singer was ACTUALLY building an ego.... starting to feel he carried the entire weight of the band, and that the rest didn't really matter, etc etc... Nothing like that happened here. It seemed so out of character, so out of place.But... remember what I said.. These are just nitpicks... Even with this bump on the road, the movie was nothing short of brilliant.",finally rock hits bollywood,sure sure there has been numerous attempts at adapting greatest music genre all time into hindi arena at getting rock music blend with indian songs but while some attempts were partly successful most them were as ridiculous as dressing up elephant ballerina costume expecting successful ballet while some original indian songs yes there are original un plagiarized hindi songs have had their own charm about it it seemed completely alien tone touch that embodies rock but this movie brings with it some first successful merges between two giant ballerina costume doesnt look out place at all since ive started out with songs let me get few things clarified first lyrics are eclectic sporadic random yet not gibberish it could have been better but its not bad at all per se but music farhan akhtars voice compelling screen presence all build songs well deserve hype performances were amazing no ham acting no glitzy deviations no bullshit it was honest down earth approach i one applaud trend bollywood plot was simple enough while it felt like sequel that thing you do it was delivered very powerfully i have make special mention about cinematography it was awesome it used restricted depth field approach several shots yet did not give feeling that it was overused at this point i should probably mention something about me last hindi movie i really liked was taare zameen par one before that was dil chahta hai one before that was probably mr india so you should understand that i am typically not generous with praises bollywood so when i say rock rocked it means something nows time nitpick here theres gonna be some spoilers this basically means that if you havent watched movie yet you should probably throw rock at monitor cover your eyes jump behind couch over there so that you get enjoy movie properly when you do see it alternatively you can use this time actually go get tickets hop theater seat with popcorn when you return youll be well equipped read rest this article plot was smooth except few things that detracted my attention firstly big fight what was that all about guys who are all that pally with each other situation had not developed into such state as demand ten year hiatus they took guy fight treated it like darned girl fight you know what i mean except certain really extreme lines getting crossed such as stealing each others make up or not guys get over such fights after two days mug beer while i can understand that farhan akhtar has short temper its still far stretch imagine that when one his closest friends hit him he just packs up leaves music starts over new life build up fight kept implying that it was something huge we were dropped hints farhan betraying friends great ego clashes building up something mysterious that was so sinister that everything turned topsy turvy after fight fight actually didnt give anything that scale ok things were turning sour farhan was starting build ego sure but it was just starting i expected something at least as heated as band split that thing you do lead singer was actually building ego starting feel he carried entire weight band that rest didnt really matter etc etc nothing like that happened here it seemed so out character so out place but remember what i said these are just nitpicks even with this bump road movie was nothing short brilliant,0.5506611251402919,0.1698574535032868,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
5.0,Not as rocking as expected,"For the most part, ""Rock On!!"", though engagingly realistic and well-acted, is not a particularly rocking movie. Considering it's about a rock band, the film is fairly slow and at times even tedious. There is some depressing feel to it although the viewer may clearly feel the light in the end of a tunnel will certainly come at some point. What I really liked about this film, however, is the portrayal of relationships. I think it was very well done, and it was the film's best-depicted aspect. It was actually the main aspect which pushed the otherwise unmovable narrative forward. The film's concept is interesting, but not really new or unused. It's neither intriguing nor unpredictable.The performances are good in this order: Shahana Goswami is mind-blowing as Debbie. She is an excellent actress with a very natural and intense style and a particularly forceful dialogue delivery. This clearly is the best performance of the film. Arjun Rampal's is the best performance among the male cast, and he is thoroughly convincing in a role that is essentially a very passive one. Prachi Desai acts very well and she is vulnerable and convincing throughout the film. Farhan Akhtar makes a good debut, nothing outstanding though. He is a bit wooden in some scenes, but otherwise okay, and he actually sings very well. Purab Kohli is effective but does not really get that much of a scope.""Rock On!!"" is a one-time watch for me. It has its moments, it has good acting, the music is excellent, but the story is not very well executed. I felt there was much more to show and much more to tell about the rock band. It is done quite realistically and does not go over the top, but it has its share of clichés, unreasonable coincidences and ancient emotions, which neither move nor impress. Nevertheless, I liked the rather positive ending, which in spite of its predictability was quite efficient. The final verdict is above average according to me. I expected something else, but it's just me, watch it and make your own conclusions.",not as rocking as expected,most part rock though engagingly realistic well acted is not particularly rocking movie considering its about rock band film is fairly slow at times even tedious there is some depressing feel it although viewer may clearly feel light end tunnel will certainly come at some point what i really liked about this film however is portrayal relationships i think it was very well done it was films best depicted aspect it was actually main aspect which pushed otherwise unmovable narrative forward films concept is interesting but not really new or unused its neither intriguing nor unpredictable performances are good this order shahana goswami is mind blowing as debbie she is excellent actress with very natural intense style particularly forceful dialogue delivery this clearly is best performance film arjun rampals is best performance among male cast he is thoroughly convincing role that is essentially very passive one prachi desai acts very well she is vulnerable convincing throughout film farhan akhtar makes good debut nothing outstanding though he is bit wooden some scenes but otherwise okay he actually sings very well purab kohli is effective but does not really get that much scope rock is one time watch me it has its moments it has good acting music is excellent but story is not very well executed i felt there was much more show much more tell about rock band it is done quite realistically does not go over top but it has its share clich s unreasonable coincidences ancient emotions which neither move nor impress nevertheless i liked rather positive ending which spite its predictability was quite efficient final verdict is above average according me i expected something else but its just me watch it make your own conclusions,0.520057319223986,0.2648773448773448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.21}"
7.0,Rock with some Blue,"The basic idea of the movie is just as 'Dil Chahta Hai'- a fight between two friends and their reunion(But here there's' much more after the that). Let me clear first: THE SONGS ARE AWESOME 10/10.Very nicely directed, the film has slow pace in the first half and the story may confuse some, as there are a lot of flashbacks. some unwanted characters too included. But the second half has the perfect speed and will cling you to the seats. the whole idea of ROCK ON!! gets concentrated here, no stupid incidences, no unwanted scenes-perfect The only thing which i didn't like was the reunion of MAGIK (not as great as it should be- could be much grand) Talking about performances- everyone does a great Job, special mention for Luke Kenny and Purab Kohli. Prachi Desai (cant say a newcomer, been in daily soaps) looks lovely, acts well. Farhan has surely some thing for Singing. The songs sound genuine as are sung by Farhan than some professional singer. Lots of light moments throughout the film, wonderfully shot. The end is wonderful.... you will probably guess the end, but it will turn out much greater.For hardcore ROCK fans, don't expect NIRVANA, GREENDAY, or DEEP PURLPE, its bollywood ROCKYou will surely come out of the theatre with smiles- thats for sure.",rock with some blue,basic idea movie is just as dil chahta hai fight between two friends their reunion but here theres much more after that let me clear first songs are awesome 10 10 very nicely directed film has slow pace first half story may confuse some as there are lot flashbacks some unwanted characters too included but second half has perfect speed will cling you seats whole idea rock gets concentrated here no stupid incidences no unwanted scenes perfect only thing which i didnt like was reunion magik not as great as it should be could be much grand talking about performances everyone does great job special mention luke kenny purab kohli prachi desai cant say newcomer been daily soaps looks lovely acts well farhan has surely some thing singing songs sound genuine as are sung by farhan than some professional singer lots light moments throughout film wonderfully shot end is wonderful you will probably guess end but it will turn out much greater hardcore rock fans dont expect nirvana greenday or deep purlpe its bollywood rockyou will surely come out theatre with smiles thats sure,0.5881302521008404,0.385406162464986,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Rock On carries forward the legacy of Dil Chahta Hai,"First of all, I have to tell you that Farhan Akhtar is a ROCKSTAR !!! Man what films he has made till date - DCH, Lakshya and now this one. Along with Farhan, Abhishek Kapoor(whose first film Arryan didn't do too well) too has done a great job as a director. Though I could make out a few goofs, but considering the fact that I was so engrossed in the movie, they can be overlooked.The rest of the cast is excellent. Arjum Rampal for a change is so much better than his earlier performances. But, I still feel he could have done better. Prachi Desai gives a SMASHING performance. So much depth in her character and boy-o-boy, did she play it well. Purab was such a refreshing element throughout. He's completely lovable.Now, for the music. I'm so proud to hear the first mainstream Rock album of India. And I'm glad they have not messed up the songs and have kept the raw, college boy feel to all the songs. Even the slow tracks(2 of them) are so soothing. Brilliant album. Kudos to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy.Finally, Rock On is really fresh film, if not a classic. Technically its not 10/10 but just for the EQ(emotional quotient) I give it a 10.But, for lovers of mature drama and emotions, it'll be a treat. Thank you Farhan, Abhishek etc. etc. for such a refreshing change.

8.0,Could usher in the start of a new bollywood genre....Excellent and Enjoyable!!!!,"Farhan Akhtar has done it again! Rock On is an excellent movie and one that I would definitely would not mind watching again, in fact I am definitely going to go again. Just like how Dil Chahta Hai started a new movement in Indian cinema, I am sure that now, more projects of the same type will start coming out of the woodwork. I just hope that they can measure upto the quality of Rock On.The casting was good and the ensemble cast gave great performances. Purab kohli, Luke and Arjun Rampal were all good although Arjun Rampal was still a bit stiff with the guitar in hand. On the other hand Farhan looked like an absolute natural playing the guitar, he had excellent stage presence as the lead singer. As for the heroines, Suhana and Prachi were good although I quite liked the former, she has striking looks and has pretty good acting chops. Hope to see more of her in the future.Farhan Akhtar was excellent, in my opinion he has given a subtle but pitch perfect performance that was very natural. It should put several veterans of the big screen to shame......I won't name any names but just imagine some of our existing Bollywood heroes hamming it up on stage and compare them with the Farhan performance.The music was excellent. How good does it feel to look at an actor actually singing his own songs........so much more real and I am sure that it helped Farhan to take his performance to new heights. Akhtar's singing wasn't perfect but it had the raw quality which went well with the overall feel and theme of the movie. SEL & javed Akhtar also deserve their plaudits. I don't see why people were complaining about the music.Abhishek the director has to be given a lot of credit for the final product, which although has a lot of clichés still manages to hold our attention and makes us root for his characters. Well done.....hope he will not come up with a damp squib after this.Farhan Akhtar has become one of the few film personalities in Indian cinema whose name has become synonymous with high quality films. When I see Farhan Akhtar's name attached to a product either as a director or a producer then I would definitely make the time to see the film as I would in the case of Hollywood names such as Steven Spielberg or a Denzel Washington. Fine, he is not in the same league yet but now that Farhan has added the acting feather to his cap we can expect high quality output from him as an actor as well as as a director and a producer.",could usher start new bollywood genre excellent enjoyable,farhan akhtar has done it again rock is excellent movie one that i would definitely would not mind watching again fact i am definitely going go again just like how dil chahta hai started new movement indian cinema i am sure that now more projects same type will start coming out woodwork i just hope that they can measure upto quality rock casting was good ensemble cast gave great performances purab kohli luke arjun rampal were all good although arjun rampal was still bit stiff with guitar hand other hand farhan looked like absolute natural playing guitar he had excellent stage presence as lead singer as heroines suhana prachi were good although i quite liked former she has striking looks has pretty good acting chops hope see more her future farhan akhtar was excellent my opinion he has given subtle but pitch perfect performance that was very natural it should put several veterans big screen shame i wont name any names but just imagine some our existing bollywood heroes hamming it up stage compare them with farhan performance music was excellent how good does it feel look at actor actually singing his own songs so much more real i am sure that it helped farhan take his performance new heights akhtars singing wasnt perfect but it had raw quality which went well with overall feel theme movie sel javed akhtar also deserve their plaudits i dont see why people were complaining about music abhishek director has be given lot credit final product which although has lot clich s still manages hold our attention makes us root his characters well done hope he will not come up with damp squib after this farhan akhtar has become one few film personalities indian cinema whose name has become synonymous with high quality films when i see farhan akhtars name attached product either as director or producer then i would definitely make time see film as i would case hollywood names such as steven spielberg or denzel washington fine he is not same league yet but now that farhan has added acting feather his cap we can expect high quality output him as actor as well as as director producer,0.5541166098858407,0.3263917172571019,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.46}"
7.0,The band decides to get back together...and one of them is hiding a BIG secret.,"""Rock On!!"" is an Indian film about a group of guys who made up a rock/pop band a decade ago. The film begins in the present day and the lead singer of this group, Magik, is now a very successful businessman. He's so wrapped up in his job that he pushes his wife out of his life. She doesn't even know about this past life--and only stumbles upon his being in a band by accident. However, when she does, she contacts his other band mates and tries to get them back together. But Aditya isn't grateful--instead he treats his old friends like they are a part of the past he'd like to keep in the past. Can Aditya come around and finally open up his heart to these guys? And, he's not the only one with problems. Joe loves music and never left the music business...but his wife is a serious detriment and seems bent on squashing his dream. And then there is one other member with a serious problem...one you only learn about late in the film. Can all these problems be worked out so that Magik can once again find the magic?This film is different from a typical Bollywood film because it's clearly targeted towards a younger and hipper sort of audience. This isn't a complaint---just an observation. I really like the style in which the story was told and the story is enjoyable. The only negatives I noticed are that the story seemed a bit predictable and only offered one big surprise. The other wasn't the fault of the original production but the DVD had serious issues. Instead of playing properly, often the film would play a portion and when it came to the next segment, it would bounce back to the scene menu! This is very odd and I've never had it happen before.By the way, if you do watch the film, watch Joe when he plays guitar. Every time he does, a hidden wind machine catches his hair and it's actually unintentionally funny.",band decides get back together one them is hiding big secret,rock is indian film about group guys who made up rock pop band decade ago film begins present day lead singer this group magik is now very successful businessman hes so wrapped up his job that he pushes his wife out his life she doesnt even know about this past life only stumbles upon his being band by accident however when she does she contacts his other band mates tries get them back together but aditya isnt grateful instead he treats his old friends like they are part past hed like keep past can aditya come around finally open up his heart these guys hes not only one with problems joe loves music never left music business but his wife is serious detriment seems bent squashing his dream then there is one other member with serious problem one you only learn about late film can all these problems be worked out so that magik can once again find magic this film is different typical bollywood film because its clearly targeted towards younger hipper sort audience this isnt complaint just observation i really like style which story was told story is enjoyable only negatives i noticed are that story seemed bit predictable only offered one big surprise other wasnt fault original production but dvd had serious issues instead playing properly often film would play portion when it came next segment it would bounce back scene menu this is very odd ive never had it happen before by way if you do watch film watch joe when he plays guitar every time he does hidden wind machine catches his hair its actually unintentionally funny,0.4434108527131783,-0.02267441860465116,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"

,"Move On, No Rocking In This One","Abhishek Kapoor's 'Rock On!' is definitely an improvement when compared to his directorial debut 'Aryan' which was a 'Rocky' plus 'other boxing movies' ripoff. But, as a film itself, 'Rock On' struggles to be just strictly average. It's not a movie I would be willing to revisit. After discussing this movie with a friend, we agreed that 'Rock On' is a half-baked product. The story is too clichéd and predictable that I easily lost interest. For example, killing off the Rob character because he has no girlfriend. The rockband Magik is comprised of a typical Bollywood group of friends where Rob is the one who the audience shouldn't give much of a damn about, Joe the quiet one, KD the 'virgin' wooing the women without much luck and Aditya, the 'main one'. The characters just aren't interesting. The ending is laughably bad.Moreover, there are just too many plot holes that irritated me. Since we're all supposed to believe that these guys are so passionate about music, why do they give up just after one fight? So the band dismembered but they could have pursued their own individual career. Only, Joe is seen to be struggling with his career in music but that too is apparently because 'he's no good in anything else'. Why does Aditya dump his girlfriend? If he wanted to break all ties with Magik, such that he'd dump his girlfriend through a note, why keep the photos etc?On the technical side, it's not so bad. I liked the jump cuts. The background score and cinematography are alright. For a movie about rock, well, the music isn't rocking at all. I wonder what kind of the drugs the lyricist when writing those truly abysmal lyrics. The songs lack soul and energy.The performances are a mixture. Shahana Goswami performs well and for a newcomer Prachi Desai is good too. Despite of having a clichéd role, Purab Kohli is perhaps the best of the male cast. Luke Kenny is adequate. Arjun Rampal is passable. Farhan Akhtar looks confused and is wooden at times.Overall, 'Rock On' has nothing new to offer. It's not exactly a terrible film but I'll put it somewhere between average and below average. It's overrated. This movie just does not rock.",move no rocking this one,abhishek kapoors rock is definitely improvement when compared his directorial debut aryan which was rocky plus other boxing movies ripoff but as film itself rock struggles be just strictly average its not movie i would be willing revisit after discussing this movie with friend we agreed that rock is half baked product story is too clich d predictable that i easily lost interest example killing off rob character because he has no girlfriend rockband magik is comprised typical bollywood group friends where rob is one who audience shouldnt give much damn about joe quiet one kd virgin wooing women without much luck aditya main one characters just arent interesting ending is laughably bad moreover there are just too many plot holes that irritated me since were all supposed believe that these guys are so passionate about music why do they give up just after one fight so band dismembered but they could have pursued their own individual career only joe is seen be struggling with his career music but that too is apparently because hes no good anything else why does aditya dump his girlfriend if he wanted break all ties with magik such that hed dump his girlfriend through note why keep photos etc technical side its not so bad i liked jump cuts background score cinematography are alright movie about rock well music isnt rocking at all i wonder what kind drugs lyricist when writing those truly abysmal lyrics songs lack soul energy performances are mixture shahana goswami performs well newcomer prachi desai is good too despite having clich d role purab kohli is perhaps best male cast luke kenny is adequate arjun rampal is passable farhan akhtar looks confused is wooden at times overall rock has nothing new offer its not exactly terrible film but ill put it somewhere between average below average its overrated this movie just does not rock,0.5056020733652312,0.07793062200956939,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Our dreams can be fulfilled. Let's believe in them.,"The way some goals are so worthy that it's glorious even to fail, the same way some dreams are so lovely that even when they are not turning into reality, we should live them and allow them to live in us. And to the extent possible, we should pursue our dreams which are positive for us and negative for none. That's what is the message of Rock On (2008).Rock On tells the story of four friends who had dreamed to make it big in the world of music when in their early twenties - 1. Aaditya Shroff aka Aadi (Farhaan Akhtar), 2. Joseph Mascarenhaas aka Joe (Arjun Raampaal), 3. Kedar Zhaveri aka Killer Drummer aka KD (Poorab Kohli), 4. Robert Nancy aka Rob (Luke Kenny). They participated in a contest whose prize an opportunity to make own music album. These foursome known as Magic won the contest and then set to get own music album recorded. But the so-called practical world is populated less by the innocent dreamers like them and more by the manipulators who occupy chairs of power and authority to dictate terms to them despite not having an ounce of worthiness for that. And the truly deserving, talented ones have to listen to them and follow their dictates because the moment of time is on their side. These youngsters also had to endure everything and swallow all the bitter pills thrown at them by the chair-holders who controlled the resources. Aadi being more practical and adjusting digested everything so that the way towards the arrival of their first ever music album is paved. However Joe being a short-tempered man of self-respect fell prey to the irritating situation, leading to end of everything for these dreamers including their association.A decade has passed. Now these four friends are no longer a foursome. Each one of them is leading or struggling in his individual life. Aadi and KD are leading their lives which are comfortable though not internally satisfying whereas Joe and Rob are still struggling in the lines chosen or forced on them to make both ends meet. Aadi is a successful investment banker and happily married with Saakshi (Praachi Desaai) who feels that her husband has been hiding something as high and heavy as a mountain in his heart, not allowing herself to see it. He attempts to appear as happy but his inner reality is something else. She does not know that her husband is carrying the burden of a broken dream within him. KD is associated with his father's jewellery business being out of alternatives for himself. Rob is still struggling in the world of music and keeps in touch with Bollywood composer - Anu Malik. The most pathetic situation is that of Joe who has been fortunate enough to marry the love of his life - Debbie (Shahaana Goswami) but the struggle to make both ends meet for the family moves from day to day. Joe who wanted to be a great violinist is forced to sing here and there to get some money whereas Debbie who had dreamed with Joe to become a fashion-designer is taking care of the small scale fish business of his family which is the only main source of income for them.Fate makes KD meet Saakshi and then Saakshi comes to know of the bygone era containing the shattered dreams of the foursome. She tries to bring the separated friends together again and her success in this regard not only rekindle the hopes of the friends to do something worthwhile in the world of music but also bridges the decade old rift between Aadi and Joe. Debbie, being too much concerned with the poverty-stricken condition of their household arranges an overseas job for Joe but destiny has other plans. The magic band is revived but when it is about to take the stage for the second opportunity given to it by fate, Joe has to board the ship and Rob has to face death (because he has been suffering from a fatal illness for long). The climax takes place on a highly emotional note and when the movie is over, the viewer feels a throbbing in his / her heart.Rock On is a movie with its heart in the right place. It's a movie with a soul. Despite certain flaws here and there and the fact that the musical score of a movie based on a rock band should have been far superior to that of this movie, let me say loud and clear that Rock On is a superb movie. Very few mainstream movies are made in India with this level of sincerity. It's a movie of dreams. It's a movie of relationships. It's a movie of determination. It's a movie of survival in the cruel world.The style of narration is simply mindblowing. Cutting the narrative back and forth in the past as well as the present without even a drop of confusion, deserves lots of applause. All the principal actors have done superbly. I choose Shahaana Goswami as the best performer and Arjun Raampaal after her. But others are no less. Even supporting ones like Koel Purie (Saakshi's friend whom KD falls for) and Nicollette Bird (the ex-girlfriend of Aadi) have done complete justice to their roles.Rock On is a must watch for every dreamer. Fulfillment of dreams depends on certain external factors too and everybody is not fortunate to have his / her dream fulfilled. However our dreams are our babies. Let's not abandon them. Even when unfulfilled, they have given us a lot and hence they deserve to be cherished in our hearts. And if still there is a scope to make our dreams to be turned into reality, let's believe that it can be done.",our dreams can be fulfilled lets believe them,way some goals are so worthy that its glorious even fail same way some dreams are so lovely that even when they are not turning into reality we should live them allow them live us extent possible we should pursue our dreams which are positive us negative none thats what is message rock 2008 rock tells story four friends who had dreamed make it big world music when their early twenties 1 aaditya shroff aka aadi farhaan akhtar 2 joseph mascarenhaas aka joe arjun raampaal 3 kedar zhaveri aka killer drummer aka kd poorab kohli 4 robert nancy aka rob luke kenny they participated contest whose prize opportunity make own music album these foursome known as magic won contest then set get own music album recorded but so called practical world is populated less by innocent dreamers like them more by manipulators who occupy chairs power authority dictate terms them despite not having ounce worthiness that truly deserving talented ones have listen them follow their dictates because moment time is their side these youngsters also had endure everything swallow all bitter pills thrown at them by chair holders who controlled resources aadi being more practical adjusting digested everything so that way towards arrival their first ever music album is paved however joe being short tempered man self respect fell prey irritating situation leading end everything these dreamers including their association decade has passed now these four friends are no longer foursome each one them is leading or struggling his individual life aadi kd are leading their lives which are comfortable though not internally satisfying whereas joe rob are still struggling lines chosen or forced them make both ends meet aadi is successful investment banker happily married with saakshi praachi desaai who feels that her husband has been hiding something as high heavy as mountain his heart not allowing herself see it he attempts appear as happy but his inner reality is something else she does not know that her husband is carrying burden broken dream within him kd is associated with his fathers jewellery business being out alternatives himself rob is still struggling world music keeps touch with bollywood composer anu malik most pathetic situation is that joe who has been fortunate enough marry love his life debbie shahaana goswami but struggle make both ends meet family moves day day joe who wanted be great violinist is forced sing here there get some money whereas debbie who had dreamed with joe become fashion designer is taking care small scale fish business his family which is only main source income them fate makes kd meet saakshi then saakshi comes know bygone era containing shattered dreams foursome she tries bring separated friends together again her success this regard not only rekindle hopes friends do something worthwhile world music but also bridges decade old rift between aadi joe debbie being too much concerned with poverty stricken condition their household arranges overseas job joe but destiny has other plans magic band is revived but when it is about take stage second opportunity given it by fate joe has board ship rob has face death because he has been suffering fatal illness long climax takes place highly emotional note when movie is over viewer feels throbbing his her heart rock is movie with its heart right place its movie with soul despite certain flaws here there fact that musical score movie based rock band should have been far superior that this movie let me say loud clear that rock is superb movie very few mainstream movies are made india with this level sincerity its movie dreams its movie relationships its movie determination its movie survival cruel world style narration is simply mindblowing cutting narrative back forth past as well as present without even drop confusion deserves lots applause all principal actors have done superbly i choose shahaana goswami as best performer arjun raampaal after her but others are no less even supporting ones like koel purie saakshis friend whom kd falls nicollette bird ex girlfriend aadi have done complete justice their roles rock is must watch every dreamer fulfillment dreams depends certain external factors too everybody is not fortunate have his her dream fulfilled however our dreams are our babies lets not abandon them even when unfulfilled they have given us lot hence they deserve be cherished our hearts if still there is scope make our dreams be turned into reality lets believe that it can be done,0.5322932763439091,0.13805003013863773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8.0,The Next Step by the Young Brigade,"You may not feel the way you felt after watching ""Dil Chahta Hai"" but you are sure to feel good and contented to have something new on the Indian Celluloid. ""Rock On"" may not be a trend setter but it will surely act as a path opener for the budding film-makers.Rock mania or Rock style of living have very limited takers in our part of the world. And that might be the reason the director doesn't follow the hardcore rock styles but opts for a soft rock feel in the movie. But he does a fine and competent job, shifting from his acting to directing a movie he believed in. Abhishek Kapoor comes up with a movie which has a fresh appeal, a perfect script with perfect character sketches which are capable to hold even the viewers who don't know what ""Rock"" is. It's about four friends and their rock band called ""Magik"", their struggle to make it big, their break up and then their re-union after a gap of 10 years. Apart from the direction, the revelation comes from the acting department as almost every person in the movie has given a soulful and energetic performance, highly enjoyable and entertaining.Purab Kohli as the Killer Drummer of the band comes up with a lovable and superlative act with his own unique comic touches. Luke Kenny as the keyboard player surprisingly gives a controlled & subtle performance, which is really appreciable. Arjun Rampal gives the best shot of his career, as the lead guitarist and he is surely going to surprise people who called him wooden faced. Critics would find it tough to criticize him this time around.And now the man who was way above the expectations, Farhan Akhtar. Before seeing the movie I was having the opinion that Farhan has just tried one movie for fun and he was only satisfying his passion for music and singing with this opportunity which came his way. But he proved me wrong. Farhan is hugely impressive and convincing in his act of the lead singer of the band. He acts easily with no hassles at all and he is exactly like he was seen in the reality shows he judged. You may feel as he is your friend next door, having mood swings like we all have and nothing filmy at all.The icing on the cake is the raw voice structure he has and his singing style. It seems that he simply doesn't care about the details to be taken care of while singing. He sings brilliantly, screams at places, goes out of tune somewhere but he simply remains himself. And that's the beauty of his un-comparable and fantastic realistic approach. At times he looks arrogant but that's how his character is in the script. On the whole, with this fine attempt Farhan moves miles ahead in his career and would surely win many more fans than he had as a director.Prachi Desai gives an impressive and lovable debut performance. She is sure to go places as she works harder on her looks and styling. Koel Puri in her short role is sweet. Every other supporting actor in the movie provides the required strength to the narrative and is worth praising. Director Abhishek Kapoor raises the bar of expectations and now his next venture will be highly awaited.The movie is very close to being perfect with only few point of the minus side. Firstly, there is no Bass (Base) Guitarist in the band, who is considered as the backbone of a Rock Band. But that is only for the people who know the Band Requirements, otherwise this can be ignored. The only point where it lacked something is its music and lyrics. A musical movie with a rock background certainly needed more good & hummable songs with some more youthful and energetic lyrics. The concert song ""Laundry Ka Bill"" is good but the ""Slow Love Song"" lacked the depth. You don't remember any particular song from this musical movie while walking out. The only thing you remember is the surprising Farhan Akhtar act and to some may be Prachi Desai.In my opinion as ""Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy"" also have a good & healthy relationship with ""Vishal-Shekhar"". They could have brought Vishal in, as he has the experience of being the lead singer of a rock band and has performed in the rock concerts for several years. May be he could contribute in the score and helped.But keeping these thoughts aside, ""Rock On"" is a new and fresh experience for our Indian Viewers. It is a must watch for every youngster as it teaches the importance of your passions in life and the strength of a good team. It will give you power to follow your own paths and be responsible for them.",next step by young brigade,you may not feel way you felt after watching dil chahta hai but you are sure feel good contented have something new indian celluloid rock may not be trend setter but it will surely act as path opener budding film makers rock mania or rock style living have very limited takers our part world that might be reason director doesnt follow hardcore rock styles but opts soft rock feel movie but he does fine competent job shifting his acting directing movie he believed abhishek kapoor comes up with movie which has fresh appeal perfect script with perfect character sketches which are capable hold even viewers who dont know what rock is its about four friends their rock band called magik their struggle make it big their break up then their re union after gap 10 years apart direction revelation comes acting department as almost every person movie has given soulful energetic performance highly enjoyable entertaining purab kohli as killer drummer band comes up with lovable superlative act with his own unique comic touches luke kenny as keyboard player surprisingly gives controlled subtle performance which is really appreciable arjun rampal gives best shot his career as lead guitarist he is surely going surprise people who called him wooden faced critics would find it tough criticize him this time around now man who was way above expectations farhan akhtar before seeing movie i was having opinion that farhan has just tried one movie fun he was only satisfying his passion music singing with this opportunity which came his way but he proved me wrong farhan is hugely impressive convincing his act lead singer band he acts easily with no hassles at all he is exactly like he was seen reality shows he judged you may feel as he is your friend next door having mood swings like we all have nothing filmy at all icing cake is raw voice structure he has his singing style it seems that he simply doesnt care about details be taken care while singing he sings brilliantly screams at places goes out tune somewhere but he simply remains himself thats beauty his un comparable fantastic realistic approach at times he looks arrogant but thats how his character is script whole with this fine attempt farhan moves miles ahead his career would surely win many more fans than he had as director prachi desai gives impressive lovable debut performance she is sure go places as she works harder her looks styling koel puri her short role is sweet every other supporting actor movie provides required strength narrative is worth praising director abhishek kapoor raises bar expectations now his next venture will be highly awaited movie is very close being perfect with only few point minus side firstly there is no bass base guitarist band who is considered as backbone rock band but that is only people who know band requirements otherwise this can be ignored only point where it lacked something is its music lyrics musical movie with rock background certainly needed more good hummable songs with some more youthful energetic lyrics concert song laundry ka bill is good but slow love song lacked depth you dont remember any particular song this musical movie while walking out only thing you remember is surprising farhan akhtar act some may be prachi desai my opinion as shankar ehsaan loy also have good healthy relationship with vishal shekhar they could have brought vishal as he has experience being lead singer rock band has performed rock concerts several years may be he could contribute score helped but keeping these thoughts aside rock is new fresh experience our indian viewers it is must watch every youngster as it teaches importance your passions life strength good team it will give you power follow your own paths be responsible them,0.5199573350625982,0.28501225674909886,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.45}"

7.0,Doesn't Disappoint!!!,"Just came back from the first day, first show screening of this film! I must say that, due to all the pre-release hype and going by the excellent (and a very original) music score achieved by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, I had very high expectations. To say that I'm a little disappointed won't be wrong but hey! Rock On!! isn't a bad movie! In fact, its far from it. Director Abhishek Kapoor (Aryan) does a fine job donning the director's cap but one can't help but see the influence that Farhan the director must've had on the movie for there are scenes which have his typical trademark style! Well, honestly when the end product is a movie like Rock On!!, I couldn't be bothered more by who's directed it and who's credited for it.The story of Rock On is all about following your dreams and, as the tagline says: Living it! Now coming to the story, its about four friends: Aditya (Akhtar), Joe (Rampal), Rob (Kenny) and KD (Kohli) and their band that they choose to call ""Magick"". Their struggle to follow and accomplish their dream of making it big with ""Magick"". Cut to present day, Aditya is a businessman, Rob works under Anu Malik (yeah! watch out for the cameo by Malik lol, also look out for Javed Akhtar in the movie..... you'll be surprised to find him there, and where!! lol again!), KD does a job and Rampal runs a music shop and gives guitar lessons to kids. What caused the band to break up and will these guys get back to pursue their dreams again is what forms the rest of the story.To say that Rock On!! succeeds in reminding you of Dil Chahta Hai in parts, of your schooling / college days, of the good old times that you shared with your friends, of the rare innocence you had when you started out would be nothing but describing the strong points of the film. There'd be parts where I'd feel ""ditto"" coz I've been there, done that... so have all of us at some point of time or the other.Talking about the strong points of the films, well, there's more that needs to be written about! In terms of performances, this is, undoubtedly, Rampal's film. No other character has been more well defined or better performed as Rampal's Joe Mascarenhas. The scenes in which he emotes some of the feelings that his character goes through are the the high-points of the film. Oh, and btw, that's a sexed-out Santana look that Rampal carries and pulls off with panache. Watch out for him during the climax-- he steals almost every scene that he's in! Following Rampal is debutante-actor / singer, Mr. Versatile, you make Mr. Javed Akhtar proud with almost everything that you do! Farhan Akhtar gives an impressive performance and its hard to tell that this is his first (keeping in mind that The Fakir of Venice is yet to be released). Of course, the lisps and his cracked-up voice are some of the biggest flaws that Akhtar needs to work on. Surprisingly, its the same husky voice that works to his advantage as a singer. I don't know whether SEL worked on his voice in music editing softwares to get the desired results but truth be told, he sounds amazing, at least on record he does! In terms of whether Akhtar has a very bright future as an actor or not, is hard to tell just basing it on one film but if I had to go with my intution and understanding of the industry, I'd say that Akhtar the actor doesn't have a very long life span (no complaints about his performances at all! Just a word of what I feel). Prachi Desai, Purab Kohli, Bird and Luke Kenny provide apt support and all the four cast members mentioned here manage to stand their own ground, in short- impressive performances! Now coming to the music, there is nothing I could say or write that would justify the brilliance of the job done by S-E-L. Truly truly different soundtrack after such a long time. In fact, its the soundtrack which made me want to watch the film on the first place. Javed Akhtar matches the trio at every step of excellence that they tread. Its tough to point out a single favorite in an album that so many. Tum Ho To is according to me, the best-sung track by Mr. F. Akhtar in this collection of musical gems. A clever move on SEL and Akhtar's part, taking the theme music of Lakshya and making a Rock On title track out of it that truly rocks, way to go!! Zahreelay, of course, in terms of lyrics, composition, and performance is the most hatke track of the album! Listen to it carefully and you'll realise it has genius written all over it. Finally we have our first Hindi Metal number!!! Phir Dekhiye is another very, very beautiful track. Socha Hai has been my callertune for a month now--- need I say more? And of course, Pichle Saat Dino Mein: the track that soooooo defines one's life in the early years! Yeh Tumhari Meri Baatein sort of reminds me of a track that SEL had delivered in one of their earlier flicks, Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai but then, who's complaining?? In fact, to seal it, it wouldn't be wrong to say that this is Akhtar-SEL-Akhtar's greatest album to have released since Dil Chahta Hai and that is, a very bold statement but true!",doesnt disappoint,just came back first day first show screening this film i must say that due all pre release hype going by excellent very original music score achieved by shankar ehsaan loy i had very high expectations say that im little disappointed wont be wrong but hey rock isnt bad movie fact its far it director abhishek kapoor aryan does fine job donning directors cap but one cant help but see influence that farhan director mustve had movie there are scenes which have his typical trademark style well honestly when end product is movie like rock i couldnt be bothered more by whos directed it whos credited it story rock is all about following your dreams as tagline says living it now coming story its about four friends aditya akhtar joe rampal rob kenny kd kohli their band that they choose call magick their struggle follow accomplish their dream making it big with magick cut present day aditya is businessman rob works under anu malik yeah watch out cameo by malik lol also look out javed akhtar movie youll be surprised find him there where lol again kd does job rampal runs music shop gives guitar lessons kids what caused band break up will these guys get back pursue their dreams again is what forms rest story say that rock succeeds reminding you dil chahta hai parts your schooling college days good old times that you shared with your friends rare innocence you had when you started out would be nothing but describing strong points film thered be parts where id feel ditto coz ive been there done that so have all us at some point time or other talking about strong points films well theres more that needs be written about terms performances this is undoubtedly rampals film no other character has been more well defined or better performed as rampals joe mascarenhas scenes which he emotes some feelings that his character goes through are high points film oh btw thats sexed out santana look that rampal carries pulls off with panache watch out him during climax he steals almost every scene that hes following rampal is debutante actor singer mr versatile you make mr javed akhtar proud with almost everything that you do farhan akhtar gives impressive performance its hard tell that this is his first keeping mind that fakir venice is yet be released course lisps his cracked up voice are some biggest flaws that akhtar needs work surprisingly its same husky voice that works his advantage as singer i dont know whether sel worked his voice music editing softwares get desired results but truth be told he sounds amazing at least record he does terms whether akhtar has very bright future as actor or not is hard tell just basing it one film but if i had go with my intution understanding industry id say that akhtar actor doesnt have very long life span no complaints about his performances at all just word what i feel prachi desai purab kohli bird luke kenny provide apt support all four cast members mentioned here manage stand their own ground short impressive performances now coming music there is nothing i could say or write that would justify brilliance job done by s e l truly truly different soundtrack after such long time fact its soundtrack which made me want watch film first place javed akhtar matches trio at every step excellence that they tread its tough point out single favorite album that so many tum ho is according me best sung track by mr f akhtar this collection musical gems clever move sel akhtars part taking theme music lakshya making rock title track out it that truly rocks way go zahreelay course terms lyrics composition performance is most hatke track album listen it carefully youll realise it has genius written all over it finally we have our first hindi metal number phir dekhiye is another very very beautiful track socha hai has been my callertune month now need i say more course pichle saat dino mein track that soooooo defines ones life early years yeh tumhari meri baatein sort reminds me track that sel had delivered one their earlier flicks yeh kya ho raha hai but then whos complaining fact seal it it wouldnt be wrong say that this is akhtar sel akhtars greatest album have released since dil chahta hai that is very bold statement but true,0.5725726984126983,0.2439802116402117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8.0,A new and high point in Bollywood film-making...,"Starting up a rock band by the name of Magik, four friends have the dream of shooting to stardom with their rock music. When this dream never sees the light of day, the band split and has little contact with each other member. After 10 years, their lives become interwoven once more and the decision is made to attempt to reunite the bonds of the past.The story is presented in an intriguing fashion jumping from the past to the present at will, but it never becomes distracting. This change goes to compliment the film in many ways. Not only does it make the viewing more interesting, but it helps to better understand the emotional and mental struggles of the main characters. The two most notable are Aditiya (Farhan Akhtar) and Joe (Arjun Rampal), with the former leading a prosperous life as a business man while the latter is barely able to make ends meet. The film is relatively easy to understand throughout but that doesn't mean it lacks the depth. There is a great sense of duality and confliction which arises as the film evolves. However the film can be seen to be a tad optimistic about certain factors of life, though it is nothing detrimental to the film as a whole, especially when the film has some melancholic moments. There is also a factor overlooked in the story: when the band attempts to reunite it appears to have no effect on the busy lives of those involved in the business world, notably Aditiya, with a similar social problem only affecting Joe.There is a minor problem in regards to the English subtitling whereby spoken English is incorrectly subtitled, at one point even changing what was said entirely, though it was an unimportant scene of dialogue.On the acting side, the actors perform quite well. Rock On!! marks Akhtar's acting debut after success with script writing and directing, and he adds another skill to his growing list of talents, even that of singing. He is well suited with strong presence next to Rampal who plays a more delicate role. They both play off one another extremely well and the chemistry between both shows whether in normal interaction or when the band is performing on stage. But this is not to say that both remain constant opposites of one another, for both have these subtle moments when they reverse characteristics, but it so dependent on the situation and goes to show the complex structure of the characters themselves, with character development being apparent, though perhaps not as much as one would hope. The remainder of the cast aids both main actors successfully creating a very believable context for the film.The core highlight of Rock On!! is its musical score. It you enjoyed the snippet provided by the preview then you are bound to enjoy listening to an array of exhilarating track, complimented with a couple of slower pieces which allows for added variety. No matter what track is being played Rock On!! presents one of the most consistent soundtracks to grace a Bollywood film in a while. Also the production values are absolutely amazing for a Bollywood film. Rock on!! does not feel like a foreign Bollywood film at all, with the whole film feeling like a mid-to-high production Hollywood film. This is achieved with some masterful directing by Abhishek Kapoor with every scene, especially when Magick performs their music, seeming well calculated. However this does not stop Kapoor choosing some strange and rather unnecessary direction for certain scenes but this is thankfully very rare.In what has been an up-and-down year for Bollywood blockbusters, Rock On!! amazingly is able to remain one string above most of the rest. There is very little to fault beyond the simple story and questionable cinematographic decisions.

Aditya, the rich kid and ""creative rebel"", is the poet, lyricist, and lead vocalist of the band. Tortured soul Joe Mascarenhas is the lead guitarist. Rob is the wise and gentle keyboard player, while wacky KD (short for Killer Drummer) is the madcap drummer. They enjoy rock-star status at the college level, but dream of achieving true stardom with tours and lucrative recording contracts. However when they get their big chance of playing at a rock contest and win a coveted record contract, the dream sours and the group breaks up.Ten years later, some of them have fared better than others: Adi, now a successful investment banker, has a plush office and a vast apartment that, at current Bombay real estate rates, must have cost an obscene packet. He has a pretty wife, newly pregnant, and a promotion, so one would think he is happy. But something remains amiss. Joe lives only for the music and cannot bring himself to go into the family fish business. His wife Debbie grows increasingly frustrated at his unwillingness to contribute to the family income. In the carefree days of youth, she had harbored fashion designer aspirations, but settles for handling the business end of the Mascarenhas family fish business. Rob, wise to the ways of the world, compromises by becoming a session musician, but at least he keeps on making music. Wild man KD has joined his father's jewelery business, and, predictably, derives no joy from it.When circumstances bring the friends together again, Magik is re-formed, but to what end? Does each member find artistic satisfaction? Does life regain meaning and joy? It is not for me to elaborate further.The story is not original. It has been done in Western cinema several times before. Rob Reiner's hilarious ""This is Spinal Tap"" mined the comedic vein, while Canadian Bruce MacDonald's ""Hard Core Logo"" took a grittier look at young rebels who never grow up. ""The Thing That You Do!"", directed by Tom Hanks, is another example that comes to mind. However, this marks the first time such a story has been filmed in an urban Indian milieu, and done extremely well, at that.Abhishek Kapoor, who wrote and directed, insisted that whoever played the Adi character would have to sing his own songs, and Farhan Akhtar astonishes with both his performance and his singing. Farhan's Adi possesses credible rocker snarls and growls and, in a tender ballad, completely disarms with a sure sweet falsetto. Kapoor decreed that the other band members, too, should actually be able to play their musical instruments, and it pays off handsomely. I thought the Farhan Akhtar-directed ""Dil Chahta Hai"" was a perfect film, save for one flaw: he killed off the Dimple Kapadia character. It would have been more realistic if he had the Dimple character smack Sid and say, ""Snap out of it, buddy! Go find a playmate your own age!"" And Sid could have continued on his quest for true love, sadder but so much wiser. Instead poor Dimple was made to wear horrible makeup in her hospital scene, serve as a plot point to reunite the estranged friends, and die an undignified death. She deserved a rich, sensitive, good-looking, and age-appropriate new husband or boyfriend and to live happily from then on. Otherwise, it was a splendid film, and an impressive directorial debut. It is magnificent to see Farhan Akhtar branching out as an actor and singer, but we also hope he continues to devise smart films like ""Dil Chahta Hai"". Abhishek Kapoor, a one-time actor, has helmed with enormous sensitivity this story of five artistic souls (I include Joe's wife Debbie in this number), and extracted fine performances from each of his players. Arjun Rampal's Joe is a bravura piece of acting; he goes from reckless rocker to a man increasingly beaten down by life, with nothing left but his integrity. When Joe lets his long hair loose at the end and plays a stunning guitar solo, he is finally at peace, rejoicing at doing the one thing he does well. Luke Kenny as Rob and Purab Kohli as KD, are similarly first-rate. I have not seen their work before, and hope more good opportunities come their way, for they are both wonderful natural talents. The women play supporting parts with grace and dignity. I loved Shahana Goswami's Debbie, whose prickly exterior conceals her vulnerability and disappointment. She remains a fighter despite knowing failure, and is both fiercely protective of and infuriated by her impractical spouse. Prachi Desai and Koel Purie do well too, especially Prachi, as Adi's wife Sakshi, who becomes the catalyst for the band's reunion.Jason West's cinematography is superb; he scores most with his footage of the rock concerts, capturing every bit of the kinetic frenzy and euphoria of such events. Shankar Ehsan Loy's aptly rambunctious music is the soul of the film, while Javed Akhtar's lyrics brim over with youthful irreverence and joie-de-vivre. The editing is just right for this sort of film, moving at a swift clip, yet holding still at emotionally important moments. But will it play in Peoria, or more relevantly, Pondicherry or Patna? Perhaps not, but I am certain it will triumph in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, and maybe even New York, Berlin, and London, for like ""Dil Chahta Hai"", this is a film for city folknothing wrong with that.To Abhishek Kapoor, I say bravo, and rock on!",rock ages,rock is tale quartet rock musicians their band named magik aditya rich kid creative rebel is poet lyricist lead vocalist band
