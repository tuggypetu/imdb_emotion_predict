9,One of the good films this year. Can we have a sequel ?,"Firstly, this is not one of the regular stereotypical stupid movies telugu industry churns out with their family members just because they own the production houses and take the movie goers for fools.Its good to see someone who had genuinely tried to do something different. Don't let the low budget fool you, its been used well.Agree, its a mix of Kingsman, Mission impossible series with a mix of James bond and Jason Bourne series but the story is still strong and stands apart. Thankfully the movie cuts back on irrelevant nonsensical songs and fights. Movie is fast paced and sometimes predictable on few occasions but not all the time. Sadly, in a year there are only a handful of movies (YES its less than 10) that are good in Telugu as most are hyped and lack substance and include some irritable songs. I am rating it a 9 as this movie is good given the budget, cast and the limited release. Of course this movie also has its own loopholes (dont want to include spoilers) but they can be overlooked due to the strong story line and screenplay while intertwining it with a love story. This movie is a game changer and a trend setter. Kudos to the team.

7,"The father of all Indian Spy/Agent Dramas. Beats out popular mainstream films like Thupakki, Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai and War BY MARGIN.","Goodachari (2018) : Brief Review -The father of all Indian Spy/Agent Dramas. Beats out popular mainstream films like Thupakki, Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai and War BY MARGIN. Adivi Sesh is some genius to look out for excellent writing. I wonder, how this guy hasn't got pan India recognition after doing so great in thriller genre. 'Kshanam', 'Evaru' and now this 'Goodachari' is my 3rd watch and all three are excellent thrillers with some unpredictable twists. Goodachari is more in mainstream category because all these spy drama need some mass oriented action to survive. Similarly like Kshanam, Goodachari also drives you mad with consistent twists coming one after another and all of them are in entertaining mode. I mean it's not a pure thriller with full of suspense and dark theme, it's very much like a massy flick with some advanced level designing. A young NSA agent is framed for the murder of his bosses making him realize that now his mission is darker than expected and has some personal scores to settle regarding his father's death, a former NSA agent. The film keeps you hooked for the whole time and even delivers some gasping moments with breathtaking sequences. If you have seen other popular spy/agent dramas like Thupakki, Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai and War then believe me this film is far better than all those. Goodachari is something what our filmmakers only dream of making but never dares to play with such mess due to fear of commercial failure and then makes an average film only for commercial purposes. Writing level of Goodachari matches even Hollywood greats like James Bond and Mission Impossible series but execution wise it is not that stylish and smart. But for Indian standards, it's far more superior than what our masses have seen and loved so far. I just wish if evey Indian Spy/Agent Drama should be like this and then even Classes would freak out for such films. Overall, a Fantastic Film for Masses and Classes both.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",father all indian spy agent dramas beats out popular mainstream films like thupakki ek tha tiger tiger zinda hai war by margin,goodachari 2018 brief review father all indian spy agent dramas beats out popular mainstream films like thupakki ek tha tiger tiger zinda hai war by margin adivi sesh is some genius look out excellent writing i wonder how this guy hasnt got pan india recognition after doing so great thriller genre kshanam evaru now this goodachari is my 3rd watch all three are excellent thrillers with some unpredictable twists goodachari is more mainstream category because all these spy drama need some mass oriented action survive similarly like kshanam goodachari also drives you mad with consistent twists coming one after another all them are entertaining mode i mean its not pure thriller with full suspense dark theme its very much like massy flick with some advanced level designing young nsa agent is framed murder his bosses making him realize that now his mission is darker than expected has some personal scores settle regarding his fathers death former nsa agent film keeps you hooked whole time even delivers some gasping moments with breathtaking sequences if you have seen other popular spy agent dramas like thupakki ek tha tiger tiger zinda hai war then believe me this film is far better than all those goodachari is something what our filmmakers only dream making but never dares play with such mess due fear commercial failure then makes average film only commercial purposes writing level goodachari matches even hollywood greats like james bond mission impossible series but execution wise it is not that stylish smart but indian standards its far more superior than what our masses have seen loved so far i just wish if evey indian spy agent drama should be like this then even classes would freak out such films overall fantastic film masses classes both rating 7 5 10 by,0.5882096171802054,0.19126750700280107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"

4,"Lot of Style, Little Substance and Lot of Plotholes.","I feel bad for Sashi Kiran Tikka(Director). He made a pretty decent looking spy thriller. But the writer's love fro the protagonist ruins Goodachari. Now let's get into logic less instances in the script. Arjun/Gopi applies 174 times to all the agencies for a chance. When he uses his real father's name in the 175th attempt, he gets selected. Wait, what?Arjun's greatest dream is to serve the country. And he starts acting all childish after getting selected into Trinethra. He gets framed for murder. The killer leaves his bike(registered in Arjun's name) and a gun with Arjun's fingerprints. Arjun is a super-spy, remember? What kind of intelligent spy would do something that stupid? Sameera played by Sobhita Dhulipala is the usual hero's love interest. Leena who is another spy who got the same training as Arjun can't even defeat one guy while Arjun is fighting off a group of terrorists. And Arjun has to come back from beating all those terrorists to save Leena. Rakesh Varre is the cliche Muslim patriot who sacrifices his life for the country. Arjun has to confront Vennala Kishore's character who's traitor. This scene was only there so that the viewers gets an explanation about the leaks from the agency.Anyway, despite all these flaws, Goodachari is 1000 times better than Saaho.",lot style little substance lot plotholes,i feel bad sashi kiran tikka director he made pretty decent looking spy thriller but writers love fro protagonist ruins goodachari now lets get into logic less instances script arjun gopi applies 174 times all agencies chance when he uses his real fathers name 175th attempt he gets selected wait what arjuns greatest dream is serve country he starts acting all childish after getting selected into trinethra he gets framed murder killer leaves his bike registered arjuns name gun with arjuns fingerprints arjun is super spy remember what kind intelligent spy would do something that stupid sameera played by sobhita dhulipala is usual heros love interest leena who is another spy who got same training as arjun cant even defeat one guy while arjun is fighting off group terrorists arjun has come back beating all those terrorists save leena rakesh varre is cliche muslim patriot who sacrifices his life country arjun has confront vennala kishores character whos traitor this scene was only there so that viewers gets explanation about leaks agency anyway despite all these flaws goodachari is 1000 times better than saaho,0.5591269841269841,0.11408730158730161,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.26}"

4,A Masala spy triller !!,"Goodachari really works for mainstream audiences who are used to the Song-Dance- comedy-love story routine as the movie gives them something ""different"". It should be appreciated the fact that Goodachari is a valiant ""attempt"" to break the monotony of the formula driven Telugu cinema. The concept and the story is really good for South Indian cinema.But Goodachari shows its set flaws in a terribly written screenplay filled almost entirely with huge logical loopholes. Action scenes and comical firefights and operations reminds that, this is what we get in Indian masala movie time and again. Production design falters big time as the sets of the intelligence agency's offices and training centres are almost laughable. Casting was rudimentary and so on. Acting levels are par to levels expected from a regular masala cinema.But Goodachari has its moments to impress and it does very well in certain parts. Yes it is a top class new age Telugu cinema but the ""making"" restricts it to a certain class of audiences.

5,Good attempt,"The first half was pretty much Kingsman, then the second half does remind a bit of Mission Impossible series and the evident homage to James Bond through 116 by changing single digit to either side was a nice touch.

6,Goodachaari is nothing but a cinemaholic attempt to remake all his favorite scenes from famous spy films.,"Goodachaari (2018):Adivi Sesh's intention of changing Tollywood with rarely attempted genres is commendable attempt. His previous outing Kshanam was a mystery thriller and now his new film Goodachaari is a spy thriller. Even with not so eye grabbing promos, Goodachari has good buzz only because of Kshanam. Audience waited for another unique experience and Did Sesh achieved it?Plot:Arjun (Adivi Sesh) gets recruited into a spy organization after repeated applying for the job. He is inducted into Trinetra, a secret service bureau that recruits him for a mission. He soon becomes an agent.On the very first day as an agent, a minister gets killed, his girlfriend (Sobhita) is killed and all fingers point out that he's behind this. He is on the run to find out who the mole in Trinetra is and who actually killed his father in his childhood. As he goes on the mission, many secrets come out.My Review:Adivi Sesh's intention is good of bringing change in Tollywood is good but it would be lot better if he chose new subjects other than inspired works like these. While Kshanam is taken from Flight Plan, Goodachaari is taken from almost all the famous spy films like MI, Kingsman etc..There is nothing wrong with taking points from other works until or unless you focus on content. Kshanam is amazing with good thrill and emotions in right places but Goodachaari is too fake and tried hardly to look as an effective Mission Impossible of India. Goodachaari is too dragging, bland and sometimes confused.Sesh's character desires to join in Spy Group but once he gets place in it he starts behaving like regular college kid with silly antics and behavior. There is not a single scene in the film where we feel the suspense. It is too bland and boring. A couple of things we expect to find in spy-thrillers are suspense and characters with intelligent minds. When coveted plans are revealed that should make us go 'Oh boy! I didn't see that coming.' But in Goodachari characters that seem to lack common sense and logical thinking.Shockingly production values didn't impress. ENtire pre climax and climax were shot in some bad locations outskirts of city but shown as Bangladesh. Cinematography, Music are poor compared to Kshanam.SO,Goodachaari is nothing but a cinemaholic attempt to remake all his favorite scenes from famous spy films.My Rating 5.75/10",goodachaari is nothing but cinemaholic attempt remake all his favorite scenes famous spy films,goodachaari 2018 adivi seshs intention changing tollywood with rarely attempted genres is commendable attempt his previous outing kshanam was mystery thriller now his new film goodachaari is spy thriller even with not so eye grabbing promos goodachari has good buzz only because kshanam audience waited another unique experience did sesh achieved it plot arjun adivi sesh gets recruited into spy organization after repeated applying job he is inducted into trinetra secret service bureau that recruits him mission he soon becomes agent very first day as agent minister gets killed his girlfriend sobhita is killed all fingers point out that hes behind this he is run find out who mole trinetra is who actually killed his father his childhood as he goes mission many secrets come out my review adivi seshs intention is good bringing change tollywood is good but it would be lot better if he chose new subjects other than inspired works like these while kshanam is taken flight plan goodachaari is taken almost all famous spy films like mi kingsman etc there is nothing wrong with taking points other works until or unless you focus content kshanam is amazing with good thrill emotions right places but goodachaari is too fake tried hardly look as effective mission impossible india goodachaari is too dragging bland sometimes confused seshs character desires join spy group but once he gets place it he starts behaving like regular college kid with silly antics behavior there is not single scene film where we feel suspense it is too bland boring couple things we expect find spy thrillers are suspense characters with intelligent minds when coveted plans are revealed that should make us go oh boy i didnt see that coming but goodachari characters that seem lack common sense logical thinking shockingly production values didnt impress entire pre climax climax were shot some bad locations outskirts city but shown as bangladesh cinematography music are poor compared kshanam so goodachaari is nothing but cinemaholic attempt remake all his favorite scenes famous spy films my rating 5 75 10,0.6458916083916084,0.0377352719744024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.26}"
