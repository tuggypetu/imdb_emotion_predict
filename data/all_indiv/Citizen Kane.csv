,"CITIZEN KANE may let some people down, but it's still worth seeing.","It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE. Not because it's ""too old"" or ""too boring"", but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made. And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.This isn't to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant. From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn't a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.CITIZEN KANE's storyline is deceptively simple. Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of. The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating. Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp. As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on. And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense. To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.But no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one's expectations. Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time.",citizen kane may let some people down but its still worth seeing,its difficult undertaking someone my generation watch film like citizen kane not because its too old or too boring but because it has been hailed almost universally as single best motion picture ever made while anticipation seeing film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating actually watching it is ultimately intimidating somewhat disappointing experience this isnt say that i thought citizen kane was bad film fact i thought everything about it was downright brilliant enchanting performances right down meticulously planned camera movements clever lighting tricks there isnt single element citizen kane that isnt stunning achievement all areas filmmaking citizen kanes storyline is deceptively simple even though plot unfolds by jumping out nonlinear flashbacks it is surprisingly easy keep track straightforwardness relatively fast pace story are what make it seem intimidating because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill it feels like we are being fooled like there is something much greater that we just cant seem grasp as first time viewer i knew its reputation that there must be something that separates this movie all others something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen but that i just could not seem get handle then during those final frames that something was revealed it all began make sense me it was these moments confusion uncertainty followed by sense enlightenment appreciation that made watching citizen kane such meaningful experience but no matter how great movie citizen kane really is it can never live up ones expectations although i do feel that it is deserving its acclamation constant exposure its six decades worth hype praise will invariably set most modern viewers standards at height that is virtually unreachable even if it really is best movie all time,0.5411884411884413,0.1798349798349798,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,"A great piece of cinema, a magnificent example of storytelling","I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10",great piece cinema magnificent example storytelling,ive heard so much told about citizen kane orson welles so i finally decided get film find out if it really is all that its cracked up be i must say its great plot is great way its told is amazing story is first summed up matter minutes about 15 be more accurate then rest film has characters telling story through flashbacks retelling we hear just about every opinion about charles foster kane apart his own story is told after his death we see everything important that leads up it only very end do we understand him only then do we fully understand who he was what made him so ending also reveals one very most important things any man or woman one thing that everyone needs knows i wont reveal it here as it would almost be crime spoil experience this film anyone acting is excellent welles himself is stellar as kane his impressive appearance along with his commanding voice makes character forceful sight nay experience characters are well written credible character kane is probably most well rounded perfectly built up ive seen movie ever cinematography is excellent editing is great i cant praise angles pans zooms transitions enough it just has be experienced now one thing i can criticize film pacing its only two hours long but it feels like much much more there were portions film where it felt like it didnt move at all when there werent great dialog or something equally as good film it dragged terribly there were too many scenes where dialog seemed pointless as well i think it didnt seem be leading anything however this criticism is so minor due ending more than making up it that i still give this film perfect score i cant do anything but agree with its placing at top top films all time here imdb as im writing this its thats pretty much what it deserves my opinion not higher not lower not greatest film all time that pretty much still belongs godfather i think at least i havent seen better film than that yet but definitely far up there i recommend this any fan film general anyone who thinks they can understand it it has truly profound point that any man woman should know preferably through seeing film themselves dont let fact that its old black white deter you seeing this masterpiece true cinematic masterpiece every sense word 10 10,0.6385593220338984,0.32316384180790964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
7.0,Giant of its field,"Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?I ponder this because I don't think I fully get Citizen Kane, or if I even can get it without a degree in history. Back in its days, the film was widely applauded for its groundbreaking style and its cinematographic feats. Orson Welles put himself on the map by pulling off tricks and visuals that had never been seen before. He also based the story of one Charles Foster Kane on a real life business tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a polarizing figure back then, thus tying the film to the days of its release.And I view this film and I must admit that it didn't blow me away. The cinematography is brilliant and impressive, but I've seen most of the tricks already in newer films, and thus their impact is lessened. And while it's an interesting character study about the meaning of contentment, wealth and American ideals, I was left with the impression that I was missing something. And I think it's that I have no real life parallels to compare this film to. Especially seeing as I'm not an American.Is it still a good film? Oh, definitely. It's a pioneer of its field, its themes are very deep, it's beautiful on the technical level and even the story, while rather slow, does keep you interested through the capturing presence of Welles' acting. I do recommend seeing it, though I must admit that I respect it more than I like it.",giant its field,any art becomes harder appreciate as time passes we look at statues paintings lets say ancient greece we appreciate them their aesthetic their style craftsmanship that went into making them yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made were they political their time like art often is nowadays or were they made simply feed artist like some greatest works art history have sometimes been made if we somehow found out that painting human figure some prehistoric cave was actually political satire rival clan chief would it add value work i ponder this because i dont think i fully get citizen kane or if i even can get it without degree history back its days film was widely applauded its groundbreaking style its cinematographic feats orson welles put himself map by pulling off tricks visuals that had never been seen before he also based story one charles foster kane real life business tycoon william randolph hearst polarizing figure back then thus tying film days its release i view this film i must admit that it didnt blow me away cinematography is brilliant impressive but ive seen most tricks already newer films thus their impact is lessened while its interesting character study about meaning contentment wealth american ideals i was left with impression that i was missing something i think its that i have no real life parallels compare this film especially seeing as im not american is it still good film oh definitely its pioneer its field its themes are very deep its beautiful technical level even story while rather slow does keep you interested through capturing presence welles acting i do recommend seeing it though i must admit that i respect it more than i like it,0.4024884792626728,0.1727822580645161,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,All That Ballyhoo!,"On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic ""Citizen Kane"" there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, ""Citizen Kane"" is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of ""Rosebud""-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.From a technical standpoint, Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that ""Citizen Kane"" will always stand the test of time.However, the story of ""Citizen Kane"" remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man"" or even more recently, ""There Will Be Blood."" Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood). There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His ""Citizen Kane"" is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed.",all that ballyhoo,criterion collection dvd orson welles classic citizen kane there is original theatrical trailer where welles cleverly advertises film by introducing us cast including chorus girls whom he refers as some nice ballyhoo that pretty much sums up my opinion often over analyzed film that always shows up at top list greatest films ever made even though this was first time i sat down watch film as whole i knew everything about it studying it film class countless number essays homages parodies that have come down pike over years it seems impossible now judge film against blank slate but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny released 1941 by rko as mercury theater production citizen kane is tale influential shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon welles inspired by life william randolph hearst story follows investigation into origins rosebud mysterious word kane utters his deathbed following newsreel footage announcing kanes death we are then thrust into series flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew kane that reveal nature his character technical standpoint welles film is as innovative engrossing today as it was yesterday every single piece cinematic trickery every dissolve every long tracking shot every seamless edit every play with chronology every special effect is perfect welles was audacious inventive with his art it is these technical aspects that citizen kane will always stand test time however story citizen kane remains cold distant i didnt instantly connect with characters plot way i did with other classics period like casablanca or third man or even more recently there will be blood often supporting players over act flashbacks are tedious especially one detailing kanes second marriage or emotionless like scene showing kanes snow covered childhood theres certain smug arrogance whole production that makes it seem like perhaps welles was secretly making comedy it leaves one wondering how it wouldve come across had welles actually been allowed do straight up biopic hearst is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as all time great much todays cinema is geared towards style technique over substance way back 1941 welles was first author this very modern brand cinema where art is not story but how it is told shown audience his citizen kane is technically rich layered enthralling but narratively vapid did i ever really care about kane or rosebud no but it was fascinating watch its some very nice ballyhoo indeed,0.5097208994708995,0.18617592592592586,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,An Expert On What People Will Think,"The problem with writing about a film like Citizen Kane is that with 809 previous comments on the boards here, there is little that hasn't been said already. The best you can do is not look at any others and express your own thoughts your own way.I've always felt the real reason that William Randolph Hearst so bitterly resented Orson Welles's masterpiece is that it got really too close to his own soul for him to be easy. Most folks who talk about Citizen Kane go for the obvious target, Welles's depiction of Marion Davies (Susan Alexander) as a no talent gold digger. In fact Welles himself in later years said he thought he was unfair to Davies then in Dorothy Comingore's performance. What Welles showed in Charles Foster Kane was the insincerity of his beliefs. The key line in Citizen Kane I've always thought was what Joseph Cotten said that his friend Charlie Kane had a lot of opinions, but didn't believe any of them. To this day serious biographers of Hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when the day was done.Citizen Kane came up with a host of Oscar nominations, but only took home one award for original screenplay for Welles and Herman Mankiewicz. Original it certainly was in concept and execution.The role that was written by Welles and Mankiewicz and directed by Welles for Welles is one of the greatest roles ever written for any film actor. The technique of Citizen Kane is always discussed, the flashbacks told from many points of view for the audience to get a grasp of what the title character was all about. What's not discussed is Welles himself.What he does in fact is give several performances of the same man in one film. Welles reinterprets Kane five or six times depending on whose flashback we're seeing. He's a scared child being taken from his parents, he's a rich frat boy and incorrigible scamp as seen by George Couloris the J.P. Morgan like banker, he's an idealist and crusader as seen by his business manager Everette Sloane, a man with no core set of beliefs who will do anything to bend the public to approval by his closest and maybe his only real friend Joseph Cotten, a lonely man with a compulsion for real love by Dorothy Comingore, and as an aging tyrant by butler Paul Stewart. Welles makes every one of these Kanes come alive and each relates to the other.The names of all those I've mentioned in the cast before were from Welles's Mercury Theater Company, nearly all went on to substantial movie careers. Others from the cast who did are Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Erskine Sanford. I don't think any other film comes close to introducing so many talented players to the screen.The film begins with the aged Kane's death and that single word 'Rosebud' which sends everyone scrambling to find out just what he had on his mind in his final moments on earth. Those searching never do find out, but you the audience does and the unveiling of Charles Foster Kane's inner soul is something once seen and never forgotten.",expert what people will think,problem with writing about film like citizen kane is that with 809 previous comments boards here there is little that hasnt been said already best you can do is not look at any others express your own thoughts your own way ive always felt real reason that william randolph hearst so bitterly resented orson welless masterpiece is that it got really too close his own soul him be easy most folks who talk about citizen kane go obvious target welless depiction marion davies susan alexander as no talent gold digger fact welles himself later years said he thought he was unfair davies then dorothy comingores performance what welles showed charles foster kane was insincerity his beliefs key line citizen kane ive always thought was what joseph cotten said that his friend charlie kane had lot opinions but didnt believe any them this day serious biographers hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when day was done citizen kane came up with host oscar nominations but only took home one award original screenplay welles herman mankiewicz original it certainly was concept execution role that was written by welles mankiewicz directed by welles welles is one greatest roles ever written any film actor technique citizen kane is always discussed flashbacks told many points view audience get grasp what title character was all about whats not discussed is welles himself what he does fact is give several performances same man one film welles reinterprets kane five or six times depending whose flashback were seeing hes scared child being taken his parents hes rich frat boy incorrigible scamp as seen by george couloris j p morgan like banker hes idealist crusader as seen by his business manager everette sloane man with no core set beliefs who will do anything bend public approval by his closest maybe his only real friend joseph cotten lonely man with compulsion real love by dorothy comingore as aging tyrant by butler paul stewart welles makes every one these kanes come alive each relates other names all those ive mentioned cast before were welless mercury theater company nearly all went substantial movie careers others cast who did are ray collins agnes moorehead ruth warrick erskine sanford i dont think any other film comes close introducing so many talented players screen film begins with aged kanes death that single word rosebud which sends everyone scrambling find out just what he had his mind his final moments earth those searching never do find out but you audience does unveiling charles foster kanes inner soul is something once seen never forgotten,0.5575783972125434,0.1893583042973287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,"Why Is ""Citizen Kane"" the Best Film of All Times?","Anyone who sees ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it ""for what it is,"" so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: ""it was okay."" This will not do. It is a great tragedy if ""Citizen Kane"" suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" or Beethoven's ""9th Symphony"". In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why ""Citizen Kane"" necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and ""Citizen Kane""?One might begin with the basic fact that ""Citizen Kane"" wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"", and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, ""Citizen Kane"" was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that ""everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'."" Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of ""Citizen Kane"" is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in ""Citizen Kane"". The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- ""Rosebud"" -- by interviewing people who knew the man. ""It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing,"" he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' ""Oedipus Rex"" as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of ""Citizen Kane"" lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of ""Citizen Kane"" and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. ""Citizen Kane"" is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-scène since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of ""Citizen Kane"" are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, ""Citizen Kane"" remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.",why is citizen kane best film all times,anyone who sees citizen kane 1941 first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is greatest film ever made one simply doesnt come

6.0,Wonderful Cinematography,"If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, ""Citizen Kane"" is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.The film's B&W cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette, creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film, frame compositions are clever and interesting, like one scene in the second half wherein a woman, with her back to the camera, blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see, amid murky, shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions, as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene, for example, background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows, we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared, and that renders the character small, by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu, with a fireplace that appears average in size, until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example, in the Great Hall, the cavernous, mostly empty, room strongly echoes human sounds, creating the impression of some huge, dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.But the film's story, about a corpulent newspaper tycoon, is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout, he is egotistical, overbearing, bombastic, loud, and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions, but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist, the script's dialogue is very talky.The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and, when combined with lots of stock footage, create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.Some viewers love this film; others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects, but loathe the story. ""Citizen Kane"" should have won several Oscars, including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt, and to compensate, they routinely vote the film as ""the number one greatest film in history"".But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem, but well deserved, Oscars, especially for B&W cinematography.

,The march of time...,"Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble. It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories. The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized. At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains. Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity. Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death. The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently destructive of human values. Kane himself states `If I hadn't been born rich I might have been a really great man.What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore). Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man. This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar. Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time. He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions, he broke all the rules. The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations. A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another. Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made. Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film. When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target. Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane. It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music. Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams, obsessions and fears. Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century",march time,citizen kane is majestic elegant noble it begins at end we see man obvious wealth power breathe his last then mysteries his life are unraveled via series anecdotes barely remembered scenes highly subjective memories boldness this approach cannot be overemphasized at time that this film was made hollywood was most part used creating straight forward stories with clearly identified heroes villains kane dared present man as he is rife with confusions internal contradictions uncertainty as film progressed we see kane loosely based william randolph hearst famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals order build his financial empire losing his friendships with those who believed him until ultimately he looses everything he has his marriage his friends his integrity though he is richest man world he lives his remaining isolated his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures alone despairing one senses that he welcomes death film takes view that wealth power are inherently destructive human values kane himself states if i hadnt been born rich i might have been really great man what is so masterful about kane is its ambiguity we never are certain if kane really did believe values that he professed at same time that he sets himself up as above world he longs affection common people this is symbolized by his exploitative patronizing love chorus girl susan alexander dorothy comingore her character is given paper thin characterization only obvious flaw nearly perfect movie orson wells gives bravura performance as kane both identifying with condemning man this film was his first venture into movie making after infamous war worlds radio broadcast that threw america into uproar wells child prodigy had background shakespearian theater offering modernized adaptations classics bold unusual gesture at time he brought that kind sweeping tragic romantic sensibility his first film unconstrained by hollywoods traditions he broke all rules deep focus photography that gives kane its theatrical look was one his innovations mastery sound gained years working radio was another kane is avalanche technical innovation unmatched any other hollywood film despite films pessimistic outlook it is studded by moments joy beauty emotional truth supporting cast characters most them regulars wells mercury theater are also superb joseph cotton is memorable as jed leland kanes close friend who believes him more then he does everet slone is wonderful as kanes would be mentor mr bernstien so many scenes this movie linger forever memory one is left with stirring vision frailty human condition film gives us no easy answers while being fiercely critical many its characters is universal its compassion sympathy this is perhaps most vital ingredient great art kane was one most controversial films ever made hearst offended by his portrayal offered rko small fortune destroy film when that didnt work his newspapers embarked campaign defamation against wells thus proving that films criticism power corruption press were precisely target wells was never given free hand direct how he liked again american cinema was deprived one greatest geniuses adopt it as medium self expression its influence was immediate incalculable mostly unacknowledged film was box office critical failure due hearsts efforts it was not until years later that this film got respect it deserved nowadays there is not one living film director serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by citizen kane its not just masterpiece its creative touchstone course there were other talents at work making kane hermann mankiewiczs efforts script were indispensable bernard hermann composer most famous working with hitchcock provided films beautiful music still film remains most obviously work orson wells veritable hall mirrors reflecting great artists dreams obsessions fears citizen kane is not just one great works cinema it is one greatest artistic creations century,0.5504104491999227,0.22453364179679972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"

I just more admire it rather than adore it, but I completely understand its reputation as a classic. The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed.

10.0,A textbook I would have liked to study in school...,"Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium, and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile, no longer the static device used to merely show faces, and Toland's deep-focus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.Welles himself plays Kane in a remarkable acting performance that requires him to age progressively (which Welles does very convincingly) over the decades. Welles draws significant parallels between Kane and media mogul William Hearst in a statement that probes wealth, power figures and what we perceive as 'truth'.Kane is presented to the audience as an enigma- we never do get a full-bodied portrait of the man, only snippets of highly subjective memories from those who say they ""knew him"". In the newsreel, a montage of images that details Kane's life and eventual decline, a variety of viewpoints are established. He could be both a Fascist and a Communist- a megalomaniac manipulating power to his advantage or, indeed, being manipulated himself. It is ironic that the true meaning of 'Rosebud' is never discovered by the on-screen reporters, just as the true essence of the man Kane is never fully revealed to the audience. What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud', or something he himself is not aware of? Kane is never truly sympathetic, yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him (""If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man""), then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence, and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone (""I am Charles Foster Kane!"") yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness (""I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely""). Kane is ultimately indefinable; a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed, corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah, who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander, a thinly veiled take on Hearst's real-life mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success (For Davies this was dramatic roles in films; her talent lay in comedy). Distinguished actors Moorehead, Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay, one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she ""never gets any fun"" because they ""live in a castle"". The visual portrait is fascinating, with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess, complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge, yet empty, room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here, the sum adds up to perfect- direction, acting, writing, photography and music.The imposing, haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA (filmed the previous year) in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's half-finished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character- grandiose, larger than life, powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled.",textbook i would have liked study school,orson welles citizen kane 1941 was perhaps first american film since silent era fully demonstrate possibilities film medium role camera welles camera is mobile no longer static device used merely show faces tolands deep focus cinematography revolutionary welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions craft work that is now often termed textbook cinema welles himself plays kane remarkable acting performance that requires him age progressively which welles does very convincingly over decades welles draws significant parallels between kane media mogul william hearst statement that probes wealth power figures what we perceive as truth kane is presented audience as enigma we never do get full bodied portrait man only snippets highly subjective memories those who say they knew him newsreel montage images that details kanes life eventual decline variety viewpoints are established he could be both fascist communist megalomaniac manipulating power his advantage or indeed being manipulated himself it is ironic that true meaning rosebud is never discovered by screen reporters just as true essence man kane is never fully revealed audience what is kane searching is it untouched youth innocence symbolized rosebud or something he himself is not aware kane is never truly sympathetic yet he is wholly fascinating he seems lament status power that wealth has given him if i hadnt been very rich than i may have been very great man then buys another load cold statues ornaments his cruel treatment second wife susan alexander his insistence that she train as opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence unwillingness accept defeat kane is willing stand alone i am charles foster kane yet seems crave filler his loneliness i know too many people i guess were both lonely kane is ultimately indefinable jigsaw puzzle that both susan audience struggle piece together into anything whole or real welles used actors his mercury theatre populate this story greed corruption vanity friend close confidant joseph cotten becomes friend observer jebediah who is witness kanes slide into moral decay dorothy cormingmore portrays susan alexander thinly veiled take hearsts real life mistress marion davies she possesses similar honking bronx whine limited talent her masters chosen area success davies this was dramatic roles films her talent lay comedy distinguished actors moorehead sanford sloane also feature support one aspect that is perhaps ignored favor focusing technical innovations is truly amazing screenplay one which offers just as many quotable snippets dialogue as casablanca or all about eve welles understanding soundtrack is often overlooked memorable scene involves bored susan alexander whining kane that she never gets any fun because they live castle visual portrait is fascinating with alexander perched seat as princess complete with tiara her hair echo her words kanes mechanical replies huge yet empty room speaks volumes welles understanding film as sum all parts here sum adds up perfect direction acting writing photography music imposing haunting xanadu is similar hitchcocks manderlay rebecca filmed previous year that mansion operates as both character symbol protagonist kanes half finished palace seems come closest suggesting his character grandiose larger than life powerful yet strangely empty unfulfilled,0.5587420634920636,0.15409613997114002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Citizen Welles,"Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts. The creative innovation and the technical advancements implemented, can be least regarded as incredible and astonishing, for a 1941 movie. The movie pioneered the phenomena of time switching and special effects in the world of cinema.Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and source of inspiration to the film-makers of different era. Citizen Kane is an obituary about a fictitious Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate and a newspaper tycoon. Through this movie, Orson Welles, not only immortalized Charles Foster Kane but also proved his mettle, as a writer, director, actor and most importantly as an auteur. The scenes presented as flashbacks, not only display his versatility as an actor (taking care of the nuances and the subtleties needed to portray the different stages and aspects of Kane's life), but also his story-telling brilliance. Kane's murmuring of the word 'rosebud' at the time of his death and him publicly annihilating his election opponent, Jim Getys, represent the two extremes of human life, the very low and the very high, respectively.The scenes between Welles and Joseph Cotton are an absolute treat to watch, the latter being at his sarcastic best, depicting contrasting emotions of sympathy and disgust towards his childhood friend, owing to the dichotomy that he suffered, simultaneously taking care of his duties as a journalist, and his friendship with Kane. The movie is studded with numerous mesmerizing and unforgettable scenes and moments, which immensely contribute to the apotheosis that it so deservedly enjoys.

7.0,"Essential viewing for fans of classic cinema (along with films like The Godfather, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Babe: Pig in the City).","It's been nearly 80 years since the original release of Citizen Kane and I imagine that any film fan worth their salt already knows the secret behind 'Rosebud', the final word uttered by newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) immediately before popping his clogs. But even if you are well aware of the significance of the word, this classic drama is still a must-see if only because of its status as one of the most important and critically acclaimed films ever made.Somehow, I made it to the ripe old age of 52 without seeing Citizen Kane, but finally popped it in the DVD player to see what all the fuss is about, and while I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece myself (I believe I have very different criteria to most for that accolade), I did enjoy the film, finding it an engaging study of a powerful character, brilliantly portrayed by Welles, who goes convincingly from cocksure youngster with big ideas to an old man with more than a few regrets over the course of two hours.Told through flashbacks recounted by various acquaintances of Kane, to a reporter trying to unravel the meaning of Rosebud, the film flits back and forth through the wealthy man's life: his childhood, when his parents became filthy rich and sent him East to be schooled; his building of a news empire; the Great Depression; his two marriages; a failed political career; and old age, as a recluse in his sprawling Florida mansion, Xanadu. It's a rocky ride through the ups and downs of Kane's life, in which the happiest moments were before a shed load of gold made him one of the richest men in the world (which should be a big clue as to what Rosebud refers, if you've spent your life living under a rock and don't already know).The lack of a gratuitous sex/shower scene, ninjas, barbarians, talking animals, cyborgs, exploding heads and dwarfs mean that Citizen Kane doesn't get full marks from me, but even though it's far removed from my usual fare, I still had a good time (Welles had a great eye for an interesting shot, that's for sure). 7/10 -- glad to have finally ticked it off my list of essential classics.",essential viewing fans classic cinema along with films like godfather 2001 space odyssey babe pig city,its been nearly 80 years since original release citizen kane i imagine that any film fan worth their salt already knows secret behind rosebud final word uttered by newspaper tycoon charles foster kane orson welles immediately before popping his clogs but even if you are well aware significance word this classic drama is still must see if only because its status as one most important critically acclaimed films ever made somehow i made it ripe old age 52 without seeing citizen kane but finally popped it dvd player see what all fuss is about while i wouldnt class it as masterpiece myself i believe i have very different criteria most that accolade i did enjoy film finding it engaging study powerful character brilliantly portrayed by welles who goes convincingly cocksure youngster with big ideas old man with more than few regrets over course two hours told through flashbacks recounted by various acquaintances kane reporter trying unravel meaning rosebud film flits back forth through wealthy mans life his childhood when his parents became filthy rich sent him east be schooled his building news empire great depression his two marriages failed political career old age as recluse his sprawling florida mansion xanadu its rocky ride through ups downs kanes life which happiest moments were before shed load gold made him one richest men world which should be big clue as what rosebud refers if youve spent your life living under rock dont already know lack gratuitous sex shower scene ninjas barbarians talking animals cyborgs exploding heads dwarfs mean that citizen kane doesnt get full marks me but even though its far removed my usual fare i still had good time welles had great eye interesting shot thats sure 7 10 glad have finally ticked it off my list essential classics,0.5641775599128541,0.14942810457516337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Love The Cinematography; Story Not That Appealing,"Hey, make no mistake: this film does deserve lofty status. It is a good film, fantastically photographed.....but the greatest of all time? I question that, but that kind of question - Who's number one? - is impossible to answer. I would think to be number one you would have to have a great technical film, great story, great acting, great camera-work as this has, AND have it generally loved by the public. Then you have a true number one picture of all time. I'm not a fan of ""Gone With The Wind,"" but that was a technical marvel, too, for its day and was universally loved by millions of people....so I can see that being listed number over Citizen Kane. The same goes for Casablanca, Ben-Hur and a number of wonderful films.Anway, concerning this movie, I enjoyed it best for the cinematography. Orson Welles, the ""genius"" behind this film, was ahead of his time with his inventive camera-work. The acting is good and it's interesting to note that this was Welles' first acting role. Yes, he was an amazing talent, behind or in front of the camera. The story is pretty unlikable and, in this day and age would be too boring for most people under 50, sad to say. However, even older, more ""mature"" folks find this hard to get through sometimes from what I have read.The unlikable part mainly comes from the lead character, ""Charles Foster Kane,"" played by Welles. He is simply a selfish egomaniac. Other unpleasant parts of the story include several scenes with his second wife, in which she berates him in this shrill hysterical voice; the fact there is very little humor in here and the ending is anything but uplifting. For those who find this a confusing story, I suggest giving it another chance. I found this film better the more chances I gave it. It also looks fabulous on the latest special-edition DVD. In summary, it was a great technical achievement but remember professional critics usually have the same mindset and are afraid to be their own person, so don't feel stupid or inadequate if this film doesn't do it for you. You are hardly alone. But, yet, that camera-work has to be seen and appreciated if you really love movies.",love cinematography story not that appealing,hey make no mistake this film does deserve lofty status it is good film fantastically photographed but greatest all time i question that but that kind question whos number one is impossible answer i would think be number one you would have have great technical film great story great acting great camera work as this has have it generally loved by public then you have true number one picture all time im not fan gone with wind but that was technical marvel too its day was universally loved by millions people so i can see that being listed number over citizen kane same goes casablanca ben hur number wonderful films anway concerning this movie i enjoyed it best cinematography orson welles genius behind this film was ahead his time with his inventive camera work acting is good its interesting note that this was welles first acting role yes he was amazing talent behind or front camera story is pretty unlikable this day age would be too boring most people under 50 sad say however even older more mature folks find this hard get through sometimes what i have read unlikable part mainly comes lead character charles foster kane played by welles he is simply selfish egomaniac other unpleasant parts story include several scenes with his second wife which she berates him this shrill hysterical voice fact there is very little humor here ending is anything but uplifting those who find this confusing story i suggest giving it another chance i found this film better more chances i gave it it also looks fabulous latest special edition dvd summary it was great technical achievement but remember professional critics usually have same mindset are afraid be their own person so dont feel stupid or inadequate if this film doesnt do it you you are hardly alone but yet that camera work has be seen appreciated if you really love movies,0.5655691964285714,0.1722144717261904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"One of the great films, if not ""the"" greatest.","MINOR SPOILER IN SECOND PARAGRAPH.""Citizen Kane"" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest American films ever made. Orson Welles was basically handed the keys to the city - he had everything he wanted and complete control over budget, actors, script, and more.He plays Charles Foster Kane, who dies at the beginning of the film while uttering the immortal words ""Rosebud."" So the film starts off by searching for what ""rosebud"" really means. We see countless relations of Kane interviewed. None of them know what ""rosebud"" really means. But as the film goes on we see glimpses of Kane's life, and eventually the mystery unfolds itself.Like Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru,"" ""Citizen Kane"" is a glance at a man's life and what has driven him to bitterness. Kurosawa claims he never saw ""Citizen Kane"" before making his film, but nevertheless they form a nice back-to-back viewing.""Citizen Kane"" has, perhaps, some of the best makeup ever seen on film. A twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles is easily disguised as a sixty-something, overweight man. (And this was before he actually WAS overweight later in his life.) I recently bought the Special Edition DVD with a commentary by Roger Ebert, who said in his commentary that there are probably more special effects in ""Citizen Kane"" than in the ""Star Wars"" films.Though subtle, I have to agree that there truly are many special effects used in the film. They're so flawless it's hard to even notice.Another thing Ebert pointed out is how low the ceilings are, which creates a feeling of paranoia. All these things work on a subconscious level that you don't really pick up on the first time.And if you want symbolism, this film is for you. As Kane hands over his empire in one scene, he walks over to a window, which to the naked eye looks normal-sized. But as Kane nears the window, guess what? Turns out the window is very, very high. It makes Kane look small. Think about it. He's handing over his empire and growing smaller in his wealth. It's all very symbolic.I recommend picking up the DVD; it also contains a two-hour documentary called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" plus many, many more tidbits, including the original theatrical trailer (which is very odd and original).All in all, ""Citizen Kane"" is a classic of epic proportions.

9.0,Is a childhood worth sacrificing for wealth,"I think the quote that my friend made about this movie sums it up pretty much: it is a modern day work of literature. I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.Citizen Kane is about a man named Charles Foster Kane who is a US newspaper magnate. I will not delve into the plot because that is not the purpose of the movie. Rather it is a character study on Kane and it is also a tragedy for we see how Kane's life not only slowly disintegrates to its inevitable conclusion, but also we see how his life ended up as it is.There has been a lot of discussion over the precise meaning of Rosebud, the word that he mutters on his deathbed. At the end of the movie we discover that Rosebud is the name of his sleigh, and we see this as it is thrown into the fire. A journalist spends the entire movie trying to find out the meaning of Rosebud, but he fails to do so, walking out of Kane's manor, Xanadu, behind a huge amount of possessions packed away in boxes. We learn that the answer to the Rosebud question is an insignificant item amongst all of these meaningless possessions.What does Rosebud mean? It may be the name of the sleigh, but what does it really mean. I guess to answer that question we must look at what Kane had, and what he did not have. At the beginning of the movie we are told all about Kane, or what the media knew of it, but as we follow the journalist we slowly come to learn more about the more intimate and personal period's of Kane's life. We are allowed into Kane's personal space and into his mind to try and understand how he thinks, and by doing that we are given clues as to why he mentioned Rosebud.Charles Foster Kane was incredibly rich, having almost everything that he could want. Xanadu, his palace in which he died, was a tribute to his wealth. The palace was not finished, but that only says something minor about his character which I will not address. What I wish to draw out of that is that Xanadu represents his wealth and his ability to claim whatever possession that he wants. I use the word possession because there are three things in the movie that his money cannot buy: the presidency, love, and his childhood. The presidency is a minor thing, and love becomes more important after his first divorce. It is important because he uses his money to make his second wife famous, but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him. He dies in bed a lonely man.I believe that the major thing that Charles Foster Kane could not buy was his childhood, and we see evidence of this throughout the film, and tied together at the end where we see his sleigh, Rosebud, burning in the fire. His actions and his attitudes all show signs of a little boy trapped in the body of a man, trapped since the days he was sent off to boarding school.The first instance is when Kane's mother decides to send Charles Foster Kane away. His father is against this, but his mother is adamant that Kane has a good education. When Kane learns of this his first reaction is to lash out at Thatcher, his trustee, with his sleigh. For the rest of his life he hated Thatcher with a passion. He refused to listen to him, and made his job incredibly difficult. Even though he was sent to the best schools, he reacted violently against them and was never able to last long. In the end he purchases a Newspaper because it seems like a good idea.He hated Thatcher because Thatcher was the man that stole Kane's childhood. When Kane came of age he was able to dissolve the trust, and as such remove Thatcher from his life. He reaction to the schools is his hatred of having his childhood stolen from him, and the newspaper was him trying to reclaim the childhood that he had lost. In the end he is too old to live out a childhood, but tries to anyway.The final thing that I wish to discuss is the reaction by Randolf Hurst against this film. It is a reaction that I really do not understand because I do not see Kane as an unflattering character. My friend described Kane as being a real and a repulsive character. I did not find him that repulsive, rather rash and unthinking. He actions which lost him the presidency was not due to any immorality, but rather due to lies fostered by his opponents. The divorce of his first wife is never explored, and it is doubtful that it was because of this because she knew the truth. Maybe it is because she did not really love him, but because she loved the fact that one day he might be president.",is childhood worth sacrificing wealth,i think quote that my friend made about this movie sums it up pretty much it is modern day work literature i agree with him precisely that point i do not give it 10 because at places it is slow dull but one does not appreciate brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down thought about it citizen kane is not movie is simply watch it is one think about mull over ideas that come through it another friend stated that it was most boring piece crap that he has ever seen though that might be his opinion i feel that he missed entire point this movie citizen kane is about man named charles foster kane who is us newspaper magnate i will not delve into plot because that is not purpose movie rather it is character study kane it is also tragedy we see how kanes life not only slowly disintegrates its inevitable conclusion but also we see how his life ended up as it is there has been lot discussion over precise meaning rosebud word that he mutters his deathbed at end movie we discover that rosebud is name his sleigh we see this as it is thrown into fire journalist spends entire movie trying find out meaning rosebud but he fails do so walking out kanes manor xanadu behind huge amount possessions packed away boxes we learn that answer rosebud question is insignificant item amongst all these meaningless possessions what does rosebud mean it may be name sleigh but what does it really mean i guess answer that question we must look at what kane had what he did not have at beginning movie we are told all about kane or what media knew it but as we follow journalist we slowly come learn more about more intimate personal periods kanes life we are allowed into kanes personal space into his mind try understand how he thinks by doing that we are given clues as why he mentioned rosebud charles foster kane was incredibly rich having almost everything that he could want xanadu his palace which he died was tribute his wealth palace was not finished but that only says something minor about his character which i will not address what i wish draw out that is that xanadu represents his wealth his ability claim whatever possession that he wants i use word possession because there are three things movie that his money cannot buy presidency love his childhood presidency is minor thing love becomes more important after his first divorce it is important because he uses his money make his second wife famous but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him he dies bed lonely man i believe that major thing that charles foster kane could not buy was his childhood we see evidence this throughout film tied together at end where we see his sleigh rosebud burning fire his actions his attitudes all show signs little boy trapped body man trapped since days he was sent off boarding school first instance is when kanes mother decides send charles foster kane away his father is against this but his mother is adamant that kane has good education when kane learns this his first reaction is lash out at thatcher his trustee with his sleigh rest his life he hated thatcher with passion he refused listen him made his job incredibly difficult even though he was sent best schools he reacted violently against them was never able last long end he purchases newspaper because it seems like good idea he hated thatcher because thatcher was man that stole kanes childhood when kane came age he was able dissolve trust as such remove thatcher his life he reaction schools is his hatred having his childhood stolen him newspaper was him trying reclaim childhood that he had lost end he is too old live out childhood but tries anyway final thing that i wish discuss is reaction by randolf hurst against this film it is reaction that i really do not understand because i do not see kane as unflattering character my friend described kane as being real repulsive character i did not find him that repulsive rather rash unthinking he actions which lost him presidency was not due any immorality but rather due lies fostered by his opponents divorce his first wife is never explored it is doubtful that it was because this because she knew truth maybe it is because she did not really love him but because she loved fact that one day he might be president,0.5522804232804235,0.027355218855218848,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,tough sledding,"I have an observation concerning Rosebud (and I don't mean that story about Marion Davies). Everyone seems to assume that Kane saying ""Rosebud"" means he was thinking of the one time in his life when he was totally happy and had what he wanted. For years I have also assumed that. The other day something occurred to me and I am curious to know if it has occurred to anyone else.When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this: Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the ""love nest"" with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!So maybe when Kane says ""Rosebud"" he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why ""Rosebud"" is the last word he speaks.But if this is true (and it seems quite logical to me) then why does no one else comment upon it? Why has no one spotted it? Or has someone I just don't know it? Or could it be that this is the kind of truth that no one wants to face? That all of our lives are determined more by blind, idiot accident than by design or purpose.",tough sledding,i have observation concerning rosebud i dont mean that story about marion davies everyone seems assume that kane saying rosebud means he was thinking one time his life when he was totally happy had what he wanted years i have also assumed that other day something occurred me i am curious know if it has occurred anyone else when kane first meets susan alexander he says he is his way or coming i dont recall which warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen many years he doesnt mention sled but presumably that is one thing which drew him warehouse kane is splashed susan laughs at him one things leads another but my point is this kane would never have met susan but rosebud if kane never met susan he would never have been caught love nest with her lost election governor kane might have had another mistress but this seems unlikely kane is not very interested sex perhaps because he feels he is making love whole world his interest susan is primarily idealized not physical so but meeting susan kane would likely not have had scandal would have been elected governor we are told he would then have almost certainly been elected president also he would not have lost his wife his son would not have been killed car accident as president kane could have been most powerful man world instead he loses this chance loses his wife loses his son all because he happened be certain street at certain moment reason he was that street at that moment was rosebud so maybe when kane says rosebud he is not thinking when he was carefree lad playing snow maybe he realizes that because rosebud his whole life went spinning completely different direction what it otherwise would have taken by pure accident rosebud ruined his life shut him off forever everything he otherwise could have been could have accomplished maybe that is why rosebud is last word he speaks but if this is true it seems quite logical me then why does no one else comment upon it why has no one spotted it or has someone i just dont know it or could it be that this is kind truth that no one wants face that all our lives are determined more by blind idiot accident than by design or purpose,0.5084516178266179,0.08846111450278119,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Welle's pushed every button,"Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I don't know. It's such a personal comment that I don't believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still don't understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then there's the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.I first saw this film in college. We had a new student union which had a nice little theater in it. I had heard of the film, but this was pre-rental, pre VCR, so if one were to see such a film, you had to simply wait. Even television tended to avoid this as too artsy. I sat at the screening. There were a couple of football players in the audience (I could tell by their jackets). I remember being mystified and confused and wanting to see the film again. It took about five years until it showed up on television and, even though there were about 60 commercials, I still enjoyed it. When I got my first VCR, it was the first movie I rented. What a trip. Anyway, as we left the theater, one of the football players said to the other, ""Well that was the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen."" This just reaffirmed that it was a great film. I'm sure that most average film-goers are not willing to put in the effort to get the most out of this film. That's their prerogative. I've often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about. If you look at my reviews of movies like ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" you will see I am not a film snob, but this is one great movie and I hope everyone gets to see it before they go down that last hill in that little red sled.",welles pushed every button,many say this is greatest film all time i dont know its such personal comment that i dont believe even modest consensus can be reached that said there is no disputing that this is one most influential projects ever done having read some books about orson welles i still dont understand other than having as strong personality as is possible how he had film knowledge vision that went into this masterpiece his first try there are hundreds stunning shots camera what it does is enough carry film editing take us place place heartbeat characters are pithy interesting especially kane then theres william randolph hearst thing that is going background we see power we see power corrupting we see love self contrasted with love others we see oppressive cloud loneliness descend upon powerful wealth versus happiness which is course overriding theme if anyone doubts effectiveness black white cinematography just watch five minutes this film more can be done with few shadows than full palette colors i first saw this film college we had new student union which had nice little theater it i had heard film but this was pre rental pre vcr so if one were see such film you had simply wait even television tended avoid this as too artsy i sat at screening there were couple football players audience i could tell by their jackets i remember being mystified confused wanting see film again it took about five years until it showed up television even though there were about 60 commercials i still enjoyed it when i got my first vcr it was first movie i rented what trip anyway as we left theater one football players said other well that was biggest pile crap ive ever seen this just reaffirmed that it was great film im sure that most average film goers are not willing put effort get most out this film thats their prerogative ive often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about if you look at my reviews movies like attack crab monsters you will see i am not film snob but this is one great movie i hope everyone gets see it before they go down that last hill that little red sled,0.5368598521659744,0.16117295403009685,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,why did Citizen Kane create such an impact upon its first release?,"Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the ""Mona Lisa of all films"" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's are:KANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty's. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.There are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece .",why did citizen kane create such impact upon its first release,well as media student myself i have come across this question many times books during lectures there are simply 3 reasons film which was considered as mona lisa all films created such legendary appeal upon release 1941 1 this was orson welles first cinematic debut even though he had been huge star theater he was given opportunity few first time directors were permitted having he had full artistic freedom above all power direct produce write even star his own picture therefore film industry rko pictures had absolutely no influence making film were not know what was happening set course this was bound generate number problems as businessmen were curious about nature plot film which takes us second reason film caused controversy 2 one main reasons film posed contentions was because main character charles foster kane orson welles featured range similarities with real media mogul newspaper journalist william randolph hurst therefore film was seen as depicting life problems personal relationships real person thus fictionalizing his life some similarities between two personas are kane newspaper tycoon worked new york inquirer known as kubla khan xanadu married talentless singer susan alexander kane he was political aspirant presidency by campaigning governor bought his wife municipal opera house financier thatcher threat gettys hurst yellow journalist worked new york journal political aspirant presidency by becoming governor married acress marion davies bought his wife cosmopolitan pictures financier jp morgan threat tammany hall differences susan alexander kane dorothy comingdore leaves kane later their life however there was no marriage breakdown hurst marion 3 last reason most pivotal all why film was regarded way it was was due its technical stylistic innovations film upon its release was misunderstood unappreciated by critics as they couldnt comprehend many its elements were too concerned with its dark mysterious nature which is one welless characteristics his films film after all was 20 years ahead its time was only regarded as triumphant success upon its second release after american film noir era 1950s his most prominent artistic inventions were low angled camera movements extreme facial closeups long uninterrupted shots chiaroscuro lighting overlapping dialogue giving realistic effect conversations subjective camera angles deep focus shots depth field flashbacks that make up most film all above more constitute why film is so influential all would be film directors why many people regard it as best film all time lastly we musnt forget exceptional score by bernard herrmann who had collaborated also with best known director all time alfred hitchcock made him chillin sounds strings psycho vertigo name few addition superb photography gregg toland regards welless unique eye details after all he wanted put each shot everything human eye can see if they were present there are many areas film which are crucial these are some most important as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add this masterpiece,0.4396608946608948,0.20258080808080806,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,"Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, ""Citizen Kane"" electrified a complacent industry","""Citizen Kane"" was a dazzling movie debut for Welles, a twenty-four-year-old infant terrible whose brilliant work for stage and radio had already made him famous RKO had given him carte blanche, and with the collaboration of writer Herman Mankiewicz and photographer Gregg Toland, he had produced a masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"" is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a rich young man who decides to build a newspaper empire and in doing so sacrifices his professed high ideals on the altar of yellow journalism His personal, political ambitions are ruined when his extramarital liaison with a young singer becomes public knowledge and his efforts to make her an international opera star bring him nothing but ridicule Having alienated his friends and wives and lost a good part of his fortune, Kane spends his last years alone in the enormous art-filled palace he has had created in FloridaTold primarily in flashbacks, the film begins with Kane's death: after dropping a paperweight that simulates a snowfall when it is turned upside down, the old man whispers a single word, ""Rosebud,"" and dies Immediately a strident Mach-of-Time newsreel begins, reviewing the highlights of Kane's career as the camera had recorded them over the years It is, however, an unsatisfactory record of a man's life, and a group of journalists decide to probe deeper in an attempt to discover the truth about Kane Perhaps, they speculate, the word ""Rosebud"" offers a clue... Then ensues a series of interviews with the key people in Kane's life, each of whom relates the man's story as he or she knew it...

,Narrative and Eye Disconnect,"Spoilers Herein.This an extremely influential film, by one of the very few inventors of cinema. But I do not think it is Welles' best. (That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans: Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames: a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots: perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways: an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible. It all starts here, but only as a promise. In real terms, the film is a failure.",narrative eye disconnect,spoilers herein this extremely influential film by one very few inventors cinema but i do not think it is welles best thats either othello or lady shanghai depending your religion first all this is not work genius but excellent product three committed artisans welles tobin mankiewicz mankiewicz with his brother were industrys working intellectuals here aided by houseman he simply got client intelligent enough know what was up similarly with tobin who was sascha vierny his day these two men pulled welles but as we will see independent directions story hearst all that is irrelevant except notion that writer right place can create reality if willing pay price acting is fine course uncharacteristically abstract but thats hardly innovative nor groundshaking no what makes this film important are two features failed relationship between them first these is incredibly complex narrative structure things that are normally nested frames reminiscent flashback text annotated with pictures are here multiply set up turn enfolded into film proper we see newsreel whose footage later appears real action we have recalled death vision childhood but that becomes untenably self critical we see her singing again her perspective we have several screen narrators but each gets swallowed there are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning sledding as each comes into play is then reabsorbed puzzle is assembled several different ways nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted not by lynch bergman wenders anyone other innovation is breaking convention with eye camera camera takes positions physical philosophical that were previously utterly unknown previously camera was audience supplemented by context shots perspectives that human observer might not see but that seemed natural now camera is something unto itself that we have accommodate camera does things no human would or could it sometimes often sees two things simultaneously something that never happens with natural eye it has curiosity that we would not have directed eye defines lighting not other way around here everything is colored not by what it is but by how films eye changes it both these experiments are masterful they changed world films hence dreams hence all abstract thinking forever but flaw lethal problem with this film is that two experiments have independent lives they are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints then only simplest ways image that is being described by speaker nature newsreel it is as if there were two geniuses at work each doing something important neither communicating with other so when there is shift or trick narrative eye is ignorant it but hey it was just mans first film he quickly fixed that othello especially shanghai merger eye narrative is real revolution kane raised question which is why it is important tarkovsky some bergman malick greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices but master is kurosawa welles made kurosawa possible it all starts here but only as promise real terms film is failure,0.470181598062954,0.11321832122679582,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,A true original,"RKO was the smallest of the Big Five Hollywood studios and the purveyor of mainly undistinguished genre pictures. For this reason they hired a young theatre producer called Orson Welles to make a prestige film. Welles had just shook up radio with his production of The War of the Worlds, a broadcast that was so innovative and realistic it caused widespread panic throughout the United States with some people really believing that Martians were attacking. Welles was given free reign to make the film he wanted. This was unprecedented for an untried film-maker. The film's central character resembled newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. The film was delayed several months while RKO tried to appease Hearst's lawyers. It was well received by the critics but not a popular success. It would remain the high point of Welles career and the one time he enjoyed such complete control. This led in part to the auteur theory where masterpieces of cinema were attributed to the director's genius. However, this is too simplistic as Welles had great collaborators here such as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland. The former provided a disciplined structure for Welles to work off and the latter the deep focus photography that allowed him to manipulate cinematic space in a way that strengthened the story. The combination of deep focus and long takes allowed for scenes where characters moved around the cinematic space in ways that heightened the drama considerably.Citizen Kane is often considered a triumph of technique but it's really the way in which the technique was used and controlled to strengthen the story that makes it so notable. It wasn't the first film to utilise deep focus or long takes but it was the first one to use them so systematically. It combined many opposites – social comment / surrealism, European art film / Hollywood entertainment, comedy / tragedy, realism / expressionism. Kane himself is presented in a variety of ways – dreamlike images of him dying, a remote public figure, a man known by wife and friends and finally a detached being. This reality is expressed by a combination of objective fact and subjective opinion. The beginning of the movie illustrates opposites of approach. We begin with a subjective dreamlike death scene and immediately are thrust into the objective 'News on the March' segment that mimics the news documentary in a similar way to how Welles mimicked the radio news in The War of the Worlds. In this part we are told the whole narrative in summary. It's a microcosm of the film as a whole. After this we then piece together the story of Kane's life via the accounts of various people who knew him, all interviewed by Thompson, a man whose face we never see because he really represents us. The use of flashbacks, multiple narrators and an ambiguous conclusion was a very innovative one for the time. The film as a whole resembles one of the jigsaws that Kane's second wife Susan works on, each piece contributed another truth but some pieces are missing. To add to the complexity of the film, different people offer contrasting judgements that make up the differing periods of his life. Welles once remarked that 'the point of the picture is not so much the solution of the problem as its presentation'.Thompson realises that no single word can 'explain a man's life' and so it proves with 'Rosebud'. The sledge and paperweight represent the time when Kane was happiest and the love he lost but it's left essentially ambiguous and is never fully explained. Kane seeks to regain the love he lost for the rest of his life but always on his own terms, this leads to the ruin of his career and relationships. He winds up in Xanadu his very own pleasure dome with caves of ice. The final tracking shot moves slowly over the expensive rubbish that Kane has accumulated; as we pan forward we see items from further and further back in the story until we find the fateful Rosebud sledge. The 'answer' to our quest.",true original,rko was smallest big five hollywood studios purveyor mainly undistinguished genre pictures this reason they hired young theatre producer called orson welles make prestige film welles had just shook up radio with his production war worlds broadcast that was so innovative realistic it caused widespread panic throughout united states with some people really believing that martians were attacking welles was given free reign make film he wanted this was unprecedented untried film maker films central character resembled newspaper magnate william randolph hearst film was delayed several months while rko tried appease hearsts lawyers it was well received by critics but not popular success it would remain high point welles career one time he enjoyed such complete control this led part auteur theory where masterpieces cinema were attributed directors genius however this is too simplistic as welles had great collaborators here such as screenwriter herman j mankiewicz cinematographer gregg toland former provided disciplined structure welles work off latter deep focus photography that allowed him manipulate cinematic space way that strengthened story combination deep focus long takes allowed scenes where characters moved around cinematic space ways that heightened drama considerably citizen kane is often considered triumph technique but its really way which technique was used controlled strengthen story that makes it so notable it wasnt first film utilise deep focus or long takes but it was first one use them so systematically it combined many opposites social comment surrealism european art film hollywood entertainment comedy tragedy realism expressionism kane himself is presented variety ways dreamlike images him dying remote public figure man known by wife friends finally detached being this reality is expressed by combination objective fact subjective opinion beginning movie illustrates opposites approach we begin with subjective dreamlike death scene immediately are thrust into objective news march segment that mimics news documentary similar way how welles mimicked radio news war worlds this part we are told whole narrative summary its microcosm film as whole after this we then piece together story kanes life via accounts various people who knew him all interviewed by thompson man whose face we never see because he really represents us use flashbacks multiple narrators ambiguous conclusion was very innovative one time film as whole resembles one jigsaws that kanes second wife susan works each piece contributed another truth but some pieces are missing add complexity film different people offer contrasting judgements that make up differing periods his life welles once remarked that point picture is not so much solution problem as its presentation thompson realises that no single word can explain mans life so it proves with rosebud sledge paperweight represent time when kane was happiest love he lost but its left essentially ambiguous is never fully explained kane seeks regain love he lost rest his life but always his own terms this leads ruin his career relationships he winds up xanadu his very own pleasure dome with caves ice final tracking shot moves slowly over expensive rubbish that kane has accumulated as we pan forward we see items further further back story until we find fateful rosebud sledge answer our quest,0.3960136054421769,0.12739115646258503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,A very solid movie with some mystery,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Citizen Kane"" (1941) isn't the best or most important movie ever made in my opinion. As there one word cannot explain man's life, one movie can not influence flow of cinema itself. That said ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good picture, while it's opening ~17 min are nothing short of brilliant and next 40 min are superb, the movie felt short a bit during the end, with to much being focused on ""the singer"" rather on Kane's life itself. There are some truly brilliant camera shoots in this movie, which i suppose was one of the first camera tricks at the time. Acting is very good, especially by Orson Welles - he should have won Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Script is great and directing is also a tip notch, that is why this movie barely drags.Overall, ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good movie about with some mystery. I kinda guest the meaning of this word during the end, and last scenes confirmed my guess - it is a good mystery but maybe a bit over-hyped (no spoilers). This movie definitely worth seeing once (even as i'm watching for the first time just now in 2015).",very solid movie with some mystery,greetings lithuania citizen kane 1941 isnt best or most important movie ever made my opinion as there one word cannot explain mans life one movie can not influence flow cinema itself that said citizen kane is very good picture while its opening 17 min are nothing short brilliant next 40 min are superb movie felt short bit during end with much being focused singer rather kanes life itself there are some truly brilliant camera shoots this movie which i suppose was one first camera tricks at time acting is very good especially by orson welles he should have won oscar best actor leading role script is great directing is also tip notch that is why this movie barely drags overall citizen kane is very good movie about with some mystery i kinda guest meaning this word during end last scenes confirmed my guess it is good mystery but maybe bit over hyped no spoilers this movie definitely worth seeing once even as im watching first time just now 2015,0.48666666666666664,0.4376923076923077,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,The Citizen Kane of Movies,"The most frequently acclaimed ""greatest film ever,"" idiosyncratic in its day yet massively influential, a cultural staple, a narrative and technical tour de force, and there's the whole thing of the wunderkind granted carte blanche for his debut to the machinery of classical Hollywood at its peak--the expectations for ""Citizen Kane,"" to say the least, are high. Indeed, it's a marvel of cinematography and plot. In both senses, there's a deep focus from various angles. The plot is a jigsaw puzzle of flashbacks from multiple sources--the ""News on the March"" film-within-the-film, the dead man's memoir, a reporter interviewing characters for the meaning of ""Rosebud""--linked by an also-layered sound design and framed by a curious camera violating the ""No Trespassing"" sign in entering and exiting the Xanadu estate. Moreover, the story is about a powerful storyteller notoriously based on William Randolph Hearst (and other famous rich guys, if not also a bit of Orson Welles)--a newspaper man, populist politician, overseer of his lover's career, and who even dictates the story beyond his grave with his final word. The picture constantly exploits a deep depth of field, with figures in the foreground and background in focus, to show it off. Much of this was accomplished by composite photographic effects. While ""Kane"" is famous as an arty old black-and-white film, which it is, it belies that it was genre-mixing popular entertainment and a special-effects extravaganza of its day: the virtuosity of the editing and sound design in addition to the matte paintings, miniatures, multiple-exposure photography, rear projection, and the most significant use of the optical printer in between ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""Star Wars"" (1977). The difference is that the effects here are realistic as opposed to fantastic.Outside of co-writer Herman Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and Welles, arguably the most important contributions to the production came from Linwood Dunn and his optical printer, and that's not even to mention a score by Bernard Herrmann, editing from Robert Wise, and contributions from a host of less well-known technicians doing career-best work, including lead matte painter Mario Larrinaga, the special-effects team's boss Vernon Walker, and art director Perry Ferguson. More than half the picture has been guessed to be effects shots. According to Dunn, ""Once Orson Welles learned about the optical printer he just went hog-wild with it.""From the start, there's a miniature for the gate with the matte paintings of Xanadu in the background, and dissolves--lots of long dissolves in this one (and wipes and a few more dazzling effects)--transition between ever-closer views of the lit window, always matching the same frame position, until a reverse angle shot inside followed by an extreme close-up of Kane's lips, with the added snow effects, as he mutters the dying word. The reflection of the nurse in the broken snow globe was created with Dunn's printer. There are many such marvelous compositions throughout. In the ""News on the March"" reel, a terrific film-within-film newsreel parody overall (including intentional scratches and, reportedly, edited by RKO's newsreel department, to make it look authentic), a shot of construction of Xanadu is cobbled together from an actor in the foreground, stop-motion trucks in the middle plane, and the matte painting of the mansion atop the hill. There's also the pre-""Forrest Gump"" (1994), pre-""Zelig"" (1983) insertion of Kane into archival footage. Other treated shots include the camera moving through the window of the El Rancho nightclub for Susan Alexander Kane's scenes, the downward tilting shot from the miniature statue of the Thatcher library, the tilt upwards to the rafters of the workers reacting to Susan's singing, and rear projection and multiple-exposure compositions being employed where the deep, or pan, focus was otherwise impractical, such as when there were figures extremely close to the camera and in the extreme background with another plane for the middle action--the shot of young Kane through the window playing in the snow, the three-tier composite of Boss Getty observing Kane's campaign rally, Leland's firing, Susan's suicide attempt, the shot with the parrot, e.g. Of course, these effects were in service to what was already a uniquely-photographed picture.With good reason, Welles shared the final screen credit with his cinematographer. According to Toland, the demands of deep focus and stagings and camera angles that included ceilings necessitated some unusual lighting setups, and the film has also been credited for the first extensive use of coated lenses and a new film stock. Kane walking back to the windows before sitting down in one scene is a standout that plays with perspective while also underscoring Kane's metaphorical position in the world (i.e. he feels small or distant and is literally so in the image). Similar setups are repeated for when Charles walks up to Susan practicing or in their distant exchanges of reverberating dialogue in the large mansion as she puts puzzles together. Shadows act the same way, such as when she's figuratively and literally in his shadow when he insists she continue her career. The effect is a staggeringly unique picture--not only in a showy manner, although there's an undeniable bravado to it all, but also in a way to explore figures in space in the same way as the narrative investigates characters and their perspectives.The long takes in deep focus to keep all the figures staged in depth in sharp relief--pan focus--as assisted by the optical printer when wide-angle lenses weren't enough, in addition to the unusual angles--especially the low ones featuring ceilings--function to visually depict a plot that is also all about focusing on every character and from every angle, while much still remains in the dark. The visuals are as ambiguous and complex as the narrative: multiple perspectives, with some scenes repeated but appearing differently depending on the narrator, pan focus with figures often obscured, or just turned into silhouettes, by the harsh shadows of the chiaroscuro lighting. We never quite get a good view of the reporter Thompson, e.g., his back usually to the camera and his face in shadows when not, such as in the screening-room scene, which is apt given that he's our surrogate, the unseen spectator within the film. He even wears glasses; he sees through lenses, as we do through the camera. And, in this case, that camera is even more curious than and as much a character as Thompson and isn't slowed down by closed doors or windows and goes through a desk during one point at Kane's childhood home.Besides Toland, Welles shared credit with co-writer Mankiewicz. The non-linear, kaleidoscopic, sometimes restricted narration and sometimes not, flashback-structured plot, with events repeated from different points of view, including a newsreel overview that mirrors the film proper, remains one of the most wonderfully convoluted film narratives. One may get overly caught up in the story and characters, but as with the imagery, it's the structure of the thing that's brilliant. The Rosebud mystery is merely a device to drive the plot. Kane isn't a character trapped in a snow globe by a single word. Everything here is multifaceted. ""You're talking to two people,"" as he says at one point. He has two wives, two friends, two sleds, scenes are doubled and framed and reflected in visual motifs--glass, windows, doorways and mirrors. Near the end, we get the iconic hall-of-mirrors shot: the film in a nutshell.Rosebud is also part of but one or two genres in ""Kane."" It's a detective mystery, but as investigated by wisecracking newsreel reporters, like those who work at Kane's newspaper, it's an entry in the journalism films of the era--""His Girl Friday"" (1940) meets noir. It's a fictional biopic, as well as part musical (Susan's opera, the dance number at the newspaper's party), political thriller, Shakespearean tragedy and lighthearted comedy. Welles and the rest of the Mercury Players' background in radio was surely instructive, as it's the sound design that underscores these tonal shifts, equal measure playful and ominous and continually serving as transitions between scenes. The score fits seamlessly, and the editing is often inspired (e.g. the table sequence for the first marriage, or some nice match cuts throughout, as well as managing the mixture of long takes and quick montages), but there's also techniques such as overlapping dialogue and sound bridges used extensively and informed by radio practices. The shocks cuts where shot transitions are accompanied by sudden changes in sound and score may be the best, and there's a visual equivalent with the reveal of background by the sudden removal of foreground objects, such as with the newspaper in Welles' first scene.Welles and company were already famous for the ""The War of the Worlds"" radio drama, as well as theatrical productions, so it's no wonder the makeup-enhanced acting from actors new to film was already better than the acting in most films. Like ""The War of the Worlds,"" made infamous as a catalyst of mass hysteria, its reputation only enhanced by fabricated newspaper reporting and inflated mythology, ""Kane"" demonstrates the power of storytelling, effects, genre and plot--the radio adaptation was so effective, after all, because the fictional news interrupted additional staged programming, not unlike the ""News on the March"" and other narrative tricks in the film. With the control and freedom granted from the radio-based RKO, Welles and company were able to do something even greater with the recruitment of some of the best talents in Hollywood for the primarily visual art form of cinema. There are reasons it's remained in the conversation as such, whether or not one considers it the greatest film of all time.",citizen kane movies,most frequently acclaimed greatest film ever

10.0,"What does a guy do when he starts off at the Top and Tees Off a guy named Bill, William Randolph Hearst, that is..","It comes to mind of an incident occurring back at the work place, which was directly related to CITIZEN KANE (RKO Radio Pictures, 1941) and to the why to its having been almost universally held as being 'The Greatest American Film.' The 'work place' was the Chicago Police Department, the year was ca. 1991. The question of ""They're having CITIZEN KANE on cable all week long. Why are they doing that?"" The question was posed by one of my old partners, a guy whom I had known for about 25 years at that time. Let's just call him Officer Elmo Aymee. (Much like DRAGNET, ""The names have been changed to protect the Innocent.""As for an answer (there were about 6 of us in the Doughnut Shop then) it was myself who finally answered ""Well, Elmo, CITIZEN KANE is considered to be the greatest film of all time, and this is its 50th Anniversary."" Without much of a hesitation, Elmo responded; ""Yeah well, I'm not watchin' it because I don't like Orson Welles!"" That was sure as about a tough and unexpected a reply that could be returned; but I did my best to maintain the 'high' level of this discussion by saying, ""Well then you must not have seen THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979); as it had Welles in a Cameo, toward the end."" But now seriously, folks, it is no exaggeration to heap such praise on the Film. And it is certainly not considered to be puffing to bestow such a title as the Greatest Film on this one, singularly conceived and so constructed movie. We must remember that at that time, circa 1940, the young Mr. Welles was considered to be a young genius with his Star still rising in the Hollywood Zodiac. His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as ""Suma Cum Laude"", or in the Queen's own tongue, ""With Highest Honors"".* We of course know of his famous and infamous ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a ""standard, Rich & Famous"" Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently ""double crossed"" him. They gave in. So, it was armed with guarantee of absolute Artistic control and an essentially a ""the skies are the limit"" budgetary considerations, that he headed West; taking his company of players and Musical Director, Mr. Bernard Hermann, along for the ride and appointment with destiny.OUR STORY.Aw, c'mon! We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, ""Aye""! All opposed signify with ""No!"" The ""Ayes"" have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz! For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story & screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery. There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is ""Rosebud"" and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview. But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The ""secret"" lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays. As the story continues to unfold, it goes over the same ground already covered, but it always takes us a little more along the way. The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the ""left coast"" it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same. First of all, Mr. Welles' own Star quickly increased in size to that of a Nova and then to the status of a Super-Nova; before its explosion and crashing down to Earth. It would be years before Orson's brief flirtation with life at the top was gradually supplanted with the appreciation with performances in films like THE STRANGER (1946), THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) THE THIRD MAN (1949) and scores of other roles over the years.And over the years whatever the role that Mr. Orson Welles had in whatever film project, or Television appearance, he always did his best in giving his all. And that includes THE MUPPET MOVIE.",what does guy do when he starts off at top tees off guy named bill william randolph hearst that is,it comes mind incident occurring back at work place which was directly related citizen kane rko radio pictures 1941 why its having been almost universally held as being greatest american film work place was chicago police department year was ca 1991 question theyre having citizen kane cable all week long why are they doing that question was posed by one my old partners guy whom i had known about 25 years at that time lets just call him officer elmo aymee much like dragnet names have been changed protect innocent as answer there were about 6 us doughnut shop then it was myself who finally answered well elmo citizen kane is considered be greatest film all time this is its 50th anniversary without much hesitation elmo responded yeah well im not watchin it because i dont like orson welles that was sure as about tough unexpected reply that could be returned but i did my best maintain high level this discussion by saying well then you must not have seen muppet movie 1979 as it had welles cameo toward end but now seriously folks it is no exaggeration heap such praise film it is certainly not considered be puffing bestow such title as greatest film this one singularly conceived so constructed movie we must remember that at that time circa 1940 young mr welles was considered be young genius with his star still rising hollywood zodiac his accomplishments varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb being classification corresponding academias designation as suma cum laude or queens own tongue with highest honors we course know his famous infamous war worlds national broadcast over cbs radio october 1938 as weekly installment mercury theatre air programme everybodys heard that there was even made television movie telling story but accomplishments young orson welles date back much further than that extending back time before new york stage radio days at 14 years age as prep school freshman young master welles was writing producing plays which were staged at woodstock music hall woodstock illinois this was nothing unusual talented adolescent lad this sort thing had become expected him no surprise those days new york with partnership with john houseman federal theatre project so when orson was being courted by rko radio pictures ink standard rich famous hollywood contract welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands but rko apparently double crossed him they gave so it was armed with guarantee absolute artistic control essentially skies are limit budgetary considerations that he headed west taking his company players musical director mr bernard hermann along ride appointment with destiny our story aw cmon we all know that so lets waive this part all favor signify by saying aye all opposed signify with no ayes have it so with show schultz such outstanding example cinematic arts underlying structure story screenplay is rather simple amazingly non intricate even when all is cleared away what we have left is good old fashioned detective story sure we have no hero with names likes sherlock marlowe spade blackie or philo there are no colorful supporting characters help solve mystery theres no mysterious murder but there is mystery identity just who or what is rosebud just what did this mean charles foster kane his deathbed non frilled structure detective story would certainly not be enhanced by use flashbacks flashback is almost indispensable ingredient way detective or other investigative person uses by way interview but again how does otherwise normal standard story type command such great acclaim accolades secret lies methods story telling by flashback with most colorful overlays as story continues unfold it goes over same ground already covered but it always takes us little more along way story is also seen different view point each time some re visitation occurs all scenes no matter where they come story present or flashback are accompanied successfully underscored with original score themes queues incidental music all specially ordered special delivery sent movie audience by maestro himself bernard hermann as result mercury theatre companys relocating out left coast it truly does appear that tinsel town would never be same first all mr welles own star quickly increased size that nova then status super nova before its explosion crashing down earth it would be years before orsons brief flirtation with life at top was gradually supplanted with appreciation with performances films like stranger 1946 lady shanghai 1947 third man 1949 scores other roles over years over years whatever role that mr orson welles had whatever film project or television appearance he always did his best giving his all that includes muppet movie,0.5185461376684779,0.19101010101010102,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
