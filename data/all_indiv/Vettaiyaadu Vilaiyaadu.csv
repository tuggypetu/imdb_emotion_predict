8.0,Tamil Cinema Reaching new heights .. Bollywood you got so much to learn from this film,"First of let me talk about the positives in this movie : The movie was totally awesome ... technically .. Its a very different approach followed by the director .. We could definitely say with pride that Gautam has taken Indian cinema to new heights ... ! The story narration was beautiful though it did not have a very strong plot ... Thanks to Hollywood ... Tamil Cinema is reaching new dimensions ... Especially the opening 15 minutes and the scene where the killer talks with Kamal in midst of vendetta .. Just too good ! Kudos to the director .. the real hero ! Though he is not commendable in the plot, as in Kaakha Kaakha, he wanted to prove a point here ... and he does it in style ... Cheers Last but not the least ... The pride of Indian cinema .. Dr Kamal Haasan .... Does a powerful role with so much of ease ... Yet another movie of his to be remembered ..Now coming to the negatives: Though the director succeeds in a certain way .. he lets you down at certain scenes which are so Indian ... Especially.. When the hero does things out of nowhere and categorizes them as ""Raghavan Instincts"" .. the scene where the killers escape from the airport .. and the usual coincidence where the killers meets the hero and his girl within minutes he reaches a new city ..Our heroes which includes Kamal .. For their lack of body maintenance .. (Got to reduce the protruding tummy) Though these are negatives, they just go vanishing because of the style in which things are told ! In a nut shell .. Its a delight to watch this film !",tamil cinema reaching new heights bollywood you got so much learn this film,first let me talk about positives this movie movie was totally awesome technically its very different approach followed by director we could definitely say with pride that gautam has taken indian cinema new heights story narration was beautiful though it did not have very strong plot thanks hollywood tamil cinema is reaching new dimensions especially opening 15 minutes scene where killer talks with kamal midst vendetta just too good kudos director real hero though he is not commendable plot as kaakha kaakha he wanted prove point here he does it style cheers last but not least pride indian cinema dr kamal haasan does powerful role with so much ease yet another movie his be remembered now coming negatives though director succeeds certain way he lets you down at certain scenes which are so indian especially when hero does things out nowhere categorizes them as raghavan instincts scene where killers escape airport usual coincidence where killers meets hero his girl within minutes he reaches new city our heroes which includes kamal their lack body maintenance got reduce protruding tummy though these are negatives they just go vanishing because style which things are told nut shell its delight watch this film,0.5089715839715839,0.22622322122322128,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.22}"
7.0,A racy thriller with lots of style and violence; but with little depth in the story,"Vettaiyadu Villaiyadu (""hunt and play"", more approriate to say ""hunting game"") is Gautham Menon's second venture into a cops life. This time a widowed DCP Raghavan (Kamal Hassan) hunts for ""a"" serial killer who has murdered his mentor Arkoiaraj's (Prakashraj) daughter first (in India) and, then later him and his wife (in US).The story has all the qualities for a good thriller and to a certain extent engages the attention of the audience till the end. The movie contains a fair amount of violence, blood and gory scenes. So, if you do not like it, just stay away. After the first half, the story develops in a predictable style. So the key is that watch Vettaiyadu Villaiyadu, experience the thrill and, then forget about it (like any other thriller book).As expected, Kamal Hassan gives a first rate acting performance which glues the audience attention to the screen. I like Kamal's acting but on a second thought, I feel that the character Raghavan did not really needed Kamal Hassan. In other words, it could have been played by another decent actor, for instance Surya and, same effects could have been produced. Balaji does a good job as the serial killer Amudhan. At the end of the movie, you will come to hate as well as fear him. Jyotika has done well with in the given amount of screen time. I also feel that the movie could have been done without Jyotika's character. Kamalinee Mukherjee and Prakash Raj have a short screen presence but leave a good impression.Gautham's direction is crispy and good. With in a short space of time in the beginning, he creates the tough cop character Ragahavan. The script is good. Harris Jayaraj's music is OK. Songs are hummable and foot tapping. There is not much to say about the back ground score.The movie has its share of ""flaws"". For instance,(a) When Raghavan and his US cop partner zero onto a ""suspect"" Amudhan's companion, the first alert should have gone to all the ports to contain them inside US. Instead the cops go and knock on the doors of the ""suspect"" (psycho) without even having a backup plan.(b) In the era of fast digital communication, it is little bit difficult to digest that the news about the serial killers reach the Indian port authorities late (inspite of some US citizens being killed). Also, given that the travel time between New York to Mumbai can easily cross 15 hrs and, the existence of numerous channels through which the information could be sent and criminal being apprehended.(c) The serial killers kill US citizens including some police authorities. US does not even sends an investigating team to India.(d) Amuthan keeps claiming he is a university rank holder (a brilliant and intelligent guy) but some of the events does not fit into the character. For instance, when they come to know about the police surveillance they should have vacated their usual residence.The primary reason for these flaws is that the first half of the story is shown through the eyes of an investigating police officer and, the second half is shown through the eyes of serial killer.Eventually what happened in the second half of the movie is that the director ended up spending time creating the fearsome serial killers character (also resulting in some more violent and gory scenes) and, Kamal spending rest of the movie running around the trees with Jyotika and ending up as the usual villain bashing hero cop. Thus, second half becomes very predictable.Instead the character of the serial killers could have been developed through the investigation of cop, thus, keeping the audience more on the edge of seat and guessing. This would have meant that Raghavan doing some really good investigative cop work.Nevertheless, ""Vettiyadu Villaiyadu"" is worth watching once at least for Kamal.",racy thriller with lots style violence but with little depth story,vettaiyadu villaiyadu hunt play more approriate say hunting game is gautham menons second venture into cops life this time widowed dcp raghavan kamal hassan hunts serial killer who has murdered his mentor arkoiarajs prakashraj daughter first india then later him his wife us story has all qualities good thriller certain extent engages attention audience till end movie contains fair amount violence blood gory scenes so if you do not like it just stay away after first half story develops predictable style so key is that watch vettaiyadu villaiyadu experience thrill then forget about it like any other thriller book as expected kamal hassan gives first rate acting performance which glues audience attention screen i like kamals acting but second thought i feel that character raghavan did not really needed kamal hassan other words it could have been played by another decent actor instance surya same effects could have been produced balaji does good job as serial killer amudhan at end movie you will come hate as well as fear him jyotika has done well with given amount screen time i also feel that movie could have been done without jyotikas character kamalinee mukherjee prakash raj have short screen presence but leave good impression gauthams direction is crispy good with short space time beginning he creates tough cop character ragahavan script is good harris jayarajs music is ok songs are hummable foot tapping there is not much say about back ground score movie has its share flaws instance when raghavan his us cop partner zero onto suspect amudhans companion first alert should have gone all ports contain them inside us instead cops go knock doors suspect psycho without even having backup plan b era fast digital communication it is little bit difficult digest that news about serial killers reach indian port authorities late inspite some us citizens being killed also given that travel time between new york mumbai can easily cross 15 hrs existence numerous channels through which information could be sent criminal being apprehended c serial killers kill us citizens including some police authorities us does not even sends investigating team india d amuthan keeps claiming he is university rank holder brilliant intelligent guy but some events does not fit into character instance when they come know about police surveillance they should have vacated their usual residence primary reason these flaws is that first half story is shown through eyes investigating police officer second half is shown through eyes serial killer eventually what happened second half movie is that director ended up spending time creating fearsome serial killers character also resulting some more violent gory scenes kamal spending rest movie running around trees with jyotika ending up as usual villain bashing hero cop thus second half becomes very predictable instead character serial killers could have been developed through investigation cop thus keeping audience more edge seat guessing this would have meant that raghavan doing some really good investigative cop work nevertheless vettiyadu villaiyadu is worth watching once at least kamal,0.42144248608534324,0.03657276850133992,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,A great thriller movie,Very solid technical details. The way new york pictured is simple superb. Hats off to Ravi Varman for his cinematography. This movie is not inferior to any Hollywood one. Tamil movies are catching up with them. Great direction by Gautham. Kamal should shed some weight and continue his world class acting. The matured romance between Kamal and Jyothika needs a special mention. Too bad the other heroine Kamalini Mukherjee didn't get much attention. Absolutely no comedy sequences at all in this thriller. Thats a great attempt by the director in these times when comedy is given lots of importance in Tamil movies. Background score by Harris Jayaraj is simply superb.

7.0,A typical Gautham thriller,"Though this is only the second movie of Gautham, his unique way of presenting can be noticed. The thrill,excitement,scenes etc... are somewhat similar to its predecessor Kaakha Kaakha. The last scene,encounter shoots and the complete crew is the same as KK. Few new faces have been introduced in this film and all have acted splendidly. It is another episode in police life where Raghavan(Kamal Haasan),DCP investigates a murder case involving a serial killer. The hunt for the serial killer leads him to New York where there are some twists and surprises. It is hard to find any goofs in this film though I noticed two. The movie is lightning fast and I bet none would have seen their watch while watching the film. Though everything is good about this movie, Gautham should have thought of replacing few artists to avoid monotony. The reason for few people disliking the movie is it bears the same storyline and if it continues, the next film might be tragic! This movie is a must watch if you like Action and Music.",typical gautham thriller,though this is only second movie gautham his unique way presenting can be noticed thrill excitement scenes etc are somewhat similar its predecessor kaakha kaakha last scene encounter shoots complete crew is same as kk few new faces have been introduced this film all have acted splendidly it is another episode police life where raghavan kamal haasan dcp investigates murder case involving serial killer hunt serial killer leads him new york where there are some twists surprises it is hard find any goofs this film though i noticed two movie is lightning fast i bet none would have seen their watch while watching film though everything is good about this movie gautham should have thought replacing few artists avoid monotony reason few people disliking movie is it bears same storyline if it continues next film might be tragic this movie is must watch if you like action music,0.40082972582972576,0.03679653679653679,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4.0,10 Reasons I hated VV,"On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (mind you, three of us hardcore Kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday. Not to mention, we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year.I won't blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like, ""Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la"" (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing, but we have hardly improved, when it comes to Screenplay, Direction and Acting""). While you're watching VV, those words ring very true.Now, here are the 10 Reasons to hate this movie:1. Harris Jeyaraj2. Harris Jeyaraj3. Harris Jeyaraj I'm barely holding myself from using expletives here, but fact is HJ has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the jarring cacophony, he bills as background music. The next time I have an eardrum transplant, he's paying for it. 4. Songs Neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice. The film feels like it's made of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them.5. A Short gone too far. VV at best is fit to be a short story, not a 2 hour plus ""thriller"". To use a cliché here, like the Energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don't want it to. The later part of a movie feels like a big drag.6. Kamal-Jothika pairing Two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing. There's no reason you would root for them to make it together. In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie, they make a good irritant to the narration. Hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus 'Thenali'.7. Kamal Haasan's accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US; and it isn't new either. He's been doing it since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It's simply gets on the nerve. Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the US. He doesn't leave it at the Immigration either, he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in chaste Kamanglish (""Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok""), of course with nauseating effect.8. Logic There are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! The scene inside the theatre was so bad, towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the Hero's IQ. ""Is he stupid, can't he just use his Siren or Lights?"" (On a busy Madras road, Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-Jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude!). ""Can't he just use his gun?"" (""The guy on a bike"" starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). I'm not voting in favour of the later, but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside.9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped, their throats getting slashed, more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity, I would sit at home and rather watch a ""Police Report"" or ""Kuttram"". The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rapes, murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is!10. Even a double shot Espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head.",10 reasons i hated vv,way back imc6 san jose california all five mind you three us hardcore kamal fans us had reached unanimous verdict vv was solid crap thanks movie we were going have pretty screwed up monday not mention we swore stay off theatres next year i wont blame kamal here because he sort dropped hint recent interview with cartoonist madan vijay tv he said something like tamizh cinemala photography editingla namba munnerana maadri screenplay direction actingla innum namba munnerala tamil cinema has grown terms photography editing but we have hardly improved when it comes screenplay direction acting while youre watching vv those words ring very true now here are 10 reasons hate this movie 1 harris jeyaraj2 harris jeyaraj3 harris jeyaraj im barely holding myself using expletives here but fact is hj has mastered fine knack screwing up every recent movie his remember anniyan ghajini with jarring cacophony he bills as background music next time i have eardrum transplant hes paying it 4 songs neither do songs help move movies narration spatially temporally nor do they make you sit up take notice film feels like its made four very long songs with few scenes thrown between them 5 short gone too far vv at best is fit be short story not 2 hour plus thriller use clich here like energizer bunny it goes only this case you dont want it later part movie feels like big drag 6 kamal jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together couldve produced more sparks than this lead pairing theres no reason you would root them make it together fact every time they get together second half movie they make good irritant narration hate say this but kamalini mukerjhees 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal jothika achieve this movie plus thenali 7 kamal haasans accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either india or us it isnt new either hes been doing it since thoongadae thambi thoongadae its simply gets nerve imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair using this strange accent meets shooting location us he doesnt leave it at immigration either he offers doses advice his men bewildered tn cops keeranor sathoor beyond chaste kamanglish wha we hav here is plain bad police wok course with nauseating effect 8 logic there are few directors whom you expect stand up certain scale gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance department common sense which d c p his senses would meet his love interest streets discuss such matters as committing himself life after scene inside theatre was so bad towards climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge heros iq is he stupid cant he just use his siren or lights busy madras road kamal cop police jeep chases guy bike just like any ordinary dude cant he just use his gun guy bike starts foot we have fully geared kamal hot pursuit considerable amount time im not voting favour later but im just trying explain mood inside 9 gore violence if i wanted watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped thrown into bushes with excruciating authenticity i would sit at home rather watch police report or kuttram use excessive violence should go way extend story not overwhelm it somewhere down line gautum seems confused about what extensions rapes murders are what mainstay story is 10 even double shot espresso couldnt get pain out head,0.436447791734677,-0.05689932107964892,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Huge technical Delight ! ! !!,"First of all, lemme say a few words abt the director.. Gautham 's first film is 'Minnale' , a nice romantic flick, which's been a trend setter for many films, since today ! ! He directed the same movie in Hindi also ('RHTDM').. Then, he did 'Kaakka Kaakka', again a real mind blaster and one of the superb cop movies in Tamil, ever made! ! He again, did it in Telugu and then has directed this movie.I personally think Kamal Hassan's 'Kurudhippunal' is the greatest cop film ever made in Tamil ! ! Now, He joins hands with Gautham for this flick, and this raised expectations all through the Tamil film Industry..This movie's been released after facing a truckload of problems .. . A highly expected movie too in Tamil nadu... Has some 'firsts' associated with it..Combines the skills of Gautham for the first time with Kamal Hassan. . . Harris Jeyaraj too joins Kamal for the first time....Now, to be frank , I really loved it just for it's technical brilliance alone. . Combine with it the apt screenplay and some good acting... U get 'Vettaiyadu Vilayadu' ! ! The camera work is stunning, to say the least ! ! ! No Tamil film 's captured the beauty of America like this one, before. . . Also, the editing ! ! It's clean and crisp . . . Kamal too has done a nice piece of acting. The only point to say is that He spoils some scenes with his overacting, a factor we see regularly in his films , of late. Also, I would like to say something about his freaky English accent ! ! As far as I know, He thinks he 's a real English pundit in his mind, and uses a totally freakish accent which I think only he speaks in the entire universe ! ! God ! He 's doing this regularly in his films where there comes a situation when he has to say a few words in English.. Remember the train sequence in 'Guru' where he talks to a foreign lady ? I felt like laughing thru' my ass when I saw that. Since then , he uses the same kinda language in all his films ! ! Here too he does that in perfect style (???!!!!) and tickles the audience.. I think this really makes up for the fact that there is no comedy in this movie ! ! Jyothika has done a decent piece,as like kaakka kaakka. Prakash raj comes for some scenes, and captures our mind where he cries for his daughter's death .The huge negative point in this movie, as far as I'm concerned, is the music and the songs ! ! This flick's been a nice movie sans songs.. They really tamper the speed of the movie. Especially, the 'sikki mukki neruppe' song's a needless one. Also, the flashback song 'paartha mudhal naale' and the duet with jyothika are definitely slowing down the pace, I think. The background music's been horrendous, to say the least ! ! I dunno why Gautham 's sticking with Harris Jeyaraj !! He has spoiled many movies with his background score . . He does it with style here also (!!!!) . .Those jarring noises are really a pain , to hear.. It's high time to keep him out of the recording room and let someone else do the background score ! ! Also, there are some small holes in the screenplay . . Like , how can kamal forget the fact to guard his fiancé's home when the killer's are on the loose , and how can the villains escape the police and roam freely in chennai ?? Except these, it's a good flick . .I've heard some friends say to me that this is a slow movie. .I think it's been purposefully taken like that. This is what happens in real life too. U can't expect the chase to be very crisp in real life. . When a cop chases psychopaths, it's a slow one.. Nothing wrong with it.My final say : Well, see it , Njoy and feel good for Gautham for making yet another stylish cop movie ! ! Don't compare it with 'Kakka kaakka' or ' Kurudhippunal'. They are the two best ever cop films in Tamil and this can be(remember, it's a 'can be' . . Not 'will be') the third one !!",huge technical delight,first all lemme say few words abt director gautham s first film is minnale nice romantic flick whichs been trend setter many films since today he directed same movie hindi also rhtdm then he did kaakka kaakka again real mind blaster one superb cop movies tamil ever made he again did it telugu then has directed this movie i personally think kamal hassans kurudhippunal is greatest cop film ever made tamil now he joins hands with gautham this flick this raised expectations all through tamil film industry this movies been released after facing truckload problems highly expected movie too tamil nadu has some firsts associated with it combines skills gautham first time with kamal hassan harris jeyaraj too joins kamal first time now be frank i really loved it just its technical brilliance alone combine with it apt screenplay some good acting u get vettaiyadu vilayadu camera work is stunning say least no tamil film s captured beauty america like this one before also editing its clean crisp kamal too has done nice piece acting only point say is that he spoils some scenes with his overacting factor we see regularly his films late also i would like say something about his freaky english accent as far as i know he thinks he s real english pundit his mind uses totally freakish accent which i think only he speaks entire universe god he s doing this regularly his films where there comes situation when he has say few words english remember train sequence guru where he talks foreign lady i felt like laughing thru my ass when i saw that since then he uses same kinda language all his films here too he does that perfect style tickles audience i think this really makes up fact that there is no comedy this movie jyothika has done decent piece as like kaakka kaakka prakash raj comes some scenes captures our mind where he cries his daughters death huge negative point this movie as far as im concerned is music songs this flicks been nice movie sans songs they really tamper speed movie especially sikki mukki neruppe songs needless one also flashback song paartha mudhal naale duet with jyothika are definitely slowing down pace i think background musics been horrendous say least i dunno why gautham s sticking with harris jeyaraj he has spoiled many movies with his background score he does it with style here also those jarring noises are really pain hear its high time keep him out recording room let someone else do background score also there are some small holes screenplay like how can kamal forget fact guard his fianc s home when killers are loose how can villains escape police roam freely chennai except these its good flick ive heard some friends say me that this is slow movie i think its been purposefully taken like that this is what happens real life too u cant expect chase be very crisp real life when cop chases psychopaths its slow one nothing wrong with it my final say well see it njoy feel good gautham making yet another stylish cop movie dont compare it with kakka kaakka or kurudhippunal they are two best ever cop films tamil this can be remember its can be not will be third one,0.5091708214624879,0.16890075973409294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.21}"

,So whats missing?!,"Yes, at last the long awaited, slickly executed Kamal Hassan starrer is out. And the verdict...um-mm, I just dunno! Lets get the fundamentals first. Kamal Hassan plays a super cop, hunting down a serial killer who's finished off the whole family of Kamal's boss. The search takes Kamal down to New York city, where he teams up with a NYPD cop and uncovers further clues. In his spare time, he saves a girl (Jyothika) from committing suicide, and starts on a rather subdued like- you-turns-to-love-you kinda track.The story shifts from NYC back to our land (Mangalore, Goa, Kerala, Madurai and every other place in between), leading to a final showdown where justice triumphs.So whats missing? One fact that bugged the hell out of me was that the identity of the killers is revealed even before intermission (there goes my hope of out guessing the director). Two, there is no twist, or shocker. Its a very straight story from then on.

The duologue's are pretty good, and the subtle sense of humor of kamals character is enjoyable. another big plus for the movie is the outstanding camera work by ravi verman. Those aerial shots of NY are really breathtaking. Editing keeps the movie fast paced. the BGM of Harris is the main drawback of the movie.

9.0,"Yes, he has done it again. A must watch for Kamal fans!!!!!!!!!!","Yes, Vettaiyadu Villaiyadu (VV) is released at last. It was a surprise when I came to know that VV is releasing on Friday. It had everything for a Kamal movie in it, except his usual experiments, which he is not doing in his last few movies. In VV he almost resembles the character he played in Soora Samhaaram a 1988 movie. But I just feel that there has been too much of a blood shed or violence in the movie, which is becoming a trend in Tamil movies of late. Now, to the review of the story. VV starts with a nice song and a fight sequence, which Kamal has done quite nicely. Then starts the story of the movie with the kidnapping of Prakashraj's daughter and Kamal going to Madurai, just to find out that the girl is dead. Prakashraj has done a nice role of a father, and we are missing quite a few Kamal regulars in his movies like Nasser, Santhanabarathi and Nagesh. Then the story then moves back to Chennai and it seems that Kamal has forgotten about the murder and one fine day he gets a call from his chief telling that Prakashraj and his wife are executed by someone in New York, oh, yes, they had gone to New York, the Big Apple. Then he wants to go there to investigate the crime and his chief lets him. He is joined there by a detective named Anderson and with him he investigates and he doesn't find any things. Then, things are starting to happen all of a sudden in Kamal's favor and an incident happens which is similar to what happened before Prakashraj's daughter's murder. Then they find out quite a few dead bodies and start to narrow down their investigation. And then at the end (oh, yeah, and this is in the first half of the movie before the interval) they killers are shown and there comes the intermission. When it starts all again Kamal and the detective narrows their list of 10 people and then what happens after the interval is the rest of the story, which I don't want to reveal here. Yeah, at the end, Kamal does it again, a cool and composed acting by him and somehow he manages to get a beautiful girl in his movie, not Jyothika, she is cute thought, I am talking about Kamalinee, even though she only does a cameo of a role, but she has done it well. Overall, a film that starts in Chennai goes to the Big Apple then comes back again to Chennai and a lovely camera by Ravi and superb acting performance by Kamal, Jo, and Prakashraj has done the trick for the movie. But, one real let down though in the movie has been the resemblance of the Director's Gautam Menon's previous police flick, Kakka Kakka, same psychopathic villains and the use of O*** word and F*** words in the movie, and the raping scenes which made a family who came with their teenage kids to be a bit embarrassed and uncomfortable. If he has reduced those things it would have been a nice one. A great work done by the team!!!!!",yes he has done it again must watch kamal fans,yes vettaiyadu villaiyadu vv is released at last it was surprise when i came know that vv is releasing friday it had everything kamal movie it except his usual experiments which he is not doing his last few movies vv he almost resembles character he played soora samhaaram 1988 movie but i just feel that there has been too much blood shed or violence movie which is becoming trend tamil movies late now review story vv starts with nice song fight sequence which kamal has done quite nicely then starts story movie with kidnapping prakashrajs daughter kamal going madurai just find out that girl is dead prakashraj has done nice role father we are missing quite few kamal regulars his movies like nasser santhanabarathi nagesh then story then moves back chennai it seems that kamal has forgotten about murder one fine day he gets call his chief telling that prakashraj his wife are executed by someone new york oh yes they had gone new york big apple then he wants go there investigate crime his chief lets him he is joined there by detective named anderson with him he investigates he doesnt find any things then things are starting happen all sudden kamals favor incident happens which is similar what happened before prakashrajs daughters murder then they find out quite few dead bodies start narrow down their investigation then at end oh yeah this is first half movie before interval they killers are shown there comes intermission when it starts all again kamal detective narrows their list 10 people then what happens after interval is rest story which i dont want reveal here yeah at end kamal does it again cool composed acting by him somehow he manages get beautiful girl his movie not jyothika she is cute thought i am talking about kamalinee even though she only does cameo role but she has done it well overall film that starts chennai goes big apple then comes back again chennai lovely camera by ravi superb acting performance by kamal jo prakashraj has done trick movie but one real let down though movie has been resemblance directors gautam menons previous police flick kakka kakka same psychopathic villains use o word f words movie raping scenes which made family who came with their teenage kids be bit embarrassed uncomfortable if he has reduced those things it would have been nice one great work done by team,0.40663550397592946,0.11265849989254242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8.0,VV - The Definitive Review,"Expectations were between mediocre and high after viewing Minnale (which was good) and Kaake Kaake (which was bad although many don't think so). This movie is highly reflective of the amount of experience that Gautham Menon has gathered from his past projects, which he uses to bring a highly polished and refined viewing experience with perhaps a little excess of shock value. But from this trend, he is no doubt going to be one of the best directors/writers in the Indian cinema.VV starts off with the line ""Another day in a police officers life"" and you thus expect it to be some clichéd formula of the tough cop chasing the local rowdies as usual. Indeed, thats how the first few minutes of the movie are - with Kamal beating up some local thugs with style. His acting and expression however, give the same old scenes a fresh feel. After that is the excellent title song ironically titled Kaarka Kaarka, which kind feels ripped off but is still excellent when used in the movie and the action scenes. It fits in perfectly.You would probably imagine that this movie is a Kaaka Kaaka clone/money-spinner with a better actor and indeed, there is a strong resemblance to that movie in many scenes. But a high degree of polishing, refinement and a better cast make it a completely different experience. Needless to say, Kamal Hassan's acting is as excellent as expected.The first part of this movie starts off as a murder mystery and a series of gory, and I mean extremely gory by Indian movie standards, murders and an investigation into this, despite no clues about the possible suspects. Then all of a sudden, Prakash Raj (who I am becoming less and less a fan of due to his banal and repetitive acting style) out of the blue, remembers an incident about the suspects and these guys indeed turn out to be the villains at the end. This is the first major flaw in storytelling. The only excuse used here was that the Police never collected any details about these guys and hence, are now back to square one. You've all probably seen similar Murder mysteries in Hollywood but nothing similar can easily be found in Indian Cinema.Instead of keeping the murder mystery till the very end with a ""whodunit?"" flavor and the villain turning out to be the ""least expected"" guy, Gautham has tried an alternative approach and the bad guys are quickly introduced before the second half of the movie. Most people complain that the second half of the movie really dragged. While the villains turned out to be excellent and disturbing actors in their roles, they dominate and escape Kamal Hassan and the Police a bit too frequently and too easily and that also feels a bit dumb.Romance is thrown in as expected and fills gaps here and there. Due to high degree of polishing, it is somewhat better than whats seen in most other Tamil Movies. It is highly predictable that jyothika would get kidnapped by the villains and thats exactly what happens. To pursue his romantic life in the middle of a crisis and in full exposure of the bad guys, is once again devoid of any logic which further weakens the second half. The latter could have used some better writing, devoid of any romance and used some twists and more action. The ending is quite sudden and disappointing and there's no great twist.This movie is much more than ""Another day in the life of...."" but falls short of logic in a few scenes and eventually gets predictable. The gore is very realistic and used to full effect although some people may end up being more disturbed rather than appreciative. Foul language (for realism's sake) is also extensive in this movie. The screenplay is brilliant as is the cinematography. The New York sequences have been brilliantly done and that scene with the bodies in New York was truly unbelievably well done.By both Tamil and Indian Cinema standards, it could very well be a landmark film and a ground breaker but it is not without many flaws. For a Tamil movie with absolutely no comedy or comic relief, it keeps you engrossed till the very end. Perhaps Gautham should team up with Shankar in the future to make an explosive combination of Gautham's realism plus Shankar's creativity.The U/A rating of VV is not justified through extensive gore, foul language and many scenes of rape. This may attract families to the cinema and impressionable little kids may get disturbed. Were the CBFC on crack as usual?",vv definitive review,expectations were between mediocre high after viewing minnale which was good kaake kaake which was bad although many dont think so this movie is highly reflective amount experience that gautham menon has gathered his past projects which he uses bring highly polished refined viewing experience with perhaps little excess shock value but this trend he is no doubt going be one best directors writers indian cinema vv starts off with line another day police officers life you thus expect it be some clich d formula tough cop chasing local rowdies as usual indeed thats how first few minutes movie are with kamal beating up some local thugs with style his acting expression however give same old scenes fresh feel after that is excellent title song ironically titled kaarka kaarka which kind feels ripped off but is still excellent when used movie action scenes it fits perfectly you would probably imagine that this movie is kaaka kaaka clone money spinner with better actor indeed there is strong resemblance that movie many scenes but high degree polishing refinement better cast make it completely different experience needless say kamal hassans acting is as excellent as expected first part this movie starts off as murder mystery series gory i mean extremely gory by indian movie standards murders investigation into this despite no clues about possible suspects then all sudden prakash raj who i am becoming less less fan due his banal repetitive acting style out blue remembers incident about suspects these guys indeed turn out be villains at end this is first major flaw storytelling only excuse used here was that police never collected any details about these guys hence are now back square one youve all probably seen similar murder mysteries hollywood but nothing similar can easily be found indian cinema instead keeping murder mystery till very end with whodunit flavor villain turning out be least expected guy gautham has tried alternative approach bad guys are quickly introduced before second half movie most people complain that second half movie really dragged while villains turned out be excellent disturbing actors their roles they dominate escape kamal hassan police bit too frequently too easily that also feels bit dumb romance is thrown as expected fills gaps here there due high degree polishing it is somewhat better than whats seen most other tamil movies it is highly predictable that jyothika would get kidnapped by villains thats exactly what happens pursue his romantic life middle crisis full exposure bad guys is once again devoid any logic which further weakens second half latter could have used some better writing devoid any romance used some twists more action ending is quite sudden disappointing theres no great twist this movie is much more than another day life but falls short logic few scenes eventually gets predictable gore is very realistic used full effect although some people may end up being more disturbed rather than appreciative foul language realisms sake is also extensive this movie screenplay is brilliant as is cinematography new york sequences have been brilliantly done that scene with bodies new york was truly unbelievably well done by both tamil indian cinema standards it could very well be landmark film ground breaker but it is not without many flaws tamil movie with absolutely no comedy or comic relief it keeps you engrossed till very end perhaps gautham should team up with shankar future make explosive combination gauthams realism plus shankars creativity u rating vv is not justified through extensive gore foul language many scenes rape this may attract families cinema impressionable little kids may get disturbed were cbfc crack as usual,0.46670702930948815,0.09283200861069715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"

3.0,"this movie is a disgrace to kamal hassan, it is obscene, brutal and simply not worth watching","I had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations; basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever. But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. After watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better. The Protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring police officer. Who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders. Raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree. Finally Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives.THese two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters. The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly, which the movie could have survived without. To even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience.Certainly i am never going to the movies looking like Gautham's name on the production list.",this movie is disgrace kamal hassan it is obscene brutal simply not worth watching,i had lot hopes this movie so watched it with lot expectations basically because kamal hassan he is amazing actor who has marked his foot steps sands time forever but this movie proved be one worst movies i have ever seen after watching this movie brutality violence tenebra clockwork orange looks far better protagonist raghavan is very daring police officer who is assigned investigate brutal serial murders raghavan efficiently finds connecting thread this case is close solve murders put psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape again get into killing spree finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives these two psycho killers are ones who are going keep audiences going theaters murders sexual harassments rapes are shown very explicitly which movie could have survived without even imagine that teenagers kids are going be watching this movie theater kind picture it is bound paint their minds are certainly not pretty director gautham should realize that he also has some obligation society his audience certainly i am never going movies looking like gauthams name production list,0.6668934240362812,0.0556122448979592,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"

6.0,An action oriented cat and mouse game between a cop and a serial killers duo made strictly for masses.,"Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006) : Brief Review -An action oriented cat and mouse game between a cop and a serial killers duo made strictly for masses. This film was a success at box office and it was deserving for many reasons. But when i look at its intro on Wiki 'Neo-noir thriller film' then i must say it differs a lot. There is nothing like that out there in almost 3 Hours long film and even if i agree that the team really intended to bring Neo-noir touch, the fact remains still that they didn't really managed to do it. Otherwise, it's a fine massy Flick and quite suitable for classes too for the stylish designing all over. It doesn't go like any other out-an-out mass action film where things go over the top. Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu was actually a new break in storytelling. Although the film is 30 minutes long because of that typical romance and the songs, it still looked fairly gripping all the time considering the first time viewing. The film revolves around a Police Officer named Raghavan who investigates a series of brutal rapes and murders with the culprits seeming to cover more than one country. If i am not wrong then this international serial killer thing was new then in 2006 and of course it gives a new timeline to the narrative so this change in storytelling in Tamil Cinema was surely pleasant. Kamal Haasan looks great as a cop. I haven't seen his action oriented Avatar yet so for me this was a pretty nice break from his high quality classics. Jyothika has acted fairly upto the mark whereas Salim Baig and Daniel Balaji are surprisingly outstanding as serial killers. Director Gautham Menon has made a pretty watchable cop-drama and sort of a thriller too but i think he could have trimmed it by 30 minutes or so and then the final cut would have looked much better and more thrilling. Overall, a commercial draft of cop thriller that should be enjoyed according to its decent quality and not spindly hype.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",action oriented cat mouse game between cop serial killers duo made strictly masses,vettaiyaadu vilaiyaadu 2006 brief review action oriented cat mouse game between cop serial killers duo made strictly masses this film was success at box office it was deserving many reasons but when i look at its intro wiki neo noir thriller film then i must say it differs lot there is nothing like that out there almost 3 hours long film even if i agree that team really intended bring neo noir touch fact remains still that they didnt really managed do it otherwise its fine massy flick quite suitable classes too stylish designing all over it doesnt go like any other out out mass action film where things go over top vettaiyaadu vilaiyaadu was actually new break storytelling although film is 30 minutes long because that typical romance songs it still looked fairly gripping all time considering first time viewing film revolves around police officer named raghavan who investigates series brutal rapes murders with culprits seeming cover more than one country if i am not wrong then this international serial killer thing was new then 2006 course it gives new timeline narrative so this change storytelling tamil cinema was surely pleasant kamal haasan looks great as cop i havent seen his action oriented avatar yet so me this was pretty nice break his high quality classics jyothika has acted fairly upto mark whereas salim baig daniel balaji are surprisingly outstanding as serial killers director gautham menon has made pretty watchable cop drama sort thriller too but i think he could have trimmed it by 30 minutes or so then final cut would have looked much better more thrilling overall commercial draft cop thriller that should be enjoyed according its decent quality not spindly hype rating 6 5 10 by,0.5367474747474748,0.22042424242424236,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.25}"

6.0,"Beautiful Photographed, almost a Thriller","I saw this movie just yesterday on DVD. The DVD was awesome. Crystal clear and sharp hence the photography really appealed.Firstly, I am not a Tamilian. Just a movie buff. See movies of all languages. Now the movie.... It is about a ""hunting game"" between the cop and killers. The first half of the movie was amazing. Fast pace, razor sharp editing, no-nonsense investigation. It was really engaging. We were glued to our couch. Then came the second half where the pace began to slow down. Sluggish. I think the director should have stuck to the cop and killer chase rather than a ""big"" sub-plot of a love story. Also the killer/s were out-right gory but too loud. I must the second half spoiled the whole fun.Kamal Hassan as usual was good. He carried himself well though he has put on some weight.All in all, a good thriller but could have been better.",beautiful photographed almost thriller,i saw this movie just yesterday dvd dvd was awesome crystal clear sharp hence photography really appealed firstly i am not tamilian just movie buff see movies all languages now movie it is about hunting game between cop killers first half movie was amazing fast pace razor sharp editing no nonsense investigation it was really engaging we were glued our couch then came second half where pace began slow down sluggish i think director should have stuck cop killer chase rather than big sub plot love story also killer s were out right gory but too loud i must second half spoiled whole fun kamal hassan as usual was good he carried himself well though he has put some weight all all good thriller but could have been better,0.47082010582010586,0.14683862433862435,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.16}"
5.0,Overstylized or trying WAY too hard...,*****/10 I'm only giving it a 5 because I did enjoy almost half of the movie before it started getting too ridiculous. The movie had more style than substance. The story was going all over the place and it was turning into a really bad Akshay Kumar movie from the early 90s. I loved all the actors in the movie but it was the most unrealistic police story I've seen in a long time. It had a lot of potential in being something great. I don't know why so many indians are phrasing this movie as one of the greatest movies. What is wrong with people? I went into the movie expecting that my views would change about recent Indian cinema but it's still stayed the same. If you want to watch a good Tamil action movie watch Kaaka Kaaka.,overstylized or trying way too hard,10 im only giving it 5 because i did enjoy almost half movie before it started getting too ridiculous movie had more style than substance story was going all over place it was turning into really bad akshay kumar movie early 90s i loved all actors movie but it was most unrealistic police story ive seen long time it had lot potential being something great i dont know why so many indians are phrasing this movie as one greatest movies what is wrong with people i went into movie expecting that my views would change about recent indian cinema but its still stayed same if you want watch good tamil action movie watch kaaka kaaka,0.6,0.13134920634920635,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Worth watching if you are ready for a daring but strange plot.,"I am a telugu guy, but really fond of some tamil movies which have an appreciable standard of innovative technical and screenplay achievement. Though i do not understand the language fully, i take considerable effort to know what is happening in every scene of the movie.So, i went and watched this movie which is a Cop story...directed by Menon of Kakka Kakka fame and it has the versatile Kamal Hassan in it. Ummm, the title sounded very catchy too. Middle aged Cop hunting a serial killer on the run...wait a minute, when did you ever knew about an Indian serial killer who is methodical ?. These brothers (2 serial killers in this movie) do the killings in rural parts of Tamil Nadu and also in the creepy places near New York, USA. HELLO, this is NOT INNOVATIVE when you use two young guys as serial killers who cannot handle such a thing on their own, where experience is the main criterion and essential requirement to fool the establishment and societies in India and USA. The director got too involved with his own movie watching days (hannibal lecter kind) while writing the story line, where he tries to dwell into the behaviour of that main psycho guy (i cannot recollect his character name) in much of the second half of the movie.I expected the psychopath through-out the initial phase of the movie (just before the 2 brothers are shown to the audience) to be a seasoned professional killer who is at ease with his deeds, which then would have bought new dimensions to Kamal Hassan's character, thus making the movie more thrilling to watch. A definite disappointment for me there. The movie takes abrupt turns every 20 or 30 minutes and Kamal's character should have been more serious (i appreciate the inclusion of comic mode once a while, but it should have been greatly reduced for the sake of a thriller).I liked the overall approach of the director in trying to make a very different movie, where he successfully tried to cut through the existing mold(many such previous Indian movies had a ""responsibility"" of satisfying all the audience) of treating a cop story and making it more original to watch also taking it to the rusty criminal's door steps (i bet a real criminal of that kind should have been scared a little with Kamal's character after watching this movie). My salute to the director of the movie for handling a brave script and thats the main reason for me giving 8 out of 10. This movie will open new avenues for Indian cinema.The songs are nicely shot (i liked Neruppae and the initial title track).",worth watching if you are ready daring but strange plot,i am telugu guy but really fond some tamil movies which have appreciable standard innovative technical screenplay achievement though i do not understand language fully i take considerable effort know what is happening every scene movie so i went watched this movie which is cop story directed by menon kakka kakka fame it has versatile kamal hassan it ummm title sounded very catchy too middle aged cop hunting serial killer run wait minute when did you ever knew about indian serial killer who is methodical these brothers 2 serial killers this movie do killings rural parts tamil nadu also creepy places near new york usa hello this is not innovative when you use two young guys as serial killers who cannot handle such thing their own where experience is main criterion essential requirement fool establishment societies india usa director got too involved with his own movie watching days hannibal lecter kind while writing story line where he tries dwell into behaviour that main psycho guy i cannot recollect his character name much second half movie i expected psychopath through out initial phase movie just before 2 brothers are shown audience be seasoned professional killer who is at ease with his deeds which then would have bought new dimensions kamal hassans character thus making movie more thrilling watch definite disappointment me there movie takes abrupt turns every 20 or 30 minutes kamals character should have been more serious i appreciate inclusion comic mode once while but it should have been greatly reduced sake thriller i liked overall approach director trying make very different movie where he successfully tried cut through existing mold many such previous indian movies had responsibility satisfying all audience treating cop story making it more original watch also taking it rusty criminals door steps i bet real criminal that kind should have been scared little with kamals character after watching this movie my salute director movie handling brave script thats main reason me giving 8 out 10 this movie will open new avenues indian cinema songs are nicely shot i liked neruppae initial title track,0.5027645305514158,0.15745777446597117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
