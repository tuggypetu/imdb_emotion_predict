2.0,You'll know why Keanu turned down this crummy sequel when you see it,"I was so curious as to what they would do in the sequel of Speed, I just watched Speed today and absolutely loved it! So, I can understand why Keanu turned down the movie, first off not only the script was bad, but the coincidences were beyond ridiculous of Sandra Bullock being in the same position twice and Jason Patrick?! He was so scared of doing a great movie like The Lost Boys, but yet he couldn't hesitate to do this movie? The movie just lost it's course and didn't work on any level, if it had different characters, maybe, but these great actors should know better and check twice before signing onto these sequels.Annie is with this new policeman, Alex, and he surprises her with cruise tickets. He is planning on asking her to marry him, but that is shortly interrupted when Willaim Defoe is now the super duper bad guy. He is upset that he designed the ships computer system but gets no credit, so guess what? He decides the best way to avenge this is to blow it up! But with Alex on board... yup... you guessed it, he's gonna stop William and save the day! Good for him! Speed 2: Cruise Control was just a money maker that is truly a fake movie that was really sad. The acting was really bad and Sandra's character went from admirable to just plain annoying. Alex had no character or any sympathy. The explosions were lame and the plot was just beyond unbelievable, poor William, he was probably on medication when he said yes to making this movie. Well, just please stay away from this movie, it'll be a waste of your time.2/10",youll know why keanu turned down this crummy sequel when you see it,i was so curious as what they would do sequel speed i just watched speed today absolutely loved it so i can understand why keanu turned down movie first off not only script was bad but coincidences were beyond ridiculous sandra bullock being same position twice jason patrick he was so scared doing great movie like lost boys but yet he couldnt hesitate do this movie movie just lost its course didnt work any level if it had different characters maybe but these great actors should know better check twice before signing onto these sequels annie is with this new policeman alex he surprises her with cruise tickets he is planning asking her marry him but that is shortly interrupted when willaim defoe is now super duper bad guy he is upset that he designed ships computer system but gets no credit so guess what he decides best way avenge this is blow it up but with alex board yup you guessed it hes gonna stop william save day good him speed 2 cruise control was just money maker that is truly fake movie that was really sad acting was really bad sandras character went admirable just plain annoying alex had no character or any sympathy explosions were lame plot was just beyond unbelievable poor william he was probably medication when he said yes making this movie well just please stay away this movie itll be waste your time 2 10,0.59877469274021,-0.03410459272528235,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
3.0,Speed 2: Snooze control,"Now I liked Sandra Bullock in the original Speed. I even liked her in that film where she went into a beauty pageant. But in this monstrosity, I just wanted to slap her repeatedly and say ""What are you doing!?""She is just dire. Not in acting (well... any more than usual, anyway) but just in the way her character made you want to shake her until she regained some sense. Whoever was responsible for the script needs a good beating here. Unless I am completely mistaken, her character between the events of the first film and this one, turned into a complete and total airhead bimbo.Add in Jason Patric (who will never be leading man material) and it seems that only Willem Dafoe was having any fun. Truly awful!But it is good to see that ocean liners, which may have to weather tropical storms, apparently have windows made of glass so easy to break that anyone can hurl themselves through them on a whim. Priceless cinema.Avoid this one if you liked the original.Avoid this one if you expect a thrilling sea drama.Avoid this one if you like Sandra Bullock.Avoid this one if....well....just avoid it.",speed 2 snooze control,now i liked sandra bullock original speed i even liked her that film where she went into beauty pageant but this monstrosity i just wanted slap her repeatedly say what are you doing she is just dire not acting well any more than usual anyway but just way her character made you want shake her until she regained some sense whoever was responsible script needs good beating here unless i am completely mistaken her character between events first film this one turned into complete total airhead bimbo add jason patric who will never be leading man material it seems that only willem dafoe was having any fun truly awful but it is good see that ocean liners which may have weather tropical storms apparently have windows made glass so easy break that anyone can hurl themselves through them whim priceless cinema avoid this one if you liked original avoid this one if you expect thrilling sea drama avoid this one if you like sandra bullock avoid this one if well just avoid it,0.6212121212121212,0.26742424242424245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,Made worse by the knowledge of the brilliant film it succeeds,"Having long since broken things off with her boyfriend, Annie and her new beau plan a romantic holiday on an ocean liner. When onboard a disgruntled ex-employee of the liner disables the computer controls and sets it on a collision course while he escapes with his goods. Alex has to take him on and try to stop the ship as it `races' out of control.As if Twister hadn't done it already, Speed 2 basically showed us that the potential that was shown by De Bont's debut was clearly misplaced and he has yet to show he was really anything other than in the right place at the right time when it came to Speed. The smell of desperation is in the air from the very start when Reeves declined to star, although Bullock was more desperate and did it. This caused Annie to repeatedly state that `relationships built on etc etc never work out', all in an effort to explain it away and help the audience move on. That the film is constantly harking back to a much better film is a big problem, it would almost have been smarter just to move totally away than to retread.The plot is plain silly and never gets close to being involving. To demonstrate this, I never once gave a rats' ass what was happening - people got crushed by the boat and mangled in it's propellers (unseen) but the film (or me) never care and never lingers. Likewise the supposed big climax is unengaging and smacks of desperation - bang for buck and all that. The whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening, even when the boat swings out of control it is difficult to feel terrified as the boat slooooowly goes towards the tanker, worst come to worst people can jump off to safety. The cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside the bus concept - the vast majority of the audience will ride a bus quite often, very few of us can relate to an ocean liner! The speed is a problem and it is almost laughable it works so poorly!The cast is another problem. Bullock tries to repeat her sparky performance from the first film - when she manages it, it only feels like an impression, when she doesn't manage it she is cast as a shrieking beauty needing saving. However she also struggles from a lack of chemistry with Patric. It is a shame as he is an OK actor but not used to a pure action role and not used to not having material to work with. He lacks charisma and is quite unconvincing. Dafoe is awful; he drags the film down as much as anyone. His villain is a joke and never threatens in the way that Hopper's did (who managed to be funny and scary). It is a bad impression all round. The support cast of `innocents in peril' do much the same as the ones on the bus did, but we care less about them - they are well off and are separated from the action; those on the bus were in the thick of it and `normal' people who we could relate to.Overall this is as good a reason for not making unplanned sequels as any - there should be a board to approve all sequels to prevent cashing in! The memory of the original is cheapen by this nasty film that is uninspiring and unthrilling at best, dull and stupid at worst. De Bont never gets up a decent head of steam and he shows his inability to inject drama out of his own skill - anyone can point a camera, not everyone can (or should) direct. A dull 2 hours later, I was wondering why I wasted my time with a film that was so clearly all at sea.",made worse by knowledge brilliant film it succeeds,having long since broken things off with her boyfriend annie her new beau plan romantic holiday ocean liner when onboard disgruntled ex employee liner disables computer controls sets it collision course while he escapes with his goods alex has take him try stop ship as it races out control as if twister hadnt done it already speed 2 basically showed us that potential that was shown by de bonts debut was clearly misplaced he has yet show he was really anything other than right place at right time when it came speed smell desperation is air very start when reeves declined star although bullock was more desperate did it this caused annie repeatedly state that relationships built etc etc never work out all effort explain it away help audience move that film is constantly harking back much better film is big problem it would almost have been smarter just move totally away than retread plot is plain silly never gets close being involving demonstrate this i never once gave rats ass what was happening people got crushed by boat mangled its propellers unseen but film or me never care never lingers likewise supposed big climax is unengaging smacks desperation bang buck all that whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening even when boat swings out control it is difficult feel terrified as boat slooooowly goes towards tanker worst come worst people can jump off safety cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside bus concept vast majority audience will ride bus quite often very few us can relate ocean liner speed is problem it is almost laughable it works so poorly cast is another problem bullock tries repeat her sparky performance first film when she manages it it only feels like impression when she doesnt manage it she is cast as shrieking beauty needing saving however she also struggles lack chemistry with patric it is shame as he is ok actor but not used pure action role not used not having material work with he lacks charisma is quite unconvincing dafoe is awful he drags film down as much as anyone his villain is joke never threatens way that hoppers did who managed be funny scary it is bad impression all round support cast innocents peril do much same as ones bus did but we care less about them they are well off are separated action those bus were thick it normal people who we could relate overall this is as good reason not making unplanned sequels as any there should be board approve all sequels prevent cashing memory original is cheapen by this nasty film that is uninspiring unthrilling at best dull stupid at worst de bont never gets up decent head steam he shows his inability inject drama out his own skill anyone can point camera not everyone can or should direct dull 2 hours later i was wondering why i wasted my time with film that was so clearly all at sea,0.5095883201765554,-0.06678083354553944,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.5}"
3.0,"This is all you get when you spend $120,000,000 to make a film?!","""Speed"" was a surprise hit movie. While it cost about $30,000,000 to make, it made back more than four times the cost. So, some Hollywood executives (with a collective IQ similar to that of a gerbil) thought...'if we do a sequel, we must spend $120,000,000 on it because THAT is why the first movie was such a success'. Not surprisingly, the movie tanked and it somehow has made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list--the 100 worst ranked major releases of all time.In the original, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock work to prevent a bus from exploding and killing folks. Now, because this is an overbloated sequel, they've placed the story aboard a cruise ship...which is also out of control and will kill everyone unless our heroes save it....though this time Reeves refused to reprise his role. So, they cast the rather bland Jason Patric in the lead...who offered little improvement other than he was very good at using sign language in one small scene.How bad is this film? Well, not bad enough to be on the Bottom 100 list. So why is it on the list? After loving the first film, so many folks expected more of the same...and got nothing but a dull overblown action picture with little in the way to interest viewers....and I think THAT is why it made the list....because it disappointed so badly. Instead, I wish IMDB had a list for films with the worst ratio of cost to enjoyability of the film...in which case ""Speed 2"" would easily make the top 100.By the way, this sequel ended up spending nearly as much for ONE crash scene as the budget for all of ""Speed""! And, after paying $11,500,000 just to obtain Sandra Bullock for this film, you can only assume that the film simply had nothing left to pay competent writers. Instead, I assume, they hired some penguins to write the script....some very, very dull and untalented penguins!",this is all you get when you spend 120 000 000 make film,speed was surprise hit movie while it cost about 30 000 000 make it made back more than four times cost so some hollywood executives with collective iq similar that gerbil thought if we do sequel we must spend 120 000 000 it because that is why first movie was such success not surprisingly movie tanked it somehow has made it imdbs infamous bottom 100 list 100 worst ranked major releases all time original keanu reeves sandra bullock work prevent bus exploding killing folks now because this is overbloated sequel theyve placed story aboard cruise ship which is also out control will kill everyone unless our heroes save it though this time reeves refused reprise his role so they cast rather bland jason patric lead who offered little improvement other than he was very good at using sign language one small scene how bad is this film well not bad enough be bottom 100 list so why is it list after loving first film so many folks expected more same got nothing but dull overblown action picture with little way interest viewers i think that is why it made list because it disappointed so badly instead i wish imdb had list films with worst ratio cost enjoyability film which case speed 2 would easily make top 100 by way this sequel ended up spending nearly as much one crash scene as budget all speed after paying 11 500 000 just obtain sandra bullock this film you can only assume that film simply had nothing left pay competent writers instead i assume they hired some penguins write script some very very dull untalented penguins,0.5317216117216116,-0.009145299145299135,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,"slower, poorer...","The enormous success of ""Speed"" in 1994 could only create a (poor) sequel. The less we can say is that the scriptwriters have got a great narrow-mindedness. Here, the bus was replaced by a cruise ship and the movie doesn't work, partly due to this: a cruise ship can't go as fast as a bus even if it's trapped.Then, Keanu Reeves' absence can terribly be felt. His replacement is so colorless and listless that Sandra Bullock almost steals the show from him. Moreover, as a rule, ""Speed2: cruise control"" is supposed to be a suspense film. Well, in this case, where's the suspense? The filmmaker doesn't succeed in creating the suspense and he even can't create a disturbing atmosphere. The end of the movie falls into the ridiculous when the ship is entering the dock and destroys everything in its path.At the end: one of the worst sequels ever made.",slower poorer,enormous success speed 1994 could only create poor sequel less we can say is that scriptwriters have got great narrow mindedness here bus was replaced by cruise ship movie doesnt work partly due this cruise ship cant go as fast as bus even if its trapped then keanu reeves absence can terribly be felt his replacement is so colorless listless that sandra bullock almost steals show him moreover as rule speed2 cruise control is supposed be suspense film well this case wheres suspense filmmaker doesnt succeed creating suspense he even cant create disturbing atmosphere end movie falls into ridiculous when ship is entering dock destroys everything its path at end one worst sequels ever made,0.5661111111111111,-0.17583333333333334,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
3.0,"Everyone to the lifeboats! Women, children and paying moviegoers first.","Let the screenwriters and director go down with the ship I say. As the sun sets slowly in the West, Speed 2: Cruise Control sinks without a trace. The sequel to 1995's surprise drive-a-bus hit has barely caused a ripple at the box office. The threadbare script is mostly to blame. It consists almost entirely of simplistic, exclamation-point dialogue like, ""We're gonna crash!"" ""We're going too fast!"" ""Do something!"" ""This isn't happening!"" ""We gotta get him outta here!"" ""There's not much time left!"" and the ever useful, ""Oh, s**t!""There is, indeed, not much time left for characterization or interpersonal drama. Speed 2 gets off to a winky-dinky start with Sandra Bullock taking yet another disastrous driving test. Bullock's natural charm can go only so far, however, and you keep wanting to throw her a life preserver or a new script. As people drop dead around her, she must continue to whine about the ruination of her vacation. Bullock doesn't get a lot of help from blandish co-star Jason Patric, who plays her cop boyfriend. The nasty, computer-literate villain, who likes to attach blood-sucking leeches to his body, is certainly quirky. Willem Dafoe, who's pretty quirky himself, does what he can with the overriding vagaries of his character's mad-bomber motivation. The action bits are fairly frequent, but seem anemic when compared to what else is available to fans of such. Director Jan De Bont fared much better in 1996 with the flying cows and funnel clouds of Twister. Speed 2 ends up with some highly anticipated destruction as the cruise ship plows into the island of St. Martin. No matter, as I hear the whole thing was computer-generated anyway. This cruise is no carnival, and could have used a cameo by Kathie Lee.

Sat through the entire thing feeling like I was at sea in a teacup (in the middle of a cyclone), made worse by the terrible acting (even Temuera Morrison wasn't up to par in this) and lame 'action scenes'. The baddie wasn't bad enough, his reasons for hijacking the ship was just plain dumb, and Keanu Reeves, where the heck was he? This whole flick was over-the-top-bad, trying waaaaay too hard to equal Speed One. But putting all the action on a cruise ship - a SMALL cruise ship at that? There was twice as much action in the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed One!I found the gigantic tanker explosion, the ship crashing through the dock at the end TOO long and boring.

1.0,A big boat full of crap,"Speed. the first movie wasn't that bad, and so the other day I decided to watch speed 2, which appeared on television here. (god knows why) After 2 minutes I realized why Keanu didn't accept the role for this second part. The entire movie is filled with extremely bad timed jokes and unrealism beyond recognition... The killer being sandra bullock chainsawing open a fire door with people trapped behind that door (as if there wouldn't be an emergency handle, and what the **** is a chainsaw doing near the cabins?!?) After completing this task sandra keeps the chainsaw in the opening she just made. the people look at her and say she has to get out of the way with the chainsaw. she looks back, doesn't respond. They have to ask AGAIN and then she's all like: ""oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, sorry sorry sorry."" taking another 5 minutes to apologize before she finally removes the roaring blade....another great feature about this movie is the fact that people have to die 4 times before actually dying, or other impossible things that somehow the actors can make possible with their magic wand or something. a nice example: **** SPOILER **** The bad guy (i didn't even bother remembering his name) is flying one of those water planes. He isn't really paying attention as he flies over an oil tanker and hits the mast with a speed over 50 mph at minimum... Instead of crashing down or getting hit off course, nooo... the plane instantly stops and gets stuck at the top of the mast. The bad guy naturally hasn't a scratch. Then suddenly the plane decides to explode, taking the entire oil tanker with it. Of course there couldn't be any safety measures on board, since oil isn't flammable at all. anyway my conclusion is that speed 2 is a blown up piece of poo, and should have never been made. this is one of those movies just to get people in the seats, leaving them to die of boredom in the theatre.

4.0,Episodic sequel lacking the original's thematic strength,"An American action adventure thriller and sequel to the 1994 hit ""Speed"". Sadly, this follow up set on a slow moving cruise ship lacked the impetus of the original's theme-as-action. It has some very impressive stunts and it never fails to look busy, but the story is crammed with too many action events and has a drab script. The dialogue is cliched, the characterization as thin as gruel, the plot devices overfamiliar, and the action sequences fail to generate any excitement. Jason Patric fails to fully impose himself as the lead and Sandra Bullock is disappointingly sidelined into producing a frenetic character and she ends up overworking her character. Willem Dafoe looks the part but acts tough rather than playing tough. All in all, it's action packed but froths over. The finale does justify sticking with it because back in 1997 it was most expensive stunt ever filmed.",episodic sequel lacking originals thematic strength,american action adventure thriller sequel 1994 hit speed sadly this follow up set slow moving cruise ship lacked impetus originals theme as action it has some very impressive stunts it never fails look busy but story is crammed with too many action events has drab script dialogue is cliched characterization as thin as gruel plot devices overfamiliar action sequences fail generate any excitement jason patric fails fully impose himself as lead sandra bullock is disappointingly sidelined into producing frenetic character she ends up overworking her character willem dafoe looks part but acts tough rather than playing tough all all its action packed but froths over finale does justify sticking with it because back 1997 it was most expensive stunt ever filmed,0.4098484848484848,-0.0558080808080808,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.04, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.83}"
1.0,A film as good as being trapped on a sinking ship,"I like Sandra Bullock. I do not like all her movies and do not think she is a particular good actor, but I still like her. However, she does nothing for the movie, neither do any of the other actors.It is an endless amount of bad scenes, with a terrible plot-line, terrible jokes, terrible filming, terrible acting. The music in the background is just adding to the annoying experience.

2.0,I rather have Sandra Bullock by herself,"Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) broke up with Jack. Relationships based on extreme circumstances rarely ever work. She's been dating a nice simple safe beach patrol cop Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) for the last 2 months. She runs into him taking a bad guy as a part of the SWAT team. He convinces her to go on a cruise to work out their relationship. John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) is a disgruntle employee who uses his computer skills and inside knowledge to hijack the ship sending it into danger. He forces the passengers to abandon ship. Not everybody gets out as deaf girl Drew is trapped in the elevator. Alex decides to stay behind when he suspects foul play.It's really bad that Jack doesn't return. It's like a Die Hard movie without John McClane. Honestly, if they can't get Keanu Reeves back, I rather have Sandra Bullock save the day by herself. The movie never recovers from it. The first Speed is a manufactured plot but the writing is so good that it never felt fake. This is the exact opposite. Every move in the story feels fake. The first one pulls the audience right in. This one never does. The final boat crash has tons of destruction but it's played almost exclusively for laughs. It feels more like a spoof.

6.0,Not As Bad As Some Reviews,"I'll admit from the off, that I am bias. I love Sandra Bullock. With her gorgeous girl next door looks, I adore her, and will usually give anything she is in a chance. Hence I recently watched the universally panned ""Speed 2""Plot In A Paragraph: Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new beau Alex (Jason Patrick, who I last saw in ""Lost Boys"") are taking a vacation in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is hijacked by a villain (Willem Defoe) who hacked into the ship's computer system. As they are trapped aboard the ship, Annie and Alex work with the ship's first officer (The guy who plays Jango Fett in Star Wars) to try to stop the ship, which they discover is programmed to crash into an oil tanker.OK is it as bad as people say?? No it's far from it. It just doesn't live up to the first movie. A lot of sequels suffer from that problem. Had this movie just being called ""Cruise Control"" and references to the first movie dropped, it may have done better. To put it simply, this is just another routine action movie.

1.0,Seasick? You're Not The Only One!,"I heard the terrible reviews for this movie, but I decided to give it a try, mostly because of Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric, but even their on-screen chemistry could not save it. Why did they even bother to make a sequel? SPEED was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, where everything magically worked. SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL, on the other hand, seemed destined for self-destruction from the minute it was put into production. I have nothing but respect and admiration for Jason Patric, an intelligent, underrated actor, whose performances are outstanding, but he is obviously so far out of his element here, the viewer picks up on his disinterest and listlessness like a skin rash. What was he doing, paying off a debt? Sandra Bullock is a great lady, but her character is somewhat annoying here, and not really given much to work with. I can see why Keanu Reeves turned this masterpiece of waste down, and why both Bullock and Patric regret this project. Willem DaFoe, to his credit, tries hard as the villain, but he is just an unintentionally comic and moronic madman, and the rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts. Where's Dennis Hopper when you need him? An action-packed thriller? A love story? How about just a severe case of seasickness? Eeeeewwwwwwww . . . . . .

1.0,"Just bad, pretty much any way you look at it","From the fact that Reeves himself turned down the opportunity to star in this sequel to the pitifully awful pun in the subtitle of the film, this is just so obviously a bad idea, and one with pretty poor execution, at that. The plot is silly, and a weak attempt at recapturing the essence of the first(which, in turn, was a somewhat half-hearted attempt at recreating that of Die Hard, a film that is far superior to either). Taking the idea(which basically originated in Die Hard... Speed just gave it a shot of, well, speed) out to sea was never a particularly interesting one(what does a colossal cruiser far out on the water have to offer that a bus that needs to keep a high speed on the freeway doesn't?), and what little potential it may have had is hardly utilized. The pacing is, much like that of the first, too intense. We aren't given time to stop and breathe, to take in all the(as a result, downright overwhelming) action. The acting, save for one or two parts, is unimpressive. Odd, seeing as such talented names are on the cast. Morrison and Dafoe have given quite good performances both before and after this film... heck, even Bullock has a fair acting job or two behind her. The dialog is dreadful. The characters are half-heartedly written. Why is Annie now such a crummy driver? In the first one, she was said to be fine behind the wheel. And who thought of adding that annoying Scotsman? Anyone who's seen the film will know what I mean. And no, it wasn't his nationality... it was all his character. The clichés return... the new villain also cackles, there's a new hero cop, and the damsel is, yet again, in distress. All in all, this probably shouldn't have been made at all, and it certainly shouldn't have been a sequel to Speed(which, while by no means great, was certainly a whole lot better than this). I recommend this to the fans of the first and of the Die Hard type films who *must* see it, no matter how bad they hear it is(you know who you are!). Everyone else should probably just avoid. 1/10",just bad pretty much any way you look at it,fact that reeves himself turned down opportunity star this sequel pitifully awful pun subtitle film this is just so obviously bad idea one with pretty poor execution at that plot is silly weak attempt at recapturing essence first which turn was somewhat half hearted attempt at recreating that die hard film that is far superior either taking idea which basically originated die hard speed just gave it shot well speed out sea was never particularly interesting one what does colossal cruiser far out water have offer that bus that needs keep high speed freeway doesnt what little potential it may have had is hardly utilized pacing is much like that first too intense we arent given time stop breathe take all as result downright overwhelming action acting save one or two parts is unimpressive odd seeing as such talented names are cast morrison dafoe have given quite good performances both before after this film heck even bullock has fair acting job or two behind her dialog is dreadful characters are half heartedly written why is annie now such crummy driver first one she was said be fine behind wheel who thought adding that annoying scotsman anyone whos seen film will know what i mean no it wasnt his nationality it was all his character clich s return new villain also cackles theres new hero cop damsel is yet again distress all all this probably shouldnt have been made at all it certainly shouldnt have been sequel speed which while by no means great was certainly whole lot better than this i recommend this fans first die hard type films who must see it no matter how bad they hear it is you know who you are everyone else should probably just avoid 1 10,0.5892498434479565,-0.018557406953633344,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,A Mutilation of a Franchise,"How can this happen? You take an exhilarating film like ""Speed"" which was a big success at the box office, approved by fans and critics alike and then you follow it up with a sequel that fails to measure up. What went wrong? I've seen a lot of bad sequels or good ones that were inferior to its predecessor, but this is the worst one of them all. The thing that angered me the most was that it possessed a lacking effort to even try to even stay in sync with the original ""Speed"" even though it took an enormous budget to make this. The whole idea of the story is completely illogical and convoluted. ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" sees Sandra Bullock again caught in the centerfold of another hijacking only this time instead of on bus, we are now on a cruise ship complete with dumb passengers and an equally stupid crew. The main baddie is Willem Dafoe who's mission is to mess up the computer systems on the ship that he designed to that it will go on a collision course with a tanker while also taking in possession valuable jewelry.Nobody in the audience wanted this movie to be made and though I never really care much about popular opinions, I have to say that I agree with the majority of the fans. There were signs that this film could have been great. Bullock always has a great deal of charm. Director Jan De Bont was successful in thriller films at the time with ""Speed"" and ""Twister"". Willem Dafoe has been in many great films over the years. It's just a shame that this film was so bad it was beyond repair.""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" demonstrates that just because it was a big budget film, doesn't mean that it'll guarantee high approval from the masses. The original ""Speed"" had shoestring budget coming in and it became box office gold. Sure it was surreal and illogical, but it gave high tension, a scary but effective atmosphere and character that you truly care about. The sequel, you don't find any of that. Even the action sequences lack any drama or intensity you can be invested in. It's just there for action and nothing more.De Bont's strategy is simple, keep the action running and let the action do all the talking. And if he thinks for one minute that the constant shaking of the camera has any kind of lasting impact on the action scenes, he is seriously wrong. The only thing it does is make your stomach churn.So now we find Bullock back as Annie Porter, who is now in new relationship with a cop named Alex (Jason Patric) who surprises her with two tickets on a luxury cruise, even though she still laments that her ex-boyfriend, Jack (Keanu Reeves from the original ""Speed"" who cleverly backed out) gave her an anniversary gift of pepper spray which resulted her spending some time in an emergency room. While they're enjoying a relaxing vacation, a madman named John Geiger (Dafoe) has nothing but evil intentions as he wants to crash the ship into a tanker and steal some loot.As a rule, most villains are not evil for the sake of being evil, there's always a method to their madness. In Geiger's case he was the one responsible for installing the computer panel on the ship. But one day he reported sick, the next day he was fired where he uses leeches as medicinal remedies for his declining health. It also explains the reasons for his anger.Part of the reason why I saw this movie was because I naturally enjoy Sandra Bullock and her character is easy to become sympathetic with. She's easy to like, makes a few wisecracks here and there and tries to make this movie a bit interesting. Once Geiger takes over the ship, we hope that the number of deaths are few and far between.Sadly the rescue mission getting people off the ship and into the lifeboat was tedious and boring. Though I did wish them that they'd return to shore safely, the scene was badly affected by the soundtrack from composer Mark Mancina.The biggest blunder in ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" is when the ship loses control and glides into a coastal town located in the island of St. Martin. While civilians can spot surfers, sailboats and ski boats a mile away. But they all can't see a giant luxury liner coming their way. The most labouring part is that the sequence lasts over minutes long and no one sees it coming until it's too late.Although Bullock has an adorable smile, but her smile can be featured in many scenes where there's very little to smile about. When the oil tanker explodes and dozens of people are killed in the process she's still holds her head up with glee like it doesn't phase her in the least. When Alex slips the engagement ring on her finger, her shiny teeth gills the air without knowing that she's to embark on another dangerous misadventure.Is it just me but in movies doesn't it seem ironic that couples seem to form when something terrible seems to happen? It might also happens in the real world too. Maybe this movie would have been better if everything was just normal the way it is. In this movie too many things happen with very little to keep you intrigued.",mutilation franchise,how can this happen you take exhilarating film like speed which was big success at box office approved by fans critics alike then you follow it up with sequel that fails measure up what went wrong ive seen lot bad sequels or good ones that were inferior its predecessor but this is worst one them all thing that angered me most was that it possessed lacking effort even try even stay sync with original speed even though it took enormous budget make this whole idea story is completely illogical convoluted speed 2 cruise control sees sandra bullock again caught centerfold another hijacking only this time instead bus we are now cruise ship complete with dumb passengers equally stupid crew main baddie is willem dafoe whos mission is mess up computer systems ship that he designed that it will go collision course with tanker while also taking possession valuable jewelry nobody audience wanted this movie be made though i never really care much about popular opinions i have say that i agree with majority fans there were signs that this film could have been great bullock always has great deal charm director jan de bont was successful thriller films at time with speed twister willem dafoe has been many great films over years its just shame that this film was so bad it was beyond repair speed 2 cruise control demonstrates that just because it was big budget film doesnt mean that itll guarantee high approval masses original speed had shoestring budget coming it became box office gold sure it was surreal illogical but it gave high tension scary but effective atmosphere character that you truly care about sequel you dont find any that even action sequences lack any drama or intensity you can be invested its just there action nothing more de bonts strategy is simple keep action running let action do all talking if he thinks one minute that constant shaking camera has any kind lasting impact action scenes he is seriously wrong only thing it does is make your stomach churn so now we find bullock back as annie porter who is now new relationship with cop named alex jason patric who surprises her with two tickets luxury cruise even though she still laments that her ex boyfriend jack keanu reeves original speed who cleverly backed out gave her anniversary gift pepper spray which resulted her spending some time emergency room while theyre enjoying relaxing vacation madman named john geiger dafoe has nothing but evil intentions as he wants crash ship into tanker steal some loot as rule most villains are not evil sake being evil theres always method their madness geigers case he was one responsible installing computer panel ship but one day he reported sick next day he was fired where he uses leeches as medicinal remedies his declining health it also explains reasons his anger part reason why i saw this movie was because i naturally enjoy sandra bullock her character is easy become sympathetic with shes easy like makes few wisecracks here there tries make this movie bit interesting once geiger takes over ship we hope that number deaths are few far between sadly rescue mission getting people off ship into lifeboat was tedious boring though i did wish them that theyd return shore safely scene was badly affected by soundtrack composer mark mancina biggest blunder speed 2 cruise control is when ship loses control glides into coastal town located island st martin while civilians can spot surfers sailboats ski boats mile away but they all cant see giant luxury liner coming their way most labouring part is that sequence lasts over minutes long no one sees it coming until its too late although bullock has adorable smile but her smile can be featured many scenes where theres very little smile about when oil tanker explodes dozens people are killed process shes still holds her head up with glee like it doesnt phase her least when alex slips engagement ring her finger her shiny teeth gills air without knowing that shes embark another dangerous misadventure is it just me but movies doesnt it seem ironic that couples seem form when something terrible seems happen it might also happens real world too maybe this movie would have been better if everything was just normal way it is this movie too many things happen with very little keep you intrigued,0.5683523911554215,0.03906139315230225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"
3.0,No Speed whatsoever,"Whoever said changing what works is the best idea for a sequel clearly never seen Speed 2:Cruise Control. The only highlight of the film is that Sandra Bullock reprising her role as Anne.But as talented as Sandra Bullock is not even she could have saved this film. It follows the same formula as Speed did however this time the film take places on a cruise ship. Now whoever thought this was a good idea is clearly a king of fools.Willem Dafoe as John Geiger, the main antagonist in the film is just how could I put it? Not as smart or dangerous as Howard was in the last film.Speed 2 clearly was made to try and make a few bucks. While Sandra is a wonderful actress and Willem play a twisted character it just hard to find anything worth wild about this film.The acting is pretty much forced not one single out performance in this film.

1.0,Another one of those sequels,"You all know what I mean. No one has any original idea so they find a movie that was popular a few years back that did not necessarily need a sequel and then they make one with little thought going into it. ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" is not only one of those movies, it might be the worst movie I have ever seen that did that. The film stars Sandra Bullock, reprising her role from the original ""Speed"", and a new male lead played by Jason Patric, taking over for Keanu Reeves who smartly bailed out. The villain is played by Willem Dafoe who once worked for the company that made the cruise ship's autopilot and was fired when he became sick. With revenge on the mind, he takes control of the cruise ship and plans to crash it all to get revenge and steal some jewelry.As part of their anniversary, Alex (Patric) and Annie (Bullock) go on a Caribbean Cruise. The film's antagonist John Geiger (Dafoe), takes control of the ship and forces the crew and passengers to abandon ship on threat of blowing the ship up. A small group of passengers and crew are left on board and it's up to Alex, Annie, first mate Juliano (Tempura Morrison), and the small remainder of the crew to stop the cruise ship before it is forced to crash.A line that Bullock's character uses to describe her relationship with Alex is, ""We know nothing about each other."" Ironically, that is how it is with the majority of the characters, including the two leads. The most we know about our leads is that they are in a relationship, Alex is a cop, Annie is a terrible driver, and any other detail that the audience might remember from Annie that we learned in the first ""Speed"". The only character we get to know is Geiger and he is not very interesting. In the first ""Speed"", we got to learn a little bit about some of the more minor characters on the bus such as Stephens (Alan Ruck), but in ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", at the most we either get to see who their family is or are told what their job is. We get nothing beyond that. The only character who might be a little memorable is the little girl named Drew (Christine Firkins) due to her being able to take care of herself better than most of the adults in the movie and her creepy line asking Alex to wait for her. Another problem with the film is the actors and the acting. Throughout the whole film, the actors seem uninterested and to not be on their A- game. Bullock is the most obvious example of this. While Bullock is a good actor, she was not trying and sounded more like a whiny child than a person who has been in a similar situation before and can be cool- headed. The next biggest problem is that the film is a one and a half hour story that is told in two hours. There is a chase between Alex and Geiger at the hour and ten minute mark where it could have ended the entire film then and there. However, the movie keeps going, the remainder of the time being filled up with the cruise ship having to avoid an oil tanker and then it crashing into a harbor-side town.With a story that over-stays its welcome, boring characters, weak usage of comic relief, lacking any tension, with a cliché ending and being overall stupid, ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" is a prime example of movie sequels with little thought put into it. I will say that one positive thing is that it does not feel like it insults the audience, but that is about it. My advise? Watch ""Speed"" and stay as far away from this as you can.",another one those sequels,you all know what i mean no one has any original idea so they find movie that was popular few years back that did not necessarily need sequel then they make one with little thought going into it speed 2 cruise control is not only one those movies it might be worst movie i have ever seen that did that film stars sandra bullock reprising her role original speed new male lead played by jason patric taking over keanu reeves who smartly bailed out villain is played by willem dafoe who once worked company that made cruise ships autopilot was fired when he became sick with revenge mind he takes control cruise ship plans crash it all get revenge steal some jewelry as part their anniversary alex patric annie bullock go caribbean cruise films antagonist john geiger dafoe takes control ship forces crew passengers abandon ship threat blowing ship up small group passengers crew are left board its up alex annie first mate juliano tempura morrison small remainder crew stop cruise ship before it is forced crash line that bullocks character uses describe her relationship with alex is we know nothing about each other ironically that is how it is with majority characters including two leads most we know about our leads is that they are relationship alex is cop annie is terrible driver any other detail that audience might remember annie that we learned first speed only character we get know is geiger he is not very interesting first speed we got learn little bit about some more minor characters bus such as stephens alan ruck but speed 2 cruise control at most we either get see who their family is or are told what their job is we get nothing beyond that only character who might be little memorable is little girl named drew christine firkins due her being able take care herself better than most adults movie her creepy line asking alex wait her another problem with film is actors acting throughout whole film actors seem uninterested not be their game bullock is most obvious example this while bullock is good actor she was not trying sounded more like whiny child than person who has been similar situation before can be cool headed next biggest problem is that film is one half hour story that is told two hours there is chase between alex geiger at hour ten minute mark where it could have ended entire film then there however movie keeps going remainder time being filled up with cruise ship having avoid oil tanker then it crashing into harbor side town with story that over stays its welcome boring characters weak usage comic relief lacking any tension with clich ending being overall stupid speed 2 cruise control is prime example movie sequels with little thought put into it i will say that one positive thing is that it does not feel like it insults audience but that is about it my advise watch speed stay as far away this as you can,0.535762219551282,0.018041593822843833,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
