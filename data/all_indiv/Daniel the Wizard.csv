3,Rest in peace,"The main reason why I watched this movie that is often described as one of the worst of all times is what appears to be Daniel Kublbock's tragic suicide that occured less than two weeks ago. The actor, businessman and musician jumped off a cruise ship into icy water and his body hasn't been recovered yet. Daniel Kublbock has always been a tragic character evoking both disgust and sympathy and who obviously had his share of mental struggles. His parents had wanted a daughter and separated in his early childhood. His mother was apparently an alcoholic who used to hit him sometimes while his relationship with his father was ambivalent. Daniel Kublbock auditioned for the first edition of a reality talent show when he was just seventeen years old. He wore androgynous clothes, appeared to be overtly emotional and had very dramatic, loud and unskilled vocals. Daniel Kublbock was looking for fame to find his own identity but refused to accept that he didn't have much talent and failed to understand that he was used by producers to have a clown in their show that people could make fun of. Againt all odds, many female teenagers pitied him or even saw themselves in this sympathetically confused being and made his songs and records more popular than anyone would have predicted. Daniel the Wizard was released at the height of his career. Instead of helping him find his fame and identity, the media attention had its share of negative impacts on him. Daniel Kublbock openly identified as bisexual, then admitted being homosexual and ended up claiming he was transgender shortly before his death. His physical appearance also shifted drastically as he looked quite androgynous as a teenager, then gave himself the look of a serious male businessman before adapting a feminine look with dresses and heavy makeup. His music also changed from anglophone pop rock music over Latin pop to a mixture of blues and jazz. Daniel Kublbock's fate is tragic because he never found his true identity and his erratic behaviour gave him a few moments of glory but also a few moments of resentment. Blaming those who bullied him because of his at times annoying behaviour is only partially accurate as his family, managers and friends should have helped him deal with his mental issues first instead of supporting him being watched by millions on television when he was still legally a child.Ironically, much of this torn character can also be found in this movie that mixes fantasy elements and documentary aspects. Daniel Kublbock is seen going completely crazy on stage at one moment and sitting thoughtfully in an isolated room in the next scene. The film portrays a young female teenager who admires the unique and different singer while male teenagers despise him for his erratic behaviour. This film actually shows us who Daniel Kublbock really was and how he was really perceived by society. These two elements alone make the movie bearable and justify a slightly generous rating.The rest of this film is a catastrophe. The plot is beyond ridiculous. The acting performances are stiff. The camera work is shaky. The sound is unsteady. The movie mostly consists of concert footage weirdly intertwined with poorly scripted fantasy elements. While other bad movies such as The Room show a certain degree of passion for filmmaking or are at least entertaining like Samurai Cop, Daniel the Wizard is neither passionate nor entertaining. Despite its short length of only eighty-one minutes, it feels incredibly stretched and could have been cut in half. The movie righteously sold very poorly but is today considered a cult flick because of its flaws. Honestly, those flaws are so amateurish that they aren't even worth discussing. Daniel the Wizard is only interesting to watch if you are intrigued by the lead actor's tragic fate. If you come here expecting hilarious entertainment, you have to looke elsewhere.Calling this film one of the worst ever made would be exaggerated. Describing Daniel the Wizard as unsuccessful low budget mash-up of random documentary elements and weird fantasy parts is more accurate. This movie is a sympathetic wreck. Such seemed to be the life of its lead character as well. May Daniel Kublbock rest in peace.",rest peace,main reason why i watched this movie that is often described as one worst all times is what appears be daniel kublbocks tragic suicide that occured less than two weeks ago actor businessman musician jumped off cruise ship into icy water his body hasnt been recovered yet daniel kublbock has always been tragic character evoking both disgust sympathy who obviously had his share mental struggles his parents had wanted daughter separated his early childhood his mother was apparently alcoholic who used hit him sometimes while his relationship with his father was ambivalent daniel kublbock auditioned first edition reality talent show when he was just seventeen years old he wore androgynous clothes appeared be overtly emotional had very dramatic loud unskilled vocals daniel kublbock was looking fame find his own identity but refused accept that he didnt have much talent failed understand that he was used by producers have clown their show that people could make fun againt all odds many female teenagers pitied him or even saw themselves this sympathetically confused being made his songs records more popular than anyone would have predicted daniel wizard was released at height his career instead helping him find his fame identity media attention had its share negative impacts him daniel kublbock openly identified as bisexual then admitted being homosexual ended up claiming he was transgender shortly before his death his physical appearance also shifted drastically as he looked quite androgynous as teenager then gave himself look serious male businessman before adapting feminine look with dresses heavy makeup his music also changed anglophone pop rock music over latin pop mixture blues jazz daniel kublbocks fate is tragic because he never found his true identity his erratic behaviour gave him few moments glory but also few moments resentment blaming those who bullied him because his at times annoying behaviour is only partially accurate as his family managers friends should have helped him deal with his mental issues first instead supporting him being watched by millions television when he was still legally child ironically much this torn character can also be found this movie that mixes fantasy elements documentary aspects daniel kublbock is seen going completely crazy stage at one moment sitting thoughtfully isolated room next scene film portrays young female teenager who admires unique different singer while male teenagers despise him his erratic behaviour this film actually shows us who daniel kublbock really was how he was really perceived by society these two elements alone make movie bearable justify slightly generous rating rest this film is catastrophe plot is beyond ridiculous acting performances are stiff camera work is shaky sound is unsteady movie mostly consists concert footage weirdly intertwined with poorly scripted fantasy elements while other bad movies such as room show certain degree passion filmmaking or are at least entertaining like samurai cop daniel wizard is neither passionate nor entertaining despite its short length only eighty one minutes it feels incredibly stretched could have been cut half movie righteously sold very poorly but is today considered cult flick because its flaws honestly those flaws are so amateurish that they arent even worth discussing daniel wizard is only interesting watch if you are intrigued by lead actors tragic fate if you come here expecting hilarious entertainment you have looke elsewhere calling this film one worst ever made would be exaggerated describing daniel wizard as unsuccessful low budget mash up random documentary elements weird fantasy parts is more accurate this movie is sympathetic wreck such seemed be life its lead character as well may daniel kublbock rest peace,0.49981509625126636,-0.04060283687943262,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1,"Nearly impossible to track down, but worth it.","It's unfortunate that the only place this can be tracked down is Germany's Amazon. As much as they may be sick of it, this is a bad movie buff's wet dream. It's unintentionally funny from start to finish, even if you can't understand a word of the dialog. The mistaken ""consummate entertainer"" at the heart of this mess, Daniel Küblböck, is a sexless clown who spends the entire film in old lady sweaters while he writes the most banal, oppressively bland pop songs imaginable. Some goth weirdos show up to stalk Daniel outside his home and backstage at his concerts, muttering their intentions while Daniel croons away like a dying cat. They're lead by a shady nogoodnik who bares a distracting resemblance to Peter Stormare. Their acting, especially that of the long haired, brooding guy in black leather had me laughing out loud. An actual ""wizard"" of sorts shows up at one point as well, but what his significance is, and whether he's simply a product of Daniel's diseased mind, is totally incomprehensible to me.There are far more unbearable films to pick up for Bad Movie Night.

1,In one word: Manure ...,"Let me tell you a little story: having once worked in a video store, my boss had ordered 15 copies of Daniel der Zauberer"" – two for rentals, 13 to be put into sale. He assured me that this was a wise choice since, at the time, the name Daniel Küblböck was in mouth and ears of many pre-teens and teenagers. Küblböck made second place in Germany's ""Superstar""-version (""DSDS"") and was groomed to become Germany's version of Michael Jackson; music and persona being as artificial as the tip of Jackos nose. Surely a few handsome bucks would come from the rentals.Need I still mention it? Neither rental copy ever left the store. Not once. After having reduced the price to 50 cents, my boss tried to give the DVDs away for free, causing two copies to leave the store. One customer who took a copy assured me that this was meant as Christmas present for 'that guy dating his ex-girlfriend'; the other copy was taken by a drunk who wandered the adult section and who didn't own a DVD-player.Whatever happened to the remaining 13 copies, you ask? Unless my boss has used them as make-shift beverage coasters, they remain the only films in that shop to carry the label ""Free"".Is ""Daniel der Zauberer"" the fabled 'worst movie ever'? Well, sure ""Daniel der Zauberer"" makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" look like a Cecil B DeMille picture – but it's by far not the worst film ever. Oh, by no means. Just check out any other Ulli Lommels production, for example ""The Zodiac Killer"", ""Black Daliah"", ""BTK Killer"" or ""Green River Killer"". They're all god-awful; all bad enough to turn your best friend into your worst enemy.You might wonder why I bother to write a review about such manure: well, it's fun to make fun of movies that are worst than anything you've every recorded with your cell phone.And now you asked me how many points I give and to pass judgement over this film – to paraphrase the ""Black Adder"": good sirs and madams, I wouldn't pass water over ""Daniel der Zauberer"".",one word manure,let me tell you little story having once worked video store my boss had ordered 15 copies daniel der zauberer two rentals 13 be put into sale he assured me that this was wise choice since at time name daniel k blb ck was mouth ears many pre teens teenagers k blb ck made second place germanys superstar version dsds was groomed become germanys version michael jackson music persona being as artificial as tip jackos nose surely few handsome bucks would come rentals need i still mention it neither rental copy ever left store not once after having reduced price 50 cents my boss tried give dvds away free causing two copies leave store one customer who took copy assured me that this was meant as christmas present that guy dating his ex girlfriend other copy was taken by drunk who wandered adult section who didnt own dvd player whatever happened remaining 13 copies you ask unless my boss has used them as make shift beverage coasters they remain only films that shop carry label free is daniel der zauberer fabled worst movie ever well sure daniel der zauberer makes plan 9 outer space look like cecil b demille picture but its by far not worst film ever oh by no means just check out any other ulli lommels production example zodiac killer black daliah btk killer or green river killer theyre all god awful all bad enough turn your best friend into your worst enemy you might wonder why i bother write review about such manure well its fun make fun movies that are worst than anything youve every recorded with your cell phone now you asked me how many points i give pass judgement over this film paraphrase black adder good sirs madams i wouldnt pass water over daniel der zauberer,0.6131172839506174,0.023032407407407404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1,This one is really bad,"In few words: This movie simply sucks. To be frank it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen.There are huge problems with the concept of the story. Some might argue about the (non existing) abilities of Daniel Kübelbock as an actor. However you could imagine a story with Daniel Kübelbock playing himself in a self ironic way and some kind of trash factor supporting the rest of the story. Now Daniel Kübelblock is actually playing himself and the whole story is trash (if you would look at it from that point of view, actually more points could be given), however the film -I actually searched on several pages on the Internet to confirm this, cause I didn't believe it after I first watched the movie- wants to give its viewers a serious message and is determined to be considered as art. I would call this movie ""Entartete Kunst"" if the Nazis hadn't already used this term for their evil purposes. Still doing it in spite of this is quite tempting.Most of the other actors are better than Kübelbock, still they are far below average to say it in a friendly way. Quite amusing are the sociolects (in particular indicating uneducated and unemployed people) and jargons (representing a high consume of the German mass media culture) several actors are using. There are several slips of the tongue as well in some quite simple sentences.

1,There is no excuse for this,"Well, what can I say? A friend of mine an me we are a huge fan of trash movies and we have really fun of watching these kind of movies. So of course we also came across this item. We were really looking forward to this because we assumed a lot of funny passages but even with our expectations set as low as they could get while watching this movie it got down under... This 80 minutes movie is pure terror. You cannot even have a laugh about it and you first realize how terrible this movie really is after you have finished it. It is leaves you with the feeling after watching a deep blue drama just without the empathy and tears. Well, I really warn you about watching this piece of junk. The camera is the worst kind of recording I ever came across, Daniel Küblböck sings the worst songs I have ever heard (and it is not hard to guess, that he wrote the songs himself)- low light ""Teenage tears"" - and the script is so lacking of any talent that you really hate everybody who has something to do with this movie.I may say that I give everybody a chance, but after this movie Daniel deserves the hatred he gets. He is causing it himself. None of the characters is a tiny bit sympathetic and every minute passing by seems like forever. And nobody has any talent to act. It is also the longest movie I have ever seen.Another thing is that this movie is called Daniel - Der Zauberer (German for magician). Well, there is just now and then a reference to a magician but he never is one. Would it be an intelligent movie, i would guess Daniel would be an imaginary magician and his music is sort of the magic, but due to the fact that this movie is not a slightly bit of intelligent it just cannot be.This movie is a slap into the face of the movie industry.

The main character in the movie is the androgynous popstar and runner up of German Idol, Daniel Küblböck, played by himself. The movie showcases several of his performances which I assume to be real. So far it's more of documentary than anything else, then the fictional part breaks in with a wizard running around with a tuba in his hand, and a trio who hate Daniel and plan to kill him. Since these parts are shot in home-video style they might as well be part of a mocumentary about some idiots trying to kill a popstar. Confusion of genre apart, Daniel himself is fiercely annoying with his shrill voice and flamboyant mannerisms. Wikipedia tells us he was voted most annoying person in TV in 2004, and this movie really shows that side of him. A documentary, or whatever this mess is supposed to be, with focus on an incredible annoying pop star is not a niece experience.

1,A film so awful it transcends language,"I approached this film with only a basic understanding of spoken German, enough to order at a restaurant, ask for directions etc. As it was, the version I found did not have subtitles, so I decided to try without. This was in fact not necessary, because this film speaks the international language of terrible film. The plot makes no sense, a fault so expertly delivered that no dialogue is needed to convey this to the audience. The acting is bad in any language, and then there's the real kicker: the editing and camera-work. It feels like something someone filmed for YouTube (back before professional YouTubers with high production values came along), the only hint that this isn't the case is the main character performing in concert venues. The sound quality, the picture quality and the slightly shaky picture betray that this was likely filmed on a home-video camera. The editing is virtually non-existent, with a general feeling most of the video clips were hastily stuck together in Windows Movie Maker. Overall, a must-see for lovers of bad film.

1,"It's a Good Thing his Name is Daniel, Otherwise I Couldn't Guess his Gender","I am so, so sorry.I am not sorry for this movie. I am sorry for myself. Vain? Certainly. But vanity, I'm afraid, is a virtue in this instance.Daniel Der Zauberer (or Daniel the Wizard) is a movie about German...entertainer (...?)...Daniel Küblböck. It is apparently supposed to be an art movie about how his singing inspires thousands, but instead of just a bunch of dancing and singing (like the ego trip known as Moonwalker), it seems to have a plot. My German is negligible in this case, so I didn't understand *any* of the dialogue, but according to the handy Internet, a Goth band tries to kill him because his music is better than their's, or something like that.There is a character who I guess is supposed to be ""the Wizard"" of the title, Johannes Küblböck. Based on the fact that they share the same last name, I assume he and Daniel are father and son, but we never really learn whose side the Wizard is on; I was perplexed. Sometimes he helps the Goths, then he apparently is playing Santa or something for young Daniel (?). And there's something about a girl and her father, who are No. 1 fans trying to help him, although I honestly don't know what happened. The girl looks a little young for him, is it his sister? The ambiguity, perhaps, is the balancing factor of this movie. In many instances, ambiguity can set up a nice atmosphere, provide a bit of mystery...but this isn't a horror or mystery movie. It's an art movie, and an art movie where I really don't have a clue what's going on. My main problem was that it was hideously boring and the acting was terrible.Oh, and of course, I was especially creeped out by Daniel's...choice of dress.

1,"Horrendous, has to be seen to be believed","The star of this movie, Daniel Küblböck, took part in the first ever season of the German version of American Idol. He managed to gain some popularity due to his androgynous look and quirky personality. He later took part in the German version of ""I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!"" and by now has faded into relative obscurity, but not before leaving us this tremendous achievement of bad movie making.The rough plot of this movie goes like this: Daniel is at the height of his popularity, giving large concerts and receiving dozens of fan letters every day. However, many others hate him and his music. His worst hater is a ridiculously edgy guy called Balthasar, who is planning an assassination together with a teenage couple (Tom and Rike). Meanwhile, Daniel is visited by a mysterious one-armed magician figure (played by the director, Ulli Lommel), who tells him that in order to become a magician himself, there are several tests he will have to pass...Now, where do we start? The beginning of the movie (and several later scenes) show Daniel performing live, but his horrible singing, dancing and his ridiculous outfits quickly become hard to stomach. Speaking of ridiculous outfits, I should mention that the evil killer Balthasar wears a red leather trench coat and has upside-down crosses branded on the back of his head[!]. Judging from the bad image quality, lighting and constant shaking, the movie seems to have been largely filmed on a hand-held camcorder. Adding to the ""charm"" of the movie are some of the exciting locations: Küblböck's living room, the forest and meadow next to his house, a concert hall and the small apartment of the murderous conspirators. The production values are roughly comparable to the home movie project of a sixth grader. The true ""highlight"" of the movie however are the bizarre dialogues and the general ludicrous and nonsensical way the plot goes forward. It's hard to describe and really has to be seen to be believed.Overall, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can't say that I haven't been somewhat entertained.

5,"""Steht mir etwas schlimmes zuvor? Sag es mir, bitte. Muss ich bald sterben?""","Detractors of German pop oddity Daniel Küblböck who wanted this movie to fail could not have been indulged more than having Ulli Lommel write and direct the feature. Küblböck's polarizing persona melded with Lommel's highly questionable style of filmmaking to make for a movie that I'm surprised ever saw the inside of any theater and is practically custom-made for criticism. If someone greatly dislikes the movie, there's really no arguing with 'em...but as a lover of low-budget filmmaking, I found enough things that I liked to inspire a decent rating.The film's biggest liability is not actually its cast or direction, but its screenplay. Lommel's screenplays frequently read like something written by a man on LSD, and this one is no exception. The movie would probably be a lot more coherent if only the story could stay focused on the actual plot. Instead, it entertains no less than five different narratives: (1) the planned assassination of Daniel by a knife-carrying weirdo (Rudolf Brem) and his cohorts, (2) a rivalry between said weirdo and Daniel's ghostly protector (Lommel), (3) Daniel's quest to perform in Hollywood, (4) Daniel's status as a magician-in-training, and (5) the conflict between a teen fan (Marina Lommel) and her grandfather (Peter Schamoni) over Daniel's music. Any movie running under 90 minutes would have trouble exploring all of these subplots, but DANIEL DER ZAUBERER strains itself even further by also focusing on footage from Daniel's live performances, impromptu music videos, and go-nowhere scenes like when the would-be assassins stalk Küblböck outside of his home.The level of awkwardness is high. Some of it has to do with the acting - performed by mostly first-time performers - but more of it has to do with the blocking, editing, and the script. Dialogue shots are frequently shoved together in a manner that in no way replicates normal conversation, and scenes are occasionally interspersed with completely unrelated footage. Director Lommel must hate establishing shots, because the viewer is often just dropped right in the middle of a scene without buildup. New characters appear from out of nowhere and strike up intimate conversations with established characters. All of it's very odd.While the film depicts Daniel's vehement critics as old fogies and pathetic weirdoes who scribble death threats, his fans don't look all that great either - not the young devotee who's willing to alienate her grandfather's customers for his music and certainly not the odd girl who cavalierly tells him about how he appeared to her father in angel form (even Daniel seems weirded out by that). The movie is not very effective in drumming up support for the guy, but given its lack of production values and inherently flawed nature, I wonder how much better a more restrained version would have even been.There are some redeeming features. While this film kicked off what many consider the absolute worst portion of Ulli Lommel's career, DANIEL DER ZAUBERER has a level of energy that most of his future films lack. Few scenes drag, and unlike subsequent Lommel fare like DUNGEON GIRL, this one actually feels like it's building towards a planned conclusion and not something the crew came up with on the fly. The actors' performances can be contrived, but they're all pretty sincere and played with more confidence than you'd find in a typical no-budget movie. Fans of the main star will probably be disappointed that Daniel is no way cut out to be a dramatic actor, but they'll appreciate the presence of several exclusive songs that have yet to be released in other formats. There's even the occasional feel-good scene, like when Daniel and his on screen grandmother (Katja Rupe) discuss his deceased grandfather.This one's hard to recommend to most people, but if you tend to like films that the rest of the world seems to dislike, this one may be or you!",steht mir etwas schlimmes zuvor sag es mir bitte muss ich bald sterben,detractors german pop oddity daniel k blb ck who wanted this movie fail could not have been indulged more than having ulli lommel write direct feature k blb cks polarizing persona melded with lommels highly questionable style filmmaking make movie that im surprised ever saw inside any theater is practically custom made criticism if someone greatly dislikes movie theres really no arguing with em but as lover low budget filmmaking i found enough things that i liked inspire decent rating films biggest liability is not actually its cast or direction but its screenplay lommels screenplays frequently read like something written by man lsd this one is no exception movie would probably be lot more coherent if only story could stay focused actual plot instead it entertains no less than five different narratives 1 planned assassination daniel by knife carrying weirdo rudolf brem his cohorts 2 rivalry between said weirdo daniels ghostly protector lommel 3 daniels quest perform hollywood 4 daniels status as magician training 5 conflict between teen fan marina lommel her grandfather peter schamoni over daniels music any movie running under 90 minutes would have trouble exploring all these subplots but daniel der zauberer strains itself even further by also focusing footage daniels live performances impromptu music videos go nowhere scenes like when would be assassins stalk k blb ck outside his home level awkwardness is high some it has do with acting performed by mostly first time performers but more it has do with blocking editing script dialogue shots are frequently shoved together manner that no way replicates normal conversation scenes are occasionally interspersed with completely unrelated footage director lommel must hate establishing shots because viewer is often just dropped right middle scene without buildup new characters appear out nowhere strike up intimate conversations with established characters all its very odd while film depicts daniels vehement critics as old fogies pathetic weirdoes who scribble death threats his fans dont look all that great either not young devotee whos willing alienate her grandfathers customers his music certainly not odd girl who cavalierly tells him about how he appeared her father angel form even daniel seems weirded out by that movie is not very effective drumming up support guy but given its lack production values inherently flawed nature i wonder how much better more restrained version would have even been there are some redeeming features while this film kicked off what many consider absolute worst portion ulli lommels career daniel der zauberer has level energy that most his future films lack few scenes drag unlike subsequent lommel fare like dungeon girl this one actually feels like its building towards planned conclusion not something crew came up with fly actors performances can be contrived but theyre all pretty sincere played with more confidence than youd find typical no budget movie fans main star will probably be disappointed that daniel is no way cut out be dramatic actor but theyll appreciate presence several exclusive songs that have yet be released other formats theres even occasional feel good scene like when daniel his screen grandmother katja rupe discuss his deceased grandfather this ones hard recommend most people but if you tend like films that rest world seems dislike this one may be or you,0.4578803291303291,0.06965322965322965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"

(tsss, as if the only German actors were comedy geeks... try to search this page for instant, you might be surprised about German movie gems.... like ""lola rennt"" for example.... or German movies of the past, like ""M""...) trying something new is fun.... if that ""new"" has some substance and doesn't consist of a movie lighted out with construction site lamps (they really did this...) and the actors should have at least visited and acting school instead of being just random bums from around the corner.... and there is also no set in this movie....do yourself a favor and don't watch this without having got a prior lobotomy..... it might make your braincells pop, its so action-laden and full of thrills and emotion.... *sniffs* (that was sarcasm!!!! )",horror horror,i watched this movie recently well i tried watch it but had turn it off after 20 minutes because i couldnt take utter stupidity lameness it plot well two goths plot kill daniel with help some ghost which is fact good thing considering what annoying person with even more annoying torturing voice antagonist kueblb ck is but he manages turn them his side by using positive energy which is nothing short stereotypical hippy cr p that was sprouted all around 1960s this whiny attitude was same reason why hippies not really but even more so kueblb ck is hated if they had only succeeded movie had proper twist but as it is one can tell story first 10 seconds this is pure utter sh t same soap opera kitsch schmaltz we have endure weekdays because some women their 40s or teen girls want escape reality second infest their brain with happy happy thoughts if they only could do it proper manner sigh instead admiring bi sexual tsss if he would at least have some dignity like proper gays bisexuals do not just show what p ssy he is semi intelligent person with mindset 3yo you know go read proper book not something that mainstream media feeds you those books can be read really they are great innovative stories not just some dull autobiographies about people who have achieved nothing at life like mr k blb ck but thankfully his star is falling did anyone hear him past months me neither takes deep breath if you really want do something 90 minutes life this movie would take instead watching it go start digging your nose or even better rent movie that at least tries stress your braincells if you are fan this you probably have none though one more comment poster richard i laughed my ass off while reading your post good satirical work man tsss as if only german actors were comedy geeks try search this page instant you might be surprised about german movie gems like lola rennt example or german movies past like m trying something new is fun if that new has some substance doesnt consist movie lighted out with construction site lamps they really did this actors should have at least visited acting school instead being just random bums around corner there is also no set this movie do yourself favor dont watch this without having got prior lobotomy it might make your braincells pop its so action laden full thrills emotion sniffs that was sarcasm,0.4686537506209636,0.07741998438719751,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.23}"
