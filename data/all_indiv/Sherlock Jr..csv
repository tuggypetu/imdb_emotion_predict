,Astounding Creativity,"It's almost impossible to describe the astounding creativity of ""Sherlock, Jr"". Even for Buster Keaton, this is a tremendous display of comedic and fantasy material. What's so remarkable is not so much any particularly hilarious gag or gags, as the never-ending stream of amazing and entertaining sights - coming faster and faster as the film proceeds - that seem so off-hand and effortlessly inventive, but that must have involved many hours of painstaking work to perfect. The film vs. reality theme is also highly suggestive, and makes this great movie one of the most completely satisfying efforts by Keaton or anyone else.The film opens slowly and allows the pace to build gradually. Buster operates the movie projector at a theater, while trying to study on his own to be a detective. He is involved in a real-life mystery that involves his girlfriend's family, and which turns out badly for him. He retreats into the fantasy world of a picture showing at his theater, and from then on you just have to see it to appreciate it. The creative comedy, the technical skill, and the subtly expressed themes are all remarkable.This is a great experience not to be missed.",astounding creativity,its almost impossible describe astounding creativity sherlock jr even buster keaton this is tremendous display comedic fantasy material whats so remarkable is not so much any particularly hilarious gag or gags as never ending stream amazing entertaining sights coming faster faster as film proceeds that seem so off hand effortlessly inventive but that must have involved many hours painstaking work perfect film vs reality theme is also highly suggestive makes this great movie one most completely satisfying efforts by keaton or anyone else film opens slowly allows pace build gradually buster operates movie projector at theater while trying study his own be detective he is involved real life mystery that involves his girlfriends family which turns out badly him he retreats into fantasy world picture showing at his theater then you just have see it appreciate it creative comedy technical skill subtly expressed themes are all remarkable this is great experience not be missed,0.7322666666666667,0.3557333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Through the Movie Screen,"Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of film혰or is it the film-like nature of dreams? As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or ""cartoon"" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a film혰but this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is ""real"" and an inner film that is ""not real,"" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choice혰and a responsibility혰to clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, ""How in hell did he do that?"" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster ""shadows"" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?",through movie screen,buster keatons most surreal movie sprang his insistence logic realism his tribute cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered his vaudeville career his most dazzling original movie is also one his least formally perfect all these paradoxes belong naturally this through looking glass work which examines dream like nature film or is it film like nature dreams as buster told it origin film lay his desire use certain illusionary stunts like bewildering dive through living assistants stomach which he had learned secret as child but he firmly believed that impossible or cartoon gags were not acceptable feature films so he could only include them by making them occur dream which is also film within film this is odd when you think about it since what he seems be saying is that impossible things can happen film but this was very rule he himself refused break by creating outer film that is real inner film that is not real keaton shows that while film enables illusions distortions reality filmmaker has choice responsibility clearly delineate fact fantasy one scene keaton uses camera trick dissolving wall prove that hes not using camera trick when he dives through window comes out disguised as old woman because he was analytical mechanically minded stickler authenticity keaton took pleasure revealing processes magic tricks camera tricks rather than using them fool audience buster plays hapless cinema projectionist who yearns be detective but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages frame him stealing his girlfriends fathers watch dream he enters film hes projecting becomes great detective who solves similar crime while busters screen character is schlemiel who can only achieve mastery his celluloid fantasies as director keatons grasp mechanics film making enabled him control camera its imagery as thoroughly gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body sherlock jr is most technically advanced film he ever made including special effects as when buster steps through screen gets edited park bench street mountain top lions den that can still leave audiences wondering how hell did he do that its often said that keatons films inspire gasps rather than laughs well i just saw sherlock jr with audience last night laughter was loud regular as fireworks fourth july but its particular kind laughter surprised amazed incredulous laughter first half movie takes place real world it begins with some nice small scale gags involving busters attempts scrounge up money buy candy his girl his adorably awkward visit her house after he has been thrown out due his rivals machinations buster shadows man literally copying his every motion exactly but is tricked again trapped freight train theres beautiful shot where he runs along top train staying same spot screen while cars zoom by under him opposite direction but i cant watch stunt where he rides water spout down tracks without wincing knowing he fractured his neck doing it beginning dream sequence is one greatest self reflexive scenes history film as busters ghostly double rises his sleeping body picks up his ghostly hat marches down into theater steps into screen havent we all wanted do this at some time once over his turbulent introduction medium buster becomes elegant sherlock jr investigating theft pearls mansion marvelous game billiards buster smoothly plays around exploding 13 ball he escapes thieves den with one neatest tricks youll ever see he rides through busy streets handlebars motorcycle that no one is driving he goes romantic sail floating car all this is packed into mere 45 minutes significantly cut after poor previews sherlock jr has more common with keatons short films than his features because fractured story line it doesnt have narrative coherence or trajectory character development that most keatons great features do his performance is split between shy inept projectionist suave infallible detective he is totally convincing both roles when he wakes his dream projectionist finds that all is well girl has solved mystery come apologize he is still timid as ever so romantic denouement he looks screen peeking out his booth he copies actions movie hero wooing his leading lady this is keatons most trenchant bit social satire whose ideas kissing love making havent been influenced by what they see at movies,0.5496341066341066,0.1482486772486772,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"

9.0,marvellous and inventive,"This Keaton classic is both funny and extremely clever in its construction. Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.The first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster's father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son's films.There's a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.It is in Junior's other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.Sherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.Justly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton's cinematic career.

10.0,A World of Possibilities,"Not only is this Buster Keaton's best film, but it is among the greatest achievements in the history of cinema, period. While it is not a feature-length film--and thus barred from most critics' lists of great films--it invented just about every single basic special effect known to movies (except for morphing). The story itself, about a film projectionist who desires to become part of the movies, and then does, by walking right onto the screen, made palpable the desire that we all have to be in the movies: To get the girl, to be an action hero, to outsmart the bad guys.

10.0,Intensely Poetic and Creative,"Though a lot of older films tend to be neglected, Sherlock Jr. definitely isn't a film that could be called obscure. I imagine most people at least know OF this movie with its famous movie-in-a-movie surrealist scene.Still, having previously heard over and over again about the brilliance of this film, I never really understood until I saw it myself. It's not just the dream-story and the surreality, it's what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.Thus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it's FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There's no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of ""Pretentious!"", but still people can say ""It's amazing."" There's no comedic conceit that says, ""Bah, just simple slapstick, it's low-culture!"" because it's rather intelligently done. And it's creative in a way that isn't like an opium-dream. It can appeal to anybody of all ages.

,"nobody has ever done it better, maybe even as well, as Buster","There ought to be a theater that shows nothing but perfectly preserved prints of the silent comedies of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Harry Langdon. There ought to be a lot of things, I guess. But anyone who thinks that silent film is nothing more than a crude and unskilled ancestor of today's motion picture need only spend some time on these great comedies to realize that, in this genre at least, the peak was reached in the 20s. Yes, there are funny movies with dialogue, but the humor is generally IN the dialogue...nobody--not the Marx Brothers, or W.C. Fields, or Abbot and Costello or the Three Stooges and nobody since--has achieved the sublime mastery of physical comedy these geniuses did. And the best of them all for pure comedy, to my mind, is Keaton. And the best of his movies is Sherlock, Jr. The dream sequence in which he becomes an actor in the film he's projecting is astonishing; the way in which this movie is a sort of window into a different and appealing age is charming--and the ending of this movie takes the breath away. Keaton made some of the great endings in film, I think. Check out ""College"" some time--just for the last minute or so.

10.0,A hard act to follow,"As I sat reading the other reviewers comments I wondered what I could add. Oddly enough I watched Sherlock jr only this afternoon, after so many viewings it still amazes me how far ahead of his time Buster Keaton was, often copied, rarely equalled never surpassed.

,Creating the Art of Folding,"Spoilers herein.I am an enthusiast of what I call ""folding"" in film. That's the collection of techniques that map some awareness or identification of what the film is, to the story within the film. It isn't just a simple game, but a complex system of juggling representations and reality. It is not unique to film of course -- it has a long literary tradition. But it is one of the few things that characterize film as an agent of our imagination. I have built a database of hundreds of wonderful examples of folded films.It all starts here. Even today, the medium is still young and quickly evolving. But when this was made, film was still indistinct from its siblings: theater and still photography. Griffith had hampered the evolution by introducing one feature (societal scope -- unachievable on stage) by freezing another (ALL of the other conventions of stage).Keaton's notion of a film within a film seems ordinary today. Today, we don't even blink at one of the effects in this film: Keaton (in his film-within persona) is planning an elaborate getaway through a window in a cabin. To see this getaway, you need to see the inside and outside. Since this is explicitly a movie, we see the cabin the way it was built for a movie: with one side missing. Is is, in effect a film within a film within a film. This now common notion all starts here, it seems.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this",creating art folding,spoilers herein i am enthusiast what i call folding film thats collection techniques that map some awareness or identification what film is story within film it isnt just simple game but complex system juggling representations reality it is not unique film course it has long literary tradition but it is one few things that characterize film as agent our imagination i have built database hundreds wonderful examples folded films it all starts here even today medium is still young quickly evolving but when this was made film was still indistinct its siblings theater still photography griffith had hampered evolution by introducing one feature societal scope unachievable stage by freezing another all other conventions stage keatons notion film within film seems ordinary today today we dont even blink at one effects this film keaton his film within persona is planning elaborate getaway through window cabin see this getaway you need see inside outside since this is explicitly movie we see cabin way it was built movie with one side missing is is effect film within film within film this now common notion all starts here it seems teds evaluation 4 3 every cineliterate person should experience this,0.44575892857142857,0.0013020833333333287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.65}"
10.0,"Footage of laughter, romance and technical audaciousness","Am somebody who likes humour with wit and sophistication when it comes to comedy (that's why so many pre-1970 comedy appeals a lot to me), while appreciating comedies with a broader style providing it doesn't become too vulgar and the risque kind. Have found though that in recent years that there has been those that are very juvenile, crude and even puerile to the point of offensiveness, which is as one may have guessed appeals to me far less.There are many fine examples of silent film comedy, with Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy though in both cases it wasn't the case of finding their feet immediately. In both cases the early stuff was fairly hit and miss, but when they did settle their best work was classic. And of course Buster Keaton, who didn't transition as well or smoothly into the sound era (whereas Chaplin made some of his best work in it) but when he was in his prime there was nobody back then, when it came to comedy, more daring in terms of the jaw-dropping stunt-work, or who was able to make deadpan funny and expressive, and actually it is still like that now. Keaton wasn't nicknamed ""The Great Stone Face"" for nothing, and in my mind he was every bit as funny and easy to like as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, while also being a bigger risk taker, having bolder material physically and his films being technically in his prime period superior. The reasons for the comparisons being because they were all geniuses in comedy, who started their careers around the same time, a lot of the comedy was physical rather than verbal and their prime periods were in roughly the same time period.'Sherlock Jr' is another one of Keaton's finest, an achievement in pretty much every way. On a technical level, it is one of his most audacious and best-looking along with the slightly more ground-breaking on this front 'The General'. Again, it is beautifully shot and designed and the effects and how they're used stand out, it should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly, rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now. Films today should learn from this film and the best of Keaton, they really are an example to all in many senses. The direction keeps things moving with control, progressing gradually and always assuredly, and balances everything beautifully.When it comes to the humour, 'Sherlock Jr' is one of Keaton's funniest and most inventive, chockful of hilarious moments timed to absolute perfection. While none of the stunts are quite on the same level of awe-inspiring as for example the climax of 'Steamboat Bill, Jr', they are still incredibly daring. Also found myself surprisingly educated, which makes this film one of Keaton's more interesting films, in learning the trade tricks in editing and effects and some of the most genius use of back projection (often done cheaply and obviously, but inventively done here).Like 'The General' and 'Steamboat Bill, Jr' it is really great to have a story with brains, heart and logic, treating the audience with respect and there is never any trouble following it. In terms of structure it stands out too when it comes to the story elements in Keaton's films and is one of the most interesting. The romantic element that features heavily here is done with more charm and pathos than most comedy when balanced with romance, without being too sentimental or soap-operatic, never does it slow the film down either. As to be expected, Keaton as to be expected is superb here, not only is his comic timing on point but he once again provides a character that's endearing and worth rooting for. His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is awe-inspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced. Don't overlook the rest of the cast though, they may not have as much to do but they are also amusing and charming.In summary, one of the Keaton essentials. 10/10",footage laughter romance technical audaciousness,am somebody who likes humour with wit sophistication when it comes comedy thats why so many pre 1970 comedy appeals lot me while appreciating comedies with broader style providing it doesnt become too vulgar risque kind have found though that recent years that there has been those that are very juvenile crude even puerile point offensiveness which is as one may have guessed appeals me far less there are many fine examples silent film comedy with charlie chaplin laurel hardy though both cases it wasnt case finding their feet immediately both cases early stuff was fairly hit miss but when they did settle their best work was classic course buster keaton who didnt transition as well or smoothly into sound era whereas chaplin made some his best work it but when he was his prime there was nobody back then when it came comedy more daring terms jaw dropping stunt work or who was able make deadpan funny expressive actually it is still like that now keaton wasnt nicknamed great stone face nothing my mind he was every bit as funny easy like as chaplin laurel hardy while also being bigger risk taker having bolder material physically his films being technically his prime period superior reasons comparisons being because they were all geniuses comedy who started their careers around same time lot comedy was physical rather than verbal their prime periods were roughly same time period sherlock jr is another one keatons finest achievement pretty much every way technical level it is one his most audacious best looking along with slightly more ground breaking this front general again it is beautifully shot designed effects how theyre used stand out it should be used as example how have effects that still look good like lot effort care went into them also use them properly rather than overusing abusing them gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now films today should learn this film best keaton they really are example all many senses direction keeps things moving with control progressing gradually always assuredly balances everything beautifully when it comes humour sherlock jr is one keatons funniest most inventive chockful hilarious moments timed absolute perfection while none stunts are quite same level awe inspiring as example climax steamboat bill jr they are still incredibly daring also found myself surprisingly educated which makes this film one keatons more interesting films learning trade tricks editing effects some most genius use back projection often done cheaply obviously but inventively done here like general steamboat bill jr it is really great have story with brains heart logic treating audience with respect there is never any trouble following it terms structure it stands out too when it comes story elements keatons films is one most interesting romantic element that features heavily here is done with more charm pathos than most comedy when balanced with romance without being too sentimental or soap operatic never does it slow film down either as be expected keaton as be expected is superb here not only is his comic timing point but he once again provides character thats endearing worth rooting his physicality how he copes with stunts is awe inspiring he is one not many make deadpan interesting entertaining because he still makes it very expressive nuanced dont overlook rest cast though they may not have as much do but they are also amusing charming summary one keaton essentials 10 10,0.5324701358206514,0.28628293241695296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Fantastic filmmaking from one of the world's greatest,"Sherlock, Jr. arguably exceeds The General as Buster Keaton's greatest achievement -- it is certainly more magical in its use of extraordinary special effects and unconventionally humorous situations.

10.0,A rare treat :),"I have to say that this is by far Keaton's finest work. I have seen and own about 19 of his films/short films and this is the one that truly stands out.It is rare these days to find a comedy which will make you laugh each and every time you see it. Yet this one, to me, seems not only to be able to do this but also to get BETTER the more you watch it.The physical comedy, sight gags and insane stunts never cease to amaze me. That is what I love about Buster, the fact he did his own stunts shows that he was a great believer in producing a film that was genuine, that didnt try to trick or fool it's audience.I find it sad that today most people seem to think that comedy is about dialouge and punch lines, when it is clear from film master pieces such as Sherlock Jr. that this is not true. Silent movies are not to be ignored just because they are 'old', when I watch many of them they feel as fresh as any new comedy - if not more so.So thank-you Buster!",rare treat,i have say that this is by far keatons finest work i have seen own about 19 his films short films this is one that truly stands out it is rare these days find comedy which will make you laugh each every time you see it yet this one me seems not only be able do this but also get better more you watch it physical comedy sight gags insane stunts never cease amaze me that is what i love about buster fact he did his own stunts shows that he was great believer producing film that was genuine that didnt try trick or fool its audience i find it sad that today most people seem think that comedy is about dialouge punch lines when it is clear film master pieces such as sherlock jr that this is not true silent movies are not be ignored just because they are old when i watch many them they feel as fresh as any new comedy if not more so so thank you buster,0.5965087381754048,0.18930976430976432,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.24}"

But what makes it special is Keaton's use of the film to communicate his own joy of storytelling through the medium of the movies, and the power film has to transport us into other people's stories and fulfill our own fantasies by vicariously living through them.This movie apparently was Keaton's own personal favorite, and it shows.

6.0,Magical FIlm,"""We are lost! He is sending for the world's greatest detective - Sherlock Jr.!""After watching several of Chaplin's classic films, I decided it was time to give Buster Keaton an opportunity beginning with one of his most revered movies, Sherlock Jr. Keaton and Chaplin dominated the silent movie era, but most people are divisive as to who was the most talented actor-director of that time. So far I'm on Chaplin's side although I still have to give Keaton another shot with The General. Perhaps the problem I had with Sherlock Jr. is that I'm not a big fan of surreal films. I know everyone seems to love this genre, but there are very few surreal movies that work for me. I can see how Buster Keaton garners recognition for his magical work in this film, being one of the first to actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie. Many other films (and especially cartoons) were inspired from several scenes in Sherlock Jr, like the one in which Keaton's character jumps into a movie screen and becomes a character in the movie that is being projected (better known as ""the movie within a movie"" sequence). There are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how Keaton could have shot them way back in 1924. I was more impressed with this wizard like aspect of Keaton than on his comedic performance. His deadpan expressions were outdone by the gadgets he devised to create such advanced special effects. Despite being bored by the story, I have to give Keaton credit for his inventive and magical sequences. At the beginning of this silent film, written by Jean Havez, Joseph Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman the title card reads: ""There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both. This is the story of a boy who tried it. While employed as a moving picture operator in a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective."" We are then introduced to the projectionist (Buster Keaton) who is reading a detective book instead of cleaning up the theater. After work, he goes to visit his girl (Kathryn McGuire) and buys her a ring. Another man (played by Ward Crane), who is also fighting for the girl's affection happens to be at the house and steals her father's chain watch and incriminates the projectionist. The girl's father (Joe Keaton) kicks him out of his home and tells him never to return again. The projectionist sadly returns to work where he falls asleep and dreams of being a detective in the film that is being projected. In his dreams, he becomes the hero of the film and the adventure begins.Buster Keaton's film has some brilliant and magical sequences, and I think it is a bit unfair to compare him with Chaplin because he has a very different style. Chaplin has a more humane approach, writes his own stories and composes them as well, while Keaton does some impressive work behind the lens using some trickery. As performers they both have different styles, Chaplin uses a lot of physical comedy while Keaton uses deadpan humor and incorporates a lot of action scenes doing some risky stunts (in the train sequence he actually fractured his neck). Depending on which style you like best, you will probably claim Keaton or Chaplin is better, but it would be unfair to say one is less talented than the other because they both proved to be geniuses during the silent era and have left us with a rich legacy. I can see sparks of both in contemporary film making. Despite not being a fan of this film as much as others I still need to watch Keaton's The General to get a clearer picture of his style.",magical film,we are lost he is sending worlds greatest detective sherlock jr after watching several chaplins classic films i decided it was time give buster keaton opportunity beginning with one his most revered movies sherlock jr keaton chaplin dominated silent movie era but most people are divisive as who was most talented actor director that time so far im chaplins side although i still have give keaton another shot with general perhaps problem i had with sherlock jr is that im not big fan surreal films i know everyone seems love this genre but there are very few surreal movies that work me i can see how buster keaton garners recognition his magical work this film being one first actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie many other films especially cartoons were inspired several scenes sherlock jr like one which keatons character jumps into movie screen becomes character movie that is being projected better known as movie within movie sequence there are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how keaton could have shot them way back 1924 i was more impressed with this wizard like aspect keaton than his comedic performance his deadpan expressions were outdone by gadgets he devised create such advanced special effects despite being bored by story i have give keaton credit his inventive magical sequences at beginning this silent film written by jean havez joseph mitchell clyde bruckman title card reads there is old proverb which says dont try do two things at once expect do justice both this is story boy who tried it while employed as moving picture operator small town theater he was also studying be detective we are then introduced projectionist buster keaton who is reading detective book instead cleaning up theater after work he goes visit his girl kathryn mcguire buys her ring another man played by ward crane who is also fighting girls affection happens be at house steals her fathers chain watch incriminates projectionist girls father joe keaton kicks him out his home tells him never return again projectionist sadly returns work where he falls asleep dreams being detective film that is being projected his dreams he becomes hero film adventure begins buster keatons film has some brilliant magical sequences i think it is bit unfair compare him with chaplin because he has very different style chaplin has more humane approach writes his own stories composes them as well while keaton does some impressive work behind lens using some trickery as performers they both have different styles chaplin uses lot physical comedy while keaton uses deadpan humor incorporates lot action scenes doing some risky stunts train sequence he actually fractured his neck depending which style you like best you will probably claim keaton or chaplin is better but it would be unfair say one is less talented than other because they both proved be geniuses during silent era have left us with rich legacy i can see sparks both contemporary film making despite not being fan this film as much as others i still need watch keatons general get clearer picture his style,0.5478427128427131,0.19680014430014428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,Brilliantly Worked Out Gags,"Sherlock Jr. is one of Buster Keaton's best films, and possibly his greatest. The film starts somewhat slow as it sets Keaton up to be a struggling wannabe detective. There are some comedy moments that play well and the opening is rather enjoyable.But then, the film soon becomes 100x better as he literally steps into the movie that he is watching. We watch a sequence that maybe is not necessary for the overall story but what is a completely entertaining watch as the scenery changes in the movie he is in. Every cut is timed perfectly, even watching it back in slow motion is still a struggle to work out any unusual movements in his character between the scenery changes. It is brilliantly funny, especially when the scenery changes just as he is jumping into the sea to then jumping into a snow pit.The rest of the film follows Keaton as he goes about as a habitually clever detective in the film he has entered. The gags are so brilliantly worked out that you don't know whether to laugh or to watch in amazement. You think that surely that gag was the greatest of the film but then he goes and tops it in the next scene. Keaton did all of his own stunts which makes it even more astonishing to watch, and sometimes rather intense especially when he passes over a train track being just inches from the moving train. It is a film that words cannot describe and that has to be seen to truly be believed. Sherlock Jr. represents the truly unique style of filmmaking from the silent era, something that you would never see any other time in the history of film.If you're looking to get into silent film comedy, or just silent film as a whole, then Sherlock Jr. is a great place to start. Every part of the film is still as funny today as it must have been then. The timing is perfect.

Not only is it clever and fast and well done, it's short (well under an hour) so you won't have to panic.Buster Keaton is one of the big three silent film comedians (along with Chaplin and Lloyd). And all three were an influence on Woody Allen. In this case, you can see the most astonishing use of the film work and the real world getting mixed up. Remember that Allen film, ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" where the character on the screen steps into the real world, and things go nuts? Well, that's the key startling premise here--Keaton plays a projectionist who (in his dream) jumps up on the screen and into the movie.On top of this are classic Keaton comic moments, a plot that has at least three threads (one is in the movie on the screen), and a kind of post-modern love story. Keaton is an understated actor with is face, and overstated with his body. That is, he doesn't push the comic expressions but he really knows how to make his body language work.The Netflix streamable version is a Kino release and it's really very good, with music that makes sense.

10.0,one of the seminal Buster Keaton comedies,"Buster Keaton has cajones the size of watermelons. This isn't just to say in the stunts that he executes- sometimes, apparently, to great physical and personal risk- are at big comic peril, but that he's fearless with what he wants to try as a filmmaker and scenarist. Jokes that I thought would never really be fresh are taken in 1924 in ways I didn't think could be funny, but are. Take a small bit where Keaton's character (one of them, anyway) plans to sabotage a nefarious guy with a slip on the banana peel. For a moment this is groan-inducing, but watching how it's executed it becomes something really, really gut-busting. There are little bits like that, and then those huge scenes of choreographed mayhem: a blast by water after hanging off of a moving train, a chase through a town that includes a sudden chance of a road connected, jumps through small holes and windows at the nick of time that are half pure Keaton and half exciting editing.And then Keaton himself, usually a little guy looking shy and quiet and a dreamer in the greatest cinematic sense (this was one of the first, if not the first, films to have a character go into a movie-world right through the screen), and he's always incredibly subtle but not ever lacking appropriate comic timing. And in Sherlock Jr he operates wonderfully on two wavelengths: one is as the character just trying to hold the girl's hand on the couch without much embarrassment, and the other is as the title character, going up in peculiar fashion up to everyone in the room (as is one of the listed things ""to do"" as a detective) and suave with things like an explosive 13 ball on the pool table. Keaton is, as Ebert noticed, the one little guy wandering around in the chaos. Only this time, in such a short running time for a feature (it's just a few minutes short of being a short film), Keaton crams as much as he can to perfect effect.Sherlock Jr should be seen by just about anyone looking for a great example of pure silent-comedy hijinks and stunt work; what Jackie Chan might be for martial arts Buster Keaton is to a crazy pratfall, and you often can't entirely believe it's the guy on screen doing what's being done. And it's also, alongside Steamboat Bill Jr and The General, examples of how Keaton could be an exemplary filmmaker, someone who took film technique and shook it up just a bit (if, admittedly, more-so than Chaplin as just director if not quite as a star), while sticking faithfully to comedy and heart-tugging moments. And if you're tuned into the mania and well-oiled machine of the stunt sequences and classic chase climax it's as pleasurable as anything in comedy history, nevermind just silent film. Make sure, by the way, to watch the Kino version (at least the one on VHS which I saw) to see one of the most enjoyably strange scores for a silent film- there's even the blues hit You Got to Move at one point!",one seminal buster keaton comedies,buster keaton has cajones size watermelons this isnt just say stunts that he executes sometimes apparently great physical personal risk are at big comic peril but that hes fearless with what he wants try as filmmaker scenarist jokes that i thought would never really be fresh are taken 1924 ways i didnt think could be funny but are take small bit where keatons character one them anyway plans sabotage nefarious guy with slip banana peel moment this is groan inducing but watching how its executed it becomes something really really gut busting there are little bits like that then those huge scenes choreographed mayhem blast by water after hanging off moving train chase through town that includes sudden chance road connected jumps through small holes windows at nick time that are half pure keaton half exciting editing then keaton himself usually little guy looking shy quiet dreamer greatest cinematic sense this was one first if not first films have character go into movie world right through screen hes always incredibly subtle but not ever lacking appropriate comic timing sherlock jr he operates wonderfully two wavelengths one is as character just trying hold girls hand couch without much embarrassment other is as title character going up peculiar fashion up everyone room as is one listed things do as detective suave with things like explosive 13 ball pool table keaton is as ebert noticed one little guy wandering around chaos only this time such short running time feature its just few minutes short being short film keaton crams as much as he can perfect effect sherlock jr should be seen by just about anyone looking great example pure silent comedy hijinks stunt work what jackie chan might be martial arts buster keaton is crazy pratfall you often cant entirely believe its guy screen doing whats being done its also alongside steamboat bill jr general examples how keaton could be exemplary filmmaker someone who took film technique shook it up just bit if admittedly more so than chaplin as just director if not quite as star while sticking faithfully comedy heart tugging moments if youre tuned into mania well oiled machine stunt sequences classic chase climax its as pleasurable as anything comedy history nevermind just silent film make sure by way watch kino version at least one vhs which i saw see one most enjoyably strange scores silent film theres even blues hit you got move at one point,0.4485260770975058,0.11163903061224491,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"

7.0,Keaton blurrs the distinction between movies and dreaming,"At only 45min., this silent comedy isn't that much longer than some 3 reel comedy shorts, yet, it apparently qualifies as a feature-length film. I don't see this film as being greatly superior to the many Keaton comedy shorts I've seen. .......It starts out very slow, with Keaton and his girl sitting together for an eternity, not knowing what to say to the other. Finally, Keaton gives her a cheap engagement ring. Keaton is a mere movie projectionist, who dreams of becoming a detective in the class of Sherlock Holmes........I thought the $1.00 bill caper was cute, if unrealistic. Keaton wants to buy a $3. box of candy for his girl, but he only has $2. Luckily, he finds a $1 bill in his sweepings, also being the theater janitor. Unluckily, a women comes, complaining she lost a $1 bill in the theater, and he gives it to her. Then, another woman shows up claiming she also lost a $1 bill in the theater. Keston gives her his $1 bill. Then a mean-looking man shows up wanting to look through his sweepings. Keaton hands him his last $1. bill, but he refuses. Looking through the trash, he spies a wallet with some greenbacks in it, and goes off with it. Keaton then spreads the trash out, looking for another wallet. But, of course, he doesn't find such. Thus, he goes to the store, and buys the $1. box of candy. However, he converts the $1. price tag into a $4, to impress his girl. But, this deception will return to haunt him........While Keaton is talking to his girl, his competitor(villain) , in the form of Ward Crane, arrives, in a splendid outfit, and bringing a bigger box of candy, as well as a more impressive engagement ring. Keaton is relegated to the hall. Soon, the girl's father reports that his gold watch is missing. The Villain slips the receipt for the watch he hocked at the pawn shop into Keaton's jacket pocket. Then, Keaton says he will act as a detective, and search every one. The Villain requests him to also search himself, and he finds the pawn receipt, which says $4 for the watch., which matches the $4 price tag on the candy box. Keaton is requested by the girl's father to leave and never return. ........Still imagining himself to be a detective, Keaton shadows The Villain, as the most likely suspect, in his mind. Eventually, he winds up in a boxcar, locked in by The Villain. Luckily, there is a hatch in thr roof. Just then, the train pulls out of the station. Keaton runs along the top of the cars to keep him near the water tower. When he runs out of cars, he jumps onto the tower dispenser, which lowers and begins to release water, which practically drowns Keaton(Keaton suffered a serious neck injury in this event.) . He then runs back to his projectionist job, where he soon dozes off.......Meanwhile, his girl goes to the pawn shop with the receipt and asks the pawnbroker what the man who traded the watch looked like. He was tall and had a black moustache, which fit the description of The Villain, but not Keaton. She was satisfied that Keaton was telling the truth that he knew nothing about the watch pawning........Some reviewers say they are confused which events take place in his upcoming dream, and which really happened. According to my notes, the dream begins about the 20min. mark and lasts until the 41min. mark, just a few minutes before the ending. Among other things, Keaton dreams he walks into the movie sceen and interacts a bit with the actors. Then, he is thrust into various odd or dangerous situations, in which his pose at the end of one situation carries over to the beginning of the next situation. ......He dreams that the Villain steals a pearl necklace from his girl's mother. He takes this to a shack where his confederate thieves hideout. Keaton shows up at the hideout. Initially, captured, he breaks loose, and grabs the pearls The Villain is dangling before him, and runs.........The next gag has Keaton cornered in an alley by several of the gang. He jumps into the belly of a tie salesman, standing behind him and disappears. The gang finally find him hiding behind a rotating section of the wood fence behind. He runs, and the gang chases him. A cop on a motorcycle appears and invites him to ride on his handlebars. Soon, the cop is bumped off, without Keaton knowing it, and the cycle negotiates around various obstacles without Keaton's help, until it comes to the shack where Keaton's girl is being held, where it rockets him into the shack, he hitting the guard. Soon, the gang arrives in a car. They trick the gang, and take their car, which ends up in a lake: just the top part, which sails a ways before sinking. Keaton wakes up, and his girl arrives to tell him she believes him innocent of stealing the watch.. The movie on the screen is about to end, with the man hugging and kissing the woman. Keaton imitates what they do on the screen , with his girl. The end.",keaton blurrs distinction between movies dreaming,at only 45min this silent comedy isnt that much longer than some 3 reel comedy shorts yet it apparently qualifies as feature length film i dont see this film as being greatly superior many keaton comedy shorts ive seen it starts out very slow with keaton his girl sitting together eternity not knowing what say other finally keaton gives her cheap engagement ring keaton is mere movie projectionist who dreams becoming detective class sherlock holmes i thought 1 00 bill caper was cute if unrealistic keaton wants buy 3 box candy his girl but he only has 2 luckily he finds 1 bill his sweepings also being theater janitor unluckily women comes complaining she lost 1 bill theater he gives it her then another woman shows up claiming she also lost 1 bill theater keston gives her his 1 bill then mean looking man shows up wanting look through his sweepings keaton hands him his last 1 bill but he refuses looking through trash he spies wallet with some greenbacks it goes off with it keaton then spreads trash out looking another wallet but course he doesnt find such thus he goes store buys 1 box candy however he converts 1 price tag into 4 impress his girl but this deception will return haunt him while keaton is talking his girl his competitor villain form ward crane arrives splendid outfit bringing bigger box candy as well as more impressive engagement ring keaton is relegated hall soon girls father reports that his gold watch is missing villain slips receipt watch he hocked at pawn shop into keatons jacket pocket then keaton says he will act as detective search every one villain requests him also search himself he finds pawn receipt which says 4 watch which matches 4 price tag candy box keaton is requested by girls father leave never return still imagining himself be detective keaton shadows villain as most likely suspect his mind eventually he winds up boxcar locked by villain luckily there is hatch thr roof just then train pulls out station keaton runs along top cars keep him near water tower when he runs out cars he jumps onto tower dispenser which lowers begins release water which practically drowns keaton keaton suffered serious neck injury this event he then runs back his projectionist job where he soon dozes off meanwhile his girl goes pawn shop with receipt asks pawnbroker what man who traded watch looked like he was tall had black moustache which fit description villain but not keaton she was satisfied that keaton was telling truth that he knew nothing about watch pawning some reviewers say they are confused which events take place his upcoming dream which really happened according my notes dream begins about 20min mark lasts until 41min mark just few minutes before ending among other things keaton dreams he walks into movie sceen interacts bit with actors then he is thrust into various odd or dangerous situations which his pose at end one situation carries over beginning next situation he dreams that villain steals pearl necklace his girls mother he takes this shack where his confederate thieves hideout keaton shows up at hideout initially captured he breaks loose grabs pearls villain is dangling before him runs next gag has keaton cornered alley by several gang he jumps into belly tie salesman standing behind him disappears gang finally find him hiding behind rotating section wood fence behind he runs gang chases him cop motorcycle appears invites him ride his handlebars soon cop is bumped off without keaton knowing it cycle negotiates around various obstacles without keatons help until it comes shack where keatons girl is being held where it rockets him into shack he hitting guard soon gang arrives car they trick gang take their car which ends up lake just top part which sails ways before sinking keaton wakes up his girl arrives tell him she believes him innocent stealing watch movie screen is about end with man hugging kissing woman keaton imitates what they do screen with his girl end,0.5283648018648018,0.07007109557109556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Hilarious and philosophical - what more could you want?,"Along with SUNRISE, the greatest movie from the silent era. While not stinting on extraordinary sequences of slapstick - the bicycle scene is justly admired and unsurpassed - it is the growing richness of Buster's persona, and the breathtaking analysis of the medium itself that today astonishes. An anti-detective work ahead of its time, it both celebrates film as a repository of our dreams and desires, and critiques it for engendering passivity. Crucially, it is very, very funny.",hilarious philosophical what more could you want,along with sunrise greatest movie silent era while not stinting extraordinary sequences slapstick bicycle scene is justly admired unsurpassed it is growing richness busters persona breathtaking analysis medium itself that today astonishes anti detective work ahead its time it both celebrates film as repository our dreams desires critiques it engendering passivity crucially it is very very funny,0.7,0.4572916666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
