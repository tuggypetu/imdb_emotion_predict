10.0,Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10",why do we fall so we can learn pick ourselves up such is

10.0,One Super-Hero Film With Tremendous Depth!,"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL-----------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!----------------------Warner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!Director, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson & Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth!In the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of ""Super-Star"". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do soWhat a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!)On the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already awareaudiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .For my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .To highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .Before rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book ""super-hero"", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything closeLet's try to keep things in perspective, O. K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS!10********** SuperHero *Stars*...ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!......",one super hero film with tremendous depth,pasto colombia via l ca cali colombia orlando fl only tony kiss castillo facebook warner brothers gave us very special gift fathers day 2005 batman begins despite displaying some lethargy its opening scenes suffering some excesses so common this genre film not only might you say it is best batman franchise so far but also that it is definitely best super hero film ever director christopher nolan who dazzled with his amazing talent 2000 cult classic memento has assembled formidable cast michael caine liam neesom gary oldman tom wilkinson morgan freeman among others outstanding script special effects all well focused film that transforms two dimensional comic strip into work real depth title role we have christian bale british 31 at time film was made someone who has spent most his life front cameras without reaching at least at this juncture time long awaited status super star 2000 bale took another title role american psycho cult classic which received ample attention both critics audiences alike if you have not seen this psychological thriller do sowhat gem it is bale is chillingly creepy one hand mr bale is one very few british actors well welsh be exact capable playing american where his accent intonation even body language is absolutely perfect impeccable after taking american psycho i could have sworn he was american however begins although his performance seemed quite good it was slightly below my expectation i attribute this two factors first as im sure bale was already awareaudiences went with tremendously high expectations regarding his role secondly with supporting cast caliber involved this film it would have been almost impossible stand out same way he did american psycho my taste only really weak link was now famous being tom cruises ex katie holmes before appearing begins ms holmes never had real stand out role at least my opinion nor really had been many high profile films all fairness her though it wasnt so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasnt up those others this brilliant cast highlight very best that batman begins shows us unlike almost all movies this genre its characters are anything but black white just as real life almost all them evolve kind constant metamorphosis responding interacting with lady luck day day life events reactions those around them they do it most convincingly not least bit far fetched before rushing out see it just little warning those who yearn action packed blockbusters begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled those who crave really intense human drama since at end day this is still comic book super hero not some conflicted politician or not even anything closelets try keep things perspective o k conclusion if you have ever seen any film based comic strip that you have liked past then dont hesitate see batman begins i guarantee youll be rating it at least 7 stars 10 superhero stars enjoy disfrutela any comments questions or observations english o en espa ol are most welcome,0.47154125024495375,0.19128306878306875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,A reboot that works,"British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.The casting is extraordinary and the ensemble all give outstanding performances. Bale is terrific, finally getting some of the acclaim he deserves; I've been watching this guy for a few years now and he's been great in everything I've seen. Caine is cast as Alfred the butler, and supplies genuinely warm comedy and wit. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are friendly allies, although their roles are relatively minor. Katie Holmes is the attractive love interest and she, too, is surprisingly good. However, it's the villains which have the best parts; Liam Neeson has his best role in many years and is fantastic in it, whilst THE LAST SAMURAI's Ken Watanabe is creepy as a cult leader. Cillian Murphy (28 DAYS LATER) is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy The Scarecrow, whilst Tom Wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as a hardline gangster. Even Rutger Hauer is in it, and that's gotta be good, seeing as he's been stuck in DTV movie hell for a decade.The film is long – 2 ½ hours to be precise – but the suspense and action keep it moving. There are car chases, fist fights, massive battles and lots of other stuff going on. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through and there are plenty of surprising twists. My only complaint is that the action is cut too fast, and too close, so that it's pretty hard to see what's happening, but the excellent soundtrack helps make up for that. Still, a minor complaint with what is otherwise a flawless film – let's hope they all team up to make some more classics like this.",reboot that works,british director christopher nolan is better known his lower profile thrillers such as excellent memento brilliant insomnia but his first big budget hollywood blockbuster is still same league as other two tremendously inventive exciting piece filmmaking which breathes whole new life into batman saga proves be best film series shame it took till number five get it right but thats life nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines instead taking batman back his roots result is tough violent realistic adventure which isnt marred by any comic book campness or flights fancy which spoiled others batman is just ordinary guy here without any superpowers but instead his bond style gadgets allow him become caped crusader by night casting is extraordinary ensemble all give outstanding performances bale is terrific finally getting some acclaim he deserves ive been watching this guy few years now hes been great everything ive seen caine is cast as alfred butler supplies genuinely warm comedy wit gary oldman morgan freeman are friendly allies although their roles are relatively minor katie holmes is attractive love interest she too is surprisingly good however its villains which have best parts liam neeson has his best role many years is fantastic it whilst last samurais ken watanabe is creepy as cult leader cillian murphy 28 days later is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy scarecrow whilst tom wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as hardline gangster even rutger hauer is it thats gotta be good seeing as hes been stuck dtv movie hell decade film is long 2 hours be precise but suspense action keep it moving there are car chases fist fights massive battles lots other stuff going plot keeps you guessing all way through there are plenty surprising twists my only complaint is that action is cut too fast too close so that its pretty hard see whats happening but excellent soundtrack helps make up that still minor complaint with what is otherwise flawless film lets hope they all team up make some more classics like this,0.545676232369781,0.2330621887073499,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Batman,"We waited for years to get a new and better ""Batman"" movie than the one we got back in 1997 with ""Batman & Robin"" which was a complete disaster. This movie is probably the best of all the ""Batman"" movies to ever be released. Christopher Nolan reinvents this iconic character in the most humane way we have ever seen the character in before. It's also the greatest way we have ever seen. Christian Bale is a very good Batman, but I don't believe in his judgment all the time, taking a scene where he is about to kill a man, but fails when the same man is killed by another assassin. I didn't really get his full emotion in that scene, but he is still very good. Liam Neeson is the best villain for Batman to take on as he inhabits the iconic villain Ra's al Ghul who we all know from the comicbooks. This is a great movie that I can't help but love even more every single time I watch the movie.",batman,we waited years get new better batman movie than one we got back 1997 with batman robin which was complete disaster this movie is probably best all batman movies ever be released christopher nolan reinvents this iconic character most humane way we have ever seen character before its also greatest way we have ever seen christian bale is very good batman but i dont believe his judgment all time taking scene where he is about kill man but fails when same man is killed by another assassin i didnt really get his full emotion that scene but he is still very good liam neeson is best villain batman take as he inhabits iconic villain ras al ghul who we all know comicbooks this is great movie that i cant help but love even more every single time i watch movie,0.4206286894923258,0.39249704840613936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.58, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.12}"
10.0,"A darker, stormier knight.","Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again.

8.0,Mature Batman Origin Story With Enough Comic Book Flair To Satisfy Fans Of Every Kind,"Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce's point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan's two follow-ups, Begins doesn't get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham's elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it's own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton's Batman universe, but it's blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.85/100",mature batman origin story with enough comic book flair satisfy fans every kind,batman begins was massive breath fresh air when it came out 2005 coming 8 years after warner brothers jumped bat as it were with joel schumachers childish mess batman robin christopher nolans batman begins brought maturity seriousness caped crusader that had been absent since tim burton left world gotham while batman begins might not boast visual prowess or rich villains burtons two batman movies it fleshed out character bruce wayne way no movie has since batman begins is origin story straight through detailing bruce waynes christian bale emergence tragically scarred child symbol heroism darkness after training with ras al ghul league shadows bruce wayne returns gotham perfect mental physical shape what nolan screenwriter david goyer do perfectly here is inject bruce wayne with emotion never before seen batman movie you can feel pain grief wayne is experiencing you can see why he decides become living symbol good first full origin story batman film batman begins is very much told bruces point view earlier batman movies often focused more heavily developing villains leaving bruce wayne shadows approach that keeps batman dark mysterious figure is valiant one it makes sense however context rarely hurts batman begins provides character with heaps context you can clearly understand emotions motivations man behind mask origin is also utterly believable you can see why bruce wayne dresses like bat why he needs cape how he gets super car super gadgets why he hides cave does it strip batman his mythic status yes bit luckily unlike nolans two follow ups begins doesnt get too carried away with realism retaining comic book style that its successor would forget while it does take while bruce wayne fully become bat it is worth it once bruce wayne finally dons cape cowl there are few jaw dropping action scenes including brilliant batmobile chase scene thrilling climax gothams elevated trains atmosphere feeling gotham city is nearly perfect its own way it does not have gothic beauty tim burtons batman universe but its blend comic book dinginess contemporary sleekness makes gotham terrifically realized cityscape city feels like what comic book world would be like if it actually existed batman himself is dark brooding wonderfully realized character his own right he shares screen with ensemble great actors michael caine as alfred morgan freeman as lucius fox gary oldman as commissioner gordon are standouts ensemble cast that is playing comic book material straight as arrow cillian murphy as scarecrow is excellent but criminally underused baddie but whole supporting cast elevates material batman begins is still as fresh today as it was more than decade ago origin batman is engaging engrossing emotional story provides context bruce wayne character that elevates movie beyond its fun comic book plot origin is satisfying believable one once batman finally enters scene action is unmatched batman begins is strong confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity emotional truth than most dramas i hesitate call it definitive interpretation batman batman 1989 takes that title but batman begins is best christopher nolans batman movies film that balances gritty realism human drama thrilling comic book fun 85 100,0.5466279761904763,0.26057142857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Let's get serious...the real Batman has arrived!...,"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait.

10.0,Everything I could have hoped for,"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind).",everything i could have hoped,i had fearful reservations about this one i loved tim burtons batman 12 years old when it came out i was perfect age it i also enjoyed batman returns franchise went so wrong under joel schumacher that i wasnt sure i wanted it resurrected not least because batman was one few comics i read enjoyed as kid was always my favourite superhero i grew up reading comics watching reruns adam west tv show then getting burtons celluloid vision i was spoilt choice as kid but as adult now i was concerned revisiting franchise especially given warners record over last decade screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over place dare i bring up matrix sequels however i am pleased report i could not have been more wrong about how great christopher nolans batman begins is this is better than burton sacrilege you say well burton was still cartoony many elements he wasnt churning out bilge schumacher but burtons batman was still over top as kid this was ideal but nolans batman is real everything this world seems plausible it is therefore world that draws you characters vulnerability is that much more present every bruise every scare every concern every emotion seems real part this is that nolan has assembled exemplary cast again this concerned me prior seeing film i wasnt sure cast big name legends like michael caine morgan freeman well known names like liam neeson katie holmes wouldnt detract distract batman i was always sure christian bale could be great moody batman hes been waiting his career be but others i wasnt so sure about that said bale is not just good hes superb i never thought id really be able envision anyone other than michael keaton as definitive batman me but since seeing batman begins couple days ago bale has cemented himself position perhaps keaton will now be able escape spectre batman he hasnt truly shaken off 13 years rest cast is also pitch perfect cillian murphy is creepy as hell liam neeson is authoritative imposing katie holmes is strong sexy i particularly thought shed be insipid she should jettison tom cruise let her talent which she does have naysayers just watch pieces april speak itself michael caine is alfred youve never seen but fact far more likely as butler than aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed gary oldman is also superb rare wholly decent character him as lieutenant jim gordon who gets far more so here than gordon has ever had do before only tom wilkinson is little off with slightly comedic wise guy american accent that never really convinces emotional bond between bruce wayne alfred is actually wonderful human heart film than nolan goyer have written perfectly dont let that make you think action is not front centre though waynes training through early stages film his early missions as batman at about half way point thrillingly choreographed chase sequence edge your seat finale this film delivers cool quotient bucket loads great villains especially murphy great story great cast great action put simply great film probably best comic book movie ever made thats excluding genius sin city which i consider moving comic book rather than comic book movie that will never be bettered but batman is different beast best its kind,0.6142810457516338,0.3078921568627453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Nolan is the real superhero,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called ""Batman"" in 1989, selfishly I said, ""I want something new!"".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic.",nolan is real superhero,tell truth i thought batman franchise could never be saved i was really let down that i may never see my favorite superhero good movie ever again then i saw preview batman begins i didnt really know what think new batman new alfred new story new style i wasnt sure why i wanted it old way but maybe i wanted actors batman films i grew up with revive themselves make good batman movie i wanted robin sadly batgirl alongside batman saving world another familiar villain i heard batman begins i thought great this was called batman 1989 selfishly i said i want something new but course being big batman fan i went opening night begings 2 half hours later like rest audience was completely blown away it was only movie i had ever been yes i have been some great ones where crowd claps end this was not just golf claps popcorn clip this was standing ovation 10 30 pm show crowded theater austin texas i never would have thought this would have worked even with nolan directing but i was wrong so wrong after seeing x mens spidermans i clearly thought marvel had upperhand dc was just simply trying keep up again so wrong nolan gave us dark gritty pleasantly realistic view batman bale gives tremendous performance as both batman bruce wayne michael caine was fabulous alfred morgan freeman almost stole show as luscious fox even though x men spiderman all them are wonderful superhero movies batman begins is just good no great movie i think that is what blew people away that it wasnt just some superhero special effect hero gets girl good guy wins movie it was truly dark well crafted movie it maybe stupid say but it didnt even feel like you were watching superhero movie i dont even think burton his animated style which works could have revived this troubled series that schumaker wrecked because like fantastic four daredevil tried over do it give us latter part things so here is you chris nolan you saved franchise you made unforgettable movie that will be remembered as best superhero movie all time but just all around great unforgettable movie classic,0.5875815295815296,0.18116810966810967,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.2}"
8.0,Good start to Nolan's trilogy,"Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two.",good start nolans trilogy,director christopher nolan is rebooting dark knight with ever darker style it is faux realism he starts off with death bruces parents after not able kill their killer bruce is chinese prison where he meets mysterious ras al ghul it is anti obi wan kenobi his message is dark perversion justice when he returns gotham he invents batman there are two things that keep this even more impressive start nolans batman trilogy first is katie holmes she is not up task she is still playing that little girl character dawsons creek she doesnt have seriousness or gravitas play this gutsy lawyer character its big character not just another girlfriend second is that scarecrow cillian murphy isnt big enough villain evil plan has too much silly bond feeling it is too unrealistic batman movie that is suppose be realistic it leaves bad taste climatic ending other than those two this is still great start trilogy it sets tone final two,0.5307971014492753,-0.015036231884057966,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.5}"
,DC Finally Got It Right. This Is A Grittier And Darker Batman Story,"Batman Begins is a well told story of the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale). It covers a lot of the same ground as Michael Keaton's original Batman, but goes much further in depth in many factors of his creation. It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume, what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he chose to be bat-like.One of the more interesting aspects here is how it shows Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), and how he molded Bruce's life and instilled good judgment within him, a point which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes in contact with. Thomas, too, teaches Bruce valuable lesson, such as ""We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up"". This is pretty close to the theme of the movie or motto Bruce Wayne lives by. The resemblance of the father & son is pretty good, too.I also thoroughly enjoyed the training Bruce Wayne endured becoming ""invincible"". Bruce is trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson) in many ways like a ninja (The concept of Batman IS similar to a ninja). He is taught many valuable lessons in this temple and is shown no mercy. Eventually, we even see his first real enemy as a superhero/vigilante.Although I am not positive as to how true to the comic book this movie is, I am sure it took a few liberties, as did Spider-Man. Most of the small examples I have noticed are for the better and make for a good story. The Batmobile is more believable as an expensive armored vehicle that the military would not spend the money on than a juiced up Corvette (or whatever that was). Same with the Batsuit.Katie Holmes is excellent as Rachel Dawes, a D.A. who is not afraid to go after the big villains in court. Also worthy of mentioning is Michael Caine as Alfred the butler. I do not believe they could have found a better man for that role, although I could not get the image of Caine as Austin Powers' dad out of my head when he was on screen.Finally, in my opinion, Christian Bale makes a much better Batman than the three recent previous ones in Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Something about him makes Batman darker and more mysterious. Hopefully, DC Comics and movies have learned from their mistakes and we will not have to worry about Batman picking up a sidekick in this newest installment of the Batman series. 9/10",dc finally got it right this is grittier darker batman story,batman begins is well told story origin bruce wayne batman christian bale it covers lot same ground as michael keatons original batman but goes much further depth many factors his creation it goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume what exactly it is same goes with batmobile we also find out why he chose be bat like one more interesting aspects here is how it shows bruces father thomas wayne linus roache how he molded bruces life instilled good judgment within him point which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes contact with thomas too teaches bruce valuable lesson such as we fall so we can learn pick ourselves up this is pretty close theme movie or motto bruce wayne lives by resemblance father son is pretty good too i also thoroughly enjoyed training bruce wayne endured becoming invincible bruce is trained by ducard liam neeson many ways like ninja concept batman is similar ninja he is taught many valuable lessons this temple is shown no mercy eventually we even see his first real enemy as superhero vigilante although i am not positive as how true comic book this movie is i am sure it took few liberties as did spider man most small examples i have noticed are better make good story batmobile is more believable as expensive armored vehicle that military would not spend money than juiced up corvette or whatever that was same with batsuit katie holmes is excellent as rachel dawes d who is not afraid go after big villains court also worthy mentioning is michael caine as alfred butler i do not believe they could have found better man that role although i could not get image caine as austin powers dad out my head when he was screen finally my opinion christian bale makes much better batman than three recent previous ones michael keaton val kilmer george clooney something about him makes batman darker more mysterious hopefully dc comics movies have learned their mistakes we will not have worry about batman picking up sidekick this newest installment batman series 9 10,0.5312756415697593,0.26203420762244295,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,And i thought the Combination of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton was as good as its gonna get?,"I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get.I'm glad to say that i was wrong, Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to the very beginning, fleshing out the characters of both Bruce Wayne and Batman down to the finest details. Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received.

9.0,By far the most intense of them all,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.",by far most intense them all,ive seen all batman movies most arent that deeply lodged my memory i know that scene stealers most them are villains this movie puts it strong shoulders bruce wayne batman movie is about him his ghosts his baggage it is about man coming grips with immense guilt it goes into great detail explain us how batman came be it has verisimilitude bad guys are course really exaggerated their evil plans everything is neatly plotted there is fragility both character wayne city he his family loved organized crime abounds he must face it pretty much alone i was quite impressed with inspector gordon gary oldmann he was believable fragile yet committed what was right amidst culture evil even police force like is so often case i cant speak people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when movie doesnt follow their dictates yet i really was involved this this is quite all star cast with excellent direction with bleakness that tim burton also did well i think it was one last years best films,0.673015873015873,0.2070436507936508,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,"A Batman that is stylish, dark and gritty- simply brilliant!","My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.Visually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent.The acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.Overall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",batman that is stylish dark gritty simply brilliant,my only criticism this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is little too long but it is extremely good film that along with original batman could very well be best batman films thought perhaps just lacking original films sophistication people may find this blasphemy but i did prefer this over dark knight but that was still very good christopher nolans batman begins is stylish dark gritty pretty much what batman should be i have seen complaints that film contradicts 1989 film perhaps so but what i can say films defence is that batman begins is sort very loose prequel original movies visually batman begins looks absolutely incredible it could very well be most beautiful visually batman films with beautiful cinematography simply dazzling view gotham city itself another asset i appreciated was that music score didnt overpower action fact it gave some atmospheric flavour it as much as danny elfmans scores were outstanding definitely memorable hans zimmer james newton howard do great job with score script is taut well written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour plot isnt convoluted or predictable but original film moves briskly second half was marginally better terms pacing first half though but that is no way flaw action is explosive particularly climax bat mobile car chase also christopher nolans direction is excellent acting aside visuals is what drives film christian bale is me best batman since michael keaton role batman he is suitably dark brooding like batman should be as bruce wayne he is dashing handsome ambitious katie holmes actually surprised me good way she wasnt bland or annoying i actually found her sympathetic surprisingly good liam neeson is also very good though he has been better while michael caine is perfect as alfred cillian murphy tom wilkinson excellent underrated gary oldman are also solid their roles while morgan freeman is wonderful as always overall brilliant film that is visually stunning gripping atmospheric 9 5 10 bethany cox,0.5613963963963965,0.31417792792792787,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,The best and most underrated in the Dark Knight Trilogy,"Eight years after the infamous abomination Batman & Robin that killed the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan stepped in and started a whole new series a darker (even darker than the first two Tim Burton Batman movies) and realistic level. Now at first, I wasn't mad on Batman Begins because at first I thought it was boring and it took a while to get to the part where Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. But after a while, I loved the film. In fact, it turned out to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton. I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal; not to mention better-looking. It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight Rises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't think it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins.

10.0,Rebirth Of A Legend - The greatest reboot of an origin story!,"Batman Begins (2005) is actually great reboot of The Dark Knight trilogy and a start of the origin tale of Batman, but is not the best one in the series, that will be The Dark Knight (2008). Batman Begins is strayed from the comic books. My DC comic super hero on a 1st rank will always be Batman I always love Batman from comic books, cartoons and movies more than other superheroes. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it because I thought, it was boring and I didn't got the story. I grew up with Batman (1989) Michael Keaton and I did too loved much more than this one. But than I kept watching and watching it and I fall in love it, It always entertained me. In my opinion Christopher Nolan's and Burton's Batman are all great movies. If it weren't for its amazing sequel this would be the greatest superhero film ever made. The film that started it all... a Batman film but with a more realistic, gritty and original approach. If your a fan of Batman and you haven't seen this you are going to LOVE every minute. It is smart, innovative, awe-inspiring and for a bat-fan, iconic. Christopher Nolan focuses on the origin and story behind a man standing against justice rather than the quirky early attempts. Its just a shame that this isn't as popular as The Dark Knight because it deserves the glory just as much. If your new and you've only just seen TDK, watch this purely because it catapulted this reinvention of a hero to great heights. TDK has the rise of The Clown Prince Of Crime and the escallation that was inevitable. Batman Begins has the creation of Batman and the lengths of which he had to go in order to combat injustice in a city that did not know justice. Watch this, it is a classic. What I like in Batman Begins is the origin story. I like that the movie focus on a comic book movie sadly Burton Batman doesn't follow on Batman origin story but follows more Joker story and I didn't pay for this movie to see Katie Holmes but naked and to be laid I am glad he didn't do that don't get me wrong but I don't like action hero's that always, always get a girl at the end of the movie and get laid I hate that! I am glad this was the beginning of Batman and the film took a different turn. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) did not get laid or get the girl once. I love this movie and I am true Batman fan I always was more Batman fan than a Superman fan. Bruce Wayne being trained and been ninja the long path how he become Batman the fighting the suit the climbing the wall. Car chases, action sequences are awesome! The actors: Christian Bale is an excellent darker Batman. He acted perfectly his role as Bruce and Batman the same time. I love Liam Neeson I think that actor did a wonderful convincing performance as Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul. He deserve a credit for his role that this movie redeem it self. Liam Neeson was terrific awesome convincing actor. This role was one of the reason why I become Liam Neeson fan and I enjoy his new action thrillers: Taken, Walk Among the Tombstones , Non-Stop, Taken 2 and Unknown. Rutger Hauer was awesome did you know he had a small role in comic book series Smallville? He was in Season 3 Episode 1 & 2. Cillian Murphy was great as Scarecrow! I love him and Tom Wilkinson was awesome too! Gary Oldman was amazing as Jim Gordon.Things I don't like in this movie: Batman Begins was really slow, the first hour of the movie was boring and really dramatic. The fighting sequence in this movie were shot to close with camera so we barely see a any fights between Batman and Ra's Al Ghul. Bruce Wayne blamed him self for his parents death. It wasn't his fault! The murder of his parents was too much dramatic too much for my eyes and Katie Holmes sadly I don't like her in this movie I would replace her with Maggie Gyllenhall or any other actress. I thought Maggie portrayed Rachel Dawes much better and made a better job in the sequel than Katie Holmes did. The fight between Batman and Ras' Al Ghul on a train I don't like it. Because the fight scene is too close, you can barely see who hit's who. That is the thing, that bothers me the most in this movie. The fight scenes in Burton's Batman are so much better, awesome than in Christopher Nolan's Batman and he could have made the fights scenes believable like Burton did. Peace <3./: I love this movie and it is a 9 by me.

8.0,Very good,"'Batman Begins' started on the right foot and started the best superhero trilogy of all time. In this film, the protagonist character is so well represented, that the whole environment around him seems to reinforce his characteristics. Gotham City has never been so well represented, and the scenarios that gave life to the city made it seem that it was always night and that perfectly portray the darkness experienced by the bat man. To complete such harmony, the plot created in the viewer a sense of reality so well thought out that darkness seemed to be everywhere, except in the moments of light from Bruce's past in the dear Wayne mansion, or when it involved him with other dear characters, like Rachel and her butler Alfred. And, magnificently, the villains Falcone, Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul only magnify the story further by gradually causing terror in Gotham, spreading crime until it reaches the main point that gives life to the bat man, protecting the city from its own destruction, and justly the one who contributed most to bringing Batman to life became the one who most needed to get him out of the way simply because of a divergence of opinions that define a hero of the villain, although still within the line of justice. It is an intelligent morality and better preached than in any other superhero film, and that define hero as such, but that still makes you understand and admire the lines of reasoning of all the characters, including the villains. If you have never been satisfied with superhero stories so far and consider them silly, watch this movie and you will never have the same opinion again, and you will see that reality is much more like comic fiction than you think.Film seen on August 15, 2020.",very good,batman begins started right foot started best superhero trilogy all time this film protagonist character is so well represented that whole environment around him seems reinforce his characteristics gotham city has never been so well represented scenarios that gave life city made it seem that it was always night that perfectly portray darkness experienced by bat man complete such harmony plot created viewer sense reality so well thought out that darkness seemed be everywhere except moments light bruces past dear wayne mansion or when it involved him with other dear characters like rachel her butler alfred magnificently villains falcone scarecrow ras al ghul only magnify story further by gradually causing terror gotham spreading crime until it reaches main point that gives life bat man protecting city its own destruction justly one who contributed most bringing batman life became one who most needed get him out way simply because divergence opinions that define hero villain although still within line justice it is intelligent morality better preached than any other superhero film that define hero as such but that still makes you understand admire lines reasoning all characters including villains if you have never been satisfied with superhero stories so far consider them silly watch this movie you will never have same opinion again you will see that reality is much more like comic fiction than you think film seen august 15 2020,0.6071100164203613,0.3142200328407224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
6.0,Better the second time around...,"The first time I watched ""Batman Begins"" I can't really claim to have been overly impressed with this origins story, and I remember finding the characters sort of plain and the story equally so.Now, several years later, watching the movie on TV, I am a bit surprised to say that the movie is actually a lot better this time. And the storyline actually had more depth and flavor than I remembered.Christian Bale is unquestionably the best chance for portraying Batman and Bruce Wayne, and manages to take the character and his performance one step further with each successive movie.The characters in the movie were adequate, although the Scarecrow character wasn't really fully utilized, nor given as much time on the screen as I would have liked. And Cillian Murphy was an interesting choice of actor for this role; not a bad choice, mind you. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine are also excellently cast for their roles.Chris Nolan also turned out to be the director with the most interesting approach to directing Batman movies.",better second time around,first time i watched batman begins i cant really claim have been overly impressed with this origins story i remember finding characters sort plain story equally so now several years later watching movie tv i am bit surprised say that movie is actually lot better this time storyline actually had more depth flavor than i remembered christian bale is unquestionably best chance portraying batman bruce wayne manages take character his performance one step further with each successive movie characters movie were adequate although scarecrow character wasnt really fully utilized nor given as much time screen as i would have liked cillian murphy was interesting choice actor this role not bad choice mind you gary oldman michael caine are also excellently cast their roles chris nolan also turned out be director with most interesting approach directing batman movies,0.39386446886446885,0.30842490842490844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Batman has truly begun!,"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

10.0,Outstanding Batman 'Prequel',"This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. The first hour of this ""prequel"" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role, ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected, and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face, leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but, once again, played by another actor.)The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman, featuring ""The Joker.""After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion. Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!",outstanding batman prequel,this latest batman film disappointed lot people but not me i appreciated it because they didnt overdo violence didnt have stupid romance angle muddy up real story fount it interesting history how batman became batman first hour this prequel dealt with his origins if youre fan comic book stories other batman films this part film should not bore you it was like documentary me about topic i was interested fact second viewing i enjoyed this even more christian bale did fine job as latest batman its too bad there have been so many actors playing this role ruining continuity this latest series i hope bale continues with few more efforts with this character it was nice see michael caine role alfred he was excellent stabilizing force story katie holmes did not have anywhere near as big role or romantic one as i expected that was fine with me i just enjoyed looking at her face leaving it go at that gary oldman was also interesting as low key young detective gordon who would go become commissioner gordon all other episodes but once again played by another actor film ends with what would be beginning first batman featuring joker after having seen all batman films several times i now think is best them all perhaps unpopular choice but thats my opinion dont let naysayers keep you watching this movie you might be missing best batmans,0.47703252032520327,0.208130081300813,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Finally!!!,"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",finally,i got chance see batman begins just this past friday evening i must say that before seeing film i felt my heart this is batman film weve been waiting within ten minutes into movie i turned my date said her this is it this is movie i just cant believe that after all these years warner bros finally got it right me most intriguing part film apart great script great acting was christopher nolans decision base film reality deciding that batman could really exist our universe our world was stroke genius another aspect film thats so refreshing is that instead focus being villain batman is films star rightly so its amazing what can happen when studio leaves respected director creative team alone allow them make best movie possible only two negatives that i can think is katie holmes fight sequences holmes does indeed look like teenager playing grown up her performance isnt bad per se its just that you really dont buy her as assistant d as fight sequences i felt cameras angles were too tight action edited too quickly lit too dark so that you really couldnt tell what was going determine who was hitting who maybe we can attribute this fact that nolan is not action director hopefully next film will open up fight sequences so we can actually see batman use martial arts skills he developed during his exile but apart those relatively minor quibbles film is excellent im definitely going back opening day june 15th seeing it second time third fourth viewing is definitely not out question,0.4418452380952381,0.1381547619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,The start of something truly spectacular.,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first.

3.0,But what three!,"While I enjoy Tim Burton ""Batman"" immensely, I cannot stand this one. What are the problems with ""Batman Begins""? Well, I can name at least three ones. But what three!Reality. How come they put Gotham City into the real world together with Rome and other true-to-life cities? It is simply laughable. In the Burton movie Gotham is such an amazing ethereal place that it just frees your mind. And here we have a dirty town next to New York or whatever.Background. In certain amounts the background is great. But when everything gets explained, stretched out, chewed and re-chewed with a detailed psychological analysis of the characters... it gets boring and nauseating. In ""Batman"" (1989) we had two psychos. They just clashed and the whole Gotham was a battlefield for the two maniacs who did not have to back themselves up with the loads of facts from their lives - they were too stylish for that paraphernalia and too insane. And what do we have here? Numerous flashbacks which are annoying. The main character's idiotic samurai-like training as if he were going to become a Jedi knight from ""Star Wars"" trilogy (and there is also that actor who performed in ""Star Wars: Episode 1""). Scrutinized explanation of the technology performed by Mr Morgan Freeman and of the way it can be purchased. Deep speeches delivered by the evil and good guys that resemble the notorious rubbish talks from ""Matrix: Reloaded"".Actors with profound performance. What the hell is wrong with the performance? It's too self-imposing. I feel as if these actors are going to burst from inside  their self-importance is simply overwhelming. I feel the need to shout at the TV-set: ""Come on guys! It's ""Batman"", not ""Born on the Forth of July""!"" Those serious talks and big serious faces resemble scenes from ""Godfather"". Fine, they are making a deep criminal saga out of a comics booklet. Just brilliant.That's enough to lower the mark to a 3-out-of-10 level. The conception has been ruined. It's no match for the ""Batman"" from the 1989. By the way, I tried to watch this movie twice. For me to watch it from top to toe was unbearable.My verdict: unwatchable for the most part of its running time, but at least not completely tasteless and repellent (its major achievement). 3 out of 10. I would never bother commenting this one but it's on the top list while ""Batman"" (1989) is not. I cannot take this for granted.

7.0,What's all the fuss? It's just OK,"Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.OK--it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed. I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up! It does have good parts--Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He also pumped up for the role (we have at least two shirtless scenes). It LOOKS great (if very dark) and it has elaborate special effects left and right (with tons of explosions thrown in too). But I was mostly bored. The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly--it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans. Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere. At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines. This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an ""atmosphere"" to the scene. Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job (i.e. entertaining you). However Batman's costume, the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically.Acting varies--Bale was just great. Michael Caine (as Alfred) matched him. Even Katie Holmes (a limited actress) was good--too bad she won't be in the sequel (this inexplicable romance/marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career). Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher--he appeared to be drugged out. Gary Olman was (suprisingly) terrible as Jim Gordon--he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role. But Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale) and Morgan Freeman were all great.To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once. I couldn't wait for this thing to get over. All the praise this is getting is beyond me. I give it a 7--and that's mostly for the acting.",whats all fuss its just ok,batman redone it gives us new origin batman christian bale how he got his powers such he still plays playboy bruce wayne while fighting evil as batman his first two villains are scarecrow cillain murphy who produces intense fear his victim with gas ras al ghul who trained batman knows all his weaknesses ok its much better then tim burtons dreadful movies but i still wasnt too impressed i didnt like new origin at all its full hour before batman even shows up it does have good parts bale is dead perfect as bruce wayne batman he also pumped up role we have at least two shirtless scenes it looks great if very dark it has elaborate special effects left right with tons explosions thrown too but i was mostly bored training sequence at beginning just went endlessly it was more like shadows origin than batmans also this movie was way too heavy darkness atmosphere at one point it was raining i noticed nobody gotham pulled their clothes their lines this isnt nit picking but obviously it was all out there add atmosphere scene also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that movie just isnt doing its job i e entertaining you however batmans costume batcave batmobile are all explained pretty logically acting varies bale was just great michael caine as alfred matched him even katie holmes limited actress was good too bad she wont be sequel this inexplicable romance marriage with tom cruise is destroying her career laim neeson was very dull as teacher he appeared be drugged out gary olman was suprisingly terrible as jim gordon he seems very unsure how play role but rutger hauer linus roache who bears uncanny resemblance bale morgan freeman were all great be totally honest i looked at my watch more than once i couldnt wait this thing get over all praise this is getting is beyond me i give it 7 thats mostly acting,0.570197628458498,0.11592367777150385,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
