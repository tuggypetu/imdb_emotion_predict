10,A Hauntingly Adept Cinematic Masterpiece,"HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity.",hauntingly adept cinematic masterpiece,haider me is acronym that means following h haunting be it its background score music lyrics playback especially rekha bharadwaj sukhwinder singh arijit singh cinematography or backdrop kashmir 1995 haider is haunting how film will stay with you long after you have left theater astounding haider is astoundingly adept adaptation classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective your knowledge about shakespearean tragedy hamlet if you dont know hamlet great you do even better i incredible haider is incredible terms its performances be it that shahid kapoor haider hamlet who performs complex role with kind award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once all or that matter triumvirate tabu halala gertrude ethereal dauntless supreme kay kay menon khurram claudius terrific resolute subtle or irfan khan rooh ghost hamlets father rudimentary underplayed not be forgotten is shraddha kapoor aarshi ophelia who pitches performance that is pictureesque perfect so full finesse course two salman khans who are fans superstar who will surely gain some fans their own post this film fact every single member cast pitches perfect performance here irrespective role duration d daring haider is daring talking about issues that many wouldnt touch with bargepole way it has juxtaposed shakespearean tragedy with human tragedy kashmir valley is character here that finally finds voice its own interpretations that voice are truly brilliant e effective sometimes experimentation reinterpretations fail not here with layer upon layer waiting audience be interpreted example touch oedipal complex between mother son growing guilt well meaning lover song gravediggers examples chutzpah its comparison with afspa etc haider is effective multiple levels truly faultless its execution r rooh spirit soul this is film with indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die include their body work which vishal bharadwaj effectively manages this lifetime this film has that which many masterpiece may sometimes lack soul terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music soul stirring performances soul warming message short watch haider theater vishal bharadwaj director composer writer shahid rising prince tabu eternal queen gulzar lyricist cinematography by pankaj kapoor editing by aarif sheikh finally kashmir unforgettable voice humanity,0.6806939830195645,0.3370985603543743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"

9,Haider: Literature on screen. 'Bard'waj's best!,"So, hours after I have finished watching the best movie to have come out this year( by a margin), I am finally in a condition to write anything about it. I am going to stick my neck out and say, Haider is the best work of Vishal Bhardwaj till date. There is no doubt, that for a story driven by passion, revenge, love and power, where emotional dispute forms the core of it, no land other than Kashmir, which has been living under the clouds of dispute ever since, would have been a better choice as the setting for the adaptation. The film is haunting and engrossing. It seamlessly adapts Hamlet and at the same time creates unforgettable characters of its own and makes us see a complex world through their eyes. I can't recall any other film which has completely been shot in the valley and surely none depicting it in all it's glory. The film takes off with the event around which the actions of all the the players of the movie would revolve. One gets only the first hour to get to know the basic nature of the characters as platform for the mind blowing second half is being built. At the cusp of the interval when an ever assured Irrfan Khan makes an intriguing entry, you only get a hint of things to come. The second half unleashes on you Shahid Kapur, who for the first time in his career shows glimpses of Pankaj Kapur. Those three minutes ( you would know which when you watch it ) where Shahid displays what all he is capable of, are those you would want to watch again and again. Kay Kay Menon is now a veteran and he doesn't disappoint.The only weak link to this extraordinary cast could have been Shraddha Kapoor, but she surprises everyone with a very composed yet captivating presence on screen. The heart of the film lies in the eyes of Tabu who makes the movie as deep as the depth of her eyes and as intensely beautiful as her voice. As we hear that Vishal Bhardwaj was not ready to make the film without Tabu, you will believe it once you have watched the film. There is no way you can expect anything short of the best from the dialogues and music, when Gulzar Saab and VB themselves are at helm and they ensure that you do not fall off track even for a moment. A cinematographer can hardly mess it up when you are shooting in paradise. After a brushstroke in Rockstar and a miniature art-piece in Lootera, we get to seethe full painting of Kashmir in Haider. There are enough funny spots in this dark tale of complex emotions,thanks to the fact that Salman Khan had long hair during the period the movie is set. The film has various undertones which were obviously part of the play as well. It would have required a director and screenwriter who is at the peak of his direction and writing skills to have made it happen. The dexterity with which Vishal Bhardwaj has been able to pull it off shows us why he is probably the best in the business in India. I feel, it requires at least another watching before one can completely absorb the enormity of the work that has been created. Salute Vishal 'Bard'waj. Go get Haidered because rarely do you get a chance to read literature on screen.",haider literature screen bardwajs best,so hours after i have finished watching best movie have come out this year by margin i am finally condition write anything about it i am going stick my neck out say haider is best work vishal bhardwaj till date there is no doubt that story driven by passion revenge love power where emotional dispute forms core it no land other than kashmir which has been living under clouds dispute ever since would have been better choice as setting adaptation film is haunting engrossing it seamlessly adapts hamlet at same time creates unforgettable characters its own makes us see complex world through their eyes i cant recall any other film which has completely been shot valley surely none depicting it all its glory film takes off with event around which actions all players movie would revolve one gets only first hour get know basic nature characters as platform mind blowing second half is being built at cusp interval when ever assured irrfan khan makes intriguing entry you only get hint things come second half unleashes you shahid kapur who first time his career shows glimpses pankaj kapur those three minutes you would know which when you watch it where shahid displays what all he is capable are those you would want watch again again kay kay menon is now veteran he doesnt disappoint only weak link this extraordinary cast could have been shraddha kapoor but she surprises everyone with very composed yet captivating presence screen heart film lies eyes tabu who makes movie as deep as depth her eyes as intensely beautiful as her voice as we hear that vishal bhardwaj was not ready make film without tabu you will believe it once you have watched film there is no way you can expect anything short best dialogues music when gulzar saab vb themselves are at helm they ensure that you do not fall off track even moment cinematographer can hardly mess it up when you are shooting paradise after brushstroke rockstar miniature art piece lootera we get seethe full painting kashmir haider there are enough funny spots this dark tale complex emotions thanks fact that salman khan had long hair during period movie is set film has various undertones which were obviously part play as well it would have required director screenwriter who is at peak his direction writing skills have made it happen dexterity with which vishal bhardwaj has been able pull it off shows us why he is probably best business india i feel it requires at least another watching before one can completely absorb enormity work that has been created salute vishal bardwaj go get haidered because rarely do you get chance read literature screen,0.492849794238683,0.20277777777777767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.44}"

8,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Vishal Bhardwaj's final chapter in Shakespeare trilogy,"Haider is the latest offering from the renowned Indian filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj. Co-written by Basharat Peer and Bhardwaj himself, Haider is the third and final chapter in Bhardwaj's Shakespeare trilogy. Having already made successful adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool, 2003) and Othello (Omkara, 2006), Bhardwaj was left with the choice of adapting either King Lear or Hamlet to complete his trilogy. He opted for the latter because of the presence of a strong sexual undercurrent in the source material—a motif that harks back to the first two films of the trilogy. The uncanny choice of Kashmir of the 1990s—a treacherous avenue of unparalleled beauty and unfathomable danger where people just disappear, never to return again—as the movie's backdrop proves to be a stroke of pure genius as it helps Bhardwaj in orchestrating an enchanting mise-en-scène that elevates an otherwise sprawling orgy of histrionics to the realms of realism. By the mid-1990s, Kashmir had taken the form of a like a spewing volcano, a ticking time bomb ready to go kablooey at any given moment. The terrorist insurgency in the Kashmir valley had started to pose a serious threat to India's sovereignty and the army had to be given a carte blanche so as to guard the country against any possible threat from both within and as well as outside the country. The people of Kashmir started seeing the growing military activity in the region as a violation of their basic rights. The separatist leaders saw this as a golden opportunity to galvanize the masses against the state and started adding fuel to fire as the valley got encompassed in a miasma of mistrust. Although, the situation has improved significantly over the last decade, a lot of work still needs to be done before the conflict can be fully resolved. Bhardwaj's film also leaves a strong message not only for people of Kashmir but for all humanity that nothing can be gained through revenge and in the absence of trust.Adapting a work of Shakespeare is no kid's play. Even the most experienced campaigners can falter if their ambition gets the better of them. The key to adapting any major work of literature is to be wary of one's limitations. Haider is far from being called a perfect adaptation of Hamlet. But, Bhardwaj, to his credit, gets the job done. There are moments of sheer brilliance but there is also a lot of drivel which could have easily been chopped off. Haider has all the makings of an epic but it faces some serious pacing issues towards the second half. Also, the narrative appears to be sketchy at some places. But, that's the price that one must be willing to pay for one's ambition. One of the main themes of Hamlet is chaos. This chaos is most evident in the play's central character who, in many ways, is a personification of confusion and duality. His highly complex, fascinating albeit bizarre nature makes him a singular character in all literature, endowed with contradictory traits that fade the lines that separate virtue and vice, heroism and villainy, and sanity and madness. In Haider, Vishal Bharadwaj and Shahid Kapoor try their best to grapple with the endless contradictions that define Hamlet's multidimensional character. Oedipus complex is another major theme that runs through Hamlet. The term Oedipus complex denotes the subconscious emotions and ideas that focus upon a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. In Haider the syndrome is both latent and nuanced in comparison to the play.Haider not only serves as a decent adaptation of Hamlet, but it also proves to be a powerful socio-political commentary on Kashmir of the 1990s. Without the Kashmir angle, Haider would have appeared more empty and existential, with the Shakespearean characters merely playing their parts in a bid to reach the end of the trail. But, with Kashmir as its backdrop, it almost comes across as a propaganda films that aims to serve as a bitter reminder of our not too distant past. Haider is a warning of how easily the youngsters can be brainwashed and led astray by anti-national elements if the state machinery fails to look after them.While the acting is brilliant all around, it is Tabu who steals the show with a multilayered portrayal that would have guaranteed her an Oscar had Haider been a Hollywood production. Shahid Kapoor's performance in Haider is not perfect but is easily the best of his career, and it comes as no big surprise as Bhardwaj has a reputation to get the best out of his actors. Kay Kay Menon plays his detestable part with the desperation of a mangy scoundrel. Shraddha Kapoor serves well as an eye candy, but, beyond that, not much can be said of her acting. Irrfan Khan is brilliant as ever in the limited screen time that he gets. While the entire support cast does a reasonable job, Narendra Jha, who impresses in the role of Haider's father, deserves a special mention.Overall, Haider is a dark, distorted and diabolical work of cinematic art that falls well short of attaining perfection. At regular intervals, Bhardwaj tries to lighten up the mood perhaps to satisfy the cravings of the casual viewers. Needless to say, the movie is technically brilliant: cinematography, editing, and music are all at par with the international standards. The movie has several memorable sequences but the ones that stand out are: Shahid Kapoor's monologue, the sequence in which Haider brutally kills his captors, and the final graveyard sequence which may prove to be a real trendsetter as far as Hindi cinema is concerned. Haider is not meant for casual viewers for it will test their patience to the limit. As far as the intelligent viewers are concerned, the movie offers enough food for thought to keep them engaged.

8,One of the best adaptations of Hamlet,"Of the trilogy of films by Bhardwaj based on Shakespeare's work, Haider is probably the best one. The backdrop of 1990s Kashmir gives the film an unique look and feel. All the actors in the film have performed well. Most of the characters have grey shades but the actors have balanced the act. It appears as if the actors realized that they were working in a special film. Background score is brilliant; while most of the songs, unlike the regular Bollywood offerings, add value to the film and appear to be a part of the narrative. Can't find any major faults with this film. Of the Bollywood films that I have seen so far this year, Haider is the best bet for India's entry to Oscars. IMO, the film has created a new segment in Bollywood films.

8,Haider.,"The movie Haider, as most of you would be aware of is an adaptation of Shakespeaes' Hamlet. It does help if you have read the original work ,but believe me there is nothing in the movie which you cannot understand if you have not read it.In fact if you have not read it till now,its better because the story would be anew to you. Set in Kashmir it takes the essence of problems faced in Kashmir valley due to insurgency and counterinsurgency measures though it doesn't focus on the problem alone. In a broad sense this movie is about search of a father by a son and subsequent events which leads him nearer towards revenge. First of all the movie is not everybody's cup of tea. You've to be very patient throughout to get the real pleasure out of it. The film is slow paced so as to draw you into it, just like an old wine. And, like an old wine you are supposed to sip it and not drink it in a hurry. The ensemble actor list is itself worth mentioning from Shahid ,Shradhha,Kulbhushan Kharbanda to the talented KK Menon,Tabu and of course the ever reliable Irfan Khan. Their performance is indeed flawless in the movie.The relationships are well portrayed ,the agony and trauma well expressed and the hate ,betrayal ,action scenes well-choreographed and scripted(especially the action sequence in the last scene). The only fault I could find in the acting department is that because of the presence of so many good actors (though the movie has good runtime still) much is left to be desired especially from Irrfan Khan whose performance is too succinct for an actor of his caliber. As said earlier, the movie is slow paced but the script doesn't fail the plot often. There is hardly anytime where you find yourself napping in the movie. Songs are good especially Arjit Singhs voice again creates magic with 'khul kabhi'.Cinematography, background score(which sometimes sound like Bourne trilogy) are also good.

10,Best movie of 2014,"When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogues, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered ""foreign films"". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogues and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The picturization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider— a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare—and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy",best movie 2014,when films transmute william shakespeares poetic imagery atmosphere that his verses conjure into re imagined re contextualized visuals not merely reproduce action with select dialogues movie adaptation shakespeare play can be considered successful that is why thought british film scholar roger manvell shakespeare often translates best what he considered foreign films setting is one reasons haider vishal bhardwajs adaptation hamlet works it is true haunting ambiguity characters motives original play shakespeares most opaque tragedies but kashmir canvas is potent bhardwajs visual intelligence screenplay by bhardwaj basharat peer one indias acute commentators kashmir his home state add effective localization shakespearean purism aside haider is thrilling film it is film luxuriant paranoia it is about oedipal love unlike cardboard insurgency imagery or images damaged beauty that soak most films about kashmir haider is unflinching take kashmir malaise tragedy infused with sense dark humor about ordinary kashmiris hopelessness compared bhardwajs earlier two shakespeare adaptations maqbool macbeth omkara othello both which depended heavily language dialogues used shakespeares stories rather conveniently propel plot haider is quieter yet richer spectacle convincing standalone piece bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection that sense haider is tradition mainstream hindi cinema picturization songs is riveting watch pankaj kumars cinematography is breathtaking throughout especially songs songs are some bhardwajs best compositions as music director recent times melodrama towards end loosens narrative last half hour feels like bit drag again typical affliction hindi films protagonist is far melancholy dane haider which shahid kapoor plays with impressive zest inventiveness is more dashing combustible figure than brooder bhardwaj also does away with supernatural horror so integral original play which can be easy tool creating suspense drama cinema horror is everyday macabre reality death loss waiting manipulation kashmiri muslims emotions insecurities haider kapoor arrives kashmiri village he left long ago study at aligarh after his father doctor has disappeared his mother ghazala tabu is romantically close his fathers younger brother kay kay menon arshi shraddha kapoor his childhood sweetheart is torn between her pro indian establishment family haider who is devastated see his mothers sudden transformation his idyllic childhood with parents seemingly love is shattered when roohdar irrfan khan mysterious man with limp sends him message his lost father haider is destructive path jealousy hatred turmoil doubt central story is relationship between ghazala haider tender as well as anguished bond between mother son fueling film as essentially oedipal drama romantic love between arshi haider is almost sweet afterthought casting ideas work impressively well kay kay menon stands out as superbly calculating man villain haiders mind tabu makes heart rending ghazala shraddha kapoor delivers earnestly fervent performance irrfan khan is pitch perfect as quietly menacing presence only personification close ghostly apparition salman khan is here too deliciously manufactured ode hindi film hero through salman salman haiders friends pair all round crooks interesting replication rosencrantz guildenstern original play haider is immensely effective re imagination shakespeare films biggest triumph is that provincial this case kashmir characters defined by its reality shine universal timeless tragedy,0.5683974358974359,0.2565384615384616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10,Haider: a masterful re-imagining of Shakespeare's Hamlet,"Haider is not merely a remake of Hamlet. Vishal Bhardwaj has taken the source material, re-shaped it to meet the Indian context, and has made the story his own, while at the same time remaining faithful to the original. The story starts with Haider (Shahid Kapoor) returning to his home in insurgency-ridden Kashmir, after his father Hilaal Meer has been taken away by the army for treating an injured militant. Hilaal is a doctor, an idealist who believes in ""being on the side of life, not of ideology"". By the time Haider returns to his homeland, his father has joined the ranks of the ""disappeared"" and the home of his childhood has been destroyed. Worst of all, Haider's mother Ghazala (played by a luminous Tabu) seems to be drowning her sorrow in the arms of her brother-in-law Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Haider joins the ranks of those Kashmiris desperately searching for their loved ones who have disappeared - seeking his father in hospitals and morgues, turning over blood-drenched bodies in a truck, a sheaf of photocopied photos of his father in his backpack. His childhood sweetheart (Shraddha Kapoor) tries her best to be supportive, but is unable to break through his wall of depression. His depression spirals into rage when he is contacted by a mysterious Roohdaar (Irrfan Khan) who confirms that his father has been killed because of the machinations of Khurram and Ghazala, and that his father's wish was for Haider to avenge his death. From then on, the movie descends into the depths of Haider's thirst for vengeance. The choices he makes, and the consequences of those choices drive the rest of the movie to its inevitable conclusion.Shahid Kapoor plays Haider in the role of a lifetime. His talent, generally obscured by his pretty-boy looks, is in full force here. His eyes mirror his vulnerability and despair, his rage and brutality and eventually his madness. The movie belongs to him. Tabu is Ghazala, glorious as ever. Described as half-widow, half- bride, she does a wonderful job of conveying forbidden obsession and desperation. Her relationship with her son, with their unexplainable passion for each other, is delicately portrayed. Kay Kay Menon is, as always, wonderful as the clownish and somewhat pathetic Khurram, gradually revealing his true face. Irrfan Khan is impressive in his small role as Roohdaar. Vishal Bhardwaj has succeeded in capturing the desolate beauty of Kashmir, once described as ""heaven on earth"". The snow takes on a character of its own, and as Haider spirals into madness and destruction, the snow-filled roads and woods seem more threatening than beautiful. The movie effectively captures the struggle of an entire people, trapped by misplaced patriotism and opposing ideologies. Not an action movie, watch it to see poetry translated to the big screen.",haider masterful re imagining shakespeares hamlet,haider is not merely remake hamlet vishal bhardwaj has taken source material re shaped it meet indian context has made story his own while at same time remaining faithful original story starts with haider shahid kapoor returning his home insurgency ridden kashmir after his father hilaal meer has been taken away by army treating injured militant hilaal is doctor idealist who believes being side life not ideology by time haider returns his homeland his father has joined ranks disappeared home his childhood has been destroyed worst all haiders mother ghazala played by luminous tabu seems be drowning her sorrow arms her brother law khurram kay kay menon haider joins ranks those kashmiris desperately searching their loved ones who have disappeared seeking his father hospitals morgues turning over blood drenched bodies truck sheaf photocopied photos his father his backpack his childhood sweetheart shraddha kapoor tries her best be supportive but is unable break through his wall depression his depression spirals into rage when he is contacted by mysterious roohdaar irrfan khan who confirms that his father has been killed because machinations khurram ghazala that his fathers wish was haider avenge his death then movie descends into depths haiders thirst vengeance choices he makes consequences those choices drive rest movie its inevitable conclusion shahid kapoor plays haider role lifetime his talent generally obscured by his pretty boy looks is full force here his eyes mirror his vulnerability despair his rage brutality eventually his madness movie belongs him tabu is ghazala glorious as ever described as half widow half bride she does wonderful job conveying forbidden obsession desperation her relationship with her son with their unexplainable passion each other is delicately portrayed kay kay menon is as always wonderful as clownish somewhat pathetic khurram gradually revealing his true face irrfan khan is impressive his small role as roohdaar vishal bhardwaj has succeeded capturing desolate beauty kashmir once described as heaven earth snow takes character its own as haider spirals into madness destruction snow filled roads woods seem more threatening than beautiful movie effectively captures struggle entire people trapped by misplaced patriotism opposing ideologies not action movie watch it see poetry translated big screen,0.6396929824561403,0.17149122807017544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10,"An exceptional cinematic experience for anyone, anywhere in the world","The movie ""Haider"" proves that Bollywood has evolved and that India has now some bold filmmakers like Vishal Bharadwaj. This outstanding movie with a mind-blowing performance by Tabu deserves 10 stars, but I am holding one star because the movie fails to come off as unbiased and the movie could have done with better editing and zero romantic songs. First, the movie shows a realistic Kashmir - this is not the heavenly Srinagar of old Hindi movies, and the movie realistically depicts one of the problems that the people of Kashmir face. But here the movie should have balanced opinion in order to appear neutral. While the movie clearly shows things as seen with the eyes of terrorists or budding terrorists (Roohdar and Haider) and makes a case for these people to dislike Indian Army, it fails to explain why the Army has to resort to the measures that it does. The movie does not explicitly show the murders and the guerrilla war that the Army has to suffer at the hands of the terrorists. Even when the Army arrests Haider's dad, the doctor, for harboring terrorists in his home, the movie provides the counter-argument that the doctor is on ""life's side"". We then go on to see one of the primary characters, Haider, turn against the Army in search of his dad - and there is little ambiguity here - the filmmaker clearly wants you to sympathize with Haider. The only thing to the movie's credit in this matter is the message of peace borne by the protagonist Ghazala - yes, Ghazala, and not Haider, is the true protagonist of the movie because she plays the upper hand in all events including the climax - Bharadwaj has shifted the center of gravity of Shakespeare's play from Hamlet's dilemmas to Gertrude's mind.Screenplay is mostly perfect but slips at a few places. One of the strongest points of the movie is its ending. The screenplay puts a surprising twist to the Shakespearean drama. In a way, this is the movie's way to try to balance the case it has built for violence and revenge.Direction and cinematography are superb. Editing is also good, except the romantic songs, whose presence in the movie, first of all, I do not know the reason for, but worse, which have been inserted into the movie at the most unfitting moments. They actually end up making the viewer impatient instead of providing any respite.I would give primary credit for the movie to the performances, and above all, to Tabu. Ghazala is heart-breaking and her eyes and facial expressions speak volumes. Lending her full support is Kay Kay Menon in a highly convincing villainous Kashmiri role. Shahid Kapoor, as Haider, is exceptionally good in the second half of the movie, but not so convincing in the first half. The only weak link in the cast is Shraddha Kapoor and clearly stands out as an under- performing novice among veterans - fortunately, she has pulled off her last scene well - which is where her character really matters.All in all, ""Haider"" is a must-see Bollywood affair. It will leave you deeply moved and make you think. However, remember that the movie succeeds in making the case for only one side of the full picture, the main reason it loses one star in my rating.",exceptional cinematic experience anyone anywhere world,movie haider proves that bollywood has evolved that india has now some bold filmmakers like vishal bharadwaj this outstanding movie with mind blowing performance by tabu deserves 10 stars but i am holding one star because movie fails come off as unbiased movie could have done with better editing zero romantic songs first movie shows realistic kashmir this is not heavenly srinagar old hindi movies movie realistically depicts one problems that people kashmir face but here movie should have balanced opinion order appear neutral while movie clearly shows things as seen with eyes terrorists or budding terrorists roohdar haider makes case these people dislike indian army it fails explain why army has resort measures that it does movie does not explicitly show murders guerrilla war that army has suffer at hands terrorists even when army arrests haiders dad doctor harboring terrorists his home movie provides counter argument that doctor is lifes side we then go see one primary characters haider turn against army search his dad there is little ambiguity here filmmaker clearly wants you sympathize with haider only thing movies credit this matter is message peace borne by protagonist ghazala yes ghazala not haider is true protagonist movie because she plays upper hand all events including climax bharadwaj has shifted center gravity shakespeares play hamlets dilemmas gertrudes mind screenplay is mostly perfect but slips at few places one strongest points movie is its ending screenplay puts surprising twist shakespearean drama way this is movies way try balance case it has built violence revenge direction cinematography are superb editing is also good except romantic songs whose presence movie first all i do not know reason but worse which have been inserted into movie at most unfitting moments they actually end up making viewer impatient instead providing any respite i would give primary credit movie performances above all tabu ghazala is heart breaking her eyes facial expressions speak volumes lending her full support is kay kay menon highly convincing villainous kashmiri role shahid kapoor as haider is exceptionally good second half movie but not so convincing first half only weak link cast is shraddha kapoor clearly stands out as under performing novice among veterans fortunately she has pulled off her last scene well which is where her character really matters all all haider is must see bollywood affair it will leave you deeply moved make you think however remember that movie succeeds making case only one side full picture main reason it loses one star my rating,0.4481818181818182,0.17522727272727268,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9,Hamlet splendidly weaved into the militancy and raw beauty of Kashmir,"Macbeth, Othello, and now Hamlet. Vishal Bharadwaj does it once again, by re-imagining Shakespeare in a very gritty Indian milieu. This time it is the Kashmir of 1995 in throes of militancy.The instruments Vishal Bharadwaj used for Maqbool and Omkara, are far sharper this time around. The songs are very rustic, and completely of the type to be found in street plays (not even a symbolic nod to Bollywood or a titillation to the audiences with a Bidi). The sense of suspense even sharper (even with a story with a basis as well known as Hamlet). The characters continue to be just as eccentric as in Omkara. And death once again continues to be not an infrequent visitor just like with Omkara. Yet the context is more sombre. And the whole scenario of militancy IMO dealt with quite responsibly with (what I would imagine to be) a good sense of reality.Not everything is wonderful. On the acting front, Tabu is impressive but understated. Shahid Kapur does well by his standards, but every so often I used to wonder how much better Pankaj Kapur would've done in some of the scenes. Shraddha Kapoor manages the role of pretty innocence well enough, but will probably cringe when she watches her own histrionics. Kay Kay Menon, and Irfan Khan of course are a pleasure to watch, but this is not their best film. While the songs aim to dramatise, I found them underwhelming and unnecessarily melodramatic in this context, Also the film is just a tad too long and could've been shortened by 15-20 minutes.Be prepared to see a Kashmir which does not look the swiss alps but still deserves to be considered amongst the most beautiful places on earth. This kashmir is a little raw. And forms the milieu for two concurrent threads, one the intra family drama which is the very essence of Hamlet, and the general environment of militancy and counter insurgency.

10,Hadar is the best film,"Films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select duologue's, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered ""foreign films"". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and duologue's and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The pasteurization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider— a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare—and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy",hadar is best film,films transmute william shakespeares poetic imagery atmosphere that his verses conjure into re imagined re contextualized visuals not merely reproduce action with select duologues movie adaptation shakespeare play can be considered successful that is why thought british film scholar roger manvell shakespeare often translates best what he considered foreign films setting is one reasons haider vishal bhardwajs adaptation hamlet works it is true haunting ambiguity characters motives original play shakespeares most opaque tragedies but kashmir canvas is potent bhardwajs visual intelligence screenplay by bhardwaj basharat peer one indias acute commentators kashmir his home state add effective localization shakespearean purism aside haider is thrilling film it is film luxuriant paranoia it is about oedipal love unlike cardboard insurgency imagery or images damaged beauty that soak most films about kashmir haider is unflinching take kashmir malaise tragedy infused with sense dark humor about ordinary kashmiris hopelessness compared bhardwajs earlier two shakespeare adaptations maqbool macbeth omkara othello both which depended heavily language duologues used shakespeares stories rather conveniently propel plot haider is quieter yet richer spectacle convincing standalone piece bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection that sense haider is tradition mainstream hindi cinema pasteurization songs is riveting watch pankaj kumars cinematography is breathtaking throughout especially songs songs are some bhardwajs best compositions as music director recent times melodrama towards end loosens narrative last half hour feels like bit drag again typical affliction hindi films protagonist is far melancholy dane haider which shahid kapoor plays with impressive zest inventiveness is more dashing combustible figure than brooder bhardwaj also does away with supernatural horror so integral original play which can be easy tool creating suspense drama cinema horror is everyday macabre reality death loss waiting manipulation kashmiri muslims emotions insecurities haider kapoor arrives kashmiri village he left long ago study at aligarh after his father doctor has disappeared his mother ghazala tabu is romantically close his fathers younger brother kay kay menon arshi shraddha kapoor his childhood sweetheart is torn between her pro indian establishment family haider who is devastated see his mothers sudden transformation his idyllic childhood with parents seemingly love is shattered when roohdar irrfan khan mysterious man with limp sends him message his lost father haider is destructive path jealousy hatred turmoil doubt central story is relationship between ghazala haider tender as well as anguished bond between mother son fueling film as essentially oedipal drama romantic love between arshi haider is almost sweet afterthought casting ideas work impressively well kay kay menon stands out as superbly calculating man villain haiders mind tabu makes heart rending ghazala shraddha kapoor delivers earnestly fervent performance irrfan khan is pitch perfect as quietly menacing presence only personification close ghostly apparition salman khan is here too deliciously manufactured ode hindi film hero through salman salman haiders friends pair all round crooks interesting replication rosencrantz guildenstern original play haider is immensely effective re imagination shakespeare films biggest triumph is that provincial this case kashmir characters defined by its reality shine universal timeless tragedy,0.5683974358974359,0.2565384615384616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
