10.0,A tale of human condition. One of the best biopic from Bollywood. Irrfan was awesome.,"I saw this in a theatre. The acting in this film is the shinning point. Especially the main actor Irfaan khan made a great impression on my mind by his excellent acting skill. Irfaan excellently potrayed the emotion of a ""runner"" who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. The screenplay is brilliant. Being a biopic of an army guy/athlete who turned into a dacoit won't b a happy/fun movie. It's a very sad movie. But Irfann did manage to evoke some light moments by his sheer one liners n acting. Imagine an athlete who's very good in running has to run away from police. The direction was good n the cinematography was good capturing the harsh, dry, rural difficult terrain.",tale human condition one best biopic bollywood irrfan was awesome,i saw this theatre acting this film is shinning point especially main actor irfaan khan made great impression my mind by his excellent acting skill irfaan excellently potrayed emotion runner who is suffering pain frustration exhaustion but he is not giving up rest is portrayal man who has never had it easy his life but nonetheless keeps his heart screenplay is brilliant being biopic army guy athlete who turned into dacoit wont b happy fun movie its very sad movie but irfann did manage evoke some light moments by his sheer one liners n acting imagine athlete whos very good running has run away police direction was good n cinematography was good capturing harsh dry rural difficult terrain,0.6074999999999998,0.36916666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.2}"
,A great film by Tigmanshu Dhulia about an issue which needed to be told,"India is probably one of the few countries in the world with various distinct cultures and their own history. In such a nation there were (and are) innumerous people whose life contains all ingredients for a nail-biting tales but sadly biopics are hardly explored in the country. Tigmanshu Dhulia showed guts to pen a script on one of unsung heroes of Indian sports Paan Singh Tomar and end result is a captivating cinema that explores many facets of our system. Paan Singh Tomar is an interesting journey of a loyal soldier and a brilliant athlete (infact a national pride) who transforms into a notorious ""dacoit"" thanks to the 'system"". In a flashback mode the movie deals on the drastic transformation of this loyal army-man into a notorious dacoit (Baaghi as referred by Paan Singh himself). In a linear and simple story PST tells about the plight of an athlete who had brought honours for his own country. Negligence of system is highlighted through his sad tale and the story revolves on framework after independence when seeds of corruption & anti establishment were germinating in full swing. In one sequence Paan Singh tells a journalist that how he was ignored by media when he won medal in steeple chase race in an international army sports meet but now when he was in the other side of the law playing hide-and-seek with the police the journalists are pouring down to get interviews. Another pain stacking sequence shows Paan Singh going to local police to lodge a complaint but he was humiliated by the inspector and even insulted the gold medal which he won for his own country. Tigmanshu dhulia' eye for detailing needs to be acknowledged. While writing the script Dhulia ensured that the audiences identify with the character and gets involved with the proceedings. The crowds were cheering in the initial reels when Paan Singh's potential as an athlete was displayed following which his cry for justice which was put down by the corrupt system. As the film reaches the climax the neglected scenario of athletes indeed touches the emotional chords of the audience. Dhulia's execution makes you think as you leave the theatre. In terms of technicalities Editing and Art department deserves mention. Dhulia's direction is complimented by Irfan Khan who played the role of Paan Singh Tomar with perfection. His nuances, dialogs, expression, body language speaks about a perfect army men. Brownie points should be given to him for his efforts to shape his body at this age and mould himself as the young energetic athlete. His dialogue delivery in the later reels reflected the strive within as he becomes a rebel with a cause. ""Bihad mein baghi hote hai, dacoit toh parliament mein bante hai"" â€“ this dialogue will be remembered in from now on. A performance that deserves full marks and demands awards, this one is easily one of Irfan's career best performances. The supporting casts were appropriate in their roles. Mahie Gill as Tomar's wife gave a good performance again. Vipin Sharma was a treat to watch in role of Major Masand, a senior to Tomar and one who believed in his potential. Brijendra Kala is as usual dependable and brought a comic flavour as a journalist. With the current scenario of the nation movies like Paan Singh Tomar needs to be made and promoted which injects ""thoughts"" inside audience in an entertaining way. It's when the movie ends, and the names of four Indian national champions who died penniless are shown, ""Paan Singh Tomar"" hits the most. Indeed a fitting tribute to unsung heroes of Indian sports. This movie needs to be watched and pondered upon.

8.0,An unadulterated effort = Contemporary Masterpiece = Paan Singh Tomar,"Paan Singh Tomar, national steeplechase champion, nephew of a Dacoit or ""Baaghi"" as Paan prefers to call it, an army soldier wants to be in army sports because they don't have restriction on eating food. The interesting plot builds on it and takes you to a whirlwind journey of his life, which tickles you, inspires you, and ultimately asks you some very uncomfortable questions.Tigmanshu Dhulia paints the canvas with natural but vivid emotions, he has surely pulled it off. All characters have color of their own, but Irrfan, has just delivered a performance which will make him stand in league of extraordinary men. He is convincing as middle aged dacoit, and it is pleasant surprise that he looks as convincing as young army soldier running on track in shorts, which his wife thinks he shouldn't wear as women stare at them.Mahie Gill has restricted territory but like in all her previous films, she has supported the scenes well. All other characters have just beautifully fallen in place. Director has not compromised with authenticity and has retained the language as spoken in the area where movie is set, don't worry English subtitles are there to help you out if you miss some of the dialogs.The romance between husband and wife has been handled with gentleness, with sequences such as the couple sends their children to buy ""lemon-choos"" so that they get some time alone. The movie could have been crispier and shorter n second half when plot moves to Chambal as Paan plans to exact his revenge. Director has sensibly not inserted any songs in the movie as they are not required at all, compliments to the team for this common sense. The background score, especially during races compliments the beautiful cinematography.Overall the movie is a treat to eyes and ears. A must watch !

Though the language is thick Chamabl dialect but Irrfan bridges that gap with a masterful display forcing you to laugh, cry and feel his pain.

10.0,Paan Singh Tomar âˆž The Most Important Movie on Indian Sports âˆž,"Somewhere in the sandy and hilly terrains of the Chambal where a normal human being never wished to visit even in the nightmare there lies a Man - an athlete â€“ a sports person from soul- And a Dacoit now whose winning run for the great nation called India went unnoticed due to crippled ,undemocratic, corrupt political and administration system and forced him to taken his own route for justice- A path which make which more noticed and more popular amongst the country's newspaper, radio and Parliament than winning his gold medals Indian National Games seven times in a row.The Movie opens up with a journalist who wants to interview the most terrible dacoit of the region Paan Singh Tomar and as the interview moves the story went into flashback. Paan Singh Tomar (Irrfan Khan) works in Army but his dietary supplement requirements moved him to the sport division of the army because there is no limit on diet in sports. Thou luckily his race talent got noticed by his senior to whom he delivered the ice cream at his home in just four minutes Unmelt. Soon he become National Champion in ""Indian National Games"" and later in ""International Military Games"" in 1967.But gradually his personal life takes over his Professional life, and the incidents after him changed the course of his life which tuned him from an athlete to a dacoit The movie touches some serious issues of the Indian sports and Indian sports persons. In a scene where Pan Singh participated in Asian Games at Tokyo , the organizer gave him new spike shoes which become the cause of his defeat because the athlete never practiced with those shoes earlier and sponsors want to show that India can afford spike shoes shows the level of training in the country even applicable today .In a second scene where the coach requested Pan singh to withdrew his name from 5000 mts race else coach's kin would have been lost that race shows again that the super sportsman you know may not be the best because the best was never given the chance. In a third scene where a villager was given bribe in terms of recruiting the villager's son in the Indian army again shows that all in the Indian military may not have joined the army to serve the nation but to serve their selfish motives. Fourth and very important the scene where the Paan Singh Tomar went to police station to file a FIR against his relatives who has grabbed his land unlawfully and beaten up his son helpless and was insulted and rejected shows the system's efficiency to tackle an issue which turns a common man into a rebel â€“ A Dacoit Paan Singh Tomar also helps to think deepens into the political arena and government arrangements for the promotion of SPORTS not cricket because cricket is so over-hyped and overpaid that sponsors in the previous past has marketed it as a religion and few players as Demi- GODs that the other sports in India per say are lying on the stretcher waiting for the medicines of hope and support from the sponsors and government.Paan Singh Tomar may not celebrate the spirit of win like 'Chak de India' or ""Jo jeeta wohi sikandar"" But it does celebrates the spirit the True Sportsmanship and it does it perfectly & flawlessly-Kuods",paan singh tomar most important movie indian sports,somewhere sandy hilly terrains chambal where normal human being never wished visit even nightmare there lies man athlete sports person soul dacoit now whose winning run great nation called india went unnoticed due crippled undemocratic corrupt political administration system forced him taken his own route justice path which make which more noticed more popular amongst countrys newspaper radio parliament than winning his gold medals indian national games seven times row movie opens up with journalist who wants interview most terrible dacoit region paan singh tomar as interview moves story went into flashback paan singh tomar irrfan khan works army but his dietary supplement requirements moved him sport division army because there is no limit diet sports thou luckily his race talent got noticed by his senior whom he delivered ice cream at his home just four minutes unmelt soon he become national champion indian national games later international military games 1967 but gradually his personal life takes over his professional life incidents after him changed course his life which tuned him athlete dacoit movie touches some serious issues indian sports indian sports persons scene where pan singh participated asian games at tokyo organizer gave him new spike shoes which become cause his defeat because athlete never practiced with those shoes earlier sponsors want show that india can afford spike shoes shows level training country even applicable today second scene where coach requested pan singh withdrew his name 5000 mts race else coachs kin would have been lost that race shows again that super sportsman you know may not be best because best was never given chance third scene where villager was given bribe terms recruiting villagers son indian army again shows that all indian military may not have joined army serve nation but serve their selfish motives fourth very important scene where paan singh tomar went police station file fir against his relatives who has grabbed his land unlawfully beaten up his son helpless was insulted rejected shows systems efficiency tackle issue which turns common man into rebel dacoit paan singh tomar also helps think deepens into political arena government arrangements promotion sports not cricket because cricket is so over hyped overpaid that sponsors previous past has marketed it as religion few players as demi gods that other sports india per say are lying stretcher waiting medicines hope support sponsors government paan singh tomar may not celebrate spirit win like chak de india or jo jeeta wohi sikandar but it does celebrates spirit true sportsmanship it does it perfectly flawlessly kuods,0.44974210186976143,0.1515538362346873,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.53}"
9.0,Why you should watch Paan Singh Tomar,"Paan Singh Tomar is a fantastic biopic of an Armyman turned Athlete turned dacoit. Apart from great cinematography, which really brought the Bhihad of MP alive, its the dialogues and the ease with which Irrfan Khan carries off the character which really makes the film work.But the single most appreciable fact about the film is that it considers the audience intelligent. The film in a way is an excellent way to understand what is wrong with India, without being preachy.Apart from the most obvious one i.e. How India treats its athletes, the film also sheds light on broader national issues. The scene when the village sarpanch (headman) who betrays Paan Singh is ratting out to the police is a grim reminder of how deeply entrenched the Caste system is in our country & the hypocrisy of the upper castes. Also, the whole film is an excellent critique of how outlaws are often a result of a corrupt and immoral society - nation, which could put into perspective a lot of our views on Naxalites. It's only rare that a film so honest and gritty comes out of Bollywood. For the amount of senseless cinema we produce, Paan Singn Tomar redeems Bollywood.The director Tigmanshu Dhulia goes many notches up with this film, and for me he has joined the ranks of Vishal Bhardwaj, Anurag Kashyap & Dibakar Banerjee for making good cinema",why you should watch paan singh tomar,paan singh tomar is fantastic biopic armyman turned athlete turned dacoit apart great cinematography which really brought bhihad mp alive its dialogues ease with which irrfan khan carries off character which really makes film work but single most appreciable fact about film is that it considers audience intelligent film way is excellent way understand what is wrong with india without being preachy apart most obvious one i e how india treats its athletes film also sheds light broader national issues scene when village sarpanch headman who betrays paan singh is ratting out police is grim reminder how deeply entrenched caste system is our country hypocrisy upper castes also whole film is excellent critique how outlaws are often result corrupt immoral society nation which could put into perspective lot our views naxalites its only rare that film so honest gritty comes out bollywood amount senseless cinema we produce paan singn tomar redeems bollywood director tigmanshu dhulia goes many notches up with this film me he has joined ranks vishal bhardwaj anurag kashyap dibakar banerjee making good cinema,0.6313186813186815,0.22802197802197804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10.0,Paan Singh Tomar: An Indian national athlete who became a rebel,"I shall attempt to write a review about the movie. But I must confess that vocabulary needs to be reinvented for writing a review about such a movie. The word Brilliant, Cult will be an understatement.The story rips apart the callousness of our mediocre society and bares the ugly trust of being a sportsman in India.Paan Singh Tomar was a national record breaking sprinter who became a rebel. He had an illustrious career as a sportsman in the Army but the chores of his village life forced him to retire early to tend to his fields. The serene life of village proved to be more challenging than the task of defending his motherland. His own cousin brother who had now become a local muscle-man with the help of police took over Paan Singh's field without any remorse. Paan Singh tried every possible way to make our legal system attend to his woes but to no avail. Finally he resorted to his own personal strength to bring justice to the wrong doers. The story begins with a writer (Brijendra Kala) going for an interview with the Subedar (Irrfan Khan). Brijendra Kala has acted to perfection; it cannot get better than this! Most of the story is in flashback but it keeps you clutched to your seat. Story telling had never been better than this. Paan Singh aka Subedar, a rank which he got in the Army narrates his illustrious career as an athlete in the Army. However the career of a national sports hero does not translate into a successful place in the society as he struggles to keep his farm safe from his own cousin. Tomar who has been taught that Army men are guardians of the country believes that laws and system would protect his farm & family. His belief is shattered when the cops refuse to acknowledge his complaint even after his son is beaten to a pulp by the hands of his cousin. Later when his cousin attacks Tomar's house and kills his beloved mother Tomar sets on another race only this one will be in real life with guns, goons and cops. A quote from the movie, Paan Singh Tomar says â€“ 'In a race there are rules, rules which state that once you have started the race it doesn't matter if you are ahead of behind or how much time it takes you have to reach the finish line'.A must watch for all the sports lovers.",paan singh tomar indian national athlete who became rebel,i shall attempt write review about movie but i must confess that vocabulary needs be reinvented writing review about such movie word brilliant cult will be understatement story rips apart callousness our mediocre society bares ugly trust being sportsman india paan singh tomar was national record breaking sprinter who became rebel he had illustrious career as sportsman army but chores his village life forced him retire early tend his fields serene life village proved be more challenging than task defending his motherland his own cousin brother who had now become local muscle man with help police took over paan singhs field without any remorse paan singh tried every possible way make our legal system attend his woes but no avail finally he resorted his own personal strength bring justice wrong doers story begins with writer brijendra kala going interview with subedar irrfan khan brijendra kala has acted perfection it cannot get better than this most story is flashback but it keeps you clutched your seat story telling had never been better than this paan singh aka subedar rank which he got army narrates his illustrious career as athlete army however career national sports hero does not translate into successful place society as he struggles keep his farm safe his own cousin tomar who has been taught that army men are guardians country believes that laws system would protect his farm family his belief is shattered when cops refuse acknowledge his complaint even after his son is beaten pulp by hands his cousin later when his cousin attacks tomars house kills his beloved mother tomar sets another race only this one will be real life with guns goons cops quote movie paan singh tomar says race there are rules rules which state that once you have started race it doesnt matter if you are ahead behind or how much time it takes you have reach finish line must watch all sports lovers,0.6383333333333333,0.145,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,National Athlete turns Chamba Valley Dacoit when all govt machinery fails to protect him,"Paan Singh Tomar: Irfan Khan is one the greatest actors that we have in India. N...o Doubt. He takes the script to superlative levels. The dialogues are amusing and situations really funny and not crass. His transformation from a national level athlete to a dacoit in the Chambal Valley makes for a rare story. How many such stories have we heard of. Having gone through what Paan goes through its really easy to understand and empathise with the character Paan especially since he picks up arms when all else fails. He approaches all the govt machinery disposable to him..the army , collector and the no good bribe taking , dishonest, lazy unscrupulous Indian police who instead of protecting the citizens instead loots and harasses them and don't we all know that. One wants to run in the opposite direction when one has to deal with police in India and that's the truth none can deny. Paan knows that the unlawful path will lead to his death but to live under such suppression was just not acceptable to him anymore. In my mind Had it been me, i would have taken that coaching job that being an Olympian offered along with cushy discounts at army canteen and a peaceful retirement life on army pension with family.But in my mind I also want to shoot these stupid police guys who tell me not to take the route to my own home at the Aarey Colony.

7.0,A piece of history,"A stunner.. An Indian Rambo, far far away from the horse-borne dacoits and cheesy dialogs of similar films. Reportedly based on the life and times of an Indian army subedar, the film is a piece of history. That an army man finds civilian life difficult is well known. But this man took up arms because of the failure of the civilian administration to address his problems, as well as the army's failure to intervene, or at least coordinate with the administration, so that an illustrious ex-army man like Paan Singh had to undergo the travails that he did.This film is a lesson on how to make films, which are entertaining, and not over-the-top. It is also a history lesson, for those in power, who see this sort of tragedy occurring in the lives of common people, but do nothing, till trouble comes knocking at their own doors.Hats off to the team of PAAN SINGH TOMAR - the film.

10.0,"Sports person turns outrageous rebel, kicks ass on box office!","Paan Singh Tomaris the angst of an athlete who did the right thing and tried his best to work within the system to get justice for himself and his family. But then he was pushed. Pushed beyond his limits. And then he turned into a revolutionary, what we call a dacoit. The irony, that he got more recognition as a dacoit than a sports person representing his country in international events, never stopped to boggle him. Does it bother us though? Then, why hasn't the situation changed in the last 40- 50 years?Even now, the plight wouldn't have reached us if it were not for Irrfan Khan who plays Paan Singh Tomar. He completely bowls us over with his simplicity and then, frustrated aggression. Moreover, after Paan Singh turns into a dacoit rebel, the pride of a military personnel and a national-level sports person never leaves his eyes. He is very rooted in his cause and yet reminds you where his heart lies, time and again.Mahie Gill provides wonderful support by showing us why she is Paan Singh's vulnerability. And this must be that rare film when a character who plays a prominent part in the first half of the film disappears later and the disappearance seems justified. Paan Singh had to forgo his family life including his wife, after all.Paan Singh Tomar invokes your curiosity by exposing the rebel Paan Singh before telling us about how he was as a sports person. That created just the right amount intrigue because as the flashback progressed you wanted to know how this simple, straightforward person took to becoming a dacoit.Paan Singh's achievements as an athlete is shown in good detail and so is his transformation into a person who had to take the law in his hands. The part where he becomes feared and successful as a dacoit is sorely missing. And that according to me is the film's biggest letdown. The meek and largely submissive Paan Singh suddenly becomes a dreaded outlaw and we are asked to take that as a given.And despite this major gap in the writing, Paan Singh Tomar is commendable and recommended watch because of the issue it tries to address. If there is one thing about sports in our nation that needs dire attention, it is the condition of and apathy towards our non- cricketing sports people.Detailed Ratings (out of 5):Direction: 3.5 Story: 4 Lead Actors: 4 Character Artists: 3 Dialogues: 4 Screenplay: 3",sports person turns outrageous rebel kicks ass box office,paan singh tomaris angst athlete who did right thing tried his best work within system get justice himself his family but then he was pushed pushed beyond his limits then he turned into revolutionary what we call dacoit irony that he got more recognition as dacoit than sports person representing his country international events never stopped boggle him does it bother us though then why hasnt situation changed last 40 50 years even now plight wouldnt have reached us if it were not irrfan khan who plays paan singh tomar he completely bowls us over with his simplicity then frustrated aggression moreover after paan singh turns into dacoit rebel pride military personnel national level sports person never leaves his eyes he is very rooted his cause yet reminds you where his heart lies time again mahie gill provides wonderful support by showing us why she is paan singhs vulnerability this must be that rare film when character who plays prominent part first half film disappears later disappearance seems justified paan singh had forgo his family life including his wife after all paan singh tomar invokes your curiosity by exposing rebel paan singh before telling us about how he was as sports person that created just right amount intrigue because as flashback progressed you wanted know how this simple straightforward person took becoming dacoit paan singhs achievements as athlete is shown good detail so is his transformation into person who had take law his hands part where he becomes feared successful as dacoit is sorely missing that according me is films biggest letdown meek largely submissive paan singh suddenly becomes dreaded outlaw we are asked take that as given despite this major gap writing paan singh tomar is commendable recommended watch because issue it tries address if there is one thing about sports our nation that needs dire attention it is condition apathy towards our non cricketing sports people detailed ratings out 5 direction 3 5 story 4 lead actors 4 character artists 3 dialogues 4 screenplay 3,0.48271756978653535,0.1898809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Ice Cream.,"Since having found the 1974 ""Curry Western"" Dacoit film Khhotte Sikkay to be pretty enjoyable,I became very intrigued,when I read a good amount of praise on the IMDb's Indian movie board about a recently realised movie which took a look at one of India's most successful athlete's:Paan Singh Tomar,who later became one of India's most infamous Dacoit's.The plot:1980:Getting information from his informants which could lead to him getting the biggest story of the year, a newspaper reporter rushes to get a relative of his, (who is also taking care of his young niece) to come along with him to the very outskirts in the city,in the hope of finding one of India's most famous Dacoit's:Paan Singh Tomar.Arriving to the location,the reporter is met by a group of men who claim to be members of Tomar's gang.Due to the group being unsure about how genuine he is,they decide to keep the niece and uncle as a ""safe guarantee"",and tell the reporter that he is the only one who they will allow to meet Tomar.Taking him to their hideaway based at a run down building,the reporter finally gets his chance to come face to face with Paan Singh Tomar.Tomar shows a strong dislike for the reporter,due to him deciding to get straight to the point and making his first question be :""How did you become a Dacoit?""Fearing that he is about to lose the scoop of the year,the reporter does a hasty back track,and instead decides to make his first question: ""When did you pick up a gun for the first time?"".Feeling that the report may actually be here for more than just a ""cheap thrill"",Tomar begins to tell him,how he went from being a 7 time Steeplechase champion surrounded by people whose tradition he deeply respected,to finding himself chewed up and spat out into a world filled with betrayers of any tradition,which lead to him deciding that the only one who could do the right thing and show that corruption did not decay everything around people:was himself.View on the film:For the handful of cars and motorbikes that appear in the film,director Tigmanshu Dhulia shows them right at the very edge of the frame,to give a strong feeling that they are about to drive off to a completely different era miles away from the movie.Despite the very best attempts from my DVD players to stop me from seeing this film, (the first player jammed at the half way point,and ended up constantly bringing up the sign ""No DVD in player"",whilst my spare DVD player would only play the film in black and white!) they were thankfully unable to stop Dhulia's tremendous directing from shining.With Dhulia choosing specific moments in Tomar's athletic career and Dacoit period to use a slow-mo effect to show Paan gaining the respect of his peers in the athletic ranks,to slowing down the moments when fatal shots are fired during a number of terrific,tense gun battles, (with a stand out one being a shoot out that Dhulia beautifully sets in the middle of a river) to show that the applause Tomar use to hear during his moments of glory,have now been replaced with the sound of people taking their final breath.Looking at the fantastic screenplay of the film, (which IMDb has weirdly not credited) Writers Dhulia and Sanjay Chauhan brilliantly take the traditional Wild West ""baddie"" role,and spin it into a new exciting direction.Using Paan Singh Tomar's (played by a great.focused Irrfan Khan) athletics training as a place filled with ""old guard"" traditional soldiers and police officers,who teach Tomar skills about concentrating and being determined,which would also be given to any lonely gunslinger,who finds themselves to be the only brave enough person to protect a town from being taken over.Getting away from the athletics,Dhulia and Chauhan use Tomar's family farmland being taken over by a ruthless gang,as the moment for when Tomar calls for the cavalry to arrive and save the day.Sadly for Tomar, Dhulia and Chauhan expertly show that the era when ""the cavalry"" and other figures who are meant to stand up and protect the ""common man's"" town from being over run with outlaws,and to also wear a badge of authority (such as a sheriffs badge) with honour,instead of seeing it as just a cheap piece of silver.Getting Tomar to see all of the corruptions and tragedy's happening around,the writers slowly show Tomar relies that he is the last person left,who strongly keeps to the tradition of knowing what good and evil is,which leads to him having to make an unimaginable decision of leaving ""the cavalry"" and everything he has valued for his whole life,to become the thing that he has hated most,in the hope of having the chance to do the right thing.",ice cream,since having found 1974 curry western dacoit film khhotte sikkay be pretty

10.0,Feeling proud as well as ashamed after watching this honest well crafted film revealing the bitter truth.,"Beginning with a confession, I really felt both proud as well as ashamed after watching this honest well crafted film revealing the bitter truth of our Indian Social System through its powerful narrative.PROUD, because the film perfectly proves to be a true example of CINEMA made in the right manner for the overall benefit of the society. CINEMA, as per my understanding is a powerful medium of expression which basically needs to serve two main purposes. It has to entertain as well as enlighten its viewers about the various important issues prevailing in the system which need to be addressed urgently. To be precise, how many of us ever knew about this character called PAAN SINGH TOMAR who actually existed in our society a few decades ago? We all love Cricket so much, remembering all its record makers and breakers on our tips. But how many of us ever knew about this seven-time NATIONAL CHAMPION in steeplechase (obstacle) race, a born athlete who later had to pick up arms and became a hard-core WANTED rebel (not Dacoit) of Beeharh? The film enlightens us all about Paan Singh's sad life-story and thus fulfills its duty of being a ""True Cinematic Effort"" made by Tigmanshu, Irfan and the team. It also made me remember another proud product of our Indian Film Industry, BANDIT QUEEN directed by Shekhar Kapoor in 1994, which is till date considered to be a major benchmark in the history of Film-making in India. Interestingly, (as reported) director Tigmashu Dhulia worked with Shekhar in this project only in his early days.Before moving on to the acidic part of this write-up, I would like to say that as a movie, it's a gripping experience which works majorly in its first half with a pinch of comic moments too, added brilliantly in its screenplay. The second half expectedly talks about the transformation part which can also be considered as just another 'Vengeance Saga' by many critiques. Well supported by a spectacular cinematography, sharp editing and an award winning performance by Irfan Khan, it's a worth watching gem striking a difficult balance between the life of a sportsman and a rebel. Though as I felt, the background score could have been better but still it serves the purpose well while watching the film. But here instead of giving you a review, I would like to mention a few dialogues of the film, which should be enough to prove the precious value of this rare gem coming out of Bollywood after a long time.As the film starts off, Paan Singh informs his officer saying, ""Hamaar Mama Beeharh Ke Baaghi Thhey, Dacait NahinÂ…..Aur Bahut Izzat Thi Unki Purey Ziley Mein!""On being addressed as a Daku by the reporter in his interview, Paan Singh comes forward and says, ""'Beeharh Mein Baaghi Hotey HainÂ…..Dacait Milte Hain Parliament Mein'.In the last meeting (after becoming a rebel) with his supportive Military Officer, the Officer leaves Paan Singh saying, ""Ab Main Tumse Kabhi Nahin Milunga Aur Yeh Hamari Aakhri Mulaqaat Hogi""Â…Â…..but to this Paan Singh replies, ""Par Khabrein Milti Rahengi!""And lastly, on hearing the radio, broadcasting the news of Paan Singh Tomar's search by the Police all over, he laughs in anger and says, ""Jab Desh Ke Liye Bhaaga, Tab Kisi Ne Nahin PoochaÂ…Â…Â…, Ab Beeharh Mein Bhaag Rahey Hain To Saaley Sab Naam Jap Rahey Hain!""So, if the above few dialogues cannot convince you to watch PAAN SINGH TOMAR as soon as possible then I seriously don't know what else can.Now coming to the harsh part of this write-up, I felt ashamed after watching this flick due to more than one reason related to both Bollywood as well as the political social system we are living in.Taking up Bollywood first, it was really a shame that this well-made film was lying in cans, waiting to get released for more than one year for some undisclosed reasons. The word CINEMA is complete only if we keep on making films on diversified subjects related with its various genres. Otherwise it will be just like eating the same dish in dinner every day leading to boredom. So if films like PAAN SINGH TOMAR will continue finding difficulties in getting released then Who will like to make them in the near future?The next was the bigger shock which came in the end when they showed a whole list of names on the black screen, who were NATIONAL Champions in OLYMPICS and other games but had died eventually either due to lack of medical treatment or being penniless. Reading the list scrolling on the screen I asked to myself, ""Are these talented people, the NATIONAL TREASURES of the country only till the day they can perform on the field?Don't they remain the same NATIONAL TREASURES once they get retired? And Isn't this a NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY of the Nation's Government to take care of all these gifted personalities after their retirement, till their last breath and give them a honorable farewell in the end?"".The same principle applies to every art form including the Film Industry, where we have recently seen veterans like A. K. Hangal in a sorry state asking for monetary help on the national news channels. So this is not a review of the film PAAN SINGH TOMAR but a humble tribute from my side along with Tigmanshu and Irfan Khan, for such blessed souls who were sadly not treated well by our own society. Paan Singh may have opted for a wrong or debatable path in order to fight for this own rights. But had the Government been there to take care of him in those difficult days, considering him as A NATIONAL TREASURE, we could have got a great COACH instead of a REBEL running in the Beeharh.",feeling proud as well as ashamed after watching this honest well crafted film revealing bitter truth,beginning with confession i really felt both proud as well as ashamed after watching this

thi unki purey ziley mein being addressed as daku by reporter his interview paan singh comes forward says beeharh mein baaghi hotey hain dacait milte hain parliament mein last meeting after becoming rebel with his supportive military officer officer leaves paan singh saying ab main tumse kabhi nahin milunga aur yeh hamari aakhri mulaqaat hogi but this paan singh replies par khabrein milti rahengi lastly hearing radio broadcasting news paan singh tomars search by police all over he laughs anger says jab desh ke liye bhaaga tab kisi ne nahin poocha ab beeharh mein bhaag rahey hain saaley sab naam jap rahey hain so if above few dialogues cannot convince you watch paan singh tomar as soon as possible then i seriously dont know what else can now coming harsh part this write up i felt ashamed after watching this flick due more than one reason related both bollywood as well as political social system we are living taking up bollywood first it was really shame that this well made film was lying cans waiting get released more than one year some undisclosed reasons word cinema is complete only if we keep making films diversified subjects related with its various genres otherwise it will be just like eating same dish dinner every day leading boredom so if films like paan singh tomar will continue finding difficulties getting released then who will like make them near future next was bigger shock which came end when they showed whole list names black screen who were national champions olympics other games but had died eventually either due lack medical treatment or being penniless reading list scrolling screen i asked myself are these talented people national treasures country only till day they can perform field dont they remain same national treasures once they get retired isnt this national responsibility nations government take care all these gifted personalities after their retirement till their last breath give them honorable farewell end same principle applies every art form including film industry where we have recently seen veterans like k hangal sorry state asking monetary help national news channels so this is not review film paan singh tomar but humble tribute my side along with tigmanshu irfan khan such blessed souls who were sadly not treated well by our own society paan singh may have opted wrong or debatable path order fight this own rights but had government been there take care him those difficult days considering him as national treasure we could have got great coach instead rebel running

9.0,Highly recommended !!!,"Paan Singh Tomar, based on a true story of an athlete-turned-rebel , was an encouraging , sit-up and make-you-think movie which ends on a sad note. An athlete(Irrfan Khan) joins the army to serve for the country but is encouraged to participate in distance running in international competition because of his great stamina, high energy and good running speed. Soon he brings laurels for his country after winning several gold medals and appreciation. But his success is short lived when he enters into fight with his relatives in his village over a land feud. Though , he wins the fight in village panchayat , he and his family are threatened for life. He goes back to army and even approaches police for help but his efforts goes in vain. Unfortunately , he had no options but to pick guns to protect his family which turns him into a dreaded dacoit. Paan Singh Tomar is directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia (Haasil , Sahib Bibi and Gangster). It takes a great effort to make a film of this stature. The director has not only handled the hard-hitting true story of a rebel but he has also portrayed the forgotten sportsman in an outstanding way. The screenplay is executed superbly along with some fantastic dialogues. Cinematography was eye-catching which captured the rough terrain of Chambal valley. There were couple of scenes which stands out particularly the sequence at the police station where Irrfan blast the cop for not following his duty diligently. On the flip side , I thought the race sequence could have been made more thrilling. But the brilliant performance by supremely talented actor compensates for it. Irrfan Khan plays the role of Paan Singh Tomar to T. He is just perfect fit for this role where he had to emotes the character of a sportsman and brilliantly turning into a rebel. He has done it all. Vipin Sharma was effective , Mahie Gill was good. So ,overall , a brilliant movie in all aspects. Watch out for the superlative performance of Irrfan Khan and splendid direction. But most importantly , the movie gives out a message to us â€“ Have the government done justice to the Indian Sportsmen who have brought laurels and medals for our country ? Watch this flick Â… highly recommended : 4/5",highly recommended,paan singh tomar based true story athlete turned rebel was encouraging sit up make you think movie which ends sad note athlete irrfan khan joins army serve country but is encouraged participate distance running international competition because his great stamina high energy good running speed soon he brings laurels his country after winning several gold medals appreciation but his success is short lived when he enters into fight with his relatives his village over land feud though he wins fight village panchayat he his family are threatened life he goes back army even approaches police help but his efforts goes vain unfortunately he had no options but pick guns protect his family which turns him into dreaded dacoit paan singh tomar is directed by tigmanshu dhulia haasil sahib bibi gangster it takes great effort make film this stature director has not only handled hard hitting true story rebel but he has also portrayed forgotten sportsman outstanding way screenplay is executed superbly along with some fantastic dialogues cinematography was eye catching which captured rough terrain chambal valley there were couple scenes which stands out particularly sequence at police station where irrfan blast cop not following his duty diligently flip side i thought race sequence could have been made more thrilling but brilliant performance by supremely talented actor compensates it irrfan khan plays role paan singh tomar t he is just perfect fit this role where he had emotes character sportsman brilliantly turning into rebel he has done it all vipin sharma was effective mahie gill was good so overall brilliant movie all aspects watch out superlative performance irrfan khan splendid direction but most importantly movie gives out message us have government done justice indian sportsmen who have brought laurels medals our country watch this flick highly recommended 4 5,0.6255,0.3609583333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.24}"
7.0,Sends a message of respecting national pride.,"Paan Singh Tomar is a movie about poor man from a remote village of India. He achieves the honor of breaking various records in racing. After getting retired, there is a dispute that sets against his family. Even a national asset is not supported by officials, this in turn makes him a dacoit. The story goes further, he and his associates kill several people for wealth, helping poor. Gradually he dies at the hands of police and story ends.A movie is now made for suffering national assets, an extra mark for that. Even the Olympic champions sometimes do not gain the deserving respect from officials (in the form of making a living at ease). Government must arrange for certain ways that this doesn't happen at least to people who are nation's pride. I personally did not like Irrfan's acting, a negative mark for that. Somebody who's more flexible physically, would have been well suited for the role. A movie worth a watch, because of the message it sends.Rating: 8.0/10",sends message respecting national pride,paan singh tomar is movie about poor man remote village india he achieves honor breaking various records racing after getting retired there is dispute that sets against his family even national asset is not supported by officials this turn makes him dacoit story goes further he his associates kill several people wealth helping poor gradually he dies at hands police story ends movie is now made suffering national assets extra mark that even olympic champions sometimes do not gain deserving respect officials form making living at ease government must arrange certain ways that this doesnt happen at least people who are nations pride i personally did not like irrfans acting negative mark that somebody whos more flexible physically would have been well suited role movie worth watch because message it sends rating 8 0 10,0.35714285714285715,0.007142857142857142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,"Made as a competently good biopic, the acting is well top notch is worth a watch just for Irfan Khan.","Made as a competently good biopic, the acting is well top notch. It is worth a watch just for Irfan Khan.I have not heard of this man, till I knew of this movie, its good to know of such sportsman and sad to know the tragedy. The fate of the country is such that a national champion is forgotten but a dacoit is made news easily. This is an ironic story and is told really very well. Dialogues are written extremely well. The dialect is just great, It brings out rawness to character and a flavor of its own to the whole script. The cinematography is done well, and the director sure has an eye for detail the way he has shown a few things, like a steeplechase race, dacoit's backdrop and the feuds in villages. Mind you this is a biopic and has to be handled in way to tell a real life character, there is no much added drama, at few places, it might have fallen bland too of course life is not so very interesting all times either. But all are pu together effectively to bring out a story that has a heart. We may not be in favor of Paan Singh by the end for what he has done, but fir sure he shall live on in the minds long after the movie is over.Watch it for Dialect/Dialogues and yes for Irfan Khan who may be sweeping many best actor awards for reprising this role and living it in a way thats so tough to do in terms of controlling emotions and thus exhibiting them at rare times.Liked it and I recommend such biopics be watched to know India and its diversity in a better way too. My rating is 4/5 for a movie that has been dared to be made and executed really well.",made as competently good biopic acting is well top notch is worth watch just irfan khan,made as competently good biopic acting is well top notch it is worth watch just irfan khan i have not heard this man till i knew this movie its good know such sportsman sad know tragedy fate country is such that national champion is forgotten but dacoit is made news easily this is ironic story is told really very well dialogues are written extremely well dialect is just great it brings out rawness character flavor its own whole script cinematography is done well director sure has eye detail way he has shown few things like steeplechase race dacoits backdrop feuds villages mind you this is biopic has be handled way tell real life character there is no much added drama at few places it might have fallen bland too course life is not so very interesting all times either but all are pu together effectively bring out story that has heart we may not be favor paan singh by end what he has done but fir sure he shall live minds long after movie is over watch it dialect dialogues yes irfan khan who may be sweeping many best actor awards reprising this role living it way thats so tough do terms controlling emotions thus exhibiting them at rare times liked it i recommend such biopics be watched know india its diversity better way too my rating is 4 5 movie that has been dared be made executed really well,0.5362573099415205,0.2655037214247741,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
