10.0,Make sure you get the director's cut!,"Many people compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with ""The Godfather"". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",make sure you get directors cut,many people compare once upon time america with godfather my opinion these two movies cant be compared both are masterpieces their own way but each them has different style you dont compare picasso michelangelos sixteen chapel either do you what is it that makes this movie masterpiece well first all there is director sergio leone is real master when it comes creating special atmosphere full mystery surprises drama hes one few directors who understands art cutting movie such way that you stay focused until end way movie was cut is also reason why lot americans dont think this movie is very special there are three versions but only european version is how director imagined it be he didnt want his movie be shown chronological order 1910s 1930s 1960s but wanted mix these three periods time studio cut movie chronological order loosing lot its originality therefor getting lot bad critics if you want see this film way sergio leone saw it you have make sure you get directors cut second reason why this movie is so great is music ennio morricone who is seen as greatest writer film music ever did excellent job together with images music speaks itself this movie time time there isnt said word but music images their own tell story he understood perfectly what sergio leone wanted composed most music even before movie was shot last but not least there is also acting script actors all did excellent job but what else can you expect actors like robert de niro joe pesci they helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort it script helped them with it it took twelve years complete but it hasnt left any detail untouched writers really thought everything when creating it i can really recommend this movie everyone but especially people who like gangster genre when you want see movie you better be sure that you will have time it this isnt movie that is finished after 90 minutes youll have be able stay focused during 3 hours 47 minutes which will certainly not be easy during first 20 30 minutes some scenes at beginning only make sense when you have seen end movie but when you are able stay focused youll find this one best movies youve ever seen i certainly did i rewarded it with well deserved 10 10,0.5507936507936507,0.3070899470899471,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.1}"
10.0,"Last, butchered, unappreciated, work from one of the greatest...","... Directors of all time. Let's start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an ""Italian Western,"" that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being ""re-imagined"" by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he'd just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits. By this point the critics began to acknowledge not only Clint, but also the man behind the camera, Leone, who was one of the most promising directors of the era. HE DID THINGS WITH THE CAMERA THAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, especially his use of closeups, especially his ability to match powerful emotional orchestrals to key scenes. The fourth film in the series, done by Leone but by this time lacking Eastwood, was ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. (Eastwood meanwhile had returned to America as a major celebrity, formed his own production company, Malpaso, and over time became a director as well as the #1 box office star. Over the course of his career, Eastwood subtly voiced his distaste for Leone's work by scrupulously avoiding all Leone's trademark camera angles, even in his westerns!) Back to Leone. While he lent his name to a handful of oddball productions, the last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film. OMG. What a film. Showcasing not only Leone's talent behind the camera, but also his musical magic as well as his ability to tell a complex tale like no one before him. It was by and large produced in obscure locations in NA, and the performances of the players, especially James Woods, and also de Niro, could possibly rank even today as the best they have ever given. (Also a performance from a young and charismatic Jennifer Connolly that by itself is worth the price of the ticket) The film is magical. But here is the catch. Very few people have ever seen it. Even people who ""think"" they have seen it, really have not. The studio behind the film went berserk when they saw the length and, fearful of losing dollars when they could be changing reels and selling more tickets, they brought in a butcher to shorten it. Now maybe the new editor was not a butcher by trade, but he was sure one by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director's version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see.",last butchered unappreciated work one greatest,directors all time lets start with story many years ago when your grandfather was still boy failed beaten down actor named clint eastwood packed up his horse saddle speaking metaphorically here left hollywood forever or so he thought headed out europe pick up cash wherever he could he ended up doing film italy almost unknown director named sergio leone almost unknown sound guy named ennio morricone film was as history would later record italian western that is as iconic western drama was all but disappearing us it was being re imagined by italian writers directors then filmed italy using mainly italian actors set eastwood spoke english everyone else spoke italian dubbing later fixed all that filming now over eastwood took his cash left weeks later bar another part europe he overheard mention that certain film was leading box office attraction continent name sounded familiar but frankly during production final name film hed just done had not even been selected he investigated yes this was film he had just completed now titled fistful dollars rest is history sort two sequels were done with eastwood playing same character monster hits by this point critics began acknowledge not only clint but also man behind camera leone who was one most promising directors era he did things with camera that no one has done before or since especially his use closeups especially his ability match powerful emotional orchestrals key scenes fourth film series done by leone but by this time lacking eastwood was once upon time west eastwood meanwhile had returned america as major celebrity formed his own production company malpaso over time became director as well as box office star over course his career eastwood subtly voiced his distaste leones work by scrupulously avoiding all leones trademark camera angles even his westerns back leone while he lent his name handful oddball productions last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film omg what film showcasing not only leones talent behind camera but also his musical magic as well as his ability tell complex tale like no one before him it was by large produced obscure locations na performances players especially james woods also de niro could possibly rank even today as best they have ever given also performance young charismatic jennifer connolly that by itself is worth price ticket film is magical but here is catch very few people have ever seen it even people who think they have seen it really have not studio behind film went berserk when they saw length fearful losing dollars when they could be changing reels selling more tickets they brought butcher shorten it now maybe new editor was not butcher by trade but he was sure one by disposition late roger ebert said that his career this was most abusive re edit he had ever seen actual film one that leone left was not seen until years later when directors version surfaced it is astounding it is magical it is one best films ever made it is must see,0.45781721322817204,0.08771981063076956,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.01, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,A wonderful epic that is really only about one man's regret - excellent,"Noodles returns to the New York of his youth in response to an invitation to come and meet. His return is his first for half his life having fled New York to avoid being killed for ratting out his gangster friends. His return is mysterious and he doesn't know why he has been summoned. His return sparks memories of his childhood and adulthood growing up in the area with his friends and eventual business partners.A three and a half hour movie may not be everyone's idea of fun. On the other hand, many people who see a running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is an epic that must be `the greatest film ever made'. In this case the time is worth the effort, even if it a little luxurious and overlong. The plot is too sweeping to go into detail, encompassing 30 years in the main part and a further 30 by way of suggestion. Basically it comes down to Noodles memories of his life when he was growing up, up till the point we find him now, as an old man with little but those memories. As a story this is moving and involving. There are maybe too many lingering shots of Noodles staring into the distance but these don't feel as lazy as they have in other films.Noodles past and the misery of him now is involving enough, but the main thread is Noodle's past, both childhood and adulthood in crime and love. The sheer detail that must be covered is well done. The film not only includes many major events but also minor things like the scene where the boy is tempted to eat a cream cake! This mix is very rewarding and makes it feel a lot more detailed than it actually is. The story is a real feel of several generations of crime and is very involving.The cast make the film and hold the attention during the scenes that are longer than they should be etc. De Niro convinces as youth and bitter old man and holds the eye easily as both. Woods is much better than usual even if his character is the same. McGovern is good considering she has a minor role, but as an `old woman' she looks the same as she was when she was young. Actors like Williams, Aiello, Forsythe, Hayden etc easily fill out the gangster etc roles without falling into cliché or caricature. Just as rewarding are the child actors who carry the first hour of the film. Not only do they actually look like the actors in question, but they also do a very good job. There are some bum notes but they do mange the innocence of youth with the emotional basis for the rest of the film.The direction is excellent  both gritty streets but with an affectionate slant of Noodles' memories. The direction is made almost perfect by the use of Ennio Morricone's score. It is at once haunting but slightly warming and `Debra's theme' has become one of my favourite tunes. The overall effect is one of a rich tapestry that eventually weaves into a very personal epic of regret and loss.An excellent film that deserves to be recognised as both one of the great crime epics but also a personal and moving film.",wonderful epic that is really only about one mans regret excellent,noodles returns new york his youth response invitation come meet his return is his first half his life having fled new york avoid being killed ratting out his gangster friends his return is mysterious he doesnt know why he has been summoned his return sparks memories his childhood adulthood growing up area with his friends eventual business partners three half hour movie may not be everyones idea fun other hand many people who see running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is epic that must be greatest film ever made this case time is worth effort even if it little luxurious overlong plot is too sweeping go into detail encompassing 30 years main part further 30 by way suggestion basically it comes down noodles memories his life when he was growing up up till point we find him now as old man with little but those memories as story this is moving involving there are maybe too many lingering shots noodles staring into distance but these dont feel as lazy as they have other films noodles past misery him now is involving enough but main thread is noodles past both childhood adulthood crime love sheer detail that must be covered is well done film not only includes many major events but also minor things like scene where boy is tempted eat cream cake this mix is very rewarding makes it feel lot more detailed than it actually is story is real feel several generations crime is very involving cast make film hold attention during scenes that are longer than they should be etc de niro convinces as youth bitter old man holds eye easily as both woods is much better than usual even if his character is same mcgovern is good considering she has minor role but as old woman she looks same as she was when she was young actors like williams aiello forsythe hayden etc easily fill out gangster etc roles without falling into clich or caricature just as rewarding are child actors who carry first hour film not only do they actually look like actors question but they also do very good job there are some bum notes but they do mange innocence youth with emotional basis rest film direction is excellent both gritty streets but with affectionate slant noodles memories direction is made almost perfect by use ennio morricones score it is at once haunting but slightly warming debras theme has become one my favourite tunes overall effect is one rich tapestry that eventually weaves into very personal epic regret loss excellent film that deserves be recognised as both one great crime epics but also personal moving film,0.49608305274971937,0.19985655162738503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"A sprawling, deliberately paced, and generally a superbly crafted piece of work","It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good. It's a story of life-long friends, in the tradition of the Godfather movies with obvious differences, and the story cuts back and forth to Noodles (De Niro) in his old age returning from exile, looking back on his childhood in Brooklyn, his rise to power with his partners, and the twists come quite unexpectedly. The pace is slow, but not detrimental, and it gives the viewer time to let the emotions sink in. The story is also non-linear, and yet doesn't give away facts to the viewer- this is something that more than likely influenced Tarantino (and many others) in style. By the end, every detail that has mounted up makes the whole experience rather fulfilling, if not perfect. Finally, I'd like to point out the exceptional musical score. Ennio Morricone, as it says on this site, has scored over four hundred films in forty years, including Leone's movies. This would have to be, arguably, one of his ten best works- his score is equally lively, saddened, intense, and perhaps majestic for a gangster epic. Overall, it's filled with the same spirit Leone had in directing the picture, and it corresponds beautifully- there are some scenes in this film that would simply not work without the strings.

10.0,"On par with ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas""...","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a film set free of time; it spans many different years and, like ""Citizen Kane,"" never tells the audience where it is. As many times as I watch it, I can never guess what is going to happen next.And watching ""Once Upon a Time in America"" on the new extended DVD is like revisiting an old friend, finally seeing a masterpiece in its entirety. Many people complained of the choppiness in the three-hour-version of the film originally released in 1984 - and the new four hour version puts all the pieces together and is truly marvelous to behold.This is the dirty, gritty version of ""The Godfather."" It has an incredible amount of violence, especially for a film made almost twenty years ago. I'm not sure how much violence, sexual content and so on was in the original cut, but this extended version is pretty close to an NC-17 rating.The film stars Robert De Niro in one of his most memorable yet forgotten roles. He plays Noodles, a gangster operating sometime during the 1930s. Noodles grew up during the early 1900s, and on the streets he and four other kids started their own crime operation. After a local crime lord named Bugsy gets jealous and murders the youngest member of Noodles' operation, Noodles returns the favor and kills Bugsy. Apprehended by police, Noodles is sent to jail for years.Sometime, years later, Noodles is released into the free world. He isn't a changed man, either. His old crime buddy Max (James Woods) picks him up and introduces him to the old gang members. Soon they are back in business, working for Frankie (Joe Pesci). This is the truest definition of an epic. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is one of the most forgotten gangster films, and yet it is ironically one of the best. It took director Sergio Leone almost ten years to get this motion picture to the screen. Sergio's original script treatment - the outline for the story - was 200 pages long. Just the outline. Soon he employed numerous writers to redo the script, and they bounced it up to 400 pages. There is a saying that for every page in a film script, there is one minute of screen-time. You do the math. After the long scriptwriting process, they then had to get permission to film the movie, from the author of the novel this film is based upon. Then, after that struggle, there came the film itself. How to turn such a bold narrative into a compelling film? What techniques should be used? Where to start?The beginning of the film opens up during the 1930s or sometime around then, fast-forwards to the 1960s, then flashbacks to the early 1900s. It skips around a lot. This makes the viewer active, trying to figure out where and when they are. It is an element that gives a film rewatchability. Roger Ebert pointed out that ""Citizen Kane"" is set free of chronology, and the same goes for ""Once Upon a Time in America."" Sergio Leone is the master of extreme close-ups and wide frame shots, seen in ""Fistful of Dollars"" and here with wide shots of busy streets. In one scene a young girl (pre-stardom Jennifer Connelly) walks along a street, and Leone pulls the camera up, up, up and back, back, back, revealing the entire street. Soon she is lost in the crowd. The same thing is done with De Niro's character as a child, and we lose image of him in the crowd, but then Sergio uses an almost invisible dissolve and we come back upon him.The acting by De Niro is superb. His character, Noodles, is probably the character in this film who is most in-touch with his feelings. We often feel for him, but numerous times in the film he does things disturbing and sickening and we are repulsed. One scene extended in the DVD is the controversial rape scene between De Niro and Elizabeth McGovern. After it is all over, Noodles climbs out of the back seat of the car and walks to the side of the road, standing there, looking into the distance. Many people say this is guilt because he knows what he has done and is ashamed. I don't think so. During the film he rapes numerous women and doesn't seem to mind at all. I think the point Leone was trying to make is that De Niro's character has no idea how to treat or respect women. His entire life he grew up around women who were treated as objects (such as the young prostitute who lived in his apartment complex). So when Noodles stands by the side of the road, this is not from the guilt of what he has done - it is from the guilt of not knowing how to treat a woman, not knowing what to say, not knowing what to do. Not knowing how to respect her. His entire life he was taught that women were just there for pleasure, but when he stands by the road this is a sign that Noodles is starting to think this may all be wrong. It is the guilt of naivety, not self-awareness.""Once Upon a Time"" is the master of gangster flicks. Two other tremendous gangster flicks, ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas,"" have gotten the respect they rightfully deserve over the years - but ""Once Upon a Time in America"" has been seemingly ignored - up until know. I hope that this DVD sparks a newfound interest in the film, because no one should go a lifetime without seeing this moving motion picture.",par with godfather goodfellas,once upon time america is film set free time it spans many different years like citizen kane never tells audience where it is as many times as i watch it i can never guess what is going happen next watching once upon time america new extended dvd is like revisiting old friend finally seeing masterpiece its entirety many people complained choppiness three hour version film originally released 1984 new four hour version puts all pieces together is truly marvelous behold this is dirty gritty version godfather it has incredible amount violence especially film made almost twenty years ago im not sure how much violence sexual content so was original cut but this extended version is pretty close nc 17 rating film stars robert de niro one his most memorable yet forgotten roles he plays noodles gangster operating sometime during 1930s noodles grew up during early 1900s streets he four other kids started their own crime operation after local crime lord named bugsy gets jealous murders youngest member noodles operation noodles returns favor kills bugsy apprehended by police noodles is sent jail years sometime years later noodles is released into free world he isnt changed man either his old crime buddy max james woods picks him up introduces him old gang members soon they are back business working frankie joe pesci this is truest definition epic once upon time america is one most forgotten gangster films yet it is ironically one best it took director sergio leone almost ten years get this motion picture screen sergios original script treatment outline story was 200 pages long just outline soon he employed numerous writers redo script they bounced it up 400 pages there is saying that every page film script there is one minute screen time you do math after long scriptwriting process they then had get permission film movie author novel this film is based upon then after that struggle there came film itself how turn such bold narrative into compelling film what techniques should be used where start beginning film opens up during 1930s or sometime around then fast forwards 1960s then flashbacks early 1900s it skips around lot this makes viewer active trying figure out where when they are it is element that gives film rewatchability roger ebert pointed out that citizen kane is set free chronology same goes once upon time america sergio leone is master extreme close ups wide frame shots seen fistful dollars here with wide shots busy streets one scene young girl pre stardom jennifer connelly walks along street leone pulls camera up up up back back back revealing entire street soon she is lost crowd same thing is done with de niros character as child we lose image him crowd but then sergio uses almost invisible dissolve we come back upon him acting by de niro is superb his character noodles is probably character this film who is most touch with his feelings we often feel him but numerous times film he does things disturbing sickening we are repulsed one scene extended dvd is controversial rape scene between de niro elizabeth mcgovern after it is all over noodles climbs out back seat car walks side road standing there looking into distance many people say this is guilt because he knows what he has done is ashamed i dont think so during film he rapes numerous women doesnt seem mind at all i think point leone was trying make is that de niros character has no idea how treat or respect women his entire life he grew up around women who were treated as objects such as young prostitute who lived his apartment complex so when noodles stands by side road this is not guilt what he has done it is guilt not knowing how treat woman not knowing what say not knowing what do not knowing how respect her his entire life he was taught that women were just there pleasure but when he stands by road this is sign that noodles is starting think this may all be wrong it is guilt naivety not self awareness once upon time is master gangster flicks two other tremendous gangster flicks godfather goodfellas have gotten respect they rightfully deserve over years but once upon time america has been seemingly ignored up until know i hope that this dvd sparks newfound interest film because no one should go lifetime without seeing this moving motion picture,0.49778724747474745,0.13007575757575757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,"Leone's ""Godfather"" Version, And About As Good","This Godfather-type film was done by Sergio Leone, of spaghetti-western fame, so you know you will see and experience several of his trademarks. Namely: (1) a lot of facial closeups; (2) some slow-motion or slow-moving dramatic scenes; (3) good overall photography and (4) a unique soundtrack.The period sets here are magnificent. You get a real feel of the time, whether it's 1910, 1933 or 1967. The colors are awash in blacks, browns and grays and the DVD brings all these out very well, especially considering the film is over 20 years old.Despite some of Leone's slow moments, this is a fascinating film to watch for the story, too. There are numerous memorable scenes, some of them involving some downright shocking violence, even for today's movies. However, the amount of violence is less than what you see today.The movie also sports an interesting twist near the end involving the two major characters, played by Robert De Niro and James Woods. The story is not always clear, either, so be prepared to be possibly confused about a few things....at least on the first viewing. Confused or not, this film always is fascinating to view, especially with intense actors such as the two men just mentioned, along with Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Joe Pecsi, Burt Young, Treat Williams and more.The child actors in here take up almost half the movie and are excellent. What an injustice they don't receive any publicity for their acting, especially the kids who played De Niro and Woods as youngsters. One of the girls has become a famous adult actress: Jennifer Connelly. She was 12 years old in this film and was already alluring.This is Godfather-type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film, not taking a back seat to it at all.",leones godfather version about as good,this godfather type film was done by sergio leone spaghetti western fame so you know you will see experience several his trademarks namely 1 lot facial closeups 2 some slow motion or slow moving dramatic scenes 3 good overall photography 4 unique soundtrack period sets here are magnificent you get real feel time whether its 1910 1933 or 1967 colors are awash blacks browns grays dvd brings all these out very well especially considering film is over 20 years old despite some leones slow moments this is fascinating film watch story too there are numerous memorable scenes some them involving some downright shocking violence even todays movies however amount violence is less than what you see today movie also sports interesting twist near end involving two major characters played by robert de niro james woods story is not always clear either so be prepared be possibly confused about few things at least first viewing confused or not this film always is fascinating view especially with intense actors such as two men just mentioned along with elizabeth mcgovern tuesday weld joe pecsi burt young treat williams more child actors here take up almost half movie are excellent what injustice they dont receive any publicity their acting especially kids who played de niro woods as youngsters one girls has become famous adult actress jennifer connelly she was 12 years old this film was already alluring this is godfather type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film not taking back seat it at all,0.5149068322981366,0.11970755693581778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,The Very Definition of a Tortured Masterpiece.,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is probably the most difficult film I have ever encountered in terms of completing an overall accurate cinematic criticism. This movie just grows in myth and debate as the years come and go. Co-writer/director Sergio Leone (who became an international success with ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in the late-1960s) could not really figure out what to do with the complicated novel ""Hoods"" when adapted to the silver screen. He struggled through with writes, re-writes and several versions of this production. Every version seemingly has more questions than the one before. There are six screenwriters credited. In the end the final product (the very long running 229-minute version) is one of those films that cannot really be talked about. If you try to talk about this production with someone unfamiliar with it, you will leave them dumb-founded and completely confused. Elements of time, situations, heart of the story and characterization get mixed up into a long and winding road of a movie that is extremely deep and definitely complicated. An elderly Jewish man in the 1960s (Robert DeNiro with heavy makeup) comes back to his old New York neighborhood and goes on a quiet and sad journey of remembrance and personal loss. Flashbacks to the early-1920s start quickly as we see a young group of Jewish adolescents in New York (Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, Adrian Curran and Brian Bloom among them) run around town and take advantage of hard-core criminal syndicates and dim-witted beat police officers. The group is wise beyond their years. They have street-smarts that put them into a high class of law-breakers. Early problems develop and brutal multiple murders take place by Tiler. He is sent to prison for the better part of the 1920s and returns in the 1930s in the form of Robert DeNiro. The other youngsters have grown up to become James Woods (in his first legitimate screen role), William Forsythe and James Hayden. DeNiro's reunion comes and goes like a lightning strike and the group gets back to old crime basics. By this time Prohibition is a way of life for the gangsters of major U.S. metropolitan areas and the quartet takes full advantage of that opportunity to run wild around the city and create immense profits for themselves. Killing men in their way and even at times raping women in their path becomes a norm as the production advances. Other characters leave almost as fast as they appear. Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams and Danny Aiello make such short runs that if you are not paying attention closely you might miss them. The women make more pronounced impressions. Youngster Jennifer Connelly grows to become Elizabeth McGovern (DeNiro's childhood love who has aspirations of acting and singing professionally) and Woods finds companionship with the ultra-erotic and smart-mouthed Tuesday Weld (doing her best work by a mile). As the movie continues, DeNiro and Weld develop a bond of hate that turns into mutual respect and eventually they even become the oddest of friends. Woods and DeNiro have a mutual unspoken brotherly love that translates into one of the most important relationships in the history of the movies (DeNiro and Al Pacino would later share a similar bond in the vastly under-rated ""Heat"" some 11 years later). As all this happens though we begin to wonder if all we are seeing is the true reality. A dream-like beginning (which supposedly shows the fates of the four criminals) does not always fit with an amazingly strange final 30 minutes that seems to defy convention, time constraints for the characters and major cinematic screen-writing principles. Symbolism that has always been prevalent in the Italian cinema also comes into play here and these symbols may indeed hold the true answers to the mysteries within. And then again, maybe not. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" was Sergio Leone's final film and it grows in myth and legend due to that fact. Much like similar movies like ""Giant"" (James Dean's final performance) and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (Stanley Kubrick's hypnotic final production), this movie just seems to go into a higher stratosphere of Hollywood that totally ignores the typical norms that are always in association with other big-name movie products. James Hayden even died of an apparent drug overdose shortly after this film was initially released while performing on Broadway. And thus the legends grow and multiply. Overall in the end I do believe that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is arguably the finest movie of the 1980s. It is definitely a unique production that stands near the paramount of a decade that was mired in stupid comedies, teen flicks and endless horror movie installments. DeNiro is truly a revelation once again here and he dominates most in a production of seemingly endless wonderful performances. The movie is one of those that should be studied and analyzed over and over by those who really want to get to the root of cinematic history and development. Much like its running time, the excellence of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is nearly immeasurable. 5 stars out of 5.",very definition tortured masterpiece,once upon time america is probably most difficult film i have ever encountered terms completing overall accurate cinematic criticism this movie just grows myth debate as years come go co writer director sergio leone who became international success with fistful dollars few dollars more good bad ugly late 1960s could not really figure out what do with complicated novel hoods when adapted silver screen he struggled through with writes re writes several versions this production every version seemingly has more questions than one before there are six screenwriters credited end final product very long running 229 minute version is one those films that cannot really be talked about if you try talk about this production with someone unfamiliar with it you will leave them dumb founded completely confused elements time situations heart story characterization get mixed up into long winding road movie that is extremely deep definitely complicated elderly jewish man 1960s robert deniro with heavy makeup comes back his old new york neighborhood goes quiet sad journey remembrance personal loss flashbacks early 1920s start quickly as we see young group jewish adolescents new york scott tiler rusty jacobs adrian curran brian bloom among them run around town take advantage hard core criminal syndicates dim witted beat police officers group is wise beyond their years they have street smarts that put them into high class law breakers early problems develop brutal multiple murders take place by tiler he is sent prison better part 1920s returns 1930s form robert deniro other youngsters have grown up become james woods his first legitimate screen role william forsythe james hayden deniros reunion comes goes like lightning strike group gets back old crime basics by this time prohibition is way life gangsters major u s metropolitan areas quartet takes full advantage that opportunity run wild around city create immense profits themselves killing men their way even at times raping women their path becomes norm as production advances other characters leave almost as fast as they appear joe pesci burt young treat williams danny aiello make such short runs that if you are not paying attention closely you might miss them women make more pronounced impressions youngster jennifer connelly grows become elizabeth mcgovern deniros childhood love who has aspirations acting singing professionally woods finds companionship with ultra erotic smart mouthed tuesday weld doing her best work by mile as movie continues deniro weld develop bond hate that turns into mutual respect eventually they even become oddest friends woods deniro have mutual unspoken brotherly love that translates into one most important relationships history movies deniro al pacino would later share similar bond vastly under rated heat some 11 years later as all this happens though we begin wonder if all we are seeing is true reality dream like beginning which supposedly shows fates four criminals does not always fit with amazingly strange final 30 minutes that seems defy convention time constraints characters major cinematic screen writing principles symbolism that has always been prevalent italian cinema also comes into play here these symbols may indeed hold true answers mysteries within then again maybe not once upon time america was sergio leones final film it grows myth legend due that fact much like similar movies like giant james deans final performance eyes wide shut stanley kubricks hypnotic final production this movie just seems go into higher stratosphere hollywood that totally ignores typical norms that are always association with other big name movie products james hayden even died apparent drug overdose shortly after this film was initially released while performing broadway thus legends grow multiply overall end i do believe that once upon time america is arguably finest movie 1980s it is definitely unique production that stands near paramount decade that was mired stupid comedies teen flicks endless horror movie installments deniro is truly revelation once again here he dominates most production seemingly endless wonderful performances movie is one those that should be studied analyzed over over by those who really want get root cinematic history development much like its running time excellence once upon time america is nearly immeasurable 5 stars out 5,0.46684457355509984,0.05400888585099112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,"Not simply the greatest of gangster movies,but one of the greatest movies ever,a multi-layered,melancholic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings","Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It's nearly four hours long,and demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.Reminiscent at times of some very old gangster films such as The Roaring Twenties,one will find almost every gangster movie cliché one can find-one can imagine Leone half remembering bits and pieces from films he saw as a youth. However,he never glamourises his protagonists-he may dare us to like Robert De Niro's 'Noodles'-a murderous thug and rapist who always seems to make the wrong decisions-but that's different from glamourising him. The notorious rape scene is all the more hard to watch because its painful to watch Noodles try to destroy himself and his girlfriend by going through with it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past. Therefore,starting in mid-plot in the 1930s,than flashing back and forth in time,was the right choice {if initially confusing!}. This is the culmination of Leone's increasing interest in the flashback structure-think especially of the parallel story told in A Fistful of Dynamite's flashbacks.There is action,but it's mostly quick and brutal,and there is also humour,such as a very funny scene set to Rossini's Thieving Magpie where the gangsters are loose in a hospital filled with babies. However,the broody,melancholic tone never really goes away,and towards the end,the film grinds to a virtual halt. Be warned,there is no action climax,just a series of somewhat oblique dialogue scenes and revelations.The expected Leone flamboyancy is hardly to be found,but the film still often soars most when dialogue is kept to a minimum and Ennio Morricone's gorgeous music takes over. Some of the most brilliant scenes just consist of Noodles seeing and reflecting. In one especially effective and poignant scene near the end,an old Noodles is leaving his love Deborah as her achingly sad theme plays,and he sees her son,who is the spitting image of,well,I try to avoid spoilers! As the music changes into the still sad but more majestic main theme,the camera slowly zooms,as it often does,into Noodles' sad eyes. We go to what is initially a blur,until we realise it's curtains. The person who holds the key to all this appears,like a ghost,through the curtains and goes onto a balcony,from where he sees the same 'son' with a girlfriend. Sheer brilliance,and not a gun in sight! Of course De Niro is great,but he's obviously very restrained and reflective. It's James Woods who really dominates,so dynamic here,this should have made him a big star. One must also mention Tonni Delli Colli,who photographs three time periods with slightly different hues but still subtly.Leone's original cut was five hours and if you want to be picky there are holes in the plot. Leone leaves a great many things ambiguous,but shouldn't all great art ask questions? Once Upon A Time In America is not necessarily easy viewing,but it IS great art,the final statement of one of the best filmmakers of all time.",not simply greatest gangster movies but one greatest movies ever multi layered melancholic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings,once upon time america is crowning achievement director sergio leone its nearly four hours long demands total concentration beginning end however those willing submit will find it more than worth it reminiscent at times some very old gangster films such as roaring twenties one will find almost every gangster movie clich one can find one can imagine leone half remembering bits pieces films he saw as youth however he never glamourises his protagonists he may dare us like robert de niros noodles murderous thug rapist who always seems make wrong decisions but thats different glamourising him notorious rape scene is all more hard watch because its painful watch noodles try destroy himself his girlfriend by going through with it what really makes this film different is its overwhelming melancholy leones favourite loyalty betrayal theme is there but film is also study memory lost soul coming terms with his past therefore starting mid plot 1930s than flashing back forth time was right choice if initially confusing this is culmination leones increasing interest flashback structure think especially parallel story told fistful dynamites flashbacks there is action but its mostly quick brutal there is also humour such as very funny scene set rossinis thieving magpie where gangsters are loose hospital filled with babies however broody melancholic tone never really goes away towards end film grinds virtual halt be warned there is no action climax just series somewhat oblique dialogue scenes revelations expected leone flamboyancy is hardly be found but film still often soars most when dialogue is kept minimum ennio morricones gorgeous music takes over some most brilliant scenes just consist noodles seeing reflecting one especially effective poignant scene near end old noodles is leaving his love deborah as her achingly sad theme plays he sees her son who is spitting image well i try avoid spoilers as music changes into still sad but more majestic main theme camera slowly zooms as it often does into noodles sad eyes we go what is initially blur until we realise its curtains person who holds key all this appears like ghost through curtains goes onto balcony where he sees same son with girlfriend sheer brilliance not gun sight course de niro is great but hes obviously very restrained reflective its james woods who really dominates so dynamic here this should have made him big star one must also mention tonni delli colli who photographs three time periods with slightly different hues but still subtly leones original cut was five hours if you want be picky there are holes plot leone leaves great many things ambiguous but shouldnt all great art ask questions once upon time america is not necessarily easy viewing but it is great art final statement one best filmmakers all time,0.524976416277786,0.1173122083396056,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Sergio Leone's grand ambition.,"After so many years of westerns, Sergio Leone made ""Once Upon a Time in America"", about several friends forced to abandon their loyalty as they age. This is one of those movies that's too hard to simply describe; you really have to see it to understand it. And you may be disappointed if you expect something exactly like ""The Godfather""; they are gangsters, but they're Jewish, so that changes things a little.If absolutely nothing else, this disproves the notion that we have nowadays that historical epics are always pieces of drudgery (blame ""Alexander"" for that stereotype). ""OUATIA"" is the sort of movie that could only star people like Robert DeNiro. It also stars James Woods, Joe Pesci, Elizabeth McGovern, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly (in her debut), and they all do a great job. This movie is a masterpiece in every way.

1.0,"A bloated, self-indulgent epic fail","A few very rich people and a great many very talented people, not least Snr. Leone, invested a great deal of time, talent and moolah to bring this movie to completion. It shows, and the movie is a rich spectacle - but nothing more. No-one should waste their time watching this except to learn how to overspend on art direction. I just want four hours of my life back. Naively, I sat through endless period son-et-lumiére, gratuitous sex and violence, dubious ageing makeup jobs, unrealistic dialogue and nondescript music, hoping that the ending would tie it all together in a satisfying way. Epic fail. It's a bad B-movie plot dressed as The Sting.*SPOILER* Noodles (De Niro, wasting his prime - the ridiculous name of the protagonist says it all) returns to New York after 30 years to find he has been advanced a million bucks for a hit, but why? It's Max, (James Woods) his boyhood gang chum that he thought he'd double-crossed and got killed, wanting Noodles to kill him before the real baddies get hold of him. What rubbish; after all, a million buys a lot of secret hideaway. It is so telling that the movie's premise considers a huge sum of money a good enough maguffin to hang a four-hour marathon melodrama on. Mild, ostentatious tedium follows - mystified, Noodles wanders from mausoleum to left luggage office to cold-cream besmeared dancer's dressing room, all the while flashing back to a squeaky-clean 1930's gangland, where we eventually learn that it is a bad idea to call Max 'crazy'. Because instantly he goes crazy, in a piece of character development that probably had the Scooby-Doo writers looking to their laurels. That was said of 'Bugs' Moran, actually - you didn't call him 'Bugs' to his face. There's no chance of any such real-life wit or irony in this script. No chance of any reality at all, because the intention seems to have been to make grand opera, so it doesn't matter that a man can be forced to sit in a vat of gasoline (and drink it) yet jump out when rescued as though it were gameshow gunk. It doesn't matter that driving a car at speed into a quay with no-one wearing belts would result in a bloody mess, not male bonding. Grand opera requires grand passion to drive the plot; Noodles' only passion is for looking at length through one of the movies' two terribly unconvincing peepholes at a budding ballet dancer, whom he goes on to rape. As you do; another piece of meaningless quasi-characterisation. Grand opera requires grand symbolism to resonate with people; there is no symbolism in OUATIA, the whole thing is a completely pedestrian display of directorial indulgence. But then, in 1984 we all thought the money would last forever. This movie certainly feels like it.",bloated self indulgent epic fail,few very rich people great many very talented people not least snr leone invested great deal time talent moolah bring this movie completion it shows movie is rich spectacle but nothing more no one should waste their time watching this except learn how overspend art direction i just want four hours my life back naively i sat through endless period son et lumi re gratuitous sex violence dubious ageing makeup jobs unrealistic dialogue nondescript music hoping that ending would tie it all together satisfying way epic fail its bad b movie plot dressed as sting spoiler noodles de niro wasting his prime ridiculous name protagonist says it all returns new york after 30 years find he has been advanced million bucks hit but why its max james woods his boyhood gang chum that he thought hed double crossed got killed wanting noodles kill him before real baddies get hold him what rubbish after all million buys lot secret hideaway it is so telling that movies premise considers huge sum money good enough maguffin hang four hour marathon melodrama mild ostentatious tedium follows mystified noodles wanders mausoleum left luggage office cold cream besmeared dancers dressing room all while flashing back squeaky clean 1930s gangland where we eventually learn that it is bad idea call max crazy because instantly he goes crazy piece character development that probably had scooby doo writers looking their laurels that was said bugs moran actually you didnt call him bugs his face theres no chance any such real life wit or irony this script no chance any reality at all because intention seems have been make grand opera so it doesnt matter that man can be forced sit vat gasoline drink it yet jump out when rescued as though it were gameshow gunk it doesnt matter that driving car at speed into quay with no one wearing belts would result bloody mess not male bonding grand opera requires grand passion drive plot noodles only passion is looking at length through one movies two terribly unconvincing peepholes at budding ballet dancer whom he goes rape as you do another piece meaningless quasi characterisation grand opera requires grand symbolism resonate with people there is no symbolism ouatia whole thing is completely pedestrian display directorial indulgence but then 1984 we all thought money would last forever this movie certainly feels like it,0.5717372791143283,0.017046164218295388,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"

9.0,Leone's gangster masterpiece.,"Director Sergio Leone is best known for his classic spaghetti westerns, but for my money, his final movie, gangster epic Once Upon A Time In America, is his most accomplished work. With a running time of 229 minutes (more if you're watching the Extended Director's Cut), it's longer than either Once Upon A Time in the West or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and it's pacing is just as measured (some might say 'slow'), but the time passes far less painfully, so engaging are the characters and the drama that unfolds.Spanning decades, the story is truly monumental: it opens in the late 1960s with ageing gangster Noodles (Robert De Niro) returning to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty-five years in hiding, and then proceeds to cut back and forth between the present and the past to show his life as a young boy in an impoverished Jewish ghetto, as a tough gangster during the Prohibition period, and as an old man reacquainting himself with old friends. This skillful technique helps to keep the viewer engrossed long after their bum has gone numb, but fine performances from a stellar cast (which includes James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello, and a young Jennifer Connelly), excellent cinematography, and some brilliantly executed scenes of brutal violence, all accompanied by a wonderfully haunting pan flute score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, help to ensure that nodding off is unlikely.",leones gangster masterpiece,director sergio leone is best known his classic spaghetti westerns but my money his final movie gangster epic once upon time america is his most accomplished work with running time 229 minutes more if youre watching extended directors cut its longer than either once upon time west or good bad ugly its pacing is just as measured some might say slow but time passes far less painfully so engaging are characters drama that unfolds spanning decades story is truly monumental it opens late 1960s with ageing gangster noodles robert de niro returning lower east side manhattan after thirty five years hiding then proceeds cut back forth between present past show his life as young boy impoverished jewish ghetto as tough gangster during prohibition period as old man reacquainting himself with old friends this skillful technique helps keep viewer engrossed long after their bum has gone numb but fine performances stellar cast which includes james woods joe pesci danny aiello young jennifer connelly excellent cinematography some brilliantly executed scenes brutal violence all accompanied by wonderfully haunting pan flute score by brilliant ennio morricone help ensure that nodding off is unlikely,0.5392156862745099,0.10890522875816995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"

Indeed, some of the balletic collages of music and images in this movie resemble no other film more than '2001: A Space Oddysey', which is certainly not something you can say of most gangster movies. Unfortuantly, the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong as the imagery, the conclusion to the plot doesn't quite convince (or indeed, pack a big enough punch to wholly satisfy after a movie of this length), and at times the film seems almost to endorse its central characters' crude, and sometimes sexually violent, world view.

10.0,A masterpiece and an atrocity!,"This movie was a masterpiece. It ranks as one of the very best in film history, if not the best. At Cannes people yelled and screamed, couldn't believe just how good it was. The profound atrocity was a combination of two completely brainless acts, the first being Zack Stienberg's hatchet job for US release, supposedly requested by either Warner Bros or The Ladd Company (one blames the other now) and the second was the lack of anyone (and everyone)to post anything in this great film for Academy Award consideration, of which probably as many as 14 nominations and 4 sure- fire Oscars went down the toilet. These atrocities were perpretrated, I believe, with two reasons in mind, the first to preserve the dim hope of ""The Killing Fields"" (Daly & Semel's baby) of garnering any awards... and second, to try to boost up the non- foreign chances. Warner Bros knew just how good it was, that goes without saying. The problem was... they already had their share of cash cows and they wanted a real star- studded showpiece to point at. The small minds already had their showpiece but, alas, it was an ""eye- tallyan"" flick with a producer/director who didn't communicate well. The hatchet job was carefully planned, I believe... the so- called ""sneak preview"" was done in Canada and not well received, probably due to the fact that the sound system was over- amped and the film 'broke' 3 or 4 times during the showing, what a farce! The awards snub started with the GGs and carried right thru. What a myriad of stupid and utterly pointless decisions! Must have literally tore Leone's heart out when he learned what they had done. Morricone's score was a sure- thing Oscar, no question about it. DeNiro and maybe even Woods would have fought it out for best actor, Tuesday Weld as supporting actress, any one of 4 or 5 other supporting actors & actresses, most notably William Forsythe, cinematography, film editing, the list goes on & on... (best picture...Amadeus???? give me a break!!) Just what in the hell were they thinking?

,Masterpiece,"The lives of a group of Jewish gangsters from childhood to adulthood.Once Upon a Time in America is dismissed as an overrated film by many, which I can understand. It's very long, lacks dialogue and characters seem less engaging than in other gangster flicks - certainly not the kind you might see in a Scorsese picture. These are not necessarily large flaws in a film created by the master Leone, however. Once Upon a Time in America is an exercise in cinematic brilliance. Each scene is memorable and extracts the desired effect from the viewer. I was enthralled with each moment.

10.0,The second best film of the 1980s.(spoilers),"'Never trust the artist. Trust the tale' urged DH Lawrence of American literature, and it is a maxim we would do well to heed in watching any film by Sergio Leone, but in particular this, ostensibly his most realistic and straightforward. None of his films have packed the given period with so much signifying detail - the gorgeous sepia-toned 1921 sequence, with its Jewish shops and inhabitants, horses and carts, cakes, clothes, the pervading brown, the corrupt cops, the sexual fumblings; the Prohibition years, the sharp suits, the mixture of bonhomie and surgical violence, the disused harbours and warehouses with fading signs, the speakeasies and opium dens, the vast art-deco restaurants. Only the 60s sequence feels undersketched, a handful of stray signs - muzak Beatles, acoustic-strumming hippies, corruption-exposing TV - pointing to the era. This, I think, is very deliberate.1968 was a crucial year in American history from the assassination of RFK to the heated civil rights and anti-Vietnam protests. It was as if all the bogus American myths had been exploded, rising to the surface the nasty, sour-tasting truth. It was also the year Leone made 'Once Upon A Time In The West', the film that for all time defined the impulse behind American history - 'make believe it didn't happen'. This self-referentiality is appropriate to a film about cinema, full of people looking through screen-like apertures, never acting, letting history wash over them; this is a milieu where shops and stations are named after the likes of Altman and Pabst, where the hero loves an actress, where his best friend spends 35 years playing someone else.Allied to this careful, material realism, is a straightforward narrative, a mystery story: why did Noodles betray his friends? As in a conventional Hollywood film, this central enigma is suspended, and background information is sketched in, to raise the stakes of solution. Everything initially inexplicable is explained, we answer the telephone call from the past, we find out what Rosebud is. But as Borges said of 'Citizen Kane', 'Once Upon A Time In America' is a labyrinth without a centre - we must tread warily.Like 'The Godfather 2' and 'Reds', 'America' is an epic panorama of 20th century American history. We see how gangsterism is less a metaphor for American capitalism, but its very essence. We see how unions, the law, politics, even religious communities are infected by it, poisoned, learn to accomodate and live with it. As Conway says to Max, the gangsters achieve more dealing with the bosses in one night than he would have in two years negotiation.Leone shows how the American dream (oh yes), the very idea of capitalism, is inimical to democracy. He shows this through the central story of Max and Noodles, the great betrayal. And the revelation is numbingly shocking. In a film full of ironic godlike long shots, at one stage the lads, after the hospital babyswitch farce, declare themselves deities, with the power to dispense lifelong happiness or misery. But it is Max who pulls off the God trick in reality. He is a Platonic kind of God, who creates a world of illusions, of lies; who dispenses power and paralytic guilt for his own ends, who can actually change the destiny of people's lives, not just in the usual sense of killing them, but in destroying their soul, making them live in a hall of mirrors, a world of empty memories reflecting back on each other, nothing reflecting nothing. Watching De Niro in the 60s section is one of the most dispiriting things in cinema - it's like watching the walking dead.Unlike the Dollars trilogy, which are full of disruptions, Brechtian jerks and jokey intrusions, Leone's last film seems very smooth and unified. But underneath this surface, the tensions wrench. There are some remarkable shifts in tone, from the extraordinary opening section, virtually silent, a fluid requiem; to the joyous rites-of-passage sequence; to the middle gangster segment, which contains some excellent comic bits, filmed with a disarming flippancy that seems to have intruded from another film altogether; to the somnambulations of the 60s.Leone films much of 'America' like one of his Westerns, with an emphasis on extended rituals, extreme close-ups, and a contraction of time. The very 70s use of zooms seems jarring in an 80s film. The opening sequence, in its framing, its use of pace, decor and lighting, and in its editing, in its story of a helpless woman being shot by three killers, is pure spaghetti Leone. This infiltration of the Western, with its expansiveness and codes, plays havoc with the gangster film, such a claustrophobic, urban genre. The chase and murder in the feather factory is jaw-droppingly beautiful.The music plays a crucial part in the formal disjunctions - the manipulation of emotions it achieves is disturbing, so that you wonder why music that has signalled melancholy emotional crescendo is swelling at a boy eating a cake; of why the most gorgeous, heartbreaking melodies are made evoke the tragedy of a rapist, informer, murderer. If we follow these cues too closely - and it is almost impossible not to; never has sentimentality been so ruthlessly deployed - we fall into the same trap as Noodles.But does he? Is the story of a man who has been hoodwinked, who never knows what's going on, who's always left out, or in the dark; a man who walks like a ghost through his own life, whose inability to act petrifies him, turns him into Lot's wife, actually an illusion as audacious as Max's?. For many, the enigma of the film is the fate of Max, the mystery of the refuse truck,. Obviously he was planning a final self-saving scam, a way out of another mess, getting Noodles to think he's shot him, and then having his friend's mangled body, not for the first time, passed off as his own. The body (and soul) snatching would be complete. Does he in the end finally mangle himself; is this phantom, this resurrection from the dead, finally laid to rest? The scene seems to crystallise Noodles' life - victim, dupe, onlooker, not knowing what's going on, shuffling in the dark outside the sites of great events?But there is something very Gothic about this scene - the nocturnal setting; the mansion with secret passages; the wealthy, successful, melancholy man willing death; the idea of the doppelganger; the candle-lined avenue. Noodles begins and ends 'America' in an opium den, and the final image is of a big smile, like he's pulled off the biggest scam in history, fooling us, shrouded like Jill in 'West'. The film actually begins in 1933, so that the 1968 scenes are flashforwards, rather than the central narrative, which is where the film begins and ends. Like all Leone's films, there is a strong homoerotic charge, and Max has a clear longing for Noodles; the one consensual sex act in the film is in a hearse (heterosexual love=death) - the rest are violent rapes. Is the film a working out of homosexual tensions, the narrative the ultimate solipsistic gesture? The 'revelation' doesn't explain anything: it opens new enigmas. The film is full of inexplicable loose ends - what happens to Joe Pesci after he spots Noodles and Max coming out of a lift before they go to Florida? Is he the drunk in 1921 the boys rob? These repetitions, the longs shots of silent, tiny figures against huge backdrops, the rigid Kabuki gestures, the sparse oneiric 60s sequence, all seem to suggest a kind of dream; Noodles' passivity as he slopes through time seems that of a dreamer. How reliable are the points of view, the assertions, the flashforwards of a film whose main character has been left in the dark for 35 years?",second best film 1980s spoilers,never trust artist trust

10.0,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Leone's magnum opus and a testament to the free spirit of Art,"In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – ""A favor in return of another"". Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality. At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker—an auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it. The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic—caught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges—buys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era. Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review leones magnum opus testament free spirit

9.0,"Strip off the veneer, Tear down the facade...","Injustice. This film deals with it, this film suffered it. Leone and his team never saw a single Oscar for what is, undoubtedly, one of the GREAT movies of film history. Supposedly the reason was that HIS version was far too long, and 'unapetizing' for the American public. Years later, this seems ridiculous. American cinema has topped the record for gore and 'unhealthy' material. And DVD finally gave us O.U.a T. in A. in its glorious entirety. And complexity. Yes, because this script is so perfect, so stimulating and so bewitching, that although I have seen the movie 3 times in the last 30 years, it still surprises me...adds nuances and revelations to it's original story. truly admirable! The facade of good ole, healthy America is severely battered by this story of unhealthy ambition, betrayal, revenge and power. 'Noodles' De Niro (the nick-name of our 'positive' protagonist reminds us that Leone was the king of 'spaghetti' westerns), returns, twice, to the site of past crimes... risking his life and ideals in the process. The savagely bitter finale remind us that he does so, simply because he is 'curious'. Because he NEEDS the truth. And this need, although painful, is necessary. Guilt, it is implied, is a powerful corrosive agent, however icy James Woods' character may be. There is , whatsmore, a sub-text which Sergio Leone works on here, and it is the role of DRUGS in society. In order to bear the injustice and treason, the violence and solitude that life has dealt out, Noodles resorts to Opium, as a source of relief; of contemplation. Could it be that the director is reminding us that Heroin's reign in Italy and in the U.S. during the 70ies and 80ies may closely reflect 'modern' Society's degradation? As always, Leone blends his political criticism of the American way with a strong misogynist vein. His women are few and far between in the westerns, but in the two 'Once upon a time..."" movies they are increasingly present, and increasingly foxy. The are either prostitutes or cock-teasers with a strong masochist element. And it seems he prefers the 'honest whore'. This film could be reviewed by a psychoanalyst, a priest, a gangster or a politician , and all, I'm sure, would offer a different reading, as in Kurosawa's 'Rashomon'. But Leone is NOT a subtle film-maker. And maybe this reputation of his as something of a gangster in the, very selective Italian league of the 60 ies and 70ies, cheated him out of the credit he receives only now. Somewhat like Ken Russell in the British panorama, Leone's stylish but brutal approach to the realities of life, hurt the shyly hypocritical sensitivities of public and censors alike... let alone the distributors' in Hollywood. Technically the movie is breathtaking, especially Pescucci's wardrobe, Rochetti's make-up (the aging jobs are almost all superlative, and fundamental in helping us deal with such a complex game of 'flash-backs'), the Greg Tolland-style photography and shots by Tonino Delli Colli, the sets, editing and...of course, dulcis-in-fundo, Ennio Morricone's timeless score which, once again, is part and parcel of the film, an emotional bomb which Leone knowingly 'drops' in all the right moments. Deborah's theme is crushing. And the brilliant use of music and silence in Noodles' visit to his friend's mausoleum... comic and audacious. So, it's 9 out of 10, given that the perfect film may not exist (Jean Vigo's 'L'Atalante' ?), and the nearest thing to reading a GREAT novel, but with the whole 'caboodle' of the art of our time. Il Grande Cinema.p.s. It is absolutely extraordinary that an Italian,a ROMAN, with a VERY limited grasp of the English language, should endeavour, and pull off, such an ambitious American fresco. His great talent, and that of Mr. Brian Freilino (who helped him coach and survey the realism of nuances in both languages), and of the dialogue writers, greatly surpass the occasional hiccups that we encounter, especially in the childhood scenes. and by the way, ALL praise to the young actors who unjustly precede De Niro and Woods, but only chronologically.",strip off veneer tear down facade,injustice this film deals with it this film suffered it leone his team never saw single oscar what is undoubtedly one great movies film history supposedly reason was that his version was far too long unapetizing american public years later this seems ridiculous american cinema has topped record gore unhealthy material dvd finally gave us o u t its glorious entirety complexity yes because this script is so perfect so stimulating so bewitching that although i have seen movie 3 times last 30 years it still surprises me adds nuances revelations its original story truly admirable facade good ole healthy america is severely battered by this story unhealthy ambition betrayal revenge power noodles de niro nick name our positive protagonist reminds us that leone was king spaghetti westerns returns twice site past crimes risking his life ideals process savagely bitter finale remind us that he does so simply because he is curious because he needs truth this need although painful is necessary guilt it is implied is powerful corrosive agent however icy james woods character may be there is whatsmore sub text which sergio leone works here it is role drugs society order bear injustice treason violence solitude that life has dealt out noodles resorts opium as source relief contemplation could it be that director is reminding us that heroins reign italy u s during 70ies 80ies may closely reflect modern societys degradation as always leone blends his political criticism american way with strong misogynist vein his women are few far between westerns but two once upon time movies they are increasingly present increasingly foxy are either prostitutes or cock teasers with strong masochist element it seems he prefers honest whore this film could be reviewed by psychoanalyst priest gangster or politician all im sure would offer different reading as kurosawas rashomon but leone is not subtle film maker maybe this reputation his as something gangster very selective italian league 60 ies 70ies cheated him out credit he receives only now somewhat like ken russell british panorama leones stylish but brutal approach realities life hurt shyly hypocritical sensitivities public censors alike let alone distributors hollywood technically movie is breathtaking especially pescuccis wardrobe rochettis make up aging jobs are almost all superlative fundamental helping us deal with such complex game flash backs greg tolland style photography shots by tonino delli colli sets editing course dulcis fundo ennio morricones timeless score which once again is part parcel film emotional bomb which leone knowingly drops all right moments deborahs theme is crushing brilliant use music silence noodles visit his friends mausoleum comic audacious so its 9 out 10 given that perfect film may not exist jean vigos latalante nearest thing reading great novel but with whole caboodle art our time il grande cinema p s it is absolutely extraordinary that italian roman with very limited grasp english language should endeavour pull off such ambitious american fresco his great talent that mr brian freilino who helped him coach survey realism nuances both languages dialogue writers greatly surpass occasional hiccups that we encounter especially childhood scenes by way all praise young actors who unjustly precede de niro woods but only chronologically,0.5401034151034151,0.13901972101972104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,This is Master Cinema!,"Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 Italian-American epic crime drama film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niroand James Woods. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature film he had directed in thirteen years. The runtime of the film is 3h 50min and I didn't even go to the toilet all through it. It may be too long for most people but I can tell you that my wifey and me weren't even bored in the slightest. This is Sergio Leone at the height of his game and his direction is masterclass. His sketches of the characters are brief but underscored with verve. Words cannot begin to describe what he has accomplished here. The opening sequences kept me spellbound - a scene of violence, a sickening death, leading to De Niro at an opium den. You know the dragnet is closing in on him, then the fricking ringing phone that never stops ringing. I kept looking for an elusive ringing phone but it never comes. We are treated to images like three dead bodies which makes no sense at all, but dammit I couldn't tear my eyes and ears away, and then we flash forward 35 years and we see the bloody phone. What audacity! What spunk! The opening had me on the palm of its hand. I was minced meat, ready to be pounded, tenderised and moulded to become a viewer Sergio Leone wants. Such opacity in the images but you will instantly know you are in the hands of a master and have complete trust in him. Every scene is handcrafted to perfection with such a high level of meticulosity. Don't get me talking about the ending. This is an ending that is impossible to shut up about. You will want to discuss with someone with at least some measure of acuity WTF was that about. For me there are two ways to look at the ending and what it means for the preceding over 3 hours you have just seen. This is as good as a mindfcuk but with such brilliance. I can say this is not a film for all tastes but it is definitely for cineastes out there",this is master cinema,once upon time america is 1984 italian american epic crime drama film co written directed by italian filmmaker sergio leone starring robert de niroand james woods based harry greys novel hoods it chronicles lives jewish ghetto youths who rise prominence new york citys world organized crime film explores themes childhood friendships love lust greed betrayal loss broken relationships rise mobsters american society it was final film leones career first feature film he had directed thirteen years runtime film is 3h 50min i didnt even go toilet all through it it may be too long most people but i can tell you that my wifey me werent even bored slightest this is sergio leone at height his game his direction is masterclass his sketches characters are brief but underscored with verve words cannot begin describe what he has accomplished here opening sequences kept me spellbound scene violence sickening death leading de niro at opium den you know dragnet is closing him then fricking ringing phone that never stops ringing i kept looking elusive ringing phone but it never comes we are treated images like three dead bodies which makes no sense at all but dammit i couldnt tear my eyes ears away then we flash forward 35 years we see bloody phone what audacity what spunk opening had me palm its hand i was minced meat ready be pounded tenderised moulded become viewer sergio leone wants such opacity images but you will instantly know you are hands master have complete trust him every scene is handcrafted perfection with such high level meticulosity dont get me talking about ending this is ending that is impossible shut up about you will want discuss with someone with at least some measure acuity wtf was that about me there are two ways look at ending what it means preceding over 3 hours you have just seen this is as good as mindfcuk but with such brilliance i can say this is not film all tastes but it is definitely cineastes out there,0.4655258467023172,-0.05010695187165776,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.48}"
