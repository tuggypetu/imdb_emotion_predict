10,That's right. I'm just a fella now. I ain't no different than anyone else no more.,"William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he's tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.Clint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture, the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West.It's striking that the makers here have lured us in to being firmly on Munney's side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood's part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney's obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way lay the bad guys - in fact salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it's with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with.It's not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is one of the critical characters on show, this even though we didn't expect that to be the case. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derring-do heroics, gunslingers with a glint in their eye who deal death as some sort of heroic encore. This gives Unforgiven an excellent sleight of hand, for this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions and it's not controversial to say that this is indeed a good thing.Eastwood is greatly served by the actors around him, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman (winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before!), Rubinek, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman's win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett, Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction, Best Picture, Best Editing and it was nominated in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green's cinematography, which now, in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema, can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the Western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes.Ultimately though, Unforgiven is a lesson in adroit film making, where across the board it works so well. Why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre inside out, he was after all the sole flag bearer for practically 25 years. He learnt from his peers, and thus Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark. An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema, regardless of being a genre fan or not. 10/10",thats right im just fella now i aint no different than anyone else no more,william munny clint eastwood taking lead directing piece is old retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make devil himself seem tame widowed struggling raise his two children paltry farm hes tempted out retirement one last pay dirt job consequence which provides violence both physically soul clint eastwood signed off western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture appropriation irony which is itself majestic point reference after script had been knocking around nigh twenty years written by blade runner scribe david webb peoples eastwood seized opportunity play william munney lay bare mythologies wild west its striking that makers here have lured us being firmly munneys side we are incredibly influenced by eastwoods part history western spite munneys obvious murky past despicable crimes they be we wait hope munney make quip way lay bad guys fact salivating at prospect is probably closer truth so its with enormous credit that eastwood his magnificent cast crew manage fuddle all our respective perceptions west characters we ourselves have aged with its not nothing that w w beauchamp saul rubinek is one critical characters show this even though we didnt expect that be case beauchamp is writer penny pulpy novels that tell derring do heroics gunslingers with glint their eye who deal death as some sort heroic encore this gives unforgiven excellent sleight hand this west is grim destroyer all illusions its not controversial say that this is indeed good thing eastwood is greatly served by actors around him morgan freeman gene hackman winning best supporting actor oscar script he turned down many years before rubinek frances fisher anna thomson jaimz woolvett incredible cameo richard harris along with hackmans win his brutally tough portrayal sheriff little bill daggett unforgiven also won oscars eastwood his clinically tight direction best picture best editing it was nominated another five categories one those nominations was jack greens cinematography which now this age high definition enhanced cinema can be seen all its wonderful glory alberta location is magically transformed into western frontier with orange brown hues real treat eyes ultimately though unforgiven is lesson adroit film making where across board it works so well why well because man at helm knows this genre inside out he was after all sole flag bearer practically 25 years he learnt his peers thus eastwood has crafted thematically complex piece that all its violence debunking melancholy pulse beats is film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark incredible true highlight modern day cinema regardless being genre fan or not 10 10,0.5388662131519274,0.233813066893424,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,This aint just a great western. Its an incredible movie with an awesome star cast n superb performances.,"Saw this in the late nineties on a vhs n revisted umpteenth number of times. Own a dvd of it. Jus revisited few days back on a blu ray. Back in those days, my grandpop was excited to see both his fav film stars, Eastwood n Hackman in the same film. The cast is awesomely strong. Eastwood, Hackman n Freeman. This aint just a great Western. Its a great movie with awesome characters. Eastwood playing a tough guy who has killed women and children in the past but trying to lead a decent honest life with his kids on a farm. He has become more weaker with age. His farm is going thru a loss n he is pulled into his darker side once again. On the other side v have Hackman as a sheriff whos against people carrying guns in his town. He is a bit autocratic n sadist when meting out punishment. We have Freeman as Eastwood's old pal who during a shootout acknowledges that he aint no ruthless anymore. All the performances r top notch. Eastwood's direction is truly mesmerizing from opening shot n the editing top notch. The one liners are also memorable. Cinematography by Jack N Green is wonderful. The film begins and ends with a beautiful wide shot, Eastwood standing at the grave near a tree, with a sunset in the background.

10,Masterpiece,"Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary ""Man With No Name"" in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Pale Rider"", but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre: ""Unforgiven"", an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.Clint Eastwood himself plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who is now living a peaceful life as a farmer with his two children. However, life is very difficult for Munny's family, as since the death of his wife the family has been facing financial problems. One day a young man calling himself ""The Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett) appears looking for Munny. The Kid tells Munny about a bounty offered in the town of Big Whisky, and offers him the chance to join him as hired gun and split the reward between them. While Munny's days as a murderer are in the past, he decides to join him after thinking about the farm's problems, but not without calling his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join them. However, Munny's past as a notorious thief and murderer will return to haunt him in this last mission, as the Kid shows a true and honest admiration for Munny's fame as a gunslinger, even when Munny himself considers his past as villainous.While better known for his work in science fiction, David Webb Peoples' screenplay proves to be a very accurate description of life in the American west, particularly concerning the aspects of the uses and abuses of violence in that era. It is in fact the use of violence what comes as the main theme of the story, as Munny is escaping from his past's violence while the Kid is eagerly awaiting the next chance to prove his masculinity by the use of violence. The duality between man and myth is explored not only via the relationship between the Kid and Munny, but also in the shape of a character who writes novels about the wild west, and sees the figure of the gunslinger as an idolized modern hero. Peoples' screenplay is remarkably well written, as the many characters and their relationships are exhaustively explored, resulting in a character driven revisionism of the western, that in many ways criticizes the genre's origins as violent ""Shoot 'em up"" films.Peoples' script is definitely the movie's backbone, but it is Eastwood's masterful direction what transforms this meditation of violence into a unique revision of the Western. With a gritty and realistic approach very in tone with the script, Eastwood portraits the Wild West without romanticism and leaving out the mythic aspects of the genre, taking the revisionism of the Western one step beyond. Using Peoples' script, Eastwood takes a critic view on the figure of the ""hero"" in Westerns, focusing on the image of the gunslinger and the use of violence to solve problems. Visually, Eastwood has crafted his most impressive movie since ""Bird"", with an extensive use of shadows and light in the excellent work of cinematography by Jack N. Green. Eastwood's style, originated by the influence of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, and developed through many stages seems to finally have spawned its masterpiece in this film.As William Munny, Clint Eastwood is simply perfect in what at first sight looks like an extension of his earlier ""Man with no name"" persona. William Munny has a name, and a past he wants to escape from, and Estwood captures the image of guilt and regret to the letter. This is easily one of his best roles to date. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Ned Logan, although like Jaimz Woolvett (who plays The Schofield Kid), gets easily overshadowed by Gene Hackman's powerful performance as Little Bill Daggett. Hackman completely owns every scene he is in, showcasing his enormous talent in a very dramatic role. The legendary Richard Harris has a small appearance as another aging gunslinger, English Bob, in very memorable scenes where he demonstrates why he is considered one of the best actors of his generation.After starting his career playing a mythical hero in Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy, it is actually fitting that is Eastwood who explores the figure of hero in his many movies. Ever since his first directed western, Eastwood showed an interest in the duality of the hero, taking a special interest in the archetype of hero portrayed in the classic 1953 Western, ""Shane"". Eastwood has explored this theme in many ways in the past: first as a true antihero (""High Plains Drifter""), then as a man becoming legend (""The Outlaw Josey Wales"") and later as a true mythic hero (""Pale Rider""); all this culminates in ""Unforgiven"" as the ultimate demythologization of the concept, and his final ode to the Western genre. While the movie indeed feels a bit ""preachy"" at times, the story is devised in such a way that it never feels too heavy handed, as it unfolds nicely as a classic epic tale of the West.Personally, I can't praise this movie enough, as it is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"", and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an ""anti-Western"", I think that with this movie, Eastwood's name can proudly stand along those of Ford, Hawks, Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. ""Unforgiven"" is definitely Clint's masterpiece. 10/10",masterpiece,ford hawks leone peckinpah all them big names who have defined western genre one way or another across history cinema transforming

9,Unforgettable,"""Unforgiven"" may well be Clint Eastwood's greatest triumph as an actor and director. In this grim, dark, and yet strangely beautiful story of former gunslinger William Munny (Eastwood), who comes out of retirement for one last job, Eastwood deliberately sets out to demystify the old West. This is evident in the conversations between Munny and the Schofield Kid (Jaimze Wolvett), who has a romanticized image of the old-time gunfighters, and between sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) and hack journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). Yet the ""demythologizing"" message doesn't feel forced; it is woven effortlessly into a gripping story that powerfully conveys the human cost of violence.Moral ambiguity pervades the film, which has no easy resolutions and no customary clear lines between good and evil. Will and his friend Ned (Morgan Freeman), nominally the heroes, have clearly done many bad things in their lives. When they come to Big Whiskey as hired killers, it is ostensibly for a just cause -- to punish two no-good cowboys who slashed the face of a prostitute. Yet, as we know from the beginning, the version of the attack that is reported to Will and Ned is highly and grotesquely exaggerated. While the cowboys certainly should have been punished, we may legitimately wonder if death is a punishment that fits the crime. The agonizing death of the younger of the two cowboys, who didn't do the slashing and clearly felt bad about what his partner had done, certainly doesn't look like justice.The ostensible villain, Little Bill, is not just a villain. He is a sheriff determined to preserve law and order in the town. One can't blame him for wanting to keep paid assassins out. In a violent society, there's no way he can do his job without using violence. Unfortunately, he also takes a sadistic pleasure in his brutality -- even though he also seems to want a peaceful, quiet life in the house he's building.One might say that Munny's heroics in the guns-blazing climax undercut the film's purpose of dismantling the mystique of the Old West and its gunfighters. But the truth is, ""Unforgiven"" is both an homage to and a deconstruction of that mystique. While Munny acquires almost mythic stature in that scene, his actions are still morally shady, and his exchange with the nerdy Beauchamp quickly dispels the romantic aura. What's more, his ""rise"" to heroism can also be seen as a fall from grace and a reversion to his old ways.The film may be just a tad slow at times, but at 2 hrs 10 minutes, it remains nearly always gripping. (As for those IMDB reviewers who've knocked the movie because there are too many scenes where Eastwood's character is weak and pathetic, falling off his horse or getting beat up -- why don't you just go see some Arnold Schwarzenegger flick!) Not only are the principal characters well-developed, but even minor characters come across as real people with individual traits; the credit is due both to the excellent screenplay and to the superb cast. The scenes between Will Munny and Delilah, the prostitute who was slashed, are very touching without being at all ""sappy."" Eastwood is simply superb as the tortured and self-loathing Munny; Gene Hackman fully matches him as Little Bill; Morgan Freeman exudes a quiet dignity as Ned; Wolvett acquits himself well as ""the Kid."" Add to this a scene-stealing performance by Richard Harris as the elegant, vicious gunslinger English Bob, and terrific work by Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher as the prostitute Strawberry Alice, and Anna Levine as Delilah.""Unforgiven"" is a modern classic, a must-see for those who appreciate intelligent, high-quality filmmaking.",unforgettable,unforgiven may well be clint eastwoods greatest triumph as actor director this grim dark yet strangely beautiful story former gunslinger william munny eastwood who comes out retirement one last job eastwood deliberately sets out demystify old west this is evident conversations between munny schofield kid jaimze wolvett who has romanticized image old time gunfighters between sheriff little bill daggett gene hackman hack journalist w w beauchamp saul rubinek yet demythologizing message doesnt feel forced it is woven effortlessly into gripping story that powerfully conveys human cost violence moral ambiguity pervades film which has no easy resolutions no customary clear lines between good evil will his friend ned morgan freeman nominally heroes have clearly done many bad things their lives when they come big whiskey as hired killers it is ostensibly just cause punish two no good cowboys who slashed face prostitute yet as we know beginning version attack that is reported will ned is highly grotesquely exaggerated while cowboys certainly should have been punished we may legitimately wonder if death is punishment that fits crime agonizing death younger two cowboys who didnt do slashing clearly felt bad about what his partner had done certainly doesnt look like justice ostensible villain little bill is not just villain he is sheriff determined preserve law order town one cant blame him wanting keep paid assassins out violent society theres no way he can do his job without using violence unfortunately he also takes sadistic pleasure his brutality even though he also seems want peaceful quiet life house hes building one might say that munnys heroics guns blazing climax undercut films purpose dismantling mystique old west its gunfighters but truth is unforgiven is both homage deconstruction that mystique while munny acquires almost mythic stature that scene his actions are still morally shady his exchange with nerdy beauchamp quickly dispels romantic aura whats more his rise heroism can also be seen as fall grace reversion his old ways film may be just tad slow at times but at 2 hrs 10 minutes it remains nearly always gripping as those imdb reviewers whove knocked movie because there are too many scenes where eastwoods character is weak pathetic falling off his horse or getting beat up why dont you just go see some arnold schwarzenegger flick not only are principal characters well developed but even minor characters come across as real people with individual traits credit is due both excellent screenplay superb cast scenes between will munny delilah prostitute who was slashed are very touching without being at all sappy eastwood is simply superb as tortured self loathing munny gene hackman fully matches him as little bill morgan freeman exudes quiet dignity as ned wolvett acquits himself well as kid add this scene stealing performance by richard harris as elegant vicious gunslinger english bob terrific work by saul rubinek frances fisher as prostitute strawberry alice anna levine as delilah unforgiven is modern classic must see those who appreciate intelligent high quality filmmaking,0.5613900560224087,0.060432422969187674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8,A classic feel of Western with the added brilliance of Clint Eastwood and an equally strong cast,"I have heard quite a bit for ""Unforgiven"", also I want to seen all the best pictures from the 90's. I was also excited to see Morgan Freeman in the cast, so I know now that ""Million Dollar Baby"" was not Clint and Morgan's first experience together. They work so well as a team and bring nothing but sheer entertainment and charm to movies.""Unforgiven"" is a very good picture that has a real story and isn't just about ""cops and robbers"" or ""cowboys and Indians"". How far would you go for a friend? I loved Will and Ned's friendship so much because you could tell how much they had been through together and Will went back to his old ways in the blink of an eye for his dear friend. I loved watching Will's story through the movie, the first time you see him, he's just so charming and you would never had suspected of his former life of crime, alcohol, and bloodshed. Through the film, you have a lot of doubt for his character if he could go back to his old life despite his promises to his deceased wife. He, the Kid, and Ned go on a trip to kill two cowboys who cut up a prostitute's face for $1,000.00. Together, they learn that this isn't going to be such an easy task when the boys they're hunting down belong to a town where guns and all arms are banned that could lead to a punishment as far as death. But Will gets sick and the Kid and Ned give a lot of talk in killing these cowboys themselves, when Will is just half himself he does the deed himself in killing one of the cowboys. He tells Ned to go back home and he'll take care of the other cowboy, he does so but gets caught and beat to death by the sheriff.The Kid and Clint do the rest of the job by killing the other cowboy and receive their reward by the prostitutes, but Will learns of Ned and goes back into his old habits. What happens next? You'll have to watch yourself. Something that I learned that was interesting, Clint dedicated Unforgiven to Don Siegal and Sergio Leone, two directors who believed in him as a young actor. Unforgive is a remarkable film: methodical, deeply felt, with a devastating emotional and moral impact. It is easily one of the best Western movies. Like I said, it just has such a classic feel to it and you can't help but enjoy it. It seems like Clint might just own Hollywood one day. :) 8/10",classic feel western with added brilliance clint eastwood equally strong cast,i have heard quite bit unforgiven also i want seen all best pictures 90s i was also excited see morgan freeman cast so i know now that million dollar baby was not clint morgans first experience together they work so well as team bring nothing but sheer entertainment charm movies unforgiven is very good picture that has real story isnt just about cops robbers or cowboys indians how far would you go friend i loved will neds friendship so much because you could tell how much they had been through together will went back his old ways blink eye his dear friend i loved watching wills story through movie first time you see him hes just so charming you would never had suspected his former life crime alcohol bloodshed through film you have lot doubt his character if he could go back his old life despite his promises his deceased wife he kid ned go trip kill two cowboys who cut up prostitutes face 1 000 00 together they learn that this isnt going be such easy task when boys theyre hunting down belong town where guns all arms are banned that could lead punishment as far as death but will gets sick kid ned give lot talk killing these cowboys themselves when will is just half himself he does deed himself killing one cowboys he tells ned go back home hell take care other cowboy he does so but gets caught beat death by sheriff kid clint do rest job by killing other cowboy receive their reward by prostitutes but will learns ned goes back into his old habits what happens next youll have watch yourself something that i learned that was interesting clint dedicated unforgiven don siegal sergio leone two directors who believed him as young actor unforgive is remarkable film methodical deeply felt with devastating emotional moral impact it is easily one best western movies like i said it just has such classic feel it you cant help but enjoy it it seems like clint might just own hollywood one day 8 10,0.4402701789935832,0.18471968929415736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10,A Fitting End,"There may never be another real western. Clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn't anyone else I can think of that can do it Properly. Sergio Leone is gone. William Wellman is gone. Sam Peckinpah is gone. John Huston is gone. John Ford is gone. Howard Hawks is gone.Kevin Costner tries hard but he just doesn't get it. Dances With Wolves wasn't really a western. It wasn't even an anti-western. It was more like a political indictment of the actions of the Americans of the time. For all that I did enjoy it.Most of the others since Unforgiven are movies where somebody decides to put the characters on a horse, but the story is just generic pap. Nobody has the balls to make something with a meaning.I will grant that Deadwood is a truly excellent series but it isn't a movie.That's why I believe that Unforgiven is a fitting end to the western genre. I won't get all rhapsodic and spout a bunch of crap about how Clint made this movie as a symbol of the end of the western. Cuz that's a load of crap. The script had been around since the early 70s when things were still going strong. What it is, is a movie that shows us that there is no black and white in any time. There are only shades of grey.It is also just as dirty and violent as things actually were for most people in that era. Life was comparatively cheap and most people didn't have much hope of justice. The middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. The vast majority belonged to the under-classes.Good guys didn't wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy. Some were violent and corrupt braggarts and bullies. Little Bill mocks English Bob's self-promotion, but at the same time he knocks Bob down he builds himself up. He doesn't bother with courts or judges and he is his own executioner. He isn't motivated by any innate sense of justice when he deals with any criminal elements. It's more that he takes it as an insult to his own power.William Munny is a killer, plain and simple. He has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant. He changed for his wife, but like many changes it wasn't permanent. He won't sleep with a whore but when he needs money he is willing to kill for it. At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. A classic anti-hero.Rather than being about the end of the Western genre I believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. Sergio Leone would have been proud.",fitting end,there may never be another real western clint appears be done with genre there really isnt anyone else i can think that can do it properly sergio leone is gone william wellman is gone sam peckinpah is gone john huston is gone john ford is gone howard hawks is gone kevin costner tries hard but he just doesnt get it dances with wolves wasnt really western it wasnt even anti western it was more like political indictment actions americans time all that i did enjoy it most others since unforgiven are movies where somebody decides put characters horse but story is just generic pap nobody has balls make something with meaning i will grant that deadwood is truly excellent series but it isnt movie thats why i believe that unforgiven is fitting end western genre i wont get all rhapsodic spout bunch crap about how clint made this movie as symbol end western cuz thats load crap script had been around since early 70s when things were still going strong what it is is movie that shows us that there is no black white any time there are only shades grey it is also just as dirty violent as things actually were most people that era life was comparatively cheap most people didnt have much hope justice middle class was very small upper class was tiny vast majority belonged under classes good guys didnt wear white hats not every sheriff was good guy some were violent corrupt braggarts bullies little bill mocks english bobs self promotion but at same time he knocks bob down he builds himself up he doesnt bother with courts or judges he is his own executioner he isnt motivated by any innate sense justice when he deals with any criminal elements its more that he takes it as insult his own power william munny is killer plain simple he has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant he changed his wife but like many changes it wasnt permanent he wont sleep with whore but when he needs money he is willing kill it at same time he treats whore with kindness is loyal his friend somehow he managed get good woman love him classic anti hero rather than being about end western genre i believe that it is actually ode what came before it sergio leone would have been proud,0.43621441169060227,0.09750251952632906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9,"Reflective, contemplative revenge western is a real treat","There's little to say about this supreme western that hasn't been said already, but I'll try anyway. It's a spellbinding film, and nothing like what you'd expect from the rest of Eastwood's career. This turns out to be both an ode to a dying genre (the central characters are old and regretful) and a film with a powerful, anti-violence moral. Eastwood is at the top of his game both in terms of his screen presence (never has he played such a fragile, human character in a western) and as a director. This is one of the most beautiful westerns I've ever seen, with extraordinary lovely landscape shots which look fine when played in high definition.The plot is fairly slow and laced with moments of shocking violence – none more so than the opening sequence, in which a cowboy slices up a prostitute's face with his knife. It's this moment of brutality that sets off the chain of plot, eventually culminating in a well remembered showdown between our ageing hero and, well, just about everybody else. Gene Hackman is particularly good here as a sadistic lawman, gloating in his heavy-handed violence and building himself a home in his spare time; Morgan Freeman appears in his ascendancy to fame, doing the kind of quiet dignity that he's so adept at. Eastwood also finds time to give strong roles to the likes of Richard Harris, although I could have done without Saul Rubinek's comical character.In the end, though, it's the script that makes this the masterpiece which it is. Eschewing the action formula for a quiet contemplation of western themes, it really says everything there is to say about this particular genre of film-making. It says something about UNFORGIVEN that every Hollywood western that's come along since has felt more than a little passé.",reflective contemplative revenge western is real treat,theres little say about this supreme western that hasnt been said already but ill try anyway its spellbinding film nothing like what youd expect rest eastwoods career this turns out be both ode dying genre central characters are old regretful film with powerful anti violence moral eastwood is at top his game both terms his screen presence never has he played such fragile human character western as director this is one most beautiful westerns ive ever seen with extraordinary lovely landscape shots which look fine when played high definition plot is fairly slow laced with moments shocking violence none more so than opening sequence which cowboy slices up prostitutes face with his knife its this moment brutality that sets off chain plot eventually culminating well remembered showdown between our ageing hero well just about everybody else gene hackman is particularly good here as sadistic lawman gloating his heavy handed violence building himself home his spare time morgan freeman appears his ascendancy fame doing kind quiet dignity that hes so adept at eastwood also finds time give strong roles likes richard harris although i could have done without saul rubineks comical character end though its script that makes this masterpiece which it is eschewing action formula quiet contemplation western themes it really says everything there is say about this particular genre film making it says something about unforgiven that every hollywood western thats come along since has felt more than little pass,0.4775213675213675,0.13807692307692307,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9,Notoriously Vicious And Intemperate Disposition,"With all the fine westerns that have come out in the history of film, Unforgiven is only the third one to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Following in the steps of Cimarron and Dances With Wolves, Unforgiven finally got Clint Eastwood the Oscar recognition for one of film's great icons. It's also one nasty and uncompromising look at the old west with people neither all good or all bad, usually reacting to the time and circumstances they're in. And the reputations they've had built for them by the various dime novelists whose work littered the land during the last half of the 19th century.A former border raider back in the wild days of the Civil War, Clint Eastwood's William Munny is our protagonist. He gave all that up and got married, fathered two kids and has been living peaceful and quiet as a farmer. He's also given up the drink, because it was demon rum which helped him overcome a whole lot of inhibitions about violence.But a few states over, a cowboy being told about his shortcomings from one of the town tarts, decided to cut her up. After doing so, he fled to the safety of the ranch he works for. Town Marshal Gene Hackman, also a violent man in the past tries to play the whole thing down. But the women raise a bounty in the only way they know how to take vengeance on behalf of a colleague. One of the great examples of women's liberation in the old west.News of it is carried to Eastwood by old friend Morgan Freeman. Reluctantly because he does need the money, Eastwood, Freeman and young gun Jaimz Woolvett decide to go after it.Gene Hackman won his second Oscar to go with his one for Best Actor in The French Connection. His town marshal is another uncommonly vicious man who now that he is on the side of 'law and order' has some grand pretensions about himself. It's also a fascinating look inside the character of someone like Wild Bill Hickok or Wyatt Earp and what it probably took to keep 'law and order' in frontier towns. It was a well earned Best Supporting Actor performance.Part of the reason some folks in frontier America have the legendary reputations they do is the fact of those dime novels I mentioned before. Ned Buntline, the leading purveyor of this literature made the reputations that so many frontier icons have today. One of the most interesting roles in the film is that of Saul Rubinek who is such a novelist.When we first meet Rubinek he's traveling with English Bob, played by Richard Harris in another fine performance. Hackman who knows of him and knows he killed a friend of his way back when, takes it on himself to expose and thoroughly humiliate Harris. He then takes on Rubinek as his scribe because he fancies the kind of reputation that Earp, Hickok, and Bill Cody et al are now enjoying.Of course in the end when Clint delivers a bloody reprisal to one and all, Rubinek who now has seen such a scene of death and destruction that is having a lot of second thoughts about his profession. It's my favorite role in Unforgiven.Unforgiven in addition to Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Hackman got Clint Eastwood his first Oscar in the Best Director category. He's won two of them now also for Million Dollar Baby. He was up in the Best Actor category, but lost to Al Pacino for Scent Of Mystery. Unforgiven won its fourth Oscar in the Editing category.Unforgiven isn't John Wayne's kind of west, but it's a fitting climax for Clint Eastwood in the genre that launched his career. I don't think it's an accident he's not done another.",notoriously vicious intemperate disposition,with all fine westerns that have come out history film unforgiven is only third one win academy award best picture following steps cimarron dances with wolves unforgiven finally got clint eastwood oscar recognition one films great icons its also one nasty uncompromising look at old west with people neither all good or all bad usually reacting time circumstances theyre reputations theyve had built them by various dime novelists whose work littered land during last half 19th century former border raider back wild days civil war clint eastwoods william munny is our protagonist he gave all that up got married fathered two kids has been living peaceful quiet as farmer hes also given up drink because it was demon rum which helped him overcome whole lot inhibitions about violence but few states over cowboy being told about his shortcomings one town tarts decided cut her up after doing so he fled safety ranch he works town marshal gene hackman also violent man past tries play whole thing down but women raise bounty only way they know how take vengeance behalf colleague one great examples womens liberation old west news it is carried eastwood by old friend morgan freeman reluctantly because he does need money eastwood freeman young gun jaimz woolvett decide go after it gene hackman won his second oscar go with his one best actor french connection his town marshal is another uncommonly vicious man who now that he is side law order has some grand pretensions about himself its also fascinating look inside character someone like wild bill hickok or wyatt earp what it probably took keep law order frontier towns it was well earned best supporting actor performance part reason some folks frontier america have legendary reputations they do is fact those dime novels i mentioned before ned buntline leading purveyor this literature made reputations that so many frontier icons have today one most interesting roles film is that saul rubinek who is such novelist when we first meet rubinek hes traveling with english bob played by richard harris another fine performance hackman who knows him knows he killed friend his way back when takes it himself expose thoroughly humiliate harris he then takes rubinek as his scribe because he fancies kind reputation that earp hickok bill cody et al are now enjoying course end when clint delivers bloody reprisal one all rubinek who now has seen such scene death destruction that is having lot second thoughts about his profession its my favorite role unforgiven unforgiven addition best picture best supporting actor hackman got clint eastwood his first oscar best director category hes won two them now also million dollar baby he was up best actor category but lost al pacino scent mystery unforgiven won its fourth oscar editing category unforgiven isnt john waynes kind west but its fitting climax clint eastwood genre that launched his career i dont think its accident hes not done another,0.44041867954911434,0.19146537842190015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9,Eastwood & Hackman shine,"Unforgiven is about as far from the fantasy mythos of A Fistful of Dollars as Clint Eastwood could get. No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to 'play fair' and face the enemy on even terms. If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.Eastwood puts in an astonishing performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife. Now, desperately trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the bounty offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom's number has been savagely beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife's memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature. Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film's stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.One of the greatest Westerns ever made? Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary. In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man. Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.",eastwood hackman shine,unforgiven is about as far fantasy mythos fistful dollars as clint eastwood could get no pin point accuracy with 19th century technology no desire play fair face enemy even terms if you can shoot him back then do it eastwood puts astonishing performance as retired killer muny saved his life thievery murder by his late wife now desperately trying support his children with no income he is tempted back his killing ways by bounty offered by women brothel one whoms number has been savagely beaten disfigured by drunken ranch hand film follows eastwood as he wrestles with his desire honour his wifes memory his need feed his children by returning killer that he fears is his true nature meanwhile word bounty has spread events spiral out control as sheriff gene hackman deals with guns hire that ride into town while all supporting cast are excellent gene hackmans oscar winning performance even manages eclipse eastwoods as brutal sheriff he beats one bounty hunters english bob richard harris almost death then explains journalist one films stand out scenes how men like he muny are so successful at killing mood moves light banter life threatening seriousness back again with just one move his head one greatest westerns ever made certainly although fact its western is really secondary truth its tale nature evil nature man eastwood uses gap between western myth reality as arena play out his story does so with consummate style,0.5944099378881987,0.15822981366459626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10,"In my opinion, Clint Eastwood's best movie...","Not only that but one of the best of the western genre. Unforgiven is simply brilliant. Clint Eastwood's direction is superb, and he is also exemplary in a suitably world-weary role. There is also some brilliant support playing, not only from Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, but also especially from Gene Hackman.Unforgiven is also beautifully shot. The cinematography is wonderfully dark and autumnal, and the scenery and production values are breathtaking. The story is ceaselessly compelling and while Eastwood clearly dedicated the film to the likes of Sergio Leone, he replaces brutality with a greater emphasis on character and cause and effect, and doing that Eastwood successfully redefines the genre.There is also a wonderful script that does a fine job giving credibility to the characters.

9,Amazingly Thought-Provoking on How Much a Life is Worth and the Inner Workings of a Man With a Regrettable Past.,"In 1992, Clint Eastwood created the last and greatest western; 'Unforgiven'. A tribute to the previous masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.Eastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guilt-filled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the town, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax, welcoming back a sort of 'Man With No Name' character to the genre.William Munny is a cold-blooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But, all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn't die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now, but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man, of which deserved it, he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination, he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless (see Tarantino or Scorsese films) and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn't worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken, it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide (Munny and Little Bill) or kills someone and calls it a day (Kid and Logan), because they can't bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thought-provoking thing for me personally, ever.Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually, its the greatest film of all-time. It shows how violent it was back then, and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone's 'Man With No Name' films (though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land). But, Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol; which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are, either cowards or killers. The choice of word 'coward' is to say that they should be killers, as that is apparently what a man is (an exaggeration) as most westerns glorify violence, but the men can't handle it.Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way; like when asked if he killed women and children he replied ""I've killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another, and I'm here to kill you"". He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade, the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.The script, written by David Webb Peoples, buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years, even being rejected by some of the cast, before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view, yet also being extremely raw. The score, though not used often is very refreshing and moving.'Unforgiven' is an unforgettable look on life, man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the '90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.9/10",amazingly thought provoking how much life is worth inner workings man with regrettable past,1992 clint eastwood created last greatest western unforgiven tribute previous masters sergio leone don siegel who died within mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece eastwood stars as william munny retired gunslinger with guilt filled past he lives alone with his two children grave his young wife outside one day young cowboy schofield kid jaimz woolvett comes need his service hunt down some men who cut up whore william reluctantly accepts with help ned logan morgan freeman they work together track down criminals meanwhile sheriff town little bill daggett gene hackman is also looking them this then leads bloody showdown climax welcoming back sort man with no name character genre william munny is cold blooded killer schofield kid wants be one but all murders sins munny used commit has affected him extraordinary way he takes no hesitation killing climax he just walks past man he shot who didnt die shoots him dead it may sound like nothing now but he just took life no apparent reason when kid kills his first man which deserved it he hesitates this is kid who is so eager kill people as he thinks it will make him man but after assassination he breaks down he realized what he had done he had wiped another man earth munny does it with ease so does little bill he is violent brutal cop who uses torture get what he wants prisoners logan also finds it hard take lives film studies how much life is worth sometimes it is worthless see tarantino or scorsese films sometimes it is major feature usually film only does one unforgiven does both life isnt worth same amount each person when life is taken it is killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him whether he just lets it slide munny little bill or kills someone calls it day kid logan because they cant bring themselves forgetting it this is most thought provoking thing me personally ever unforgiven my opinion is greatest western actually its greatest film all time it shows how violent it was back then fact everybody was beaten it is more realistic than any leones man with no name films though i will admit they were set sort fantasy land but munny is not proud his violent nature he blames it alcohol which his wife persuaded him quit explain why he also gave up being murderer film shows cowboys as they really are either cowards or killers choice word coward is say that they should be killers as that is apparently what man is exaggeration as most westerns glorify violence but men cant handle it clint eastwood did amazing job as william munny he showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting it shameful way like when asked if he killed women children he replied ive killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another im here kill you he even admits that he will meet little bill hell gene hackman delivers one greatest performances decade tension he makes is incredible woolvett freeman remain solid above average performances throughout script written by david webb peoples buzzed around hollywood nearly 20 years even being rejected by some cast before eastwood picked it up clint eastwood deserved his oscar best direction plot flowed fluently with some surprises memorable lines instant classic cinematography is much different that good bad ugly or others westerns eastwood appeared it is much cleaner crisp view yet also being extremely raw score though not used often is very refreshing moving unforgiven is unforgettable look life man real west one most powerful films 90s true triumph exploring important morals do not miss it 9 10,0.48052972668357274,0.061520850943927875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10,Incredible!,"For me, it is the greatest Revisionist Western ever made. As per Westerns in general, this is my second most favorite Western of all times, the first one being (obviously) ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" (1966). Besides this, this movie is one of the most worthy ""Best Picture"" recipient as well as one of the most worthy ""Best Director"" recipient in the history of Academy Awards.Good : As per Clint Eastwood's direction goes, it could've never been better. In fact, this is the best of Eastwood as a director and one of his bests as an actor, in particular, a Western role. Easily my most favorite Eastwood film. Clint is yet to make a bad Western. He knows how to make Westerns incredible. And in his (supposedly) final Western, both as a director and as an actor, he proves it. This movie has whatever a great Revisionist Western needs. You got some beautiful cinematography of the country side. Perhaps, the most beautiful views of the country side I have ever seen in a Western. All the main characters, William Munny, Ned Logan, Schofield Kid and Little Bill were very good. Little Bill was a very good villain and Will Munny was an incredible lead. Throughout the film, you can see people talking about Will's past time and again. They really helps you to get behind him. You can see the radical changes in him, after all that happened with him in the past 11 years. You can see his compassion and you'll definitely love the way he accepts that he's being evened for all the sins he's committed. And in the entire film, you get to see him feeling guilty for everything and his great transformation. Ned and Schofield Kid provide a very good support to the story, with unique characterizations of their own. Ned is in the same condition as Will is, but doesn't feel too guilty. The kid is just a moron who acts as if he is cool. I am not gonna say anything more about them, but these stuffs are played out very well in the film. Also, Little Bill isn't just your typical bad guy. What he does is pure evil, but he has got his own point of view. He isn't doing the stuff he does because a guy told him to! He did it because he hates assassins and murderers and all the ""low lives"". Also, he's a badass, and a whole plotline is there to show that. You hate him, but he's not all wrong either. Even we know about Skinny a lot from the first scene he is introduced. He is just a supporting character with a secondary role. Even he doesn't get overshadowed. Alice and Delilah also stand out, too. It wasn't too necessary to the story to point out how humble Delilah was, and the movie would've been completely good, as it didn't really contribute to the story. But that little touch in the character, gave the movie a slightly different and a better vibe. There are some clichéd plot points, but they can be easily given a pass because of the flow and pacing of the story. You get attached to every character in the scene, feel their emotions, feel sad if someone gets killed, horrified when someone is being tortured, and some tension building when Ned and Kid mess with each other. You feel what the characters are feeling, especially William Munny. There are some scenes that are mere plot devices and might have felt quite forced. But Eastwood directed it so cleverly that it doesn't even feel like happening. In the end, the transition to a particular plot device was really smooth and totally unforced. It feels more like a compulsion to the character. Also, notorious and sadistic, or not, the way that moment ends, does feel right. We get the badass Clint Eastwood we have loved from previous Westerns, and an epic line before he kills. Performances - incredible! Clint Eastwood embraces the character of William Munny and gives a powerful performance. Gene Hackman does a complete justice to the character of Little Bill. Jaimz Woolvett and Morgan Freeman give some of the most underrated and overlooked performances of all times. Hell, I can't even stop talking about this movie without praising the jobs of Frances Fisher, Anthony James and Anna Levine in the limited screen time they were given. You'd definitely know it's a great film, when you note that it was one of the inspirations for ""Logan"" (2017) - a superhero film. Not just a superhero film, but a completely different kind of a film in the X-Men franchise. And Logan itself was an incredible film for most of the part. This movie is one of the great ""hero with a guilt"" story. You get invested in every scene and every major characterization of the movie. Even the musical score is great and underappreciated. It is one of those rare films which deserves every Oscar it won.Conclusion : It may not hold up with Sergio Leone's classic Westerns, but is an incredible film in its own right. We get Eastwood being humble and a badass in his final Western role in perhaps the greatest Revisionist Western of all times.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+",incredible,me it is greatest revisionist western ever made as per westerns general this is my second most favorite western all times first one being obviously good bad ugly 1966 besides this this movie is one most worthy best picture recipient as well as one most worthy best director recipient history academy awards good as per clint eastwoods direction goes it couldve never been better fact this is best eastwood as director one his bests as actor particular western role easily my most favorite eastwood film clint is yet make bad western he knows how make westerns incredible his supposedly final western both as director as actor he proves it this movie has whatever great revisionist western needs you got some beautiful cinematography country side perhaps most beautiful views country side i have ever seen western all main characters william munny ned logan schofield kid little bill were very good little bill was very good villain will munny was incredible lead throughout film you can see people talking about wills past time again they really helps you get behind him you can see radical changes him after all that happened with him past 11 years you can see his compassion youll definitely love way he accepts that hes being evened all sins hes committed entire film you get see him feeling guilty everything his great transformation ned schofield kid provide very good support story with unique characterizations their own ned is same condition as will is but doesnt feel too guilty kid is just moron who acts as if he is cool i am not gonna say anything more about them but these stuffs are played out very well film also little bill isnt just your typical bad guy what he does is pure evil but he has got his own point view he isnt doing stuff he does because guy told him he did it because he hates assassins murderers all low lives also hes badass whole plotline is there show that you hate him but hes not all wrong either even we know about skinny lot first scene he is introduced he is just supporting character with secondary role even he doesnt get overshadowed alice delilah also stand out too it wasnt too necessary story point out how humble delilah was movie wouldve been completely good as it didnt really contribute story but that little touch character gave movie slightly different better vibe there are some clich d plot points but they can be easily given pass because flow pacing story you get attached every character scene feel their emotions feel sad if someone gets killed horrified when someone is being tortured some tension building when ned kid mess with each other you feel what characters are feeling especially william munny there are some scenes that are mere plot devices might have felt quite forced but eastwood directed it so cleverly that it doesnt even feel like happening end transition particular plot device was really smooth totally unforced it feels more like compulsion character also notorious sadistic or not way that moment ends does feel right we get badass clint eastwood we have loved previous westerns epic line before he kills performances incredible clint eastwood embraces character william munny gives powerful performance gene hackman does complete justice character little bill jaimz woolvett morgan freeman give some most underrated overlooked performances all times hell i cant even stop talking about this movie without praising jobs frances fisher anthony james anna levine limited screen time they were given youd definitely know its great film when you note that it was one inspirations logan 2017 superhero film not just superhero film but completely different kind film x men franchise logan itself was incredible film most part this movie is one great hero with guilt story you get invested every scene every major characterization movie even musical score is great underappreciated it is one those rare films which deserves every oscar it won conclusion it may not hold up with sergio leones classic westerns but is incredible film its own right we get eastwood being humble badass his final western role perhaps greatest revisionist western all times rating score absolute 10 10grade,0.5671044546851001,0.21124423963133643,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,"""I ain't like that anymore, Kid.""","There's a compelling scene in the movie where the scarred whore Delilah (Anna Levine) offers William Munny (Clint Eastwood) a 'free one', not from herself, but from one of the other girls. Munny's response has to do with the scars they both carry as a burden in their lives. For one brief moment, Delilah takes comfort in the fact that someone finds her beautiful after the savage attack that left her disfigured, and Munny realizes there are only just so many things he can hang on to before reverting back to his true nature, a grim, cold hearted killer.It's fascinating to follow the rebirth of William Munny as a paid assassin after ten years of trying to scrape by as a pig farmer, the last two as a widower. The cocoon he weaved for himself to honor the memory of Claudia Feathers slowly unravels after that first conversation with the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). With friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) rounding out the trio, Munny is an unwilling participant in the reliving of his past, hazed even back then by the taint of alcohol and binge induced black outs. Would Schofield be amazed that Will escaped certain death by taking out not two, but three gunmen? The legend it seems, is greater than Munny is willing to allow. Had he heard his daughter's question, I wonder how he would have answered - ""Did Pa used to kill folks?"" I've spent some time thinking about the fact that Eastwood, in his early sixties, was portraying a character in the story in his mid thirties. All the math works, we see that his wife died at twenty nine, and his oldest son is about ten years old. He gave up his outlaw ways ten years earlier when he married. The reason I bring it up is because in 1950's ""The Gunfighter"", Gregory Peck's character felt over the hill and washed up at the age of thirty five. The harsh conditions of the late 1800's had a lot to do with the shortened life expectancy compared to today, and was exacerbated by one's choice of profession. When I saw the film when it first came out, I'm sure I chuckled when Will couldn't get on his horse the first time, but now I have a different view. Munny had become not only morally crippled, but physically crippled as well in an impoverished life with no hope of bettering his family.If one could write a thesis on the character of Will Munny, the same would be true of his antagonist in the story, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). The marshal of Big Whiskey establishes his complexity early in the story with the way he handles the situation with 'the hard workin' boys that was foolish'. Trading off a handful of horses for the scars on Delilah, Bill has a peculiar way of dealing with human lives. His savagery in dispatching English Bob (Richard Harris) has the effect of getting us ready for the assault on other would be takers of the whores' gold. ""I don't like assassins, or men of low character...""; Little Bill was not looking in the mirror when he said it.As the story progresses, it's interesting to examine how Munny's partners on the trail drop out when faced with the prospect of pre-meditated evil. Ned Logan's decision to leave was a bit surprising considering the past he had with Will, but necessary for the film's finale to explore Munny's loyalty to a friend. You had to know that Schofield's body count was a complete fabrication, once the reality of his face to face latrine assassination crept in. Munny's analysis said it best - ""Well you sure killed the hell outta that fella today"". I like to think that The Kid made it back to Sally Two Trees.The measure of justice one might be expecting on a first time viewing of the movie is prominently shaken at the climax when Munny calls out the owner of the saloon. It's a jarring prelude to the calculated shoot out so engrossing to writer Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). It's not about a hero exacting a measure of fair play, but the cold reality of giving back far more than anyone ever bargained for. If you were a resident of Big Whiskey, you believed Will Munny when he challenged them all to bury Ned Logan proper, or he'd return to kill their friends and burn their homes. The fury of Munny's vengeance lends further support to the Schofield Kid's most damning assessment of the once and present outlaw - ""I ain't like you Will"".",i aint like that anymore kid,theres compelling scene movie where scarred whore delilah anna levine offers william munny clint eastwood free one not herself but one other girls munnys response has do with scars they both carry as burden their lives one brief moment delilah takes comfort fact that someone finds her beautiful after savage attack that left her disfigured munny realizes there are only just so many things he can hang before reverting back his true nature grim cold hearted killer its fascinating follow rebirth william munny as paid assassin after ten years trying scrape by as pig farmer last two as widower cocoon he weaved himself honor memory claudia feathers slowly unravels after that first conversation with schofield kid jaimz woolvett with friend former partner ned logan morgan freeman rounding out trio munny is unwilling participant reliving his past hazed even back then by taint alcohol binge induced black outs would schofield be amazed that will escaped certain death by taking out not two but three gunmen legend it seems is greater than munny is willing allow had he heard his daughters question i wonder how he would have answered did pa used kill folks ive spent some time thinking about fact that eastwood his early sixties was portraying character story his mid thirties all math works we see that his wife died at twenty nine his oldest son is about ten years old he gave up his outlaw ways ten years earlier when he married reason i bring it up is because 1950s gunfighter gregory pecks character felt over hill washed up at age thirty five harsh conditions late 1800s had lot do with shortened life expectancy compared today was exacerbated by ones choice profession when i saw film when it first came out im sure i chuckled when will couldnt get his horse first time but now i have different view munny had become not only morally crippled but physically crippled as well impoverished life with no hope bettering his family if one could write thesis character will munny same would be true his antagonist story little bill daggett gene hackman marshal big whiskey establishes his complexity early story with way he handles situation with hard workin boys that was foolish trading off handful horses scars delilah bill has peculiar way dealing with human lives his savagery dispatching english bob richard harris has effect getting us ready assault other would be takers whores gold i dont like assassins or men low character little bill was not looking mirror when he said it as story progresses its interesting examine how munnys partners trail drop out when faced with prospect pre meditated evil ned logans decision leave was bit surprising considering past he had with will but necessary films finale explore munnys loyalty friend you had know that schofields body count was complete fabrication once reality his face face latrine assassination crept munnys analysis said it best well you sure killed hell outta that fella today i like think that kid made it back sally two trees measure justice one might be expecting first time viewing movie is prominently shaken at climax when munny calls out owner saloon its jarring prelude calculated shoot out so engrossing writer beauchamp saul rubinek its not about hero exacting measure fair play but cold reality giving back far more than anyone ever bargained if you were resident big whiskey you believed will munny when he challenged them all bury ned logan proper or hed return kill their friends burn their homes fury munnys vengeance lends further support schofield kids most damning assessment once present outlaw i aint like you will,0.42955060812203677,0.08546691403834261,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8,Sickness and Death,"I just felt awful after seeing this film. I had that same feeling after watching Taxi Driver and Deliverance. There is never a bright light anywhere. We begin with Eastwood's character visiting his wife's grave. He is a sad, defeated man. His life has been given over to violence and the one person who has salvaged some of it is now dead. Enter a young gunslinger who doesn't know anything about killing and what is involved in it. He is on his way to kill a couple cowboys who were responsible for the maiming of a prostitute. Eastwood falls to the need to feed his little children because his hogs are sick and bad times are on the way. He engages his old friend played by Morgan Freeman and get the bunch of them in way over their heads. If there is a more complete villain than Gene Hackman in all of film, I'm not sure who it is. He is killing machine who is in control of his empire. He lives on the fear of others. He brutalizes people and then grins. He is working on a house, hoping to sit down and enjoy the sunsets at some point. But you don't mess with him. Everyone understands that and they fall in line. Ultimately this movie is about the price of killing. Despite his declining years, Eastwood has had a stomach full of it and when his friend is brutalized by Hackman, well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. It's just that it brings on the darkest feelings in the soul. Maybe that's the point.",sickness death,i just felt awful after seeing this film i had that same feeling after watching taxi driver deliverance there is never bright light anywhere we begin with eastwoods character visiting his wifes grave he is sad defeated man his life has been given over violence one person who has salvaged some it is now dead enter young gunslinger who doesnt know anything about killing what is involved it he is his way kill couple cowboys who were responsible maiming prostitute eastwood falls need feed his little children because his hogs are sick bad times are way he engages his old friend played by morgan freeman get bunch them way over their heads if there is more complete villain than gene hackman all film im not sure who it is he is killing machine who is control his empire he lives fear others he brutalizes people then grins he is working house hoping sit down enjoy sunsets at some point but you dont mess with him everyone understands that they fall line ultimately this movie is about price killing despite his declining years eastwood has had stomach full it when his friend is brutalized by hackman well mans gotta do what mans gotta do its just that it brings darkest feelings soul maybe thats point,0.5750793650793653,-0.10411706349206347,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,Eastwood's Greatest Western!,"""Unforgiven"" is arguably Producer/Director/Star Clint Eastwood's best western and perhaps his best film overall. It could be very well his last western (I hope not), and if it is he certainly went out on top.In the town of Big Whiskey a couple of cowboys are being ""entertained"" by the ladies of the local saloon. Suddenly one of the girls Delilah (Anna Thomson) is attacked by one of the men and is cut up and scarred for life. When sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett (Gene Hackman) refuses to suitably punish the men, the ""ladies"" led by Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher) pool their funds and post a reward of $1,000 to anyone who will hunt down and kill these men.Word of the reward reaches former gunfighter William Munny (Eastwood) who is now a widowed pig farmer with two kids, when a cocky young kid called The Schofield kid rides up to his farm and proposes that they join up as partners. Munny reluctantly agrees and enlists his former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join in.Word of the reward has also reached other bounty hunters like English Bob (Richard Harris) who arrives in Big Whiskey first. Realizing that he has to discourage such predators, Little Bill brutally beats up the gunfighter and drives him out of town. In the process Little Bill meets a pulp fiction writer named Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) who is writing stories about the gunfighters of the west. Little Bill is only too happy to provide him with such stories.Meanwhile the unholy trio arrive in Big Whiskey. Little Bill spots Munny in the saloon while the Kid and Ned are being ""entertained"" upstairs. Munny has become ill during the trip and Little Bill takes advantage and savagely beats him. The others rescue Munny and take him to safety where the ""girls"" nurse him back to health. The trio then hunt down and kill the two cowboys during which Ned loses his stomach for such killings and starts out for home.Ned is captured by the murdered men's friends and is brought into town where he is ""questioned"" by Little Bill to the extent that he is killed. Munny who had mellowed during his marriage, loses it, arms himself and heads into town for a showdown where..........""Unforgiven"" was honored with several Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman. Eastwood's performance as the tragic Munny was also of Oscar calorie.Its hard to find a hero in this film. Eastwood, Freeman and Woolvett are after all, bounty hunters. By his own admission William Munny describes himself as someone who has killed women and children and just about everything that walks in his lifetime. Hackman's character has good intentions in discouraging the gunfighters but cannot control his hair trigger temper. The only sympathetic characters are the saloon girls as they try to find justice for their dishonored colleague.A great western!

10,Possibly Clint Eastward's most impressive western,"After a couple of drunken cowboys cut up a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming Sheriff 'Little Bill' Daggett decrees that they must give the owner of the brothel a few horses as compensation for lost earnings... the other women do not think this is enough so combine their money and let it be known that they will pay $1,000 to anybody who kills the cowboys. A young man calling himself the 'Schofield Kid' hears of this and approaches retired gunslinger and general ne'er-do-well William Munny proposing that they kill the cowboys for the reward. Munny has renounced his wicked past, thanks to his late wife, but needs the money to raise his two children so reluctantly accepts. Along the way he picks up his old partner Ned Logan.In the mythology of the west the sheriff stood up for the downtrodden, the heroes didn't draw first and they certainly didn't have difficulty getting on a horse! That is somewhat different here; our hero was certainly a very bad man in his youth and while he is now a more moral man desperation leads him to kill again. The way the myth and the reality differ are perfectly illustrated during a conversation between Little Bill and a writer working on the biography of a gunslinger when Bill explains what really happened during one particularly famous shootout. We see the West as a cruel place where might is right and the good don't always win. Our 'heroes' don't call out the villains; they ambush them when they least expect it. The story is well presented with Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman doing great jobs as old gunmen Munny and Logan. Gene Hackman is equally impressive as Little Bill. There a decent amount of action and even a few genuinely funny moments.

10,How the west was,"This film was a revelation, a western that DOESN'T LIE. The whole theme stripping away the mythology our culture has built around the west, scraping it away like the finish on a mirror and reveling the ugliness AND the humanity beneath. I was utterly convinced, both by the portrayal of the period and the reality of the characters. A large focus was its treatment of the subject of killing. The movie SHOWS US what it is like to kill a man, a stark stark contrast to the casual attitude taken by so many other westerns. We see what we already know, wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren't capable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that in spite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil still existed then as now, and every now and then, true heroism.",how west was,this film was revelation western that doesnt lie whole theme stripping away mythology our culture has built around west scraping it away like finish mirror reveling ugliness humanity beneath i was utterly convinced both by portrayal period reality characters large focus was its treatment subject killing movie shows us what it is like kill man stark stark contrast casual attitude taken by so many other westerns we see what we already know wild west or no that killing is something that most people just arent capable yet character william munny shows us that spite mundanity he embodies his later life true evil still existed then as now every now then true heroism,0.5057539682539683,-0.004298941798941814,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8,'A Man With No Name' Becomes 'A Man With A Real Story'.,"Clint Eastwood's storytelling gives the western genre one of its most sublime story's. Gone is the trademark mysterious hero and in its place is an ex gunman who made his peace when he met his wife. Eastwood has transcended traditional entertainment to storytelling craftsmanship. He delivers rich characters with deep rooted problems inextricably linked to the villains of the story. Refusing to wither and die away, style has been perfectly adapted with age thus ensuring his maturation into a true Hollywood legend.Besides his now distinctive storytelling, there are numerous factors that make this a landmark Western. The ensemble cast could not have been stronger and there were no weak performances. The soundtrack accentuates the intended atmosphere of the director. A single detracting factor I could find only just qualifies as such. Munny's whimsical lines seemed a little contrived at times. They droned on like pale attempts to capture the Western era. But this is a consequence of the fact that they were more to do with the character of William Munny. He is after all a reformed killer with a now passive approach to people. Given this fact and also that it may have been distracting since it was so out of sync with what we are used to seeing from Eastwood, I still have to list it as a demerit on the account it slightly jerked me out of the story.Hollywood producers have to satisfy audience preferences if investments are going to accrue profits. It is the nature of the beast. The action and more specifically the Western genre will stick to tried and tested formulas in order to guarantee audience acceptance. But every so often you get people who as a natural consequence of their unique character appeal are able to deliver a story that is outside these understandably restrictive boundaries. Eastwood is a cool individualist who normally plays characters who are not team players and do it their own way. His own way this time is to give the western genre a real story oozing characterization. A sort of ballad for the bad guy.The ballads tune provides the story with a sad, introspective mood, within the opening and closing scenes. The opening scene depicts Munny in his new found life. He is cured of his wicked ways, helped by his dear, departed wife. But men are not willing to forgive or forget his monstrous deeds and in the final scenes he is who he has to be. Such is the sorrowful life of William Munny.Westerns are typified by clearly defined goodies and baddies, but this is definitely not the case here. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed killers who find circumstances drawing them once again to their evil ways. But the older and wiser men now realize the value of life and come face to face with their troubled consciences. This is unlike their naïve, young partner who is attracted to the bravado image of the killer and relishes taking a man's life. This moral issue is virtually taboo for the classic western which glamorizes the lawlessness and the hero attraction of the gunslinger. This is also why in my view no-one besides Eastwood should have handled this movie.Then we have the juiciest character of the movie superbly played by Gene Hackman worthy of the weight of every micro granule of his Oscar. He is the epitome of every hard-line lawman that ever was. The misguidance of the so called righteously empowered, swinging the hammer against evil for good. Hackman must have salivated when he read the script since there was obvious relish in his performance. All the better for the movie, and of course for Eastwood at the Oscars. By far the best performance and the others were good further underlining the talent of the man.The antagonist of the movie is almost always the most complex and thus most interesting to analyze. His vain attempts at carpentry are his way of trying to appear to be a good man. There is purity in building ones own home and it is this wholesomeness that he wishes to capture. In that way his fellow citizens will see him as a simple man only wanting to lead a righteous life. But his inability as a carpenter is indicative of his depravity. He cannot be a good man. The source of his drive is anger and hatred. It is through this failing that we realize he cannot escape who he is.Indeed it was not only the power of the script that gave the audience a spellbinding climax, but the talents of the actors. The actors' characterizations deliver the audience a spellbinding climax. It is only through Hackman's performance that we not only acknowledge his ending as inevitable, but also as deserving. We saw him as a man who virtually thought that he was righteously empowered to rid the earth of Munny and his kind What he thought was an honorable task was one rather of abuse and suppression. He became the baddie in the eyes of the audience and it is he who the audience wants to see justice served upon. Munny was so weak throughout the movie that the eruption of his evil ways captured the interest of the audience. He transformed into the Eastwood of old  the anti hero with a far more malevolent presence. Never could we have sensed this hatred and evil that we now see in William Munny. It is now that the frivolity of his mannerisms that I touched on in the beginning adds to the story as it helps to accentuate the turn in character. He is now only a killer, in it neither for money or fame as the writer nearly finds out to his tragic detriment.Those who have only seen his Westerns of old or the 'Dirty Harry' movies may enter the cinema with expectations of such like will either be disappointed or pleasantly surprised. It is the atypical western and an unfamiliar portrayal by Eastwood. But I believe that most people will have the latter reaction. The differences are their strengths helped by the fact that it was a superbly crafted movie with a meaningful story and thought provoking lessons for our heroes and villains. Eastwood was directly suited to the roles that we identify him with, but it is exactly because of this suitability that he eases into the role of Munny. No mellowing with age, no identification with the mainstream, he has always done it his way, and he is so good that any way could be his way.",man with no name becomes man with real story,clint

9,Requiem for a Western,"Unforgiven will always be the last Western. No matter what comes after it, Tombstone, The Missing, or Wyatt Erp, Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns, but the spirit of Unforgiven, from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave, to the end which returns there, is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant, much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a story-form is over, it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy, it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers. Clint Eastwood presents to the audience the most distorted configuration of the western; the most disfigured example of a genre whose classical conventions were untouchable and sacrosanct. We have no heroes and no villains, only a protagonist and a puffed up sheriff who thinks he's doing the right thing (and does in fact have more moral vision than the dried out killer) The movie itself is riddled with identity crises, the killer has turned into a farmer and a father, the young gunslinger is a virgin to bloodletting, the sheriff shows signs of being a slave master, and the innocent one gets it first and gets it dirty. Gone are the days of the Magnificent 7 where one rode into town, rallied the brave cowpokes with shiny silver pistols, and dispatched an easily recognizable enemy. Gone even are the days of Bonnie and Clyde where gunslingers were attractive and fascinating to the audience, exuding flair, charisma, and sparking the imagination. They were legends; William Munny is a sad bit of history. He is presented with deadpan honesty, not as a caricatured Tarantino assassin, or a misunderstood old man who has atoned for past wrongs. He is a broken human person, so lost along the moral frontier that the only compass he can grasp is more killing. Throughout the movie, we are reminded again and again of the stark contrast Unforgiven stands in to most other Westerns, by the obsequious scribe W. W. Beauchamp. He was the one who wrote the John Wayne stories, (the ones with ethical clarity at least). He was the one who coined phrases like ""high-noon"" and ""hot lead"". In Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood, takes apart the classical western narrative piece by piece allowing the audience to inspect the illusion. Characters like English Bob are unscrupulous frauds, ladies in distress are revenge bent whores, and old men really don't ever change for the better. They become that way when sensationalized by hack storytellers like Beauchamp. And when the only character materializes who seems to at least fit the description of gunslinger, Munny is so empty and hopelessly unheroic that we begin to reconcile ourselves to the end of the Western. Where else is there to go? We understand how the old stories were crafted thanks to the insider's view provided by Beauchamp, and what's left is a craggy faced cadaver with a dead wife, a dead friend, and two forgotten children.Every character within Unforgiven inhabits a gray zone that clouds the audiences's ability to easily categorize them as good or evil. We are forced to come to a more nuanced understanding of each as a human being with redeeming as well as corrupt qualities. The two cowboys committed a horrendous crime by knifing the prostitute, but did they deserve death, especially the young one, who didn't do the knifing, clearly felt remorse, and tried to make a peace offering? The whores are right to demand justice, but do they ever take into account the wishes of the victim, who if anything seems to strike some romantic sparks with the young cowboy. By the film's end, they are bloodthirsty sirens screaming at the body of the dead young cowboy. The sheriff Little Bill, compounds the opening crime by allowing it to go unpunished, but later exposes English Bob and tries to keep people from getting killed--(is he protecting unrepentant criminals, or is he allowing old wounds to heal?) And of course there's Munny himself, who won't pay to touch a woman but will kill prolifically for a purpose that is murky at best. By Unforgiven's end, the audience feels alienated from characters and message. The conclusion of William Munny's life is narrated by a cold, impersonal voice that labels him a scoundrel, but doesn't care enough to waste much breath condemning him.

9,A deeply melancholy and complex farewell to the west,"""You just shot an unarmed man!"" ""Well, he should have armed himself...""Plenty of films have tried to examine the human side of violence. This is especially appropriate for westerns, where very often rows of men are gunned down without a thought. 'Unforgiven' does better than most, but where this differs from other films is that at the end this whole theme is flipped around as the outlaw William Munny (Clint Eastwood) pulls of a truly legendary piece of shooting. This scene though only emphasises a great sense of failure for the characters, which for me is the most prominent theme of the film. For most characters, their failures are obvious, but I won't give too many examples for fear of spoiling it. Look at the way the trio of Munny, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) are slowly whittled down to just Munny, as the others realise that they just don't have what it takes to kill people anymore. Munny, although carrying out his task to the full, has equally failed in his attempt to reform himself as he proves to himself that he is not a pig farmer after all, but still the legendarily cold blooded killer from years ago. Westerns have had different ways of looking at violence. Leone looked at the build up. Peckinpah looked at the violence itself. Eastwood here looks at the moment after the violence and shows the heartbreaking consequences. Given this it is all the more shocking to see just how merciless and devastating Munny's furious assault on the saloon really is, with him shooting unarmed and wounded men just for the sake of completeness. There is a question of motivations though-before he was in it for the money, but when a personal element is added to the mix the results are volcanic. But this is no blaze of glory for Munny, but something that has to be done, and although treated in a callous way there is a sense that this will have consequences as far reaching as before. Munny has failed in his attempt to reform himself, and the purpose of his life is defeated. There is a suggestion that Munny is damned-there is a moment in the carnage where Munny stops for a drink. The scene is shot so that Eastwood appears to have no reflection the large mirror placed above the bar. More obvious is the following exchange between Munny and Sheriff Dagget (Gene Hackman):""See you in Hell, William Munny"" ""Yeah.""The way the climax is presented would be perhaps more appropriate for a more lurid western, with most shots going wild-far more shots are fired than are strictly necessary, in true action film tradition. This is just the point though, as the end is supposed to be at odds with the grittily realistic nature of the rest of the film. The end result is a powerful message powerfully put across.That is not to say that other westerns that do not necessarily share this sentiment (at least to this level) are less powerful-the theme of 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is equally strong and affecting, but the message is different and presented in a different way. 'Unforgiven' proves though, both to the writer W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) and to the audience, that there is a flip side to every story and a dark side to every man.",deeply melancholy complex farewell west,you just shot unarmed man well he should have armed himself plenty films have tried examine human side violence this is especially appropriate westerns where very often rows men are gunned down without thought unforgiven does better than most but where this differs other films is that at end this whole theme is flipped around as outlaw william munny clint eastwood pulls truly legendary piece shooting this scene though only emphasises great sense failure characters which me is most prominent theme film most characters their failures are obvious but i wont give too many examples fear spoiling it look at way trio munny ned logan morgan freeman schofield kid jaimz woolvett are slowly whittled down just munny as others realise that they just dont have what it takes kill people anymore munny although carrying out his task full has equally failed his attempt reform himself as he proves himself that he is not pig farmer after all but still legendarily cold blooded killer years ago westerns have had different ways looking at violence leone looked at build up peckinpah looked at violence itself eastwood here looks at moment after violence shows heartbreaking consequences given this it is all more shocking see just how merciless devastating munnys furious assault saloon really is with him shooting unarmed wounded men just sake completeness there is question motivations though before he was it money but when personal element is added mix results are volcanic but this is no blaze glory munny but something that has be done although treated callous way there is sense that this will have consequences as far reaching as before munny has failed his attempt reform himself purpose his life is defeated there is suggestion that munny is damned there is moment carnage where munny stops drink scene is shot so that eastwood appears have no reflection large mirror placed above bar more obvious is following exchange between munny sheriff dagget gene hackman see you hell william munny yeah way climax is presented would be perhaps more appropriate more lurid western with most shots going wild far more shots are fired than are strictly necessary true action film tradition this is just point though as end is supposed be at odds with grittily realistic nature rest film end result is powerful message powerfully put across that is not say that other westerns that do not necessarily share this sentiment at least this level are less powerful theme once upon time west is equally strong affecting but message is different presented different way unforgiven proves though both writer w w beauchamp saul rubinek audience that there is flip side every story dark side every man,0.5323759133282943,0.10983875031494074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,"Video Meliora Proboque, Deteriora Sequor","Contains SpoilersWho would have thought it? During the eighties, when the cinematic Western was at its lowest ebb, I doubt if anyone could have predicted not only that two of the best films of the early nineties would be Westerns but also that both would go on to win 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards, something that only one film from this genre had done previously. Yet that is exactly what happened. First came Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves', then Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. In both cases the star also acted as director. In Eastwood's case he was returning to the genre in which he first made his name; this was his first Western since 'Pale Rider' eight years earlier, which in turn was his first since 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' eight years before that.In 'Unforgiven', Eastwood plays a former gunfighter and robber named William Munny. (Pronounced 'Money'; there seems to be a tradition in Westerns of giving characters surnames which suggest they are for hire. There is Charlton Heston's Will Penny, and in 'Hannie Caulder' Robert Culp plays a hired gunman named Price). In his younger days, Munny was a hardened criminal, but he abandoned his life of crime when he married and settled down to life as a farmer. At the beginning of the film he is a widower, trying to raise two young children on his own. He is tempted to return to his former life, however, when he hears of a bounty of a thousand dollars which a group of prostitutes have placed on the heads of two drunken cowboys who badly injured one of their number by cutting her face with a knife. Abandoning his children to fend for themselves, Munny sets off to try and claim the money. He recruits a former associate, Ned Logan, and they are joined in their quest by a young man who calls himself the Schofield Kid and who is eager to make a name for himself as a gunfighter. They are not, however, the only men in search of the reward; an eccentric Englishman named English Bob, who has won himself an undeserved reputation as a Western hero, is also trying to track the cowboys down.The film reminded me of another Western, Michael Winner's 'Lawman' from the early seventies. That film has at its centre a sheriff whose inflexible determination to uphold the letter of the law at all costs leads to tragic consequences. 'Unforgiven' approaches the question of law enforcement from a slightly different angle. A key role is played by Gene Hackman's sheriff, Bill Daggett. Unlike that of Burt Lancaster's character in 'Lawman', Daggett's approach to the law is arbitrary and inconsistent. He can at times uphold the law with savage zeal. He is determined to protect the two cowboys from vigilantism, but in doing so, he transgresses the law himself, dealing out a brutal kicking to English Bob and an even more brutal flogging to Ned which results in the latter's death. Moreover, Daggett has himself created the need for vigilante justice by denying the full protection of the law to the injured prostitute. (The only punishment imposed upon the cowboys is an order to pay compensation to the woman's pimp for the loss of her economic value to him). There is, in fact, no character in the film who is entirely sympathetic. Munny starts the film as a reformed character, but slips back into his old ways when he is tempted by the prospect of money. He becomes, to borrow the title of another Eastwood Western, a man prepared to kill for a fistful of dollars. The lack of an easily identifiable hero is a common feature of modern 'revisionist' Westerns. Unlike some such Westerns, however, (Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' is a good example), 'Unforgiven' does not lack a moral centre. The Schofield Kid and English Bob have both been seduced by the dubious mythology of the West. The Kid, as his nickname suggests, is an inexperienced young man, but would like others to see him as a hardened and ruthless killer because he regards killing as something glamorous. Bob takes the credit for acts of violence which are wrongly attributed to him but which in reality he would be too cowardly to commit. Munny, for all his faults, can see Western mythology for what it is. Even when he is setting out to kill for money, he remains uncomfortably aware that ""to kill a man, to take all he has and all he's ever gonna have"" is a desperately serious business. In Ovid's phrase quoted in the title, he sees the better path, and approves, but follows the worse.The first half of the film can be slow-moving, but the second half is gripping, as the death of his friend Ned leads Munny to seek a bloody revenge. As with many Westerns, there are some attractive shots of the local scenery (the film is ostensibly set in Wyoming, but was actually shot in Canada), but the overall tone is a dark, claustrophobic one in keeping with the film's theme. Many scenes are set in gloomy interiors, whether bars, brothels or ranch-houses. One of the villains is actually shot dead in an outside lavatory. Of the two great Westerns of the early nineties, I would, marginally, prefer 'Dances with Wolves', which to my mind has a greater epic sweep, but by any other standard 'Unforgiven' is a very fine movie indeed, wonderfully acted, especially by Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood himself. (Freeman's role is a rare example of a black actor taking a leading role in a Western). It also asks some searching questions about the nature of law and justice, revenge and the roots of violence. It is interesting that Eastwood has not made any films in the Western genre since this one; perhaps he feels that it has set a standard that cannot be surpassed. 9/10",video meliora proboque deteriora

8,It is unforgiven if you haven't saw this movie yet,"Before Clint Eastwood was talking to chair, he was making good films like Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a uniquely different Western, at the time as it gave the audience the most realist example of how life was like in the Old West. A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, are looking for any bounty hunter to kill two cowboys who disfigured a woman's face. Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is wanting to keep the town peaceful and is against any bounty hunters coming in. Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. News about the reward reached Kansas, where a pig farmer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is approach by the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man to collect the reward. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, who able to hide facts with his eyes, and his facial expression. Much of the charm of the first part of the movie is how unlikely he could be a bounty hunter, but he go on to do it because he's raising two children alone and his farm is failing. On the way, Munny's friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) joins in for the search of the cowboys. They weren't the first to make it to the town. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies savagely beat Bob, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. When Logan and Munny got the chance—they were able to kill one of the cowboy. It becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan tries to return home. Logan gets captured by the Sheriff's men and this is where the story gets intense. This is where we see how bad-ass Munny is. David Webb Peoples, adapter of both Twelve Monkeys and Blade Runner, wrote the screenplay. He wrote when Munny drinks whiskey, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The audience does truly find out whom Munny really about in the last ending scene. That was where it shined. The beat up up, pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences to take a drink and the monster erupted with horrific consequences. Mr. Hyde took a lot of prodding but his reputation was well founded and could been worse if he was the Hyde that shed all humanity. He still had a foot in his human side. There is a film noir feel to the film full of ambiguity and atmosphere. The dark Western deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence, deep and steeped in morality. It was a perfect fit, hand for a glove. The screenplay is unique, written for Eastwood to direct. Still, the film realism is kind of distracting and depressing. It tends to break up the myth of the West. Unforgiven is a film that doesn't hold a candle to Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollars Trilogy in any way. Certainly, it's a classic Western, regardless of it not following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting! Gene Hackman's acting is keyed to the film to work. The Sheriff was right. The only way to handle real criminals is to show them you are meaner and more ruthless than they are. Hackman did a perfect job of demonstrating the ""style' that all good law enforcement people ""should"" follow to actually get the job done effectively. Today's soft, limp wrist, politically correct cops pay a very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn and make friends with bad guys; and the politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer. It finds it kind of surreal that Little Bill is painted the villain of the film. Willy tried to be a family man, Bill wanted to build a house. Bill killed one man (a mercenary) and Willy Munny killed six (most of them innocents). Any way you look at it there were no heroes in this film. Clint's acting is just bar none, and it is a movie that has characters so compelling, it makes you wonder about the nature of humanity. Everybody soon learns a harsh lesson about the price of vindictive bloodshed and the malleability of ideas like ""justice.""",it is unforgiven if you havent saw this movie yet,before clint eastwood was talking chair he was making good films like unforgiven unforgiven is uniquely different western at time as it gave audience most realist example how life was like old west group prostitutes big whiskey wyoming are looking any bounty hunter kill two cowboys who disfigured womans face sheriff little bill daggett gene hackman is wanting keep town peaceful is against any bounty hunters coming little bill had given two men leniency despite their crime news about reward reached kansas where pig farmer william munny clint eastwood is approach by schofield kid boastful young man collect reward clint eastwood is great actor who able hide facts with his eyes his facial expression much charm first part movie is how unlikely he could be bounty hunter but he go do it because hes raising two children alone his farm is failing way munnys friend ned logan morgan freeman joins search cowboys they werent first make it town back wyoming gunfighter english bob richard harris arrive big whiskey also seeking reward little bill his deputies savagely beat bob hoping set example other would be assassins when logan munny got chance they were able kill one cowboy it becomes apparent that logan munny no longer have much stomach murder logan tries return home logan gets captured by sheriffs men this is where story gets intense this is where we see how bad ass munny is david webb peoples adapter both twelve monkeys blade runner wrote screenplay he wrote when munny drinks whiskey its like dr jekyll mr hyde audience does truly find out whom munny really about last ending scene that was where it shined beat up up pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences take drink monster erupted with horrific consequences mr hyde took lot prodding but his reputation was well founded could been worse if he was hyde that shed all humanity he still had foot his human side there is film noir feel film full ambiguity atmosphere dark western deals frankly with uglier aspects violence deep steeped morality it was perfect fit hand glove screenplay is unique written eastwood direct still film realism is kind distracting depressing it tends break up myth west unforgiven is film that doesnt hold candle sergio leones brilliant dollars trilogy any way certainly its classic western regardless it not following classic theme there is something appealing film that takes old concept makes it up modern standard everything about this movie is good direction acting gene hackmans acting is keyed film work sheriff was right only way handle real criminals is show them you are meaner more ruthless than they are hackman did perfect job demonstrating style that all good law enforcement people should follow actually get job done effectively todays soft limp wrist politically correct cops pay very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn make friends with bad guys politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer it finds it kind surreal that little bill is painted villain film willy tried be family man bill wanted build house bill killed one man mercenary willy munny killed six most them innocents any way you look at it there were no heroes this film clints acting is just bar none it is movie that has characters so compelling it makes you wonder about nature humanity everybody soon learns harsh lesson about price vindictive bloodshed malleability ideas like justice,0.4262049941927992,0.10434959349593502,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"
