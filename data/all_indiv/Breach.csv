1.0,Did Bruce have to pay his taxes?,"We all need to do stuff sometimes because we have to. I'm thinking one of several things are going on here. 1. Bruce needed money to pay his taxes. 2. He needed a loss to write off. 3. He owed someone. 4. He did someone a favour. 5. He lost a bet. 6. He signed this contract when he was drunk. 7. Someone held a gun to his head. It has to be one of those because there is no way, Bruce ""action star"" Willis, would look at this script and say..""Hey! this is the best, can't wait to put my name on it!"" What an absolute load of cow manure! Bruce should buy up all copies, burn them; put a full page ad in the Times apologizing to his fans, friends, fellow actors, family and unborn grandchildren as well as give us all refunds!

2.0,3rd Rate Garbage Fest,"Anti-Life is mostly a complete waste of time, space and film. In the 2240s a space ship leaves a plague infested earth carrying the future inhabitants of new earth. 180 days from their destination a skeleton crew is running the ship while the passengers are in hyper sleep. Soon the crew members start dying and killing eachother and the survivors end up battling an alien life form that overtakes and imitates its host and is trying to kill them all.The movie is badly filmed with terrible sound and poor visual effects which are similar to what bad sci-fi movies had in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The editing is choppy as well. The movie basically borrows ideas from The Thing, Alien, Pandorum and many other superior films and copies some elements poorly. Actors like Bruce Willis, Rachel Nichols, Collin Mullvey and Thomas Jane among others have little to do and have terrible dialogue and story to contend with.There are a few chuckles but other than that there are hardly any redeeming points to this.

I don't know what possesses him to make flicks like this, maybe it's like your favorite band that just has to keep on playing because they love to create music. The concept here was derivative of other sci-fi offerings, most notably the Alien franchise.

5.0,It's depressing and violent and very unpleasant viewing...but is it THAT bad?!,"""Breach"" is a film with a current rating of 3.1 on IMDB...low enough to merit its inclusion on its infamous Bottom 100 List. This would mean it's bad enough to be among the worst big budget films ever made...and as I watched the film it just didn't seem THAT bad...or even close. Sure, ""Breach"" is a bloody, violent and incredibly depressing film....and I am NOT singing its praises...but it is NOT 3.1 bad. It makes me wonder if there's something going on here...some attack on the film for some reason I do not understand. Again...I am not saying it's good....but it just didn't seem Bottom 100 worthy.This very depressing story is set over 120 years from now. The population of the Earth is 19,000,000,000 and some sort of plague is destroying mankind. So, in desperation, some huge ships are sent into space in order to send a small number of humans to what's been called 'New Earth'.The odd hero of this story is a stowaway. Most of the folk aboard the ship are in cryogenic suspension....with only a tiny complement to run the ship. During this time, some creature attacks and it's not only murderous but very smart. After invading a host's body, it begins working towards killing....and there's simply no reasoning with it....it only wants death. What's next? Well, I'm not going to spoil it in case you actually do want to see it.Could part of the reason the film did so badly is because during COVID folks did NOT want to see a film about the destruction of the human race? Perhaps. The timing certainly COULD have been better!! Maybe, maybe not...but it certainly is NOT a feel-good film!! But despite its gloom and violence and bloodshed, it's NOT a particularly badly made film. Depressing, you betcha.

2.0,How to make an unconvincing spaceship set,"I don't think I've seen a sci-fi film with such poor production values in some time. I'm sure this was shot on a very limited budget but its difficult to suspend disbelief when you are watching a spaceship with concrete walls and chipboard hyper sleep chambers.Bruce Willis is actually in this one quite a bit, rather then the one scene films he usually appears in these days, but he doesn't really have much to do and most scenes are just him sipping from a hip flask and watching someone else work. I suppose you could watch this as a drinking game film and take a drink every time Bruce does, maybe thats what the writers were going for.The plot doesn't seem to make much sense, why would you need five janitors to clean the bathrooms of 15 other people. How much mess can they make - clearly a lot as the protagonist has to spend a year cleaning toilets. Odd.I thought the directors last film, 3022, was pretty good and was surprised its the same director of photography on this film as it just looks so bad and the shots are terrible.I can only guess perhaps the budget wasn't there for this film or it was shot in a hurry for whatever reason. Either way its not much fun to watch unless you enjoy looking at how to cheaply make an unconvincing spaceship set.",how make unconvincing spaceship set,i dont think ive seen sci fi film with such poor production values some time im sure this was shot very limited budget but its difficult suspend disbelief when you are watching spaceship with concrete walls chipboard hyper sleep chambers bruce willis is actually this one quite bit rather then one scene films he usually appears these days but he doesnt really have much do most scenes are just him sipping hip flask watching someone else work i suppose you could watch this as drinking game film take drink every time bruce does maybe thats what writers were going plot doesnt seem make much sense why would you need five janitors clean bathrooms 15 other people how much mess can they make clearly lot as protagonist has spend year cleaning toilets odd i thought directors last film 3022 was pretty good was surprised its same director photography this film as it just looks so bad shots are terrible i can only guess perhaps budget wasnt there this film or it was shot hurry whatever reason either way its not much fun watch unless you enjoy looking at how cheaply make unconvincing spaceship set,0.49165249433106567,-0.003316326530612237,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"

3.0,Failure,"BREACH is a low budget ALIENS rip-off set on a spaceship lit in shades of green and blue. It also goes under the title ANTI-LIFE. The story follows a bored crew as they go about their routine jobs until assailed by an alien life form which has the ability to travel from body to body. Routine action plays out until the climax. The whole thing seems to have been shot in a small enclosed set with a minimum of action and mostly centred around dull dialogue. Thomas Jane has a cameo and Bruce Willis has a surprisingly large role, but he plays this obnoxious wisecracking drunk who's really hard to engage with.
