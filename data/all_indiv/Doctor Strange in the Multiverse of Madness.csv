7,"This was Wandavision 2, not Doctor Strange 2","I liked this movie and I think it's a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.While I enjoyed the movie overall, it did disappoint some expectations and could have been better. As my review title states, it's more like Wandavision 2 than Doctor Strange 2. I kept wondering, whose movie is it? Elizabeth Olsen steals the show as Wanda, a corrupted demonic figure who fits the ""slasher"" role in this film, but her characterisation was also a bit too single-minded to feel like a real person.The pacing is very strange. It often skips about from one scene to another before they have really been explored or digested, leaving us with only a glimpse. This film feels like the characters are abruptly jumping between several films that have been awkwardly smashed together, unlike the first Doctor Strange film which was extremely focused. Cool scenes like the Illuminati were wasted by being disposed of so quickly. The multiverse isn't really explored beyond red and green being swapped and pizza balls being ""free"".The writing leaves a lot to be desired. As mentioned, this is essentially Wanda's story so nobody else is given much to work with. America Chavez is just there to run away from things, Christine Palmer is just there to give Dr. Strange something to anguish over and Wong is just there for the special effects. There are glimmers of character development but it goes nowhere. We keep seeing that Dr. Strange and Christine Palmer don't work out in any universe, which we already knew, but they keep repeating it for some reason, and it's not a compelling character relationship. Dr. Strange realises that he's really no different from the other versions of him, so he has to accept what he's got in this universe and not pine for things that are out of reach (i.e. Finding happiness without Christine). But he also realises that he can choose to be different from the other versions of him and work for the greater good without throwing anyone under the bus (i.e. Letting America Chavez keep her powers). Which one is it? What does he learn from the other versions of him?On a finer level, the dialogue had lots of problems. It was often very cheesy, like the supposedly inspiring speech Dr. Strange gives to America Chavez near the end. It was also full of blunt exposition, like the encyclopedic infodumps about multiversal powers, the Darkhold, the Vishanti, the Illuminati, Thanos and so on. There are times when it felt like the writing room had an extensive Q&A session where they tried to cover every possible viewer doubt, concern or plot hole, but instead of weaving the details in naturally, they just made the characters parrot their explanations verbatim, which sounded contrived and awkward. For example, there was one scene where the film stops so that Wong can ask Wanda point-blank why she wants full multiversal powers instead of just staying in one universe with her family. This happens a lot during the film.The writer Michael Waldron was chosen because of his experience with multiverse stories, especially Loki. This sounds great until you realise that Waldron has already run out of ideas and just wrote the same story again:Main tension: The powerful protagonist is put in cuffs and deprived of his powers (Loki: Loki; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange).He is brought before a powerful tribunal of celebrity cameos with AI assistants to account for crimes against the natural order. Protagonist responds with snarky remarks (Loki: TVA, Owen Wilson and Miss Minutes; Dr. Strange: Illuminati, Patrick Stewart and Ultron robots).The tribunal has some heroic story for the public, but they are hiding a sinister secret (Loki: Time Keepers maintain the Sacred Timeline; Dr. Strange: Strange sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos).Due to having no powers, the protagonist resorts to hand-to-hand combat in their headquarters (Loki: Loki & Sylvia vs. TVA; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange vs. Illuminati Mordo).They turn out to be staffed by imbeciles who couldn't catch a shoplifter. They are dispatched easily in combat so the plot can continue (Loki: TVA vs. Anyone else; Dr. Strange: Illuminati vs. Wanda).Main plot: A female character is being pursued because she has powerful abilities to transport herself across time and space and keeps evading everyone (Loki: Sylvie with orange portals; Dr. Strange: America Chavez with blue portals).Main threat: A female character possesses the minds of other people to attack (Loki: Sylvie's enchantments; Dr. Strange: Wanda's dreamwalking).Lazy and blunt exposition technique: Protagonist uses a machine to bring his memories to life (Loki: TVA timeline viewer; Dr. Strange: Shop display that projects your past trauma to the whole street).Lazy and blunt character development: Protagonist is forced to encounter an alternate version of a significant female character from his life to make him realise something about himself. She otherwise serves no story purpose (Loki: Simulation of Lady Sif; Dr. Strange: Illuminati Christine Palmer).Eventually, protagonist finds a deranged man who lives alone inside a castle in a post-apocalyptic realm. He knows more about the vaguely defined dangers of the multiverse and must be dispatched (Loki: He Who Remains; Dr. Strange: Sinister Strange).If Disney keeps hiring Waldron to write the same story, I'll save you ticket expenses by explaining the next Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's Peter Parker encounters a universe-hopping Spider-Woman and tries to pursue her to find her secrets. He is captured by the multiversal Peter Parker Posse headed by Tobey Maguire and injected with a serum that neutralises his spider-powers. The film stops so that Maguire can give a half hour lecture about the finer details of the multiverse and how there can only be one Spider-Man per universe otherwise something vaguely bad happens. Spider-Woman arrives and controls the minds of some Peter Parkers and defeats them all in half a minute. Using a memory display machine, she reveals that the Peter Parker Posse isn't protecting the multiverse, they're secretly neutralising all the Spider-People's powers so their loved ones won't be in danger anymore. Spider-Woman turns out to be an alternate Aunt May, making Tom Holland's Spider-Man somehow realise that with great power comes great responsibility. They trace the neutralising serum to the Final Peter Parker, who lives in a universe where every single person got spider powers and misused them, leaving him as the only survivor. His life's mission is now to ensure that nobody ever gets spider powers and claims that ""with NO power comes NO responsibility!"" They defeat him and travel back to all the other universes with radioactive spiders to restore a Spider-Person in each of them. The end. Rinse and repeat for the next ten years.",this was wandavision 2 not doctor strange 2,i liked this movie i think its fine addition marvel cinematic universe it has distinct directorial style sam raimi

6,Not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness,"Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength.

5,"Well, it was shiny and colourful","So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.And her redemption arc is she notices she is a monster and ends her reign of terror in the last 2 minutes.And we're meant to sympathise with her for those heinous acts because she is sad because she had to stop imagining her children, and had to stop all the slaving and torture she was doing in order to imagine some fake imaginary children.It was loud and shiny and stupid, so it was fine as totally brainless, lightweight nonsense...

5,"Convuluted story, just like the multiverse","Doctor Strange became a very popular character, especially after the Endgame events and had a good share of performance in couple of MCU movies thereafter. Multiverse of madness was on a different hype level, however it turned out to be a disappointment affair on some levels.Starting with the storyline, the plot of multiverse and Scarlet Witch as the antagonist was a cool idea, however the execution didn't reciprocate the idea of the story. The first half was decent, with very good special effects and some action with a lot of multiverse moments, that even we weren't able to catch up with the pace of the movie.The main downfall started just as the second half started. Too many characters introduction, with less development of the ongoing story, a lacklustre special effects in many scenes and the shockingly quick pace of the story made the climax very less interesting towards the end. Direction by Sam Raimi was good, but felt flat towards the last 20 minutes or so, of the movie.Putting aside any long-term implications, The Multiverse Of Madness is a frustrating mix of eclectic elements that at times feel more like Raimi referencing his Evil Dead movies than his previous superhero work. Suffice it to say that Multiverse of Madness may find rapturous approval among comic book fans but could be less appealing to mainstream movie-goers.My Rating : 5/10.",convuluted story just like multiverse,doctor strange became very popular character especially after endgame events had good share performance couple mcu movies thereafter multiverse madness was different hype level however it turned out be disappointment affair some levels starting with storyline plot multiverse scarlet witch as antagonist was cool idea however execution didnt reciprocate idea story first half was decent with very good special effects some action with lot multiverse moments that even we werent able catch up with pace movie main downfall started just as second half started too many characters introduction with less development ongoing story lacklustre special effects many scenes shockingly quick pace story made climax very less interesting towards end direction by sam raimi was good but felt flat towards last 20 minutes or so movie putting aside any long term implications multiverse madness is frustrating mix eclectic elements that at times feel more like raimi referencing his evil dead movies than his previous superhero work suffice it say that multiverse madness may find rapturous approval among comic book fans but could be less appealing mainstream movie goers my rating 5 10,0.43764478764478765,0.13637709137709134,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.23}"

2,"Scarlet Witch: The Movie, ft: Sorcerer Supremes","Great visuals, actors and actresses do their best to make it believable. Benedict Wong's character proves to be a bad-ass. Olsen also does her best. Cumberbatch is as usual. No bad things there. Even the cameos can, at some level, sell the plot points.OK!There is one important plot hole: at the end of WandaVision, Wanda learns hot to neutralize other people's magic. She does that at the magnitude of a town. In this movie, instead of using that same magic and by-pass the Sorcerer Supremes and their wizards, she tortures and kills them. Why?One important issue in character development: Wanda learns that her happiness means nothing if it is based on other people's misery at the end of WnadaVision. In this film, she has completely forgotten that lesson and at the end she learns it, again! Come on! Writers! Learn to respect these characters!Disney identity politics: Wanda kills the 3 male cameos (Picard, Jim from the Office, and some guy) easily. Literally, with her mind. OK. But she fights Carter and Captain Marvel, and Captain Marvel dies because of a statue falling on her! The same Captain Marvel, who pierced a hole in Thanos's spaceship, dies because of rubble?!And of course, she does not look for a universe where Vision is still alive.If you have noticed, I did not mention Dr. Strange. It is because Dr. Strange has NO function or importance in this movie.

5,Multiverse of... Something-ness,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work.

3,well that was a pile of assgarbage,"From the premise itself, to the ideas of the film, Dr Strange 2 does nothing but create horrible set pieces that do nothing for the plot itself and seek to make a spectacle to bait people into trying to stay with this horribly derailed nightmare of a series of movies and TV shows. Spoilers ahead so if you don't want to find out how this is now the worst of the MCU movies, don't read on.. .. .. So where to begin?Oh yeah hows about that this movie (Dr Strange 2) is in fact America Chavez Origin Movie, it isn't about Strange (as all other MCU movie are about the title character) it's about this tertiary character that just falls out of the sky to land in on Dr Strange's life and he's swept up in her stupid story.And if that wasn't annoying enough for you, we have Wanda Maximoff. The Scarlet Witch from the previous MCU movies and the TV Series WandaVision. She's the villain in this and she's desperate to try and get back to her children she made up in the TV series enough to rip apart the multiverse. That in itself isn't a bad thing you see, as the many worlds theory would suggest the two little children she created out of her mind were in fact real in another universe (and an infinite number of the others too) but you see, we can't just have that, we have to have Wanda be the tragic lone version of Wanda that never got her happy ending, she's the sole Wanda in the whole multiverse that is without her children.Yes, in a movie about the multiverse they failed to understand that by arguing there's an infinite number of something that there wouldn't also be an infinite number of Wandas in the exact same position as the Wanda we see, this is done likely because they'd not be able to figure a way around this because the writers are HACKS.The easy solution to this is that while this is going on, there's an infinite number of others that are also doing the same thing as there are an infinite America Chavez's and Strange's fighting an infinite number of Wanda's and we're watching the progression of this version in which one version of one outcome could happen.But suggesting that to the people the MCU is targeting is asking a monkey to understand quantum theory, it's rather impossible, so why am I angry about Wanda?Well they can't let her be a villain for the WHOLE film, she has to realise before the end that what she did was wrong and repent, saving everyone by destroying the thing that corrupted her (wasn't that she was evil from WandaVision) in every universe everywhere and destroying the place it was created in the universe she's in. I'm just going to say it, this completely puts Visions death in Infinity War on her, because this level of OP breaks every variation of storytelling, it's lazy and its wrong. (oh and they mentioned a prophecy where she either destroys the multiverse or rules it, guess what she does neither)Now to the thing that has been baited over and over.The Illuminati.Reed Richards, Black Bolt, Captain Marvel, Captain Britain and Charles Francis Xavier (name said wrong can't even get that right in the movie).Guess what happens to them?Go on, make your best guess.Bet you thought they were important to the plot huh? I mean they're in all the major promo's they're front and centre on the trailers.They're there for a total of 10 minutes, get bodied by The Scarlet Witch and are of zero impact. Black Bolt has his mouth removed and his scream destroys his brain (I know they don't know how his powers work, it annoys me too) Captain Britain is the slowest of any fighter and gets sliced in two by her own shield, Captain Marvel, the person who bodied an entire space cruiser by herself with no problems whatsoever and headbutted Thor She (because of course) is killed by a falling statue of all things and Charley? Ha! He's killed inside his own mental landscape by having his metal projected self have his neck break. Oh and Reed is turned into silly putty and exploded.It's the single most insulting and demeaning representation of super heroes I've ever seen, from the use of the 90s X-Men cartoon theme (yes, really) to the failure to have Charles chair float, I mean seriously when George Lucas can create an image of a landspeeder floating with people in it without digital effects for close ups and use simple green screen effects to simulate their flying in wide shots in the 1970s, and with current tech showing that we could do that on our own in Premier Pro in 5 minutes, Marvel and Disney have no right to make such a mistake.Like I said we end with Strange telling the central real MC to believe in herself and she suddenly can and we end on Strange having the effects of the Dark Hallow on himself after his possession of a corpse.This is worse than Captain Marvel, this is worse than Black Widow, this is worse than Wandavision, this is worse than the Eternals and it's worse than Shang Chi.The only thing I will find funny is when in Chinese and Muslim Markets they turn America's Mothers (because of course they're Lesbians) into her Aunts or something, because that won't go well in those markets at all.Let's do a once over to see if I've sworn once in this and then cross my fingers that the people who approve this will put it up because I know they don't like the truth being told.

8,Massively improves on a second viewing,"I was not in a good head space at all watching it the first time, so I had to watch it a second time.My number one worry going into this film was that it wouldn't be a Stephen Strange film but a Wanda film. I was half right.Spoiler alert: She is the main baddie. And she kills many people to try and suck the power out of America Chavez in order to ""dream walk"", the act of going into a variant of oneself and taking over their body. She has been corrupted by an evil book and has found out there are variants of her children in the multiverse and she wants them for herself. I kind of felt like her story was already told in WandaVision, and this also feels like a season finale of that.The exposition, which there is a lot of, is not as bad as I've seen in other movies. But because there is so much ""madness"" going with Wanda chasing Chavez through the multiverse, the script doesn't allow that much space to breathe.There are some strong moments in the film involving Strange meeting his other selves, or talking with a variant of Christine, and being confronted with his own ego and arrogance. But sadly, they are very fleeting. And that's a huge problem. My favorite scenes in the MCU have always involved dialogues about morality, grief, mortality and other strong themes. Ex: The balcony scene in the first Doctor Strange + the Sokovia Accords debate in Captain America Civil War.The movie's themes are primarily about people wanting what they can't have. While this wasn't the sequel I was truly hoping for, it is what we have. It's what I like to call ""the saggy middle"": not quite up to par with its predecessors but entertaining and important nonetheless.",massively improves second viewing,i was not good head space at all watching it first time so i had watch it second time my number one worry going into this film was that it wouldnt be stephen strange film but wanda film i was half right spoiler alert she is main baddie she kills many people try suck power out america chavez order dream walk act going into variant oneself taking over their body she has been corrupted by evil book has found out there are variants her children multiverse she wants them herself i kind felt like her story was already told wandavision this also feels like season finale that exposition which there is lot is not as bad as ive seen other movies but because there is so much madness going with wanda chasing chavez through multiverse script doesnt allow that much space breathe there are some strong moments film involving strange meeting his other selves or talking with variant christine being confronted with his own ego arrogance but sadly they are very fleeting thats huge problem my favorite scenes mcu have always involved dialogues about morality grief mortality other strong themes ex balcony scene first doctor strange sokovia accords debate captain america civil war movies themes are primarily about people wanting what they cant have while this wasnt sequel i was truly hoping it is what we have its what i like call saggy middle not quite up par with its predecessors but entertaining important nonetheless,0.485609243697479,0.07286414565826331,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"
5,A Seriously Superb and Creative Concept Executed Blandly,"Sometimes alike but also usually unalike most of the Avengers superhero movies in the MCU, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a giant mess. It's especially disappointing since its 2016 predecessor was surprisingly a blast; it featured a talented neurosurgeon who lost the ability to use his hands properly after a car crash, following towards some solid drama and his entertaining journey to becoming a superhero. The Multiverse of Madness understandably isn't that, and shouldn't just be a sequel that watches the first film before its new story, but its just too chaotic.You would probably find the film a lot more enjoyable if you properly read and understood what it was actually about, because the trailer was just convoluted and the film is actually about Doctor Strange opening a portal to the multiverse that includes alternate versions of himself, other people and lifestyle. Even for a 2 hour movie, this film feels very rushed, overly pacy and it just ends up convoluted in the way the multiverse works and what happens. It's definitely entertaining and really engages you, but you probably need to go and break down the story to understand it.The action battle between Doctor Strange and the octopus-alien monster really gets you engaged, but all of the action is very loud and too rushed. It's alike Marvel movies for using the same predictable basis Marvel creates for superheroes, meaning big fans of Marvel will probably really enjoy it. This movie mostly deserves points for its new characters and the whole idea of Doctor Strange entering the multiverse (of madness). The characters are executed well and wisely use the talents of a brilliant cast, but the concept is just too rushed and could use some times to stop and take a breath. It's also worth noting that Sam Raimi uses lots of horror scenes and jump-scares throughout this movie, so it's much scarier than other Marvel blockbusters.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",seriously superb creative concept executed blandly,sometimes alike but also usually unalike most avengers superhero movies mcu doctor strange multiverse madness is giant mess its especially disappointing since its 2016 predecessor was surprisingly blast it featured talented neurosurgeon who lost ability use his hands properly after car crash following towards some solid drama his entertaining journey becoming superhero multiverse madness understandably isnt that shouldnt just be sequel that watches first film before its new story but its just too chaotic you would probably find film lot more enjoyable if you properly read understood what it was actually about because trailer was just convoluted film is actually about doctor strange opening portal multiverse that includes alternate versions himself other people lifestyle even 2 hour movie this film feels very rushed overly pacy it just ends up convoluted way multiverse works what happens its definitely entertaining really engages you but you probably need go break down story understand it action battle between doctor strange octopus alien monster really gets you engaged but all action is very loud too rushed its alike marvel movies using same predictable basis marvel creates superheroes meaning big fans marvel will probably really enjoy it this movie mostly deserves points its new characters whole idea doctor strange entering multiverse madness characters are executed well wisely use talents brilliant cast but concept is just too rushed could use some times stop take breath its also worth noting that sam raimi uses lots horror scenes jump scares throughout this movie so its much scarier than other marvel blockbusters if you liked this review check out full review other reviews at aussieboyreviews,0.436339355089355,0.16693278943278944,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.35}"

The main character doesn't manage to have a change to what we've seen before, the new characters don't impact much, but the cameos are amazing. The special effects are good most of the time and the photography manages to give us good shots in action scenes.It complies as a superhero movie by giving us something different from what Marvel has accustomed us to, despite its not-so-surprising script, but at a certain point the third act ruins the intentions of this movie, it is a passable and enjoyable movie to distract you.",wrong title,this movie has worst title ever even though plot manages be compelling misleading title aside story this movie manages be compelling especially second act which is amazing being totally different anything marvel has done past this second act is terrifying very shocking but third act ends up being worst film it doesnt even seem like its doctor strange movie theres emotional moment that doesnt go deep something that previous marvel production already did main character doesnt manage have change what weve seen before new characters dont impact much but cameos are amazing special effects are good most time photography manages give us good shots action scenes it complies as superhero movie by giving us something different what marvel has accustomed us despite its not so surprising script but at certain point third act ruins intentions this movie it is passable enjoyable movie distract you,0.4983563311688311,0.029931006493506506,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"

5,Hugely disappointing mess,"This movies suffers the same fate as Spiderman no way home - ie good plot idea broadly and massively underwhelming execution. In particular the story boarding, script, music and direction is very poor.The pace of this movie is it's biggest weakness.., first 15 mins race through motivations but other scenes painfully slow. Corny scenes like walking slow from the person Yoire outrunning so they can catch up... or phew a door you never saw before to save you...Wanda's motivation for being the main antagonist is paper thin snd seems to have all transpired off screen... what a cop out for a character that we all watched have an almost redemption in WandaVision.Another huge dissatisfaction is the plotting story board... sub plots don't go anywhere.. in fact about sn hour of this movie to find the 'shanti' book mean absolutely nothing to the story. Total waste of time.Intro to fantastic 4 and x men was beyond a let down... again it went nowhere and such a waste.Climax of the film ends when Wanda sees her children afraid of who she's become... literally 5 seconds after telling strange that doesn't care. Oh snd ps there are infinite universes so just go another one where your kids don't see you as a witch? Or maybe find a universe where they are orphans? Why is she obsessed with this one universe? Just doesn't track.Also the wokeness.... It's bad when it's this obvious... but a mixed race girl (the bestest ever), lesbiss as k parents and all she has to do is believe in herself... ticks all the boxes...Death of scarlet witch was a hugely wrong move in my opinion... I was waiting for the end credit scene to say 'hey all this happened in another universe too' but that never happened.

4,Time to retire the MCU,"After months of hype, we are left with a mess of a story that is mostly just CGI blobs, some light shows and some boring dialogue. I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.Firstly, you're not going to have any idea what's going on with the main antagonist unless you watched the Disney+ show Wandavision. Even though I did watch it, it had been months, and I didn't remember all the details, so her whole backstory fell flat. This movie was less about Strange and more about her.There's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.There's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.There's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.Seriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back. Let's just face it, Hollywood milked all they could from Marvel. It's time to give the franchise ( and maybe all superhero movies)a good 10-15 year rest and reboot it after audiences grow nostalgic.",time retire mcu,after months hype we are left with mess story that is mostly just cgi blobs some light shows some boring dialogue i loved first strange movie its my second favorite after captain america winter soldier so this was extra disappointing firstly youre not going have any idea whats going with main antagonist unless you watched disney show wandavision even though i did watch it it had been months i didnt remember all details so her whole backstory fell flat this movie was less about strange more about her theres also subplot involving stranges old flame but since we only saw them as exes previous film it didnt really feel that impactful theres also obligatory teen sidekick which i guess is now standard phase iv fully disneyized mcu she might have been interesting but shes just there as macguffiin has no real personality theres also random cameos other marvel properties im beginning see these bits crossover fan service are sole purpose having multiverse seriously i dont know why i keep giving my money this franchise black widow eternals shang chi now dr strange 2 have all been dull uninspired cgi crap fests that rely entirely cameos fan service keep people coming back lets just face it hollywood milked all they could marvel its time give franchise maybe all superhero movies good 10 15 year rest reboot it after audiences grow nostalgic,0.41583333333333333,-0.015833333333333338,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.27}"
2,Very uninteresting,"It's actually boring most of the time. When there's something actually going on, it's mostly not interesting. I mean, for stuff to be interesting, there has to be some semblance of sense, but none of this makes any sense, not compared to the real world, itself, or other stuff in this MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse). I mean, we have Wanda destroying the Multiverse and very, very few people show up to defend it. And that's just the most obvious thing, there's like a gazillion things that are utter nonsense.Jokes are almost all one-liners and only one really works, with just a few others which are OK. America Chavez is not nearly as cute as everybody wants her to be. Rachel McAdams is way past her primer and it shows that she was never that good of an actress, she was just playing on her cute. Professor X cameo is pretty wasted (it's like seeing a bad episode of ""Picard"" show) and would have been better if he just came in, said ""Hi, and sorry, I must go"". Similar goes for Hayley Atwell. John Krasinski cameo as Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four is such an obvious nod to fans that it doesn't have much impact (and Mr. Fantastic is much more interesting character). The ""action"" scenes are so silly one can't say they are good or interesting, except in a few interesting action moments, but, in 2 hours, that's way too little.Towards the end it goes into horror movie mode, but, in this setting it feels more like a parody or simply ""so bad it's not scary, but not so bad is funny"" such as the Evil Dead; which kind of makes sense, giving that Bruce Campbell has a cameo.Quite frankly, I don't see the ""emotional impact"" that critics are talking about. Sure, there are attempts, but, they are bad, superficial, badly acted, unrealistic and nonsensical.Unless you are a big fan of Dr Strange or of horror movies, I can't think of a reason for watching this.

6,A Puzzle No One Cares To Solve,"Oh director Sam Raimi is up to his ""Army Of Darkness"" ways. What with the cameos from Bruce Campbell, a spell book, slapstick snap zooms at canted angles and the Pontiac Delta 88 hovering in a muddled universe. This is a very sloppy slapping together of an intricate storyline of wish fulfillment...if only the bad gal wasn't so into being...a mother? Yeah, that is at the core of the conflict. Wanda the Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) wants the life of domestication versus being shunned as a witch in her own world. Therefore, she must harness the power of a teenager who has this gift.Okay.Unfortunately, what she also has IS the power to live the other woman's life (it's really her, if you think about it) in small doses. And only if she uses some spell book. Who knows. The entire thing is this dense. Meanwhile, Doc Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is lamenting about his own life. Losing Christine (Rachel McAdams) to a different suitor because it would be safer for her. Such is the life of comic book heroes. A tired trope actually. So he is saddled with that question...in any other universe, would he end up with the love of his life. I shrug here, because all of this is really inconsequential since it never is addressed in the movie anyway. And they have the chemistry of a brother and sister. So I don't get her appeal.Yeah, I think this is an above average flick. Only because I do miss the old Raimi style. This brought back those memories. Other than that, I found myself dozing at parts. The special effects, while really well done, are oftentimes nauseating. Anyone with vertigo should be warned. And, well, it seemed very empty when all was said and done.To me, the multiverse is a fascinating question. One that was wonderfully realized in ""Everything, Everywhere And All At Once"" Here it seems to be a non-issue. And it aggravated me that in every universe they visit, it seems this crew don't address the chaos and mayhem they inflict on the people of the city. I mean, some of the damage to property should closed the city down. In this film, you see teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) eat a torta a scene later. Ugh.The biggest nagging thought is how unnecessary this installment was. Why? Why was this made? Made no sense in the grander future schemes. Perhaps Marvel nerds can answer this.It is also much more adult. Which was a pleasant surprise. I can tell that the kids who went to see this got very lost. Their silence said it all.

8,Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed,"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.",some bald guy once said keep your expectations low you will never be disappointed,so thanks watching some early reviews youtube saying this is more doctor strange wanda movie than multiverse movie i adjusted my expectations i enjoyed movie thoroughly you might say well its literally called multiverse madness how do you expect me not expect multiverse this movie which i agree with i had same expectation when i first heard about name movie saw trailers but trust me whole thing revolves around multiverse there is lot madness but not way youre thinking naming this movie multiverse madness was real double edged sword it really shows by how people reacted it first all i gotta say that this is probably most different unique movie mcu at least aesthetic department or should i say most different looking you already know its exactly because sam raimi horror creepy aspect he introduces this movie i loved it about runtime i remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad sam raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours we are unreasonable ones think 2 hours i many others thought well how is movie about multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours we need at least 3 hours which werent wrong because after watching movie i can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes pacing is really off it kinda lingers some scenes it fast forwards some scenes that needed more time especially ending i think they just need hire better writers because once again this didnt feel movie it felt like episode teaser real thing but i still really enjoyed it had fun with it it is really weird too because last movie they released was literally 2 28 hours theyve already seen that longer runtime still sells like infinity war 3 hour endgame which are like top 5 all time sellers boxoffice i dont know why they cut scenes or why they didnt let some scenes linger more was it because writing then why not hire better writers or team writers like markus mcfeely who knew what they were doing gave us 4 decently written movies i hope now that theyre delving into multiverse stuff they actually get more creative writers work script lot more before releasing movie it would be interesting see directors cut movie or even scott derrickson version where he actually continued first movie not mainly wandavision which is understandable problem people have with this but well never see just like well never see edgar wrights ant man if i were feiges id just go crazy with every movie give 100 freedom directors make whatever tf they want go nuts with it have different mcu next main one even now is best time do it why not let edgar wright make ant man movie call it something like what if ant man this is perfect opportunity them go crazy with multiverse stuff but i guess making movies is hard expensive but i doubt these movies wont sell just give directors full control hire better writers writing teams word mouth good reviews do rest just like everything everywhere all at once people that are concerned about cameos think this is gonna be cameo galore fanservice dont worry cameos are fairly short they are great serve plot are not just there just be there they have some most brutal scenes ive seen mcu there was one particular scene that you know when you see it that trod line between pg 13 r was so brutal that if you showed me clip it without context without telling me anything i would assume it was scene boys season 3 yeah that level brutality danny elfman did score it fit movie gothic vibe beautifully there was certain battle that im not gonna even hint at but youll know when you watch movie that was just audio visual delight i am little disappointed sad that they didnt use amazing doctor strange theme michael giacchino did i think he wouldve done amazing job if they kept him but i guess danny is sams blue eyed boy but score is still good just wish his iconic theme was used more this movie visuals were amazing too although it still had some that looked really bad it seems like marvel has been lacking with cgi this phase more than before even tv shows but thing about visuals is that even though they are great joy witness i kinda miss reality bending we got first movie no way home i wish they used it here too went crazier with it as direction i gotta say its pretty good its obvious sam raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie i loved it it seems like marvel is getting little more open having visionary directors take helm give them freedom its obvious that this movie is not given sam with 100 percent freedom but i think theyre getting little bit better i hope this freedom becomes bigger next projects sam raimi does great job with all creepy horror scenes jump scares this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry spells i really hope they keep doing these different genres dont just stick action comedy as theyve been long time its breath fresh air seeing this being different kind superhero movie i also really liked that he actually used good color grading that colors environments are alive that they dont look like another bland marvel movie i dont think i need talk about acting because you already know they all do amazing job but surprisingly wanda is star this movie some people have problem with that i get that its called doctor strange this movie kinda lets wanda outshine him but did you also have problem with infinity war being more thanos movie or dark knight is more joker movie i dont get that people say doctor strange had less things do or even less cool things do than infinity war because it felt me that they both had more or same amount screen time doctor strange had obviously more screen time america chavez is really interesting great addition mcu xochitl gomez did good job portraying her some reviews said that christine palmer was again underutilized which i guess but i dont know what more they couldve done with fast pacing this movie i thought they did decent job with palmer anyway obviously as i said before this movie couldve benefited some breathers 20 extra minutes but it was still fine we also get ashley williams course bruce campbell is great as ever you cant have sam raimi movie without ash i also heard some people say that they liked first one better which its ok i guess you could argue that pacing first movie was better stephen strange had good development there but since villain sucked that movie i cannot say that first one is better villain their motivation this movie were far better this movie i guess they had some movies shows get more development its kinda unfair compare say this one had more development because duh but even if this was their first appearance they still had better motivation were better character anyway im using they not spoil who villain is but i think its obvious anyone who that is conclusion this movie might not be what you think is going be so manage your expectations acting is great direction sam raimis touch are great so is cinematography music is good but disappointingly there is little no use doctor stranges iconic theme villain is good visuals are great but it needed more visuals reality bending first one horror aspect is fine gives fresh look mcu but its ultimately rushed pacing needed some work needed extra time i also forgot say that there are some loose ends left first movie that they didnt deal with some reason its not really continuation doctor strange as it is more continuation wandavision that case people are kinda right if they think this wasnt that much doctor strange movie more wandas maybe im just little carried away im giving it 8 impulsively i am doing it as ive done times before watching it second time will show me its flaws better yeah its not full 8 10 but more like 7 5 leaning towards 8 i liked this one more than first one,0.49949935850951066,0.21748177795132112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07,

7,A movie that does what many don't,"SPOILER WARNING: I'm going to do my best to be as spoiler-free as possible, but I also want people going to see this movie to be, you know, surprised.It seems like the majority of people posting negatively about this movie hit the Venn Diagram just right of those that enjoy negatively posting on holidays as well. Now, I may be one of the most cynical people you'll ever meet, but it turns out that I actually want movies to entertain me. And when they entertain people other than me, I can accept their audience, move on and enjoy the movies that entertain me without dwelling.So yes: this is a superhero movie. It's a blockbuster. It's the 28th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You also have had to have some cursory knowledge of Wandavision -- there's this great thing called YouTube that has these things called recaps, you know -- and What If? Yet you can enjoy this without that. And yes, this has Sam Raimi coming back to direct a superhero movie.Even more importantly, this is the return of Sam Raimi to movies about cursed books.Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson left over creative differences -- his movie The Black Phone is coming out someday, right? -- and that left Raimi and Michael Waldron (Heels, Loki) to start over.From the original trailers, I was worried that this would cover the same ground as Loki, with Strange being called on the carpet for his abuse of the multiverse. Yet the movie does an early rug pull and places -- there's that spoiler reminder one more time -- Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch -- into the role of big bad.Some backstory: Wanda was born in Eastern Europe, where her parents were killed by a Stark Industries missile, and she and her brother Pietro (Quicksilver) survived and were augmented by Hydra's Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. Working with Ultron, she tried to destroy Stark and the Avengers before learning that the robot's real goal was destroying the human race. This led to her, the Vision (a clone of Ultron turned to the side of good) and the Avengers stopping Ultron and then her joining the team. She and Vision become a couple, join Steve Rogers' side during the Civil War event and then she must destroy Vision to protect the Mind Stone from Thanos, which means nothing, as he uses the Time Stone to undo her and Vision's sacrifice. After a five year-plus battle with Thanos, she and the Avengers win, but her grief at losing Vision causes her to basically abduct the entire town of Westview and create her own sitcom reality -- she learned English as a child from watching American TV -- and raising sons Tommy and Billy with the Vision before her illusion is shattered by Agatha Harkness. The truth is that she's destined to be the Scarlet Witch -- the MCU version of Dark Phoenix, the Harbinger of Chaos more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme -- at which point Wanda traps Harkness in the town and leaves to study a book called the Darkhold, the Book of the Damned, created by the Elder God Chthon, written in blood on flesh pages (hey Sam Raimi) and bound into book form by Morgan Le Faye, not so coincidentally the villain of the first Dr. Strange movie on TV in 1978, long before the MCU was even a thing.Yet Wanda's quest isn't predicated on evil. She learns that there is more than one reality and that in each of these -- you can glimpse these realities in your dreams -- her children still exist and haven't gone away when the spells she cast at Westview were negated. All she wants is her children, but to get them, she'll destroy entire realities.Meanwhile...take a breath...there's America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who was born outside the multiverse and has the power to open doors between worlds. The first use of her powers pushed her parents into another reality and sent her running from the Scarlet Witch, who wants to absorb her power -- killing her -- so that she can find a world with her children and be a mother again.We return to the central MCU reality -- Earth-616 also the same number as the comic universe -- where Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is attending the wedding of the love of his life, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) when a giant monster -- which can't legally be called Shuma-Gorath and is called Gargantos -- attempts to take America, who is saved by Strange and Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong). Of course, our hero has no idea that Wanda is the Scarlet Witch, but soon figures it out. The entire magical training world of Kamar-Taj attempts to protect America, who must escape with Strange through the multiverse.And that's where I really feel like the spoilers would be too much, right?So let's just discuss the merits of the film.I can't lie. I walked out of the movie with a huge smile on my face, but any film that combines the bull alien Rintrah and a cameo of the Living Tribunal with the look and feel of a Raimi film -- multiple dissolves of faces and objects like a comic book panel, wild POV shots, heroes getting slapped repeatedly and comedy mixed in with horror. Now, it's not full-on Evil Dead, despite the idea that this is the scariest MCU movie ever. I've seen a lot of folks upset about that, but what did you expect? Did Raimi make the Spider-Man films gore-filled epics?I also do like the idea that Dr. Strange continues to evolve from the self-possessed braggart he started as and the man who said to Spider-Man ""In the grand calculus of the multiverse, their sacrifice means far more than their deaths."" Whereas in Spider-Man: No Way Home, that line showed that Strange would do anything to protect the multiverse, when Defender Stranger says it in the beginning, it's to prove that Strange believes that he alone can save the say, when by the end, he realizes that he's not the only hero. When he said to Starlord in Avengers: Civil War that there was only one way to win, now he realizes that just as there are so many realities, there can also be so many solutions. He's also learned from each different version of himself -- Defender Strange, Earth-838 Strange and Sinister Strange -- the same one from What If? -- that he must make personal growth in addition to protecting the Earth. I loved the scene where he fixed his watch and bowed to Wong, showing that he understands his place.That's some pretty astounding character growth for a character in a blockbuster.Also, for Raimi fans, the 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 shows up. Bruce Campbell shows up -- twice. Even a Grindhouse Releasing logo shows up. Throughout, I didn't feel like he was compromised. The music fight alone is incredibly inventive, as is how Strange makes his way back to Earth despite being trapped on a ruined world.Perhaps most moving is a line that a certain wheelchair-bound hero says in the film: ""Just because someone stumbles and loses their way, doesn't mean they are lost forever."" That's an important message to understand. So is the fact that America has two mothers, a fact directly from the comic book and presented as such: it's just an ordinary way of life. As for America, her look and powers have emerged directly from the comics and work perfectly within the film, as she shows by the end that she may be smarter than any of the adults locked in this battle.I'd hope that even non-comic fans give this a chance. It's a visual-filled odyssey through worlds of magic and I had so much fun throughout. It did what all good films should: it made me forget life for a fleeting moment -- something needed more than ever -- and gave me joy.You can't ask for more than that, even if you rarely get it.",movie that does what many dont,spoiler warning im going do my best be as spoiler free as possible but i also want people going see this movie be you know surprised it seems like majority people posting negatively about this movie hit venn diagram just right those that enjoy negatively posting holidays as well now i may be one most cynical people youll ever meet but it turns out that i actually want movies entertain me when they entertain people other than me i can accept their audience move enjoy movies that entertain me without dwelling so yes this is superhero movie its blockbuster its 28th movie marvel cinematic universe you also have had have some cursory knowledge wandavision theres this great thing called youtube that has these things called recaps you know what if yet you can enjoy this without that yes this has sam raimi coming back direct superhero movie even more importantly this is return sam raimi movies about cursed books doctor strange director co writer scott derrickson left over creative differences his movie black phone is coming out someday right that left raimi michael waldron heels loki start over original trailers i was worried that this would cover same ground as loki with strange being called carpet his abuse multiverse yet movie does early rug pull places theres that spoiler reminder one more time wanda maximoff scarlet witch into role big bad some backstory wanda was born eastern europe where her parents were killed by stark industries missile she her brother pietro quicksilver survived were augmented by hydras baron wolfgang von strucker working with ultron she tried destroy stark avengers before learning that robots real goal was destroying human race this led her vision clone ultron turned side good avengers stopping ultron then her joining team she vision become couple join steve rogers side during civil war event then she must destroy vision protect mind stone thanos which means nothing as he uses time stone undo her visions sacrifice after five year plus battle with thanos she avengers win but her grief at losing vision causes her basically abduct entire town westview create her own sitcom reality she learned english as child watching american tv raising sons tommy billy with vision before her illusion is shattered by agatha harkness truth is that shes destined be scarlet witch mcu version dark phoenix harbinger chaos more powerful than sorcerer supreme at which point wanda traps harkness town leaves study book called darkhold book damned created by elder god chthon written blood flesh pages hey sam raimi bound into book form by morgan le faye not so coincidentally villain first dr strange movie tv 1978 long before mcu was even thing yet wandas quest isnt predicated evil she learns that there is more than one reality that each these you can glimpse these realities your dreams her children still exist havent gone away when spells she cast at westview were negated all she wants is her children but get them shell destroy entire realities meanwhile take breath theres america chavez xochitl gomez who was born outside multiverse has power open doors between worlds first use her powers pushed her parents into another reality sent her running scarlet witch who wants absorb her power killing her so that she can find world with her children be mother again we return central mcu reality earth 616 also same number as comic universe where dr strange benedict cumberbatch is attending wedding love his life christine palmer rachel mcadams when giant monster which cant legally be called shuma gorath is called gargantos attempts take america who is saved by strange sorcerer supreme wong benedict wong course our hero has no idea that wanda is scarlet witch but soon figures it out entire magical training world kamar taj attempts protect america who must escape with strange through multiverse thats where i really feel like spoilers would be too much right so lets just discuss merits film i cant lie i walked out movie with huge smile my face but any film that combines bull alien rintrah cameo living tribunal with look feel raimi film multiple dissolves faces objects like comic book panel wild pov shots heroes getting slapped repeatedly comedy mixed with horror now its not full evil dead despite idea that this is scariest mcu movie ever ive seen lot folks upset about that but what did you expect did raimi make spider man films gore filled epics i also do like idea that dr strange continues evolve self possessed braggart he started as man who said spider man grand calculus multiverse their sacrifice means far more than their deaths whereas spider man no way home that line showed that strange would do anything protect multiverse when defender stranger says it beginning its prove that strange believes that he alone can save say when by end he realizes that hes not only hero when he said starlord avengers civil war that there was only one way win now he realizes that just as there are so many realities there can also be so many solutions hes also learned each different version himself defender strange earth 838 strange sinister strange same one what if that he must make personal growth addition protecting earth i loved scene where he fixed his watch bowed wong showing that he understands his place thats some pretty astounding character growth character blockbuster also raimi fans 1973 oldsmobile delta 88 shows up bruce campbell shows up twice even grindhouse releasing logo shows up throughout i didnt feel like he was compromised music fight alone is incredibly inventive as is how strange makes his way back earth despite being trapped ruined world perhaps most moving is line that certain wheelchair bound hero says film just because someone stumbles loses their way doesnt mean they are lost forever thats important message understand so is fact that america has two mothers fact directly comic book presented as such its just ordinary way life as america her look powers have emerged directly comics work perfectly within film as she shows by end that she may be smarter than any adults locked this battle id hope that even non comic fans give this chance its visual filled odyssey through worlds magic i had so much fun throughout it did what all good films should it made me forget life fleeting moment something needed
