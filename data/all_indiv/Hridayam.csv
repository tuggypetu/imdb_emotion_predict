8,All heart,"Pranav Mohanlal is arriving as the young romantic heartthrob into malayalam cinema.It is a Vineeth Srinivasan movie - young, campus based, music based. Quite in line with ""Thattathin marayathe pennu"". To draw a comparison, Pranav has a whole lot more flair to offer than Nivin.Music has been well done, and is a continuous presence. Blending music into the situations has been pretty seamless.Cinematography has been good. The interval shot with Pranav at a train door against red light is a keeper.There is a lot of college nostalgia through out the movie. Some of the moments in the movie feel very genuine.The movie did not end with a bang for me. Nothing substantial really came out. However, there is a lot of heart and youthful enthusiasm through the movie. Darshana and Pranav have performed very well, and Pranav is slowly firming his foot as the romantic star.",all heart,pranav mohanlal is arriving as young romantic heartthrob into malayalam cinema it is vineeth srinivasan movie young campus based music based quite line with thattathin marayathe pennu draw comparison pranav has whole lot more flair offer than nivin music has been well done is continuous presence blending music into situations has been pretty seamless cinematography has been good interval shot with pranav at train door against red light is keeper there is lot college nostalgia through out movie some moments movie feel very genuine movie did not end with bang me nothing substantial really came out however there is lot heart youthful enthusiasm through movie darshana pranav have performed very well pranav is slowly firming his foot as romantic star,0.4433333333333334,0.19800000000000004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"

5,Nostalgia fest that only partially works! [+53%],"Imagine opening a school-going kid's bag. You'll find an assortment of things in there. Some of it is colorful - like crayons and sketch pens. Some of it is informative - like fat textbooks. Some of it can sting if carelessly used - like a compass. Some of it tastes brilliant - like a lunch-box. The whole package is what we'd all look back at with relatable nostalgia. That's Hridayam summed up! But since it's a Vineeth Sreenivasan film, it comes with the customary plasticity in its treatment. Hesham Abdul Wahab's musical score punctuates almost the entire 3 hours, making the film a lot more bearable. Performance-wise, Darshana Rajendran towers over the rest, while the others are okayish. Kalyani Priyadarshan's on-screen cuteness is put to good effect, while Pranav Mohanlal shows improvement.The supporting characters usually play memorable roles in these generic coming-of-age films. I didn't come across any standout supporting performances, but that's again a problem with the superficial writing. If your cup of tea is diving into perfunctory nostalgia, then Hridayam may work a lot better for you than it did for me. The way Vineeth Sreenivasan romanticizes the whole world around him and ensures that the audience feels it too (not in a subtle way) makes Hridayam an ordinary effort.",nostalgia fest that only partially works,imagine opening school going kids bag youll find assortment things there some it is colorful like crayons sketch pens some it is informative like fat textbooks some it can sting if carelessly used like compass some it tastes brilliant like lunch box whole package is what wed all look back at with relatable nostalgia thats hridayam summed up but since its vineeth sreenivasan film it comes with customary plasticity its treatment hesham abdul wahabs musical score punctuates almost entire 3 hours making film lot more bearable performance wise darshana rajendran towers over rest while others are okayish kalyani priyadarshans screen cuteness is put good effect while pranav mohanlal shows improvement supporting characters usually play memorable roles these generic coming age films i didnt come across any standout supporting performances but thats again problem with superficial writing if your cup tea is diving into perfunctory nostalgia then hridayam may work lot better you than it did me way vineeth sreenivasan romanticizes whole world around him ensures that audience feels it too not subtle way makes hridayam ordinary effort,0.4892857142857143,0.19365079365079368,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.47}"

10,Hridayam - straight from the Heart,"Congratulations to Vineeth Sreenivasan and Team for creating this masterpiece. It's hard to get a satisfying movie experience nowadays especially when it comes with high hopes. Hridayam has done that smoothly and delivers even more.Hridayam is a drama following the life of Arun Neelakandan (nice shoutout to the iconic Mohanlal character) from his college days til becoming a family man. His relationship with collegemate Darshana and his friends and how the campus affects his life forms the crux of the first half. His journey as a matured adult is presented in the later half. Pranav has done an amazing job as the protagonist. Many shots reminded me of a young Mohanlal. All the actors - Darshana, Kalyani, Aju and the fresh faces who acted as Arun's classmates deserve praise for their performance.The movie is relatively lengthy. But the writer-director shows his mastery by presenting it without boring the viewers for a single second. The movie can be considered a musical- with songs filled throughout (I think around 15 songs) but all fit well with situation.I highly recommend this movie and I guarantee that Hridayam will give you a wholesome feeling. Many scenes will definitely stay in your heart for days after leaving the theatre - some that will make you smile and some that bring tears.",hridayam straight heart,congratulations vineeth sreenivasan team creating this masterpiece its hard get satisfying movie experience nowadays especially when it comes with high hopes hridayam has done that smoothly delivers even more hridayam is drama following life arun neelakandan nice shoutout iconic mohanlal character his college days til becoming family man his relationship with collegemate darshana his friends how campus affects his life forms crux first half his journey as matured adult is presented later half pranav has done amazing job as protagonist many shots reminded me young mohanlal all actors darshana kalyani aju fresh faces who acted as aruns classmates deserve praise their performance movie is relatively lengthy but writer director shows his mastery by presenting it without boring viewers single second movie can be considered musical with songs filled throughout i think around 15 songs but all fit well with situation i highly recommend this movie i guarantee that hridayam will give you wholesome feeling many scenes will definitely stay your heart days after leaving theatre some that will make you smile some that bring tears,0.46298771121351767,0.16850230414746545,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4,A Nepotistic Jam,"Hridayam is terrible. It's a nepotistic jam, directed by the legendary Srinivasan's son, male lead acted by the legendary Mohanlal's son and female lead by the legendary Priyadarshan's daughter. This is clearly a mass manipulative voting that got it to 8.6/10 in 5.5k IMDb votes because nothing about is as special as an above-average film. It is trying to present a coming of age story of the protagonist, Arun and is filled with pretentious cliched dramatic philosophical moments that is thrown once in a while as if we are being schooled on the Poetry of Life by Professor Lame.

7,Sorry..I don't get it,"Vineeth Srinivasan movies are all really good and worth to watch so far; 'Hridayam' is also good...but; Unfortunately, 'Hridayam' is one of the tedious watch for me among all his films. The movie is dragging a lot and should have trimmed short by at least 20-30 mins. First half is good, but by end of first half, the pace is gone and movie starts to drift towards dragging mode. Too many characters here and there, nobody really sticks other than the protagonist. Pranav is just OK as 'Arun', definitely this is his career best; but, did he be the best we can get for the character 'Arun'? Not, sure. All the songs were good and the song snippets come here and there, which is fine as it is gelled nicely into the overall theme of the movie. Overall, 'Hridayam' is worth a watch, but definitely not the best from Vineeth Srinivasan. Also, difficult to justify the imdb rating of 8.5+ for 'Hridayam'.

8,A Vineeth Sreenivasan signature masterpiece!,"Vineeth Sreenivasan is a celebrated musician, screenwriter and actor but I firmly believe that his true craft comes through in his vivid, imaginative and soul-stirring direction, lending heart and joy to even the most cliché and commonplace narratives. Hridayam is not a new story by any stretch of the imagination but the deft hand of Malayalam's most beloved director in the nostalgic romance genre weaves his magic wand to create a canvas that instantly builds a connection with audiences and reels you in as the story moves along.We are taken through the life of Arun Neelakantan (Pranav Mohanlal), first as the quintessential reluctant millennial engineering student, new to Chennai and experiencing ragging, love and heartbreak all at once. Having done my engineering in the exact same batch (2006-2010) as the characters in the storyline, the nostalgia of it all was hitting me in waves, scene after scene as everything from the bulky mobile phones to the ragging to the struggle to clear semester exams took me back to what was definitely the ""good old days"".Darshana Rajendran is expectedly terrific as Arun's college girlfriend lending her own distinct voice to a nuanced character that would have come off as petulant and even childish if handled by an actress of lesser calibre. She is the centrepiece that holds the narrative together, generating the moments of conflict that takes the initial story forward and finally playing a compelling role in the final act as well. Kalyani Priyadarshan is charming and relatable as ""Nithya"" with the role carrying shades of ""Nikhita"", another character she essayed in the blockbuster Varane Avashyamund (2020).I could write pages and pages about Hesham Abdul Wahab's ethereal music in the film. You would think that he has already outdone himself with chartbusters like ""Darshana"" and ""Onakka Munthiri"", only to be blown away by the ton of nostalgia-infused bricks that is ""Manasse Manasse"" and the heartwarming ""Nagumo"".Veteran editor Ranjan Abraham and again, the deft hand of Vineeth Sreenivasan must be appreciated for infusing as many as 13 songs astutely into the narrative, never letting us feel that they are out of place or jarring. In fact, they elevate most of the clutch sequences, especially an exquisitely designed climax shot that is sure to stay with you long after you have left the theatres.I would be amiss if I didn't mention the exquisite coterie of supporting characters that Vineeth Sreenivasan has assembled for the film. Aswath Lal as Arun's best friend ""Abraham"" and Kalesh Ramanand as ""Selva"" are the standout performers, generating some of the best emotional moments in the film while Aju Varghese and Johny Antony deliver genuine laugh-out-loud moments to add a humour dimension where the story would have otherwise seemed to drift a bit.Ultimately, Hridayam is a mesmeric, nostalgia-laden coming-of-age musical that warms the soul. Master director in Vineeth Sreenivasan has managed to design a character that is tailor-made to fit Pranav Mohanlal's strengths and the young actor has, in turn, put in an earnest performance that ranks right up there with Prithviraj in ""Classmates"" (2006) or Nivin Pauly in ""Thattathin Marayathu"" (2012).Highly recommended!

2,Terrible. Please read this before you pay for this.,"This review will save your time and money. Specifically, 2 hours and 55 minutes.Plain and simple, the movie is trash. With all due respect to Vineeth Sreenivasan, please do not turn into a Mollywood Karan Johar. We don't need another of that.I would give it a 0/10. But there are 2 exact things I liked in the movie. The music, and the cinematography. The editing and shots taken are very good. Nothing groundbreaking though.Coming to those who say it brought back their engineering days. Brothers and sisters, I am an engineering graduate from a National engineering college, this is NOT how it is. Ragging isn't like this. Love doesn't work this way. Toxic relationships will do nothing but mess up your life. Friendships are never this platonic.The movie uses a countless number of cliches. A differently abled college peon, a warden everyone hates, evil seniors, innocent juniors, a breakup phase which is about 7% accurate, and the normal ""the MC goes for a journey by himself for self discovery and all of a sudden he's a purely innocent and good hearted snowflake with a sudden entrepreneurial spirit. Sure.Humour. Zero. If any of the terrible ass jokes in this movie made you laugh, you have a very very low threshold of humour.Romance. The cliche. Ex-girlfriend is reminded of her INSANELY TOXIC RELATIONSHIP seeing him getting married, and feels emotionally broken. I hate movies like these spreading a false image of love or marriage throughout young minds. Might I also add that every girl who is supposed to be percieved as ""beautiful"" is fair and every mediocre girl, especially one from the poor neighborhood, is dark? Okay?Pranav Mohanlal. Brother, I don't know if your father forced you into this. If he did, get out of this. Immediately. Take your own advice from this film and find your passion. Because acting isn't one of them. Every dialogue you delivered felt like someone was holding up the script for you. Couldn't even make up to 0.06% of the acting your father did at your age. Please. Stop.Overall, do not watch this movie. I was counting the minutes till it ended. I was drinking water to pass the time. The only thing I enjoyed was the drive to the theatre and back home.

8,Director Movie,"Hridayam is quite well movie, As mentioned director only let us to feel what he wanted audience to be felt.Plot lies around the life span of 18 to early 30's of a man so pranav character is quite relatable or most of the character is relatable to common mallu boys.Hridayam is not built in a solid story but it's screenplay deserves an applaudes but at few points the same desreved critics too.Editing takes a promienent role in flowfull narration.Considering actors part everyone does their job right , darshana rajendhran way ahead of rest, she is very expressive actor in todays gen.Pranav Mohanlal's acting quality cannot be measured with this movie, as the director claimed he doesnt forced character into pranav later he used pranav as character.Pranav's screen presence , mannerism, charisma in the big screen in irreplacable. But unfortuantely we can't fully analise his acting capacity with this movieMusic and bgm needed to be emphasised, both are the backbone of this movie. Hesham magic is classic. Recommend theatre watch for both bgm and musicOver all Hridayam is well written and conceived movie but it lacks the audience connection to the story, which is always available in vineeth sreenivasan movies but not in this.Its seems like watching arun's life instead of feeling arun's life. Arun is relatable but not felt.If they could have managed that flaw Hridayam would have been a stunning theatre experience.But still its good movie and not so typical feel good stuff.",director movie,hridayam is quite well movie as mentioned director only let us feel what he wanted audience be felt plot lies around life span 18 early 30s man so pranav character is quite relatable or most character is relatable common mallu boys hridayam is not built solid story but its screenplay deserves applaudes but at few points same desreved critics too editing takes promienent role flowfull narration considering actors part everyone does their job right darshana rajendhran way ahead rest she is very expressive actor todays gen pranav mohanlals acting quality cannot be measured with this movie as director claimed he doesnt forced character into pranav later he used pranav as character pranavs screen presence mannerism charisma big screen irreplacable but unfortuantely we cant fully analise his acting capacity with this moviemusic bgm needed be emphasised both are backbone this movie hesham magic is classic recommend theatre watch both bgm musicover all hridayam is well written conceived movie but it lacks audience connection story which is always available vineeth sreenivasan movies but not this its seems like watching aruns life instead feeling aruns life arun is relatable but not felt if they could have managed that flaw hridayam would have been stunning theatre experience but still its good movie not so typical feel good stuff,0.41558956916099776,0.18503401360544217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"

2,There are better ways of wasting money & time,Such a waste movie!!! And if someone says it's romantic..feel good etc etc... I would definitely recommend them to watch 40 year old realistic love stories in Malayalam like Sukhamodevi.. Namuku paarkam mundiri thopukal..Thoovanathumbikal.. Or even Nina... Or watch Cast Away..Forrest Gump.. Catch a fire etc!!Vineeth Sreenivasan should have picked a better plot than trying to glorify a normal college life through BGM and cinematography!!!BGM is the only thing I enjoyed in this movie...,there are better ways wasting money time,such waste movie if someone says its romantic feel good etc etc i would definitely recommend them watch 40 year old realistic love stories malayalam like sukhamodevi namuku paarkam mundiri thopukal thoovanathumbikal or even nina or watch cast away forrest gump catch fire etc vineeth sreenivasan should have picked better plot than trying glorify normal college life through bgm cinematography bgm is only thing i enjoyed this movie,0.5064102564102565,0.22435897435897434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.27}"
