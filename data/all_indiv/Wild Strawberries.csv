9.0,exceptionally well made,"Although I'm not the biggest Ingmar Bergman fan, I have really enjoyed some of his movies--especially the one that are not so pessimistic. Although the underlying theme of this movie is aging and impending death, the movie is NOT all pessimism. If it had been, it would have lost my interest early on. Instead, I really enjoyed the film--particularly the fine acting by Victor Sjöström as Professor Borg.The professor is well-respected for his work as a doctor. However, despite his success in his career, he is a failure in his personal relationships. His emotional baggage over the years has prevented him from allowing himself to be close to those he truly loves. This theme mirrors one of the subplots of Through a Glass Darkly, where a father is being destroyed inside by his daughter's mental illness but he CANNOT allow himself to show his anguish--choosing instead to hide in his room with his tears. It is interesting that the same man playing Borg's son (Gunnar Björnstrand) plays the father only a few years later in Through a Glass Darkly.Fortunately, unlike Through a Glass Darkly, there IS evidence that the professor is willing to change his persona, as he begins to open up more through the course of the movie. This appears to be assisted through extensive soul searching and dreams the professor has concerning his past and his own mortality--along with experiences he has during a long drive down the coast of Sweden. Because of this, even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears to hold some hope of improvement by the film's end. This hope for change lifts this movie above some Bergman films that only wallow in hopelessness.FYI--The Criterion version of this DVD is nice due to its running commentary as well as the accompanying documentary. Get this version if you have the chance.Also FYI--After watching many Bergman films and reading about his life, I detect quite a bit of autobiography in this film and his own stuggles with intimacy.",exceptionally well made,although im not biggest ingmar bergman fan i have really enjoyed some his movies especially one that are not so pessimistic although underlying theme this movie is aging impending death movie is not all pessimism if it had been it would have lost my interest early instead i really enjoyed film particularly fine acting by victor sj str m as professor borg professor is well respected his work as doctor however despite his success his career he is failure his personal relationships his emotional baggage over years has prevented him allowing himself be close those he truly loves this theme mirrors one subplots through glass darkly where father is being destroyed inside by his daughters mental illness but he cannot allow himself show his anguish choosing instead hide his room with his tears it is interesting that same man playing borgs son gunnar bj rnstrand plays father only few years later through glass darkly fortunately unlike through glass darkly there is evidence that professor is willing change his persona as he begins open up more through course movie this appears be assisted through extensive soul searching dreams professor has concerning his past his own mortality along with experiences he has during long drive down coast sweden because this even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears hold some hope improvement by films end this hope change lifts this movie above some bergman films that only wallow hopelessness fyi criterion version this dvd is nice due its running commentary as well as accompanying documentary get this version if you have chance also fyi after watching many bergman films reading about his life i detect quite bit autobiography this film his own stuggles with intimacy,0.4964506172839507,0.13364197530864194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,When film was an art form,"In this symbolic tale of an old man's journey from emotional isolation to a kind of personal renaissance, Ingmar Bergman explores in part his own past, and in doing so rewards us all with a tale of redemption and love.Victor Sjostrom, then 80 years old, stars as Professor Isak Borg whose self-indulgent cynicism has left him isolated from others. Sjostrom, whose work goes back to the very beginning of the Swedish cinema in the silent film era, both as an actor and as a director, gives a brilliant and compelling performance. All the action of the film takes place in a single day with flashbacks and dream sequences to Borg's past as Borg wakes and goes on a journey to receive a ""Jubilee Doctor"" degree from the University of Lund. Bergman wrote that the idea for the film came upon him when he asked the question, ""What if I could suddenly walk into my childhood?"" He then imagined a film ""about suddenly opening a door, emerging in reality, then turning a corner and entering another period of one's existence, and all the time the past is going on, alive.""Bibi Andersson plays both the Sara from Borg's childhood, the cousin he was to marry, and the hitchhiker Sara who with her two companions befriends him with warmth and affection. The key scene is when the ancient Borg in dreamscape comes upon the Sara of his childhood out gathering wild strawberries. Borg looks on (unnoticed of course) as his brother, the young Sigfrid, ravishes her with a kiss which she returns passionately; and, as the wild strawberries fall from her bowl onto her apron, staining it red, Borg experiences the pain of infidelity and heartbreak once again. Note that in English we speak of losing one's ""cherry""; here the strawberries symbolize emotionally much the same thing for Sara. Later on in the film as the redemption comes, the present day Sara calls out to Borg that it is he that she really loves, always and forever. Borg waves her away from the balcony, yet we are greatly moved by her love, and we know how touched he is.The two young men accompanying Sara can be seen as reincarnations of the serious and careful Isak Borg and the more carefree and daring Sigfrid. It is as though his life has returned to him as a theater in which the characters resemble those of his past; yet we are not clear in realizing whether the resemblance properly belongs in the old man's mind or is a synchronicity of time returned.Memorable is Ingrid Thulin who plays Mariana, the wife of Borg's son who accompanies him on the auto trip to Lund. She begins with frank bitterness toward the old man but ends with love for him; and again we are emotionally moved at the transformation. What Bergman does so very well in this film is to make us experience forgiveness and the transformation of the human spirit from the negative emotions of jealousy and a cold indifference that is close to hate, to the redemption that comes with love and a renewal of the human spirit. In quiet agreement with this, but with the edge of realism fully intact, is the scene near the end when Borg asks his long time housekeeper and cook if they might not call one another by their first names. She responses that even at her age, a woman has her reputation to consider. Such a gentle comeuppance meshes well with, and serves as a foil for, all that has gone on before on this magical day in an old man's life.See this for Bergman who was just then realizing his genius (The Seventh Seal was produced immediately before this film) and for Sjostrom who had the rare opportunity to return to film as an actor in a leading role many decades past him prime, and made the most of it with a flawless performance, his last major performance as he was to die three years later.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

10.0,Stunning Bergman Masterpiece -- Maybe His Best?,"""Wild Strawberries"" profoundly moved me. The theme -- an old man coming up fast on death and wondering if his life has had any meaning -- is an old one for Bergman, and one which he explored ad nauseum throughout the subsequent decades. But here Bergman approaches the question with an uncharacteristic optimism and sense of hope. For once, he seems to come close to finding some peace with the unknowns of life that obviously preoccupied him as an artist, and the movie he gives us is sad but immensely warm; resigned but calm and reflective.An unequivocal masterpiece, and only one of a handful of Bergman films (""Persona"" and ""Cries and Whispers"" being two others) that don't drive me over the edge when I watch them now.Grade: A+",stunning bergman masterpiece maybe his best,wild strawberries profoundly moved me theme old man coming up fast death wondering if his life has had any meaning is old one bergman one which he explored ad nauseum throughout subsequent decades but here bergman approaches question with uncharacteristic optimism sense hope once he seems come close finding some peace with unknowns life that obviously preoccupied him as artist movie he gives us is sad but immensely warm resigned but calm reflective unequivocal masterpiece only one handful bergman films persona cries whispers being two others that dont drive me over edge when i watch them now grade,0.5846153846153845,0.19102564102564104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,A cathartic viewing experience,"I'd seen ""Wild Strawberries"" as a college freshman when it was first released, and knew right away I'd be a Bergman fan from then on. I watched it again just last night, January 2004, at age 63, and needless to say got a whole different perspective on the film. Where the surrealist touches, moody photography, and incredibly smooth direction had made the big hit with me as a near boy, as an aging man I found myself--I hesitate to say painfully, but...well, closely--identifying with old Isak Borg in his strange pilgrimage, both interior and exterior, the day he receives his honorary degree at the cathedral in Lund.In the last twenty minutes or so of the movie, I found tears running down my face, not from any thrilling sentimental browbeating (I doubt if Mr. Bergman shot five seconds' worth of sentimentality in his whole long career!) but simply from the cumulative emotional impact of this simple, powerful story and its probing revelation of human character, desire, and chagrin. By the time the film ended, I felt wrung out, disoriented, happy and deeply sad at the same time: it's the experience the Greeks wanted their tragedies to convey to the spectator; they spoke of ""katharsis."" I experienced it firsthand when I had the great good fortune to see a production (in English) of ""Medea."" I walked away in tears and scarcely able to think straight for an hour or so. The same thing happened with ""Wild Strawberries."" This is one of the handful of films I unhesitatingly rate a ""ten.""A side note: I watched the Criterion Collection DVD. Before the film itself, I watched the hour-long interview conducted in 1998 by Jorn Donner included on the disc. It was remarkable to see how the film Bergman shot ca. 1957 contains many elements that were to be present in his later life--like a foreshadowing of his own old age.",cathartic viewing experience,id seen wild strawberries as college freshman when it was first released knew right away id be bergman fan then i watched it again just last night january 2004 at age 63 needless say got whole different perspective film where surrealist touches moody photography incredibly smooth direction had made big hit with me as near boy as aging man i found myself i hesitate say painfully but well closely identifying with old isak borg his strange pilgrimage both interior exterior day he receives his honorary degree at cathedral lund last twenty minutes or so movie i found tears running down my face not any thrilling sentimental browbeating i doubt if mr bergman shot five seconds worth sentimentality his whole long career but simply cumulative emotional impact this simple powerful story its probing revelation human character desire chagrin by time film ended i felt wrung out disoriented happy deeply sad at same time its experience greeks wanted their tragedies convey spectator they spoke katharsis i experienced it firsthand when i had great good fortune see production english medea i walked away tears scarcely able think straight hour or so same thing happened with wild strawberries this is one handful films i unhesitatingly rate ten side note i watched criterion collection dvd before film itself i watched hour long interview conducted 1998 by jorn donner included disc it was remarkable see how film bergman shot ca 1957 contains many elements that were be present his later life like foreshadowing his own old age,0.45956790123456787,0.137336860670194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,One last time around the strawberry patch.,"(Slight Spoilers) A man's life journey is all seen through a number of dreams and hallucinations on his trip, some 400 miles, to the town of Lund where he's to receive a lifetime achievement award for his 50 or so years of service to his fellow man as a doctor and a professor of medicine at his alma mater the Cathedral of Lund.Disturbed by a dream he had the night before Isak Borg decides to take a ride by car, not plane, to Lund for a ceremony thats to be in his honor for his work as a man of medicine. Isak's maid for some 40 years Agda is very upset with her boss' and good friends decision and decides to stay at home, she'll eventually show up at the ceremony, feeling that the old man has somehow lost control of his senses. It turns out that the long car trip together with his daughter-in-law Marianne was one of the best decision that he made in his long life, Isak is 78 years old. The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak's marriage to his wife, who had long since passed away, Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown, in one of Isak's dreams, that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell, who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was, some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son, who's also a doctor, Evald Marriane's husband.Seeing his 96 year-old mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children, who with the exception of Isak are now deceased, never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who's so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him, like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant, I guess by him, she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara, a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful, to the point of tears, Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr. & Mrs. Alman, who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a head-on car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant, Henrik, who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past , delivered their first child, that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak's gas-tank.By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others, if unintentional. With the little time that he has left, Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81, Isak is determined to make up for it.Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man's journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them. Now given a second chance Isak would try as best as he can to both re-live and at the same time correct his past mistakes.",one last time around strawberry patch,slight spoilers mans life journey is all seen through number dreams hallucinations his trip some 400 miles town lund where hes receive lifetime achievement award his 50 or so years service his fellow man as doctor professor medicine at his alma mater cathedral lund disturbed by dream he had night before isak borg decides take ride by car not plane lund ceremony thats be his honor his work as man medicine isaks maid some 40 years agda is very upset with her boss good friends decision decides stay at home shell eventually show up at ceremony feeling that old man has somehow lost control his senses it turns out that long car trip together with his daughter law marianne was one best decision that he made his long life isak is 78 years old trip that isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried hide himself that past will effect make him not only better person but bring back feeling humanity that he lost not only himself over these long empty years not only isak but those close him whom he more or less also lost contact with isak both his dreams memories is seen as man who is unable show any real feelings those around close him fear either being rejected as well as showing himself be hurt by their negative responses this defect isak personality has cost him love his life sara when he was young man who rejected him his handsome openly aggressive older brother sigfried we also see that isaks marriage his wife who had long since passed away karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability show her any real feelings emotions as husband were also shown one isaks dreams that she had affair with another man ake fridell who was anything but passive with her like her husband isak was some 40 years ago behind his back that may have possibly resulted birth his only child his son whos also doctor evald marrianes husband seeing his 96 year old mother his way lund we see her same human defect that he has that all her ten children who with exception isak are now deceased never bothered visit her her old age only time that they had anything do with her was when they wanted money old lady this coldness inability have any attachment her children is shown not only both isak his mother but his son evald whos so disgusted with life what it had offer him like beautiful caring wife like marianne evald threatened walk out marianne when after he found out her being pregnant i guess by him she refused his demand her getting abortion isak is helped his long trip lund not only by marianne but number people they meet some cases give ride along way this included young girl two her friend going trip italy ironically named sara virtual twin sara that he loved lost as young man later sara together with anders victor who later as singing group serenade surprised grateful point tears isak after he received his award meeting among others along way far flung lund bickering couple mr mrs alman who almost had isak his passengers killed head car crash isak also met gas station attendant henrik who was so impressed grateful by what he did him his wife past delivered their first child that he refused get paid filling up isaks gas tank by time isak got lund received his lifetime achievement award attendance cheering entire town he not only realized all good that he did as man medicine all these years but also all hurt that he gave others if unintentional with little time that he has left isak was pass away three years later at age 81 isak is determined make up it sweet touching yet simple little film about one mans journey back time who sees how he missed out many wonderful things that life had offer him by being blind them now given second chance isak would try as best as he can both re live at same time correct his past mistakes,0.47335946573751436,0.08814671101256469,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"

,One of Bergman's greatest achievements,"Wild Strawberries can be praised for so many reasons, but chief among them in my own mind is the way in which the film so perfectly conveys its themes of self-examination and the contemplation of one's own mortality (particularly through its stunning use of flashbacks). Bergman's autobiographical story also benefits from the brilliant casting of Swedish film legend Victor Sjostrom as Isak Borg, whose towering performance is essential to the success of Wild Strawberries. I read that Bergman based the coffin dream sequence on a frequent nightmare that he had -- and it never ceases to amaze me just how effective it remains even after all these years. Wild Strawberries seems like a quiet, thoughtful, introsepective movie -- and it is; it is also one of world cinema's most impressive motion pictures.",one bergmans greatest achievements,wild strawberries can be praised so many reasons but chief among them my own mind is way which film so perfectly conveys its themes self examination contemplation ones own mortality particularly through its stunning use flashbacks bergmans autobiographical story also benefits brilliant casting swedish film legend victor sjostrom as isak borg whose towering performance is essential success wild strawberries i read that bergman based coffin dream sequence frequent nightmare that he had it never ceases amaze me just how effective it remains even after all these years wild strawberries seems like quiet thoughtful introsepective movie it is it is also one world cinemas most impressive motion pictures,0.5883333333333335,0.42333333333333323,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,Bergman knows how to make you think.,"Bergman has been seen by many as being a depressing film makes, who speaks above the heads of most people. Thank God someone does! In this piece of genius, we are asked to consider who God is; what makes a life worthwhile; and whether human nature alters through the generations, or is it just the costumes that change? As usual, the answers are to be provided by the audience. We must chose for ourselves what we think is 'right' or 'just'. Bergman uses the usual pattern for him - a man is on a journey (life) and meets people who are going along the same road (friends and family), and they all head toward the end of their trip (death). They stop in for obligatory visits with relatives and for food (as we all do), receive an honourary degree (fame & success?), and then send the children off to a party held in our honour that we do not attend (funeral). What happens along the way is important, but we always end up in the same place - the end. Wonderful editing techniques, good story, good images, fantastic acting, and more ideas and questions to ponder than one film can hold - or so you thought. It's only after the film ends that these ponderings come to you. During the film, you simply watch a man travel from his home to another city, but this is far from what the film is about. See this film once, think about the questions it poses, then rewind and see it again. You will be rewarded for doing so.",bergman knows how make you think,bergman has been seen by many as being depressing film makes who speaks above heads most people thank god someone does this piece genius we are asked consider who god is what makes life worthwhile whether human nature alters through generations or is it just costumes that change as usual answers are be provided by audience we must chose ourselves what we think is right or just bergman uses usual pattern him man is journey life meets people who are going along same road friends family they all head toward end their trip death they stop obligatory visits with relatives food as we all do receive honourary degree fame success then send children off party held our honour that we do not attend funeral what happens along way is important but we always end up same place end wonderful editing techniques good story good images fantastic acting more ideas questions ponder than one film can hold or so you thought its only after film ends that these ponderings come you during film you simply watch man travel his home another city but this is far what film is about see this film once think about questions it poses then rewind see it again you will be rewarded doing so,0.4928571428571429,0.21753246753246752,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,A Magnificent Film,"There are moments in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries where you become so enthralled by an image that you want to dwell on it, until you realize that there are so many such moments that to do so would be to stop at practically every scene in the film. The sheer technical and visual skill that Bergman shows here is unsurprising, insofar as we ought to expect this from him, but it is dazzling, even when it is displayed in a film that, on the surface, has a rather tame premise. An old man, Professor Isak Borg (played to perfection by Victor Sjöström), is driving to Lund, where he is to be honoured. His son's wife, and three spirited young people, two men and a woman, accompany him. They also pick up an utterly depressed couple along the way, only to drop them off when they begin to fight. Interspersed with the present actions are the old man's dreams, and flashbacks to his youth.Out of this material, Bergman crafts a wonderful and touching film about redemption. There is always a tendency to marvel at how an atheist like Bergman can be so deeply involved with religious issues, but many atheists, of course, are atheists precisely as a result of such deep involvement. I don't know enough about Bergman's views on religion to comment on his attitude towards God and religion beyond the basics. What is important, at any rate, is that this film is one in which an old man is redeemed from a miserably lonely and empty existence through contact with others. This is a deeply humanistic view of redemption, and one which is firmly grounded in reality.The film begins with the professor telling us that he has distanced himself from others, because he has shunned human relationships. This has left him feeling empty and alone. The man we see seems nice enough, until we learn from his son's wife, who speaks frankly to him, how this self-imposed exilic state has rendered him selfish and aloof. Through flashbacks and the dream sequences, we learn enough about his life to chart his progress: when young, the girl he loved, Sara, chose his brother over him. The professor married, but the marriage was a bad one; his wife cheated on him, but it apparently did nothing for him. To her, as she states in one of the dream sequences, he was "" cold as ice"". The professor, therefore, is old, lonely, and has an empty existence.How does one find oneself out of that miserable situation? There are three means through which the old man is redeemed. Firstly, the dream sequences serve to warn him of death, which, considering that the man is 78, could come any day. The dream sequences also point out to him just how detached he is from other human beings. In a fantastic scene, he is given a test, which he fails. The point is clear enough: he might be a professor and doctor, but that is nothing if he does not have an understanding of human beings, their emotions and feelings. Secondly, the flashbacks serve to remind him of a time when he was connected with others, as well as of times when he was disconnected from his wife and others. The beautiful scenes of his childhood are marvelously retold, with everyone well dressed in white, and the entire family engaging with each other. Only he is absent, standing in the dark at the threshold, an old man staring at the happy ghosts of the past mingling before him. Lastly, the three young people the professor meets, especially the wonderful Sonia, connect with him on a deeply emotional and innocent level. The girl looks like, and has the same name as, the Sonia who rejected the professor in favour of his brother when he was young. You can interpret this in any way you like, but I think it's obvious that we see here a kind of second chance. In the car, the professor asks Sonia which of the two young men she likes the most. She does not answer firmly. At the end of the film, as the three bid him goodbye, she tells the professor that she loves him the most of all. He brushes it off, but once he gets in bed, there is a great smile on his face. The smile no doubt is a reaction to the whole day's events, but I'm certain that one big reason for his happiness at the end is that Sonia finally chose him, after having rejected him so long ago.What is the overall message of this film? As with all great films, there is no one right answer. What is certain, however, is that Bergman gives us a view of the world that is neither wholly pessimistic nor wholly optimistic, because it is so painfully real. The characters in this film have been bruised. They are broken, and seek a way out of their situation. There is no indication in the film that Bergman suggests that a solution will solve all the problems. Rather, any change for the better can only come once we engage with the past. Through an understanding of our past and our self, we can add a new sense of our self to what the past given. If we can achieve that, through whatever means necessary, then we can be redeemed. In fact, that understanding of ourselves is itself a kind of redemption. Bergman's world is one in which hope is always possible. It can happen to an unsuspecting 78 year old man, and it can happen to us. It is never too late. Every day in our life is a new chance to make something better of ourselves.A+",magnificent film,there are moments ingmar bergmans wild strawberries where you become so enthralled by image that you want dwell it until you realize that there are so many such moments that do so would be stop at practically every scene film sheer technical visual skill that bergman shows here is unsurprising insofar as we ought expect this him but it is dazzling even when it is displayed film that surface has rather tame premise old man professor isak borg played perfection by victor sj str m is driving lund where he is be honoured his sons wife three spirited young people two men woman accompany him they also pick up utterly depressed couple along way only drop them off when they begin fight interspersed with present actions are old mans dreams flashbacks his youth out this material bergman crafts wonderful touching film about redemption there is always tendency marvel at how atheist like bergman can be so deeply involved with religious issues but many atheists course are atheists precisely as result such deep involvement i dont know enough about bergmans views religion comment his attitude towards god religion beyond basics what is important at any rate is that this film is one which old man is redeemed miserably lonely empty existence through contact with others this is deeply humanistic view redemption one which is firmly grounded reality film begins with professor telling us that he has distanced himself others because he has shunned human relationships this has left him feeling empty alone man we see seems nice enough until we learn his sons wife who speaks frankly him how this self imposed exilic state has rendered him selfish aloof through flashbacks dream sequences we learn enough about his life chart his progress when young girl he loved sara chose his brother over him professor married but marriage was bad one his wife cheated him but it apparently did nothing him her as she states one dream sequences he was cold as ice professor therefore is old lonely has empty existence how does one find oneself out that miserable situation there are three means through which old man is redeemed firstly dream sequences serve warn him death which considering that man is 78 could come any day dream sequences also point out him just how detached he is other human beings fantastic scene he is given test which he fails point is clear enough he might be professor doctor but that is nothing if he does not have understanding human beings their emotions feelings secondly flashbacks serve remind him time when he was connected with others as well as times when he was disconnected his wife others beautiful scenes his childhood are marvelously retold with everyone well dressed white entire family engaging with each other only he is absent standing dark at threshold old man staring at happy ghosts past mingling before him lastly three young people professor meets especially wonderful sonia connect with him deeply emotional innocent level girl looks like has same name as sonia who rejected professor favour his brother when he was young you can interpret this any way you like but i think its obvious that we see here kind second chance car professor asks sonia which two young men she likes most she does not answer firmly at end film as three bid him goodbye she tells professor that she loves him most all he brushes it off but once he gets bed there is great smile his face smile no doubt is reaction whole days events but im certain that one big reason his happiness at end is that sonia finally chose him after having rejected him so long ago what is overall message this film as with all great films there is no one right answer what is certain however is that bergman gives us view world that is neither wholly pessimistic nor wholly optimistic because it is so painfully real characters this film have been bruised they are broken seek way out their situation there is no indication film that bergman suggests that solution will solve all problems rather any change better can only come once we engage with past through understanding our past our self we can add new sense our self what past given if we can achieve that through whatever means necessary then we can be redeemed fact that understanding ourselves is itself kind redemption bergmans world is one which hope is always possible it can happen unsuspecting 78 year old man it can happen us it is never too late every day our life is new chance make something better ourselves,0.5009399009399009,0.13216528216528214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Another one of Bergman's best,"Ever since I first saw Wild Strawberries, like with The Seventh Seal, Fanny and Alexander and Cries and Whispers, I was blown away by how well made and thought provoking it was(it is one of his more accessible films too). Ingmar Bergman's direction as ever is superb, there is a certain warmth to how he composes and conveys everything. Wild Strawberries looks gorgeous, it is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting and scenery. It isn't a Bergman film either without memorable images, and Wild Strawberries has those certainly. Some people may find the symbolism of the nightmares with the handless clocks and runaway hearses somewhat overpowering, I didn't think so, I found them very haunting and even fascinating to watch. It is the more beautiful images where Wild Strawberries really drew me in, the memories of the idyllic summers are among Bergman's most beautiful and finest moments. The score fits perfectly, while the script is incredibly thought-provoking, and the story contrasts innocence with the expectancy of youth with bitterness with the regrets of old age very movingly. Victor Sjöström is on magisterial form being both frosty and vain as his character seizes the chance for redemption. Overall, one of Bergman's finest, a wonderful film in all regards. 10/10 Bethany Cox",another one bergmans best,ever since i first saw wild strawberries like with seventh seal fanny alexander cries whispers i was blown away by how well made thought provoking it was it is one his more accessible films too ingmar bergmans direction as ever is superb there is certain warmth how he composes conveys everything wild strawberries looks gorgeous it is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting scenery it isnt bergman film either without memorable images wild strawberries has those certainly some people may find symbolism nightmares with handless clocks runaway hearses somewhat overpowering i didnt think so i found them very haunting even fascinating watch it is more beautiful images where wild strawberries really drew me memories idyllic summers are among bergmans most beautiful finest moments score fits perfectly while script is incredibly thought provoking story contrasts innocence with expectancy youth with bitterness with regrets old age very movingly victor sj str m is magisterial form being both frosty vain as his character seizes chance redemption overall one bergmans finest wonderful film all regards 10 10 bethany cox,0.5552134646962232,0.4449507389162561,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.23}"
7.0,Emotional and symbolic masterpiece by the genius Ingmar Berman,"¨ Wild strawberries¨ is a spellbinding masterpiece by the great Ingmar Bergman with brilliant acting by Victor Sjostrom (Sweden first movie filmmaker and star , best known for his silent work , who died three years later , aged 81) and awesome cinematography by Gunnar Fischer ; showing a rich tapestry of fears , dreams , anxieties , memories and occasionally over-symbolic frames . This Bergman's landmark film is developed in Sweden , after living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence , taking place a sentimental voyage . This the story about an aging scientist on the rout to accept a prize and he must come to terms with nightmares , surrealist dreams and guilt .The movie displays haunting and powerful scenes ,it's plenty of intellectual images which stay forever in the mind ; resulting to be one of Bergman's warmest and therefore finest movies . Brooding and thought-provoking screenplay , Ingmar Bergman wrote the script while he was in hospital and thought the movie with Victor Sjöström in mind and riddled with a real feeling the joys of youth , age and nature . Although sometimes is slow moving ,however the thoughtful screenplay is narrated with intelligence and sensitivity but are developed ethics and moral issues as death , God , religion , family and aging . Surrealist and impressive images as when the coffin falling from the hearse , one of Bergman's own recurring dreams . Victor Sjostrom , Swedish cinema's best known pioneer and in his final screen appearance , gives a surprisingly moving interpretation as a professor on a touching journey to his redemption . The movie is marvelously paced and acted , and realizes an excellent Sweden reunion actors with usual Bergman's players (Ingrid Thulin , Bibi Andersson , Max Von Sidow as a gas station keeper and Gunner Lindblon, among others) , showing the different characters and exploring their apprehensions , ambitions, fears and circumstances . Glimmer and riveting cinematography by Gunner Fischer (The seventh seal) , he's deemed by many to be one of the world's greatest cameraman , he achieved give the movies on the most natural and simplest look imaginable . Cinematographer Gunnar Fischer says that several scenes had to be shot indoors due to Victor Sjöström's poor health , ""We had to make some very bad back-projection in the car because we never knew if Victor would come back alive the next day."" Gunnar was subsequently replaced by Sven Nykvist (won an Oscar for Fanny and Alexander) as Bergman's cinematographer . ¨Smultronstället¨ is wonderfully directed by Bergman ,it's a real masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim and winning Gloden Globe 60 , for the best Foreign film . His realization was during an impressive golden period from 1957-1968 when Bergman made stunning masterpieces, plenty of richly observed characters : The seventh seal , Persona, The communicants , The silence , Virgin spring , Hour of wolf .

10.0,"WILD STRAWBERRIES (Ingmar Bergman, 1957) ****","This is still one of Bergman’s finest and, actually, it seems to me that the film improves with each viewing. It was certainly an inspired choice to cast elderly ex-director Victor Sjostrom in the lead, while the main female roles are filled by the luscious Ingrid Thulin (here in one of her best showcases) and a radiant Bibi Andersson (in two roles no less, both named Sara!). Other important members of Bergman’s stock company of actors appear in bit-parts: even Gunnar Bjornstrand in the pivotal role of Sjostrom’s son and Thulin’s husband is only in a couple of scenes; a blonde Gunnel Lindblom plays Andersson’s sister (during Sjostrom’s recollections); and, most incongruously, Max von Sydow turns up as a gas-station owner grateful to doctor Sjostrom for services rendered in the past!WILD STRAWBERRIES also features two of cinema’s most unforgettable dream sequences – Sjostrom’s character meeting his own corpse while walking a deserted city street and, later, his humiliating exam for a doctor’s degree (by and in front of the people he met during the day’s journey on the way to picking up an award for his distinguished career). The film presents a simple but eventful, episodic narrative that is brimming with reflections and insights about family, love and duty; invariably, these have marked the personality of the protagonist (rendered somewhat cold by regrets and disappointments) and now lead to either reconciliation or resignation on his part with his earlier life – it’s as if Bergman was doing his own version of “A Christmas Carol”!As usual, spirituality (the eternal debate on the existence of God) is touched upon here via semi-humorous incidents – a bickering middle-aged couple and two young students (both in love with the second character played by Andersson) who determine to settle the argument with a fistfight! By the way, in earlier viewings of WILD STRAWBERRIES, I used to resent Bergman’s rather contemptuous depiction of the twins (being one myself, I can attest to the fact that such siblings don’t speak in unison as depicted here – though it happens on occasion, for instance, that my brother and I discover to have shared parallel thoughts!); thankfully, however, the two characters’ participation in the film doesn’t last for very long.",wild strawberries ingmar bergman 1957,this is still one bergman s finest actually it seems me that film improves with each viewing it was certainly inspired choice cast elderly ex director victor sjostrom lead while main female roles are filled by luscious ingrid thulin here one her best showcases radiant bibi andersson two roles no less both named sara other important members bergman s stock company actors appear bit parts even gunnar bjornstrand pivotal role sjostrom s son thulin s husband is only couple scenes blonde gunnel lindblom plays andersson s sister during sjostrom s recollections most incongruously max von sydow turns up as gas station owner grateful doctor sjostrom services rendered past wild strawberries also features two cinema s most unforgettable dream sequences sjostrom s character meeting his own corpse while walking deserted city street later his humiliating exam doctor s degree by front people he met during day s journey way picking up award his distinguished career film presents simple but eventful episodic narrative that is brimming with reflections insights about family love duty invariably these have marked personality protagonist rendered somewhat cold by regrets disappointments now lead either reconciliation or resignation his part with his earlier life it s as if bergman was doing his own version christmas carol as usual spirituality eternal debate existence god is touched upon here via semi humorous incidents bickering middle aged couple two young students both love with second character played by andersson who determine settle argument with fistfight by way earlier viewings wild strawberries i used resent bergman s rather contemptuous depiction twins being one myself i can attest fact that such siblings don t speak unison as depicted here though it happens occasion instance that my brother i discover have shared parallel thoughts thankfully however two characters participation film doesn t last very long,0.463922619047619,0.15685714285714283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,First Bergman,"During the first scene of ""Wild Strawberries,"" I didn't think I'd be able to get through it -- the Swedish was so alien to me it sounded almost comical; it seemed as if every word ended with an ""eer"" sound. But quickly the beautiful black and white photography caught my eye and I was drawn into Isak Borg's story, or rather, his self-examination.The progression of the film is fantastic. Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, ""Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake.""How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or ""The Rock"" than something like this. Hey, I liked ""Big Daddy"" and I love Nicolas Cage, but ""Wild Strawberries"" is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and ""arty,"" and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this ""verdict"" more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see ""Cries and Whispers,"" ""Fanny and Alexander,"" ""Persona"" and ""The Seventh Seal"" (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years, as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soul-wrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be, in fact, it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful, and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film. It's all about wild strawberries.****",first bergman,during first scene wild strawberries i didnt think id be able get through it swedish was so alien me it sounded almost comical it seemed as if every word ended with eer sound but quickly beautiful black white photography caught my eye i was drawn into isak borgs story or rather his self examination progression film is fantastic early film isak has apparition within dream small events leading up it within dream are quite brilliant throughout rest film there are dreams recollections newly discovered secrets past that isak sees first time as he says film dreams as if i must tell myself something i wont listen when im awake how bergman shows us characters is terrific its like relaxed puzzle that doesnt emphasize any sort urgency figure things out story unfolds beautifully as we get deeper sense isak who i assume is alter ago ingmar bergman at that stage his life he was thirty nine when film was released it pains me know that majority people my age would rather watch adam sandler movie or rock than something like this hey i liked big daddy i love nicolas cage but wild strawberries is one few films ive seen that could possibly change way i live my life im always interested listening what aged people have say about their own life because well it can only give me tips about my own thats what this film does way there is one sequence film that is frightening arty i dont completely grasp what it means beyond isaks deterioration his realization how people actually feel towards him hes told earlier film as well but he seems accept this verdict more readily but it doesnt take away film rather its interesting addition otherwise satisfying experience fact its probably most vital part movie isak may not like it bbut once he gets past it he has option develop i dont know if film is masterpiece its my introduction bergman so once i see cries whispers fanny alexander persona seventh seal if i can get through it this time ill come back this film with new perspective or at least see it as part bergmans whole i do think this is great film its type its kind film that may require viewings every five or so years as sort reminder pauline kael once said that she didnt think much bergman because shed done her share soul wrestling it wasnt that difficult film isnt as challenging as i was expecting it be fact its walk park its pleasant rich beautiful title seems perfect after youve seen film its all about wild strawberries,0.5997208931419455,0.22632908027644863,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Quietly spellbinding -- The Best Movie Ever Made,"The film summary missed the point altogether. The professor (doctor) made no ""bad choices"" in his life; no, the ""choice"" that cast a shadow on the professor's entire life was Sara's choice in loving the professor's brother and rejecting the professor. Sara was/is the girl He loved, the girl he will always love; with that light taken out of his life everything remaining is coldness; the quiet hell of living life in the absence of love; an infection that effects his wife, his son, but oddly not the people he served as a doctor. As the story progresses, the professor witnesses a much younger Sara and her two rival young men, an exact reflection of his own situation decades ago. As the loneliness generated the coldness in his life, the one radiant light was his quiet and close-guarded memory of the love he had for Sara, and in the final scene we watch the old man view paradise as he looks back on the time when Sara was still with him, with his family at a country get-together. What adds to the emotional wallop is the realization that the old man is Ingmar Bergman's projection of himself some 40 years hence, Bergman, a man loved by many beautiful women, yet he can see (and fear) the devastation which can destroy even a strong person if such person loses the spark of irreplaceable love. Immediately following this movie, I evaluated my own life; resolving drastic action to avoid (if possible) the pitfall Bergman warned us about with this powerful movie.",quietly spellbinding best movie ever made,film summary missed point altogether professor doctor made no bad choices his life no choice that cast shadow professors entire life was saras choice loving professors brother rejecting professor sara was is girl he loved girl he will always love with that light taken out his life everything remaining is coldness quiet hell living life absence love infection that effects his wife his son but oddly not people he served as doctor as story progresses professor witnesses much younger sara her two rival young men exact reflection his own situation decades ago as loneliness generated coldness his life one radiant light was his quiet close guarded memory love he had sara final scene we watch old man view paradise as he looks back time when sara was still with him with his family at country get together what adds emotional wallop is realization that old man is ingmar bergmans projection himself some 40 years hence bergman man loved by many beautiful women yet he can see fear devastation which can destroy even strong person if such person loses spark irreplaceable love immediately following this movie i evaluated my own life resolving drastic action avoid if possible pitfall bergman warned us about with this powerful movie,0.5138157894736842,0.2645833333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,A Film About Redemption,"About thirty years ago I was totally into art films. I went to college film festivals and art theaters. It was an experience. Unfortunately, I was a little too wet behind the ears to have the proper appreciation. I am now retracing my steps and watching these films again, and now I'm seeing why they've withstood the test of time. This is a tremendous film with so much humanity and so much sadness. It's about all of us who have lived out lives a bit thoughtlessly. I think of Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" as an example of the ultimate in that category. The good doctor has all he can do to make his way to receive an honorary degree. He brings along his daughter-in-law who really doesn't like him mostly because of what he has done to make his son a cynical, harsh man. He has been beset by dreams with faceless men and handless clocks, where time stands still. He is terrified. As we go along we realize that time often does heal and when we repress what really bothers, we flatten out the rough edges. On the long drive, human beings do what they often do. They begin to forgive and understand. If the doctor is an old inflexible being, it becomes obvious that he has had enough when his daughter-in-law levels with him. He begins to draw up his past for review. He sees that his basic sterility was as destructive as if he had been cruel. The deciding factor is a group of kids going to Italy. The travelers pick them up and their infectious youth begins to come to the fore. They begin to offer new insights to the two unhappy people. There is so much in this movie that I can't begin to tell all here. Let the real critics do that, but this is ultimately about how we need to forgive and forget and let life into us. There are some wonderful religious arguments that are, thankfully, never resolved. Everyone is put to the test and the movie teaches us some valuable lessons.",film about redemption,about thirty years ago i was totally into art films i went college film festivals art theaters it was experience unfortunately i was little too wet behind ears have proper appreciation i am now retracing my steps watching these films again now im seeing why theyve withstood test time this is tremendous film with so much humanity so much sadness its about all us who have lived out lives bit thoughtlessly i think kurosawas ikiru as example ultimate that category good doctor has all he can do make his way receive honorary degree he brings along his daughter law who really doesnt like him mostly because what he has done make his son cynical harsh man he has been beset by dreams with faceless men handless clocks where time stands still he is terrified as we go along we realize that time often does heal when we repress what really bothers we flatten out rough edges long drive human beings do what they often do they begin forgive understand if doctor is old inflexible being it becomes obvious that he has had enough when his daughter law levels with him he begins draw up his past review he sees that his basic sterility was as destructive as if he had been cruel deciding factor is group kids going italy travelers pick them up their infectious youth begins come fore they begin offer new insights two unhappy people there is so much this movie that i cant begin tell all here let real critics do that but this is ultimately about how we need forgive forget let life into us there are some wonderful religious arguments that are thankfully never resolved everyone is put test movie teaches us some valuable lessons,0.5243983957219251,-0.02993538324420677,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Thoughtful & Thought-Provoking,"Thoughtful and thought-provoking, this Ingmar Bergman classic will probably mean different things to different viewers. The deceptively simple story introduces you to characters who are not wholly sympathetic, yet whom you cannot help but care about. It shows their lives to be rather drab for the most part, yet it also brings out how important the events in their lives are to the characters themselves.The story of old Professor Borg driving across Sweden to attend a ceremony in his honor is complemented by just the right measure of dream sequences and flashbacks to his youth, which put the doctor's life into perspective and raise the questions that Bergman wants his viewers to think about. The youthful memories, and the symbols they use, often strike an immediate chord whether you can personally relate to them or not. The dreams are suitably weird without being overblown, and they are always pertinent. All of this is a difficult balance to maintain, and Bergman had a masterful restraint that most film-makers lack, especially today. He trusts his viewers to pay attention, and he wants the emphasis to remain on the important themes, where it should be, and not on cinematic artifice. Of course, ""Wild Strawberries"" also benefits enormously from Victor Sjöström's excellent lead performance, with considerable help from the rest of the cast as well.Since it has little action and little pretense, but much substance, this is the kind of movie that might never be widely popular. But it is a worthwhile experience that will mean something - not always the same thing - to anyone who gives it the attention that it deserves.",thoughtful thought provoking,thoughtful thought provoking this ingmar bergman classic will probably mean different things different viewers deceptively simple story introduces you characters who are not wholly sympathetic yet whom you cannot help but care about it shows their lives be rather drab most part yet it also brings out how important events their lives are characters themselves story old professor borg driving across sweden attend ceremony his honor is complemented by just right measure dream sequences flashbacks his youth which put doctors life into perspective raise questions that bergman wants his viewers think about youthful memories symbols they use often strike immediate chord whether you can personally relate them or not dreams are suitably weird without being overblown they are always pertinent all this is difficult balance maintain bergman had masterful restraint that most film makers lack especially today he trusts his viewers pay attention he wants emphasis remain important themes where it should be not cinematic artifice course wild strawberries also benefits enormously victor sj str ms excellent lead performance with considerable help rest cast as well since it has little action little pretense but much substance this is kind movie that might never be widely popular but it is worthwhile experience that will mean something not always same thing anyone who gives it attention that it deserves,0.5717006802721087,0.1786394557823129,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"

8.0,Cinema as an art form,"Bergman's films, to state the blindingly obvious, are the complete antithesis of the mindcandy (A Beautiful Mind) presented to cinemagoers in sterile multiplexes.

It's about an inner journey about one man's subjective state of mind as he sees nostalgic memories of childhood & lost love (regret), surreal visions of denial (mortality) and unsettling weird dreams which hint at a self-awareness and truth that he cannot face in reality.I was touched by Victor Sjostrom's performance as the elderly Prof. Isak Borg reflecting upon his life, and moved by the final emotional scenes where he achieves an inner peace. Is it slightly deceiving, a cop-out that Borg finds peace at the sight of his father and mother, 'the point before betrayal, before the messiness of life' intervenes as another reviewer stated? Well, I think it's commonly accepted that most people, as they grow older, tend to remember more from their past & childhoods. Why? Perhaps because it reminds them of a time of lost innocence.What I found quite difficult to understand was how Isak is supposed to be this cold-hearted rationalist; Sjostrom's touching depiction makes this troubled old man quite endearing (viz the young travelling companions affection for him). Perhaps, as the opening suggests, this is a man who has shied away from intimate contact, whose coldness drove his unhappy late wife into the arms of another and who has approached life solely on his own (egotistic) terms leading to loneliness.This is where the allusion to wild strawberries becomes significant as it is the symbol of regeneration: through his inner journey, mixing dream & reality, Borg sees the truth about his life and its emptiness. The film charts his growing intimacy with his daughter-in-law and an eventual inner peace.The film sounds typically Scandinavian in its gloom but it is also a celebration of youth as well as a study of mortality and one man's mind. It's also not without comedy, particularly the old Prof's relationship with his housekeeper Agfa and the absurd boxing match about 'God'(Bergman parodying himself) between the two young hitchhikers.What makes the film so intriguing is how characters/situations often reflect one another (Borg & his son, their coldness and attitude to life); these parallels extend to the point where characters even play dual roles: Bibi Andersson as Sara (the lost love & then the young vivacious traveller) and a cruel husband who later appears as the stern examiner in an unsettling dream. It's a highly complex pattern of subtle connections (stream of consciousness)that, as Borg states at the end, forms some sort of logical order. ....................................................................................................................2021 addition.

9.0,The dream sequences had chills running up my spine...,"...and having said that I can say this might be one of Bergman's critically over-rated pictures. Of course there is much to look for, admire, and saturate with his tale of an old professor/doctor on his way to get a degree who looks back on his life, but the road trip scenes, while somewhat fascinating, can't hold a candle to the work that is displayed in the first dream. We see clocks with no hands (no time left for the old timer), a man with a very tightened face, and a coffin that falls right in front of the old man with himself inside of it, reflecting him. That this is one of Bergman's most evocative and powerful scenes goes to show why the film is so praised, and with the other dreams we see much insight into his fears and doubts on his life and what it's meant. But a number of the scenes go nowhere or ponder on events that slow the film down. Wild Strawberries is a film that can be judged as a display of perfect sorrow or longish observation, you decide. Plenty of beautiful outdoor scenery shots though; Max Von Sydow has a cameo as a gas station attendant.

10.0,"A beautiful, moving masterpiece - Bergman's best","The Swedish Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström) embarks on a journey to Lund in order to receive an award for lifelong achievement in the medical field. After his house maid refuses to go with him (""We're not married!"") he finds his daughter-in-law (Bibi Andersson) inviting herself along. Little does he know that she holds a great contempt for her father-in-law and is only accompanying him as a way of easily confronting him and expressing her true feelings.Painfully wounded by the prospect of his own daughter-in-law hating him, Borg begins to reflect upon his life in a series of visions, flashbacks and hazy dream sequences.This is my favorite Ingmar Bergman film. Although it's a close call, I'd say this is his overall best movie and is wonderfully, beautifully shot. It's tasteful, just the right running length (short enough not to contain any unnecessary scenes and long enough to feel satisfied when it's over).The point here -- underneath all the layers -- is that we don't have a very long time on earth, and we should make the most out of it. Borg realizes as a frail old man that he has ruined his own life and has no happy memories.It is Bergman's ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Ikiru"" -- a poignant reflection on humanity and a film that, ultimately, can change the way you look at life -- if you open up enough to let it.",beautiful moving masterpiece bergmans best,swedish professor isak borg victor sj str m embarks journey lund order receive award lifelong achievement medical field after his house maid refuses go with him were not married he finds his daughter law bibi andersson inviting herself along little does he know that she holds great contempt her father law is only accompanying him as way easily confronting him expressing her true feelings painfully wounded by prospect his own daughter law hating him borg begins reflect upon his life series visions flashbacks hazy dream sequences this is my favorite ingmar bergman film although its close call id say this is his overall best movie is wonderfully beautifully shot its tasteful just right running length short enough not contain any unnecessary scenes long enough feel satisfied when its over point here underneath all layers is that we dont have very long time earth we should make most out it borg realizes as frail old man that he has ruined his own life has no happy memories it is bergmans citizen kane or ikiru poignant reflection humanity film that ultimately can change way you look at life if you open up enough let it,0.6230952380952381,0.19817336309523806,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

7.0,"Farewell, Victor Sjostrom","After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor (Victor Sjöström) is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence.Star Victor Sjöström had been a gem of Swedish cinema for decades. He worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include ""The Phantom Carriage"" (1921), ""He Who Gets Slapped"" (1924) and ""The Wind"" (1928). Bergman said this film could not have been made without him, and it makes sense. Not only was Bergman influenced by these early Swedish films, but it makes sense to have a man at the end of his distinguished career.The real standout performance (besides Sjostrom) is Bibi Andersson, who plays Sara. Is it any surprise she starred in more than ten Bergman-directed pictures, including ""Smiles of a Summer's Night"", ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Brink of Life"", ""The Magician"", ""The Passion of Anna"", ""The Touch"" and ""Persona"". If Bergman had a muse, it was Andersson.Bergman has been a strong influence on Woody Allen, and ""Wild Strawberries"" has influenced a whole series of Allen films: ""Stardust Memories"", ""Another Woman"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and ""Deconstructing Harry"".

8.0,My brief review of the film,"A metaphoric road film full of symbolism, this film has gained the status as one of Ingmar Bergman's best films. It is uneven, with gaps between the most spectacular and meaningful sequences, however the film certainly has enough in it to rate as a great film. Victor Sjöström is excellent as the old man reflecting on his past and trying to sort out his emotions, and the camera-work is simply beautiful. The (too few) nightmarish dream segments are very well done: surreal and quite frightening to a degree. The film pushes the boundaries with some aspects though, such as how the protagonist is able to remember events that he never witnessed himself, and a time factor that can only be discussed in light of events that happen towards the end of the film. There a small number of things that one can quibble about here, but the overall film stands up strong. It is relatively pleasant, quite well acted, and the bits that are done well are done very well.",my brief review film,metaphoric road film full symbolism this film has gained status as one ingmar bergmans best films it is uneven with gaps between most spectacular meaningful sequences however film certainly has enough it rate as great film victor sj str m is excellent as old man reflecting his past trying sort out his emotions camera work is simply beautiful too few nightmarish dream segments are very well done surreal quite frightening degree film pushes boundaries with some aspects though such as how protagonist is able remember events that he never witnessed himself time factor that can only be discussed light events that happen towards end film there small number things that one can quibble about here but overall film stands up strong it is relatively pleasant quite well acted bits that are done well are done very well,0.5622134038800705,0.2678130511463845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"Beautiful, uplifting film","Victor Sjostrom stars in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, from 1957.As most everyone knows, Victor Sjostrom was the Swedish and Hollywood director Victor Seastrom who ultimately quit directing and acted full-time in theater and film. I don't think multitalented covers it. His acting, as his directing, is magnificent.Here he is Professor Isak Borg, a man about to get a prestigious award. As he contemplates his life, however, he has strange dreams. As he talks to his daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin), he realizes that the only difference between his life and death is the coffin. In choosing a lonely, cutoff existence and a life of cold detachment, Borg realizes that he is already dead.This sounds like depressing Bergman, but in fact, Isak learns something as he travels to get his award. Along the way, he and his daughter-in-law Marianne agree to give a ride to some young people, two boys and a girl named Sara, which is the name of Isak's first love, his cousin. Like the woman he loved, Sara is being sought after by both boys, and she flirts with each one. In Isak's life, his Sara fell for his brother. The situation brings back Isak's childhood to him, and he relives family experiences when he visits his old home and later, his 96-year-old mother and sees her own coldness.Isak and Marianne also give a ride to a married couple whose car has broken down. But their fighting is reminiscent of Isak's own marriage (and Marianne's to Isak's son, too, for that matter), and Marianne asks them to get out of the car.""Wild Strawberries,"" referring to the strawberries that grew on the land of Isak's family home, is the story of a man coming to grips with his life - a life full of accomplishment but not many human connections.The most striking thing about this black and white film is the cinematography - the starkness of Isak's dreams, the family all in white against the Swedish landscape - so many stunning images.People call this film optimistic and uplifting, and it is. It is also profound, emotional, and very warm. Sjostrom shows us a charming old man whose niceness is on the surface only. While Marianne says that she doesn't like him very much, the young people love him and buy into his facade because they sense the real man he is afraid to show others.Bergman tells us that life's questions aren't answered right away - sometimes, it takes a lifetime.",beautiful uplifting film,victor sjostrom stars ingmar bergmans wild strawberries 1957 as most everyone knows victor sjostrom was swedish hollywood director victor seastrom who ultimately quit directing acted full time theater film i dont think multitalented covers it his acting as his directing is magnificent here he is professor isak borg man about get prestigious award as he contemplates his life however he has strange dreams as he talks his daughter law ingrid thulin he realizes that only difference between his life death is coffin choosing lonely cutoff existence life cold detachment borg realizes that he is already dead this sounds like depressing bergman but fact isak learns something as he travels get his award along way he his daughter law marianne agree give ride some young people two boys girl named sara which is name isaks first love his cousin like woman he loved sara is being sought after by both boys she flirts with each one isaks life his sara fell his brother situation brings back isaks childhood him he relives family experiences when he visits his old home later his 96 year old mother sees her own coldness isak marianne also give ride married couple whose car has broken down but their fighting is reminiscent isaks own marriage mariannes isaks son too that matter marianne asks them get out car wild strawberries referring strawberries that grew land isaks family home is story man coming grips with his life life full accomplishment but not many human connections most striking thing about this black white film is cinematography starkness isaks dreams family all white against swedish landscape so many stunning images people call this film optimistic uplifting it is it is also profound emotional very warm sjostrom shows us charming old man whose niceness is surface only while marianne says that she doesnt like him very much young people love him buy into his facade because they sense real man he is afraid show others bergman tells us that lifes questions arent answered right away sometimes it takes lifetime,0.5494136702299968,0.16483317136378361,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"
