,"Who says popular films can't be art? ""WALL·E"" is magical","Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10",who says popular films cant be art wall e is magical,who says popular films are not cannot be art if anything is proof that popular films can be stunningly high quality beauty animation writing music sound design wall e is it wall e eclipses even andrew stantons toy story toy story 2 pixar pantheon is perhaps pixars best film date call me crazy as ive just seen it contender title best animated film period wall e is everything weve come expect pixar more colorful vibrant imaginative exciting involving beautiful most importantly film with interesting involving characters sure wall e is adorable as much credit as animators get that this film would be nothing without stantons screenplay which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent surprisingly subtle making refreshing change go green campaigns were all so used does wall e have message sure but its important message it is delivered subtly beautifully wall e operates two levels works spectacularly well both it is majestic science fiction epic like we havent seen couple decades it is genuinely touching never cheap romance wall e will never get points originality but it doesnt exactly need them because homages great films figures past chaplin keaton tati marx brothers 2001 space odyssey this one is particularly spectacular close encounters third kind are actually homages not ripoffs wall e is wonderful tribute bygone cinematic tradition well two or three them actually social commentary wall e is sobering because its never overbearing most importantly because we see world through machines machines who feel more about earth life than humans do depiction humans ship could have been incredibly offensive cheap tasteless concept but execution here is absolutely perfect what is most surprising about wall e is how sad it is not even how will they get out this oh i feel so sorry them way finding nemo previous stanton effort is but truly melancholy sense early portion film maintains all playfulness jacques tati film but also evokes striking powerful feeling loneliness its brilliant introduction wall e given that rest film is too wacky bother with long scenes focused entirely character works beautifully with ugly yet beautifully rendered future earth barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage seriously resilient cockroach being wall es only companion before eve shows up but i wont go into story its best you see it unfold yourself entertaining shorts shown before film memorable characters locations animation we have come expect pixar films are now event cinema they have outdone themselves with wall e this film is spectacular majestic touching involving achingly beautiful most importantly however it is perfect entertainment i may be saying this too soon but i dont think i have ever seen animated film that has satisfied me more than wall e 2008 is going have work hard keep this being top film year which it most certainly is at moment 9 5 10,0.6823119803476944,0.3583992346938775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Honestly? This is the best Disney/Pixar movie I have seen,"I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.WALL·E is a robot that is left all alone on Planet Earth, Earth is now covered with garbage. The humans have left onto a corporate ship and are living their lives care free and well, thought free. WALL·E has been collecting little human pieces here and there and making them into his treasures, but the one thing he really wants is a friend. One day a ship lands with a female robot, Eve, who WALL·E just adores, but Eve is on a mission to find a plant to bring back onto the human ship to show that Earth is safe. But when the ship grabs Eve, WALL·E follows her and discovers the mutiny that is afoot on the ship. Everyone is overweight, can't walk, can't think for themselves, and let's all the robots do all the work for them. But WALL·E and Eve are on the mission to get them back to Earth and give it a little love.WALL·E is seriously the best movie I have seen this summer, I just adored this movie, it has great laughs, cute jokes and is entertaining for the whole family. Like I said before, when it's Disney/Pixar you just can't go wrong. WALL·E is one of their most lovable characters ever and was like the robot version of Charlie Chaplin, he brought great slap stick to the story. This movie delivers everything you can imagine and much more, not to mention a great message. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it's just a very wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy. The animation, I can't believe how far we've come, but this was a beautifully made movie and couldn't have been better. I loved WALL·E, this is a movie that will bring you plenty of laughs for your summer.10/10",honestly this is best disney pixar movie i have seen,im starting wonder if there is bad disney pixar film i mean normally when we think combo it does equal gold we automatically know that everyone is going love this movie its just matter comparison other animation films im not just saying this because i had good time when i was watching this im very serious this is my favorite disney pixar film its completely worth ticket price this couldnt have been more perfect film everything about wall e is just beyond great characters story incredible animation but thing that i loved about wall e is its message i know that it does go little over board with jog or get fat throw your garbage away weve become too dependent machines message but i felt this was most charming way present it children who have grow up world where theyre going have worry about global warming this may open their eyes little wall e is robot that is left all alone planet earth earth is now covered with garbage humans have left onto corporate ship are living their lives care free well thought free wall e has been collecting little human pieces here there making them into his treasures but one thing he really wants is friend one day ship lands with female robot eve who wall e just adores but eve is mission find plant bring back onto human ship show that earth is safe but when ship grabs eve wall e follows her discovers mutiny that is afoot ship everyone is overweight cant walk cant think themselves lets all robots do all work them but wall e eve are mission get them back earth give it little love wall e is seriously best movie i have seen this summer i just adored this movie it has great laughs cute jokes is entertaining whole family like i said before when its disney pixar you just cant go wrong wall e is one their most lovable characters ever was like robot version charlie chaplin he brought great slap stick story this movie delivers everything you can imagine much more not mention great message i highly recommend this movie everyone its just very wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy animation i cant believe how far weve come but this was beautifully made movie couldnt have been better i loved wall e this is movie that will bring you plenty laughs your summer 10 10,0.5276293103448277,0.3075718390804598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.24}"

,A Most Endearing Love Story In Space...And Back,"Over the years I've become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. 'WALL-E' is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There's hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other's name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve's silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. The animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it's mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E's loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being 'just plain silly'. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While 'WALL-E' tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It's a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar.",most endearing love story space back,over years ive become quite sucker pixar movies just love each every one them while there are states art animation sound effects stories have heart characters are adorable yet real it reminds one those charming movies disney used make but pixar films are very much unique cinematic experience wall e is quite unusual compared previous pixar movies theres hardly any dialogue between two protagonists other than saying each others name fact barely word is spoken entire first half hour but wall e eves silent playful love story is such joy watch even though few words both characters have strong personalities character development is wonderfully done animation is colourful vivid sound effect is amazing robot characters are cute charming score deserve special mention as its mesmerizing beautiful andrew stanton has done terrific job as director co writer portrayal wall es loneliness need love is very well done then change that is brought within after entrance eve his eventual determination rescue her is effectively shown there are many genuinely funny creative moments it manages stay away being just plain silly story is rich with humour action drama adventure ben burtt elissa knight do fabulous job with voice acting wall e eve john ratzenberger kathy najimy sigourney weaver lend great support while wall e tells magnificent love story it reminds us that earth is our home nothing can replace it its joyous magical experience another sure winner pixar,0.6091344713986223,0.30190925426774484,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Simply amazing!,"I heard mixed reviews on WALL-E, there were those who said it was magical, and those who said it was one of the most overrated movies ever. I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",simply amazing,i heard mixed reviews wall e there were those who said it was magical those who said it was one most overrated movies ever i will say i loved this movie it is truly beautiful movie it could have done with being tad longer perhaps but essentially this is more than movie with list vocal talents wall e has genuine heart will definitely enchant children any pixar fan all i will say is that i am sorry it took me such long time see it i will admit i was differing whether i should see it or not but i am glad i did animation is simply incredible whole film is wonderful look at whole movie is done very sophisticated visual style bright colours sublime backgrounds were delight eyes music is stunning orchestral themes are gorgeous but song hello dolly was great fitted with story well speaking story it may seem thin some but it is very simple heart warming one all same with depth poignancy there are some very imaginative moments such as zero gravity dance ride through space voice cast that includes fred willard sigourney weaver pixar regular john ratzenburger did exceptional job all characters were endearing what made movie was wall e himself he has be one most lovable depth pixar characters ever writers create very haunting atmosphere early scenes match our little heros isolation all all brilliant quite possibly one best films 2008 9 5 10 bethany cox,0.62815521978022,0.35522916666666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,WALL-E Brings Pathos to Computer Animation,"Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube. He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence. Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe. Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve. Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably. Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love. On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control. Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination. It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character. He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would. He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid. Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home. Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly. I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling. Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features. In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults. Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement. The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human! Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president. Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films. The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camera-work. The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space. Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those 'save the earth' and 'think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story. There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor. It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience. Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us.",wall e brings pathos computer animation,pixar has produced some best animation past decade with its computer generated features toy story monsters inc finding nemo that have been marked by strong story lines vivid characters tradition continues impressive way with wall e this deceptively simple tale is transformed by emotional content told almost entirely through visuals polluted earth has become uninhabitable 700 years one its only residents is wall e small robot whose solitary mission is be mobile trash compactor his work he also finds collects trivial odd artifacts mankinds past such as rubiks cube he comforts himself with old video hello dolly as he learns about humans his yearning love it becomes his idyllic vision happiness amid insulated dull existence along his travels he comes across unique find live plant one day spaceship lands deposits robot probe fascinated by this kindred machine wall e follows eventually befriends this unit known as eve eve has directive that will hopefully return humans earth if only it can sustain life wall es plant figures immeasurably eve is returned her mother ship with wall e frantically chasing after his newly found love spaceship acting as living city its machine dependent overweight humans little robots are not only caregivers but control wall e eve must figure way return humans earth find happiness even if it means making ultimate sacrifice wall es innocence childlike wonder think e t as exemplified by how he introduces himself everyone he meets could almost have sprung steven spielbergs imagination its small details that enrich wall e as character he brings mind amalgam past robots like star wars r2 d2 little robots silent running his fears joys are expressed through body language squeals when he shuts down each night sleep he rocks himself as child would he is clumsy around eve when he takes her his makeshift home robot parts paraphernalia he is like little kid ironically he is catalyst bring humans back home writer director andrew stanton finding nemo takes huge risk by basing films premise almost entirely song hello dolly i cant think animated film that relied so much visual storytelling even fantasia allegro non troppo were collections musical sequences not narrative features way this film is almost too sophisticated its display execution little kids but is just right adults remarkably this is tale with nary spoken word by principals one has think silent films approach this achievement operative word here is pathos like best charlie chaplins little tramp amazingly this film earns its stripes by emoting body language action sound effects yet most characters arent even human fred willard has amusing small role as corporate president sigourney weaver as ships computer voice is inspired choice since like eve she was female hero alien movies had deal with computer voices those films animation is almost 3 d its rich detail simulated fluid camera work interior mother ship axiom is futuristic view commercialized think blade runner city space yes it is thinly veiled message all those save earth think green people but that never detracts main theme saving humanity amid touching love story there are moments when you think scene could have played out bit better but that is minor it is likely that wall es reputation will grow over time as shining example stretching art form by challenging trusting its audience bravo folks at pixar taking chance entertaining moving us,0.4959365915887656,0.14104424158771983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,Pixar does it again!,"I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very ""virtual"", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life ""grit."" The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping!

8.0,"Pixar Hit a Home Run with Wall-E, They Just Didn't Hit It Out of the Park!","From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................Shame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.The movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.Wall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the ""Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?"" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.Fortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years. Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind.

10.0,An A+ for Wall-E! One of the best movies this century!,"Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.Footnote: The pre-movie short is an awesome, violent Looney Tunes/Roger Rabbit-esquire toon.

8.0,Define dancingWall-E,"Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.I credit the filmmakers for showcasing a world that has been left unlivable due to pollution and excess, yet never stooping to the level of liberal propaganda to soapbox an environmental agenda. No, the idea of ""going green"" or ""stop global warming"" never comes out blatantly, but instead we are shown the message of how technology is making us gluttons and sloths, reliant for everything and unable to even see what is going on right in front of our faces. Humanity, drifting on a space station for 700 years being waited on hand and foot, has become a giant mass of inactive waste. Watching their awakening at the hands of a little waste removal machine, seeing love, life, and beauty as if for the first time ever is a wonderful thing. Sure the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey is fantastic, but these moments work on another level altogetherthat of truth. Consumer culture and materialism has destroyed our society to the point that social status depends on the car you drive and the trinkets you can collect rather than the job you do and the work you put in. To see the Captain of the vessel, housing what has become of the human race, slowly open his eyes to what could be is mind-blowingly simple, yet also so necessary for children these days to see what burying their heads in the computer and cell phone is doing to the societal structure of the world. We need to stop being lemmings, droning along without purpose. There is a reason for life, things to strive for and love is one of them, something very prevalent here.The robots themselves become more human than the humans, showing the emotion and compassion that people have left by the wayside. Curiosity takes center stage as Wall-E finds treasures amongst the trash he has been programmed to clean up for a return of life to Earth. Stacking his compacted boxes of refuse into skyscrapers taller than those left behind, he finds shelter in an abandoned tractor where he keeps spare parts and objects to play with during his solitude. Never expecting a visitor, or the impact that finding a small sapling of greenery could cause, a sophisticated robot named EVE arrives and changes his world forever. Not only does she become the woman of his dreams, but she also causes him to leave Earth and discover the spaceship, which has been trying to find his home for way too long.Maybe it is funny to say, but the chemistry between these two machines is quite palpable and real, as they discover feelings that they shouldn't have due to programming and such, but they have evolved into sentient creatures. They fight for freedom against the spaceship's auto-pilot and take a stand to end the tyranny that has been subtly and effectively beating the humans into submission. Of course they may not be doing it for the humans per se, there is a matter of needing to go back for spare parts, but you'll understand once you see. Sure the Captain does his part to see the hero that Wall-E becomes to his stagnant race and being voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin definitely helps. When he starts viewing the history of Earth and just exudes wonderment and joy, you really enjoy the ride as he attempts to reverse his sloth and actually stand on his two legs for possibly the first time ever.Where I do have a problem with the film is the pacing. Yes, I know there is very little dialogueand I whole-heartedly praise the film for itbut the beginning does have a tendency to drag. Maybe some of that has to do with it being an extended version of the trailer, but it just gets a little tedious as we wait for EVE to arrive and end the cute monotony of Wall-E playing with his finds in ways they aren't supposed to be used for, we've seen it before in The Little Mermaid. Even once they are on the ship, the cat and mouse game gets a little prolonged to pad the runtime a bit. The story here isn't very complex and I just wish there had been more to it, or at least a bit faster paced of a plot progression. Otherwise, though, this is another solid film from Pixar, showing that they definitely have the creativity and storytelling ability to infuse heart back into cinema and try new things rather than regurgitate for a big paycheck.",define dancing wall e,robots falling love there is lot like about new pixar film wall e animation goes without saying better than anything out there glares

10.0,Pixar's still producing the best movies out there,"We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille.

10.0,Not just another Pixar masterpiece....A modern day SCI-FI masterpiece!,"This truly is one beautiful, touching animated sci-fi film....I cannot stress this enough. It's a unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand.The tale is set in the 22th century , Earth has become a lifeless wasteland full of garbage, that the human race evacuated nearly a millennium ago....Lifeless, that is with the two exceptions being the ""artifical"" life form ""WALL-E"" & his pet cockroach.WALL-E is a squat humble trash-compacting robot who while continuing to fulfill the duties he was programmed for ( even though it's pointless considering there are no more humans on the planet ) collects certain leftover nicknacks, novelty items and even old films that he can still play. He mentally stimulates himself and enjoys fragments of the culture that is now gone ( that of the human race ). Though, WALL-E has imprinted on his little cockroach & vice versa, the little robot longs for more companionship.He receives it in the form of a beautiful, sleek, defensive ""fembot fatale"" ""EVE ""....In their own little forms of robotic communication ( repeating each other's names in various connotations depending on moods ; ""WAAAALLL-E,"" ""EEEEEEEE-VAH!"" ) and WALL-E's Chaplin-esquire clumsiness that amuses EVE, the pair imprint on each other and enjoy each other's company.Sadly, EVE has located a small plant and must return it to her mother ship and leave WALL-E forever...But WALLL-E hops aboard the ship in pursuit of his darling ""EEEEEE-VAH"".And yes this film has very little dialog, but guess what, IT DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' DIALIOUGUE!....The brilliance and beauty of the film is in the interactions and responses of the little robots : a great representation of what ""artificial intelligence"" really is and what it may actually be one day! And how ironic it is that in this film the organic HUMAN RACE has become soulless, mirthless, artless, jaded, self-centered cogs in a machine of blind consumerism, yet the mechanical artificial beings still respond to their surroundings like a toddler or pet : with curiosity, wonder, and delight in communication & learning.And yes there is plenty of comic relief ( albeit sans dialouge ) so no this movie is NOT BORING....It's beautiful, it even made me a little bit misty-eyed.So yeah if you're an a fan of animated films, sci-fi films, and romance you should definitely check out this movie.Obviously, it is going to win a very well-deserved Oscar for ""Best Animated Film"".",not just another pixar masterpiece modern day sci fi masterpiece,this truly is one beautiful touching animated sci fi film i cannot stress this enough its unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand tale is set 22th century earth has become lifeless wasteland full garbage that human race evacuated nearly millennium ago lifeless that is with two exceptions being artifical life form wall e his pet cockroach wall e is squat humble trash compacting robot who while continuing fulfill duties he was programmed even though its pointless considering there are no more humans planet collects certain leftover nicknacks novelty items even old films that he can still play he mentally stimulates himself enjoys fragments culture that is now gone that human race though wall e has imprinted his little cockroach vice versa little robot longs more companionship he receives it form beautiful sleek defensive fembot fatale eve their own little forms robotic communication repeating each others names various connotations depending moods waaaalll e eeeeeeee vah wall es chaplin esquire clumsiness that amuses eve pair imprint each other enjoy each others company sadly eve has located small plant must return it her mother ship leave wall e forever but walll e hops aboard ship pursuit his darling eeeeee vah yes this film has very little dialog but guess what it dont need no stinkin dialiougue brilliance beauty film is interactions responses little robots great representation what artificial intelligence really is what it may actually be one day how ironic it is that this film organic human race has become soulless mirthless artless jaded self centered cogs machine blind consumerism yet mechanical artificial beings still respond their surroundings like toddler or pet with curiosity wonder delight communication learning yes there is plenty comic relief albeit sans dialouge so no this movie is not boring its beautiful it even made me little bit misty eyed so yeah if youre fan animated films sci fi films romance you should definitely check out this movie obviously it is going win very well deserved oscar best animated film,0.5353850050658562,0.11878799392097267,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"

The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.""WALL-E"" is one of the best animations I have ever seen, with adorable characters and a deep story, showing a possible scenario of the depletion of our planet caused by the lack of concern from the big corporations with the environment. In addition, there is the beautiful love story of WALL-E, the importance of small and forgotten things; a great nostalgia of the old times among many other message.

9.0,Thoughtful and Kind,"I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold. This movie, however, takes a character who has endured in his lot, a romantic robot at that, and gives him a chance to realize his dreams. He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions.

10.0,"A refreshing, limitless landmark","WALL-E is perhaps one of the most subversive films by Pixar Animation Studios and one of the most significant animated films in many years. The film is comprised of little dialog, breathtakingly clear, but often dirty visuals that contradict the bubbly, colorful palette of colors we're used to seeing in contemporary animation, and can be seen as a showcase for several motifs and deep themes.We open in the year 2805, where Earth has become a haven for mass amounts of garbage thanks to extreme levels of consumerism perpetuated by a massive corporation called ""Buy N Large."" Earth's population was evacuated in the early 2100's to reside in certain ships in space. Left behind were ""WALL-E"" robots, small trash-compactors that would make identical cubic blocks out of the trash left behind by humans before stacking them into gigantic skyscrapers. Eventually, all the bots died off, except for one, who is still mindlessly operating and compacting trash day-after-day.WALL-E lives in a storage truck, kept cozy by pieces from human civilization that bring him comfort. One day, he is brought more comfort by discovering EVE, a much-more advanced robot who is deployed from the Buy N Large spaceship to track down vegetation on Earth. WALL-E meets and is attracted by EVE, and the two form a bond, communicating through ambiguous sounds and the occasional disjointed line of robotic dialog.There is hardly any dialog during the first act of the film; the second act is populated by a bit more than the first and the third is largely devoted to speaking because our focus has shifted from the dilapidated Earth to the more populous Axiom spaceship. Much of the film is largely focused on showcasing the variety of sounds WALL-E and EVE make, leaving the viewer to utilize those little bits of sound as the main point of reference when it comes to trying to define the emotion and the feelings the characters are currently going through. The sound design was largely conducted by Ben Burtt, the so-called ""godfather of sound"" for the film industry, and his meticulous craft shows. A viewing of the making of WALL-E reminds - or perhaps informs us - that when animation is made, nothing has a sound. Animated character movements are, by default, silent and every sound, down to the footsteps, must be done in real life before being uploaded to the film itself. The meticulous craft of Burtt and the entire sound team is an act of devotion and perfection that may go noticed by an inattentive viewer.Returning to my point made about WALL-E being the most thematically heavy film Pixar has ever made, such themes are technological advances, mass-consumerism, Christianity, love, corporation-takeover, and conformity. Consider the Buy N Large, the massive store in the sky that caters to an obese population of men and women that ride around in hovering seats, consuming food and drinks out of a cup, and wearing whatever the loudspeaker tells faithful shoppers what to where. The scene exploring the Buy N Large warehouse is a fascinating but poignant look at the effects of mass consumerism in America. It shows the kind of thing we'd like to believe we're immune to as humans but, unfortunately, are not and can be manipulated and directed in ways we never truly thought possible.The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, who largely led the team in creating Finding Nemo, one of Pixar's most renowned pictures for its emotionally touching story and beautiful animation. Finding Nemo featured some of the best animation, I believe, the CGI world has ever seen, and WALL-E's grittier, darker animation is not to be dismissed either. Stanton and the team of animators capture the vast landscapes of Earth and its desolate state, as well as space and its limited state. The animation is put to an incredible effect and Stanton proves to be worthy of operating with the animation company.WALL-E, too, shows a future where conformity is incredible. Everyone wears the same thing, possesses the same features, operates with little individualism, and function in the way where laziness appears to be something of an achievement. This is a frightening feature in a kids film; one that I don't see many young children picking up instantly. This isn't just the part of the film that keeps adults awake but keeps adults questioning the future we may be in for.Furthermore, the film works beautifully as a tone-piece and an amazingly made film in terms of grandiose animation and sound design. Ben Burtt's sound design and meticulous craft in pairing each obscure movement with a practical sound is easily the strongest thing in the film. Despite the lack of dialog, the film never fails to engage a viewer by showing them an unconventional love story that is made unpredictable because the way that Wall-E and EVE communicate is nonlinear and often ambiguous. These ingredients make WALL-E a truly stunning piece of animated art.Directed by: Andrew Stanton.",refreshing limitless landmark,wall e is perhaps one most subversive films by pixar animation studios one most significant animated films many years film is comprised little dialog breathtakingly clear but often dirty visuals that contradict bubbly colorful palette colors were used seeing contemporary animation can be seen as showcase several motifs deep themes we open year 2805 where earth has become haven mass amounts garbage thanks extreme levels consumerism perpetuated by massive corporation called buy n large earths population was evacuated early 2100s reside certain ships space left behind were wall e robots small trash compactors that would make identical cubic blocks out trash left behind by humans before stacking them into gigantic skyscrapers eventually all bots died off except one who is still mindlessly operating compacting trash day after day wall e lives storage truck kept cozy by pieces human civilization that bring him comfort one day he is brought more comfort by discovering eve much more advanced robot who is deployed buy n large spaceship track down vegetation earth wall e meets is attracted by eve two form bond communicating through ambiguous sounds occasional disjointed line robotic dialog there is hardly any dialog during first act film second act is populated by bit more than first third is largely devoted speaking because our focus has shifted dilapidated earth more populous axiom spaceship much film is largely focused showcasing variety sounds wall e eve make leaving viewer utilize those little bits sound as main point reference when it comes trying define emotion feelings characters are currently going through sound design was largely conducted by ben burtt so called godfather sound film industry his meticulous craft shows viewing making wall e reminds or perhaps informs us that when animation is made nothing has sound animated character movements are by default silent every sound down footsteps must be done real life before being uploaded film itself meticulous craft burtt entire sound team is act devotion perfection that may go noticed by inattentive viewer returning my point made about wall e being most thematically heavy film pixar has ever made such themes are technological advances mass consumerism christianity love corporation takeover conformity consider buy n large massive store sky that caters obese population men women that ride around hovering seats consuming food drinks out cup wearing whatever loudspeaker tells faithful shoppers what where scene exploring buy n large warehouse is fascinating but poignant look at effects mass consumerism america it shows kind thing wed like believe were immune as humans but unfortunately are not can be manipulated directed ways we never truly thought possible film was directed by andrew stanton who largely led team creating finding nemo one pixars most renowned pictures its emotionally touching story beautiful animation finding nemo featured some best animation i believe cgi world has ever seen wall es grittier darker animation is not be dismissed either stanton team animators capture vast landscapes earth its desolate state as well as space its limited state animation is put incredible effect stanton proves be worthy operating with animation company wall e too shows future where conformity is incredible everyone wears same thing possesses same features operates with little individualism function way where laziness appears be something achievement this is frightening feature kids film one that i dont see many young children picking up instantly this isnt just part film that keeps adults awake but keeps adults questioning future we may be furthermore film works beautifully as tone piece amazingly made film terms grandiose animation sound design ben burtts sound design meticulous craft pairing each obscure movement with practical sound is easily strongest thing film despite lack dialog film never fails engage viewer by showing them unconventional love story that is made unpredictable because way that wall e eve communicate is nonlinear often ambiguous these ingredients make wall e truly stunning piece animated art directed by andrew stanton,0.5013730158730155,0.1867519841269841,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"

,Pure Genius,"I very rarely give ten out of ten to a movie, but I have no hesitation in giving that perfect score to WALL-E. It is sublime. Not just the best animation I've seen in a long time, but simply one of the best movies I've seen in many months in terms of coherent and effective story-telling and seamless editing. It's extremely well put together. The animation is in a class of its own. My only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isn't a movie aimed at little kids, and perhaps the marketing strategy is showing too much of the 'cute funnies' and not enough of the sheer artistry of Pixar's vision. This is not a bright, sunny view of the world where everyone lives happily ever after, but quite clearly a message movie; if you agree with the message, you will love this film.Disney may own Pixar these days, but there is an artistic divide between the two production styles. If you want predictable sentimentality watch Disney. I loved Disney's older classics but some of their later offerings  with the exception of Beauty and the Beast which was very good - made me wince when I took my kids along. But in contrast I have loved every single film that Pixar have made since Toy Story in 1995, and if you want something more wry, but still possessing humour and heart, then Pixar is probably going to be your choice.The story is simple enough. It's the year 2700 and the earth has become uninhabitable, not through some terrible cataclysmic event, but by a slow accumulation of suffocating junk. It's a wasteland devoid of living things. As the opening shots pan in, we see that the skyscrapers are actually tall mounds of compressed trash, and that the compressing is being done by WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a small, solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts from all his clapped out siblings. WALL-E's only companion is a cockroach, and he fills in the time in his trailer home during long dust storms by watching an old video of Hello Dolly. WALL-E is an unlikely hero, rusty but trusty. I hesitate to use the word cute, endearing works better. One day he finds a single plant growing. He doesn't appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as a Rubic's Cube, a lighter and a trash can lid.Then a space ship lands and EVE emerges (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Eve is in a whole different class to WALL-E. She can fly, he is earth bound, she is sleek, dangerous and single minded while he is bumbling and rather dowdy. They communicate with beeps and eye twitches, and WALL-E is hooked. When WALL-E gives EVE the plant he has found, she recognizes that her directive  to find evidence of photosynthesis on earth  is fulfilled and shuts down. The ship comes back to pick her up and WALL-E clings on, desperate not to lose her. Arriving at the mother ship, we find the last remaining humans (apparently all American!) who have fled the earth at the behest of the CEO of Buy N Large, a conglomerate who ended up running everything. The humans are pretty much big, obese babies, who have lost the use of their legs and are spoon fed artificial food and platitudinous slogans in equal measure. The rest of the movie involves a plot by the auto pilot to take over the ship and keep it on course away from earth, while the captain tries to take it home, aided by WALL-E and an entertaining array of quirky malfunctioning robots let loose from the repair bay.Some of the best moments are to be found in WALL-E's interaction with everyday objects; a fire extinguisher for example, enables him to zip around in space in a balletic dance with EVE, he uses a lid as a hat to imitate the dancers he sees on his video screen. The humans are not presented as wicked or evil, just unthinking, and the movie ends on a positive and upbeat note, when they recover the use of their legs and return to earth to reclaim it as their home. There are nods to many classic sci-fi movies, Pixar's ubiquitous pizza truck is there near the beginning, and they are not beyond a little self criticism; there's a discarded iPod among WALL-E's accumulated junk.I found myself caring far more about the animated characters in WALL-E than the supposedly human ones in many 'regular' movies. Director Andrew Stanton and everyone at Pixar deserve huge credit for this movie and I hope it is an enormous financial hit for them. I also hope it gets an Oscar nomination, not for best animated feature, but for best film.",pure genius,i very rarely give ten out ten movie but i have no hesitation giving that perfect score wall e it is sublime not just best animation ive seen long time but simply one best movies ive seen many months terms coherent effective story telling seamless editing its extremely well put together animation is class its own my only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isnt movie aimed at little kids perhaps marketing strategy is showing too much cute funnies not enough sheer artistry pixars vision this is not bright sunny view world where everyone lives happily ever after but quite clearly message movie if you agree with message you will love this film disney may own pixar these days but there is artistic divide between two production styles if you want predictable sentimentality watch disney i loved disneys older classics but some their later offerings with exception beauty beast which was very good made me wince when i took my kids along but contrast i have loved every single film that pixar have made since toy story 1995 if you want something more wry but still possessing humour heart then pixar is probably going be your choice story is simple enough its year 2700 earth has become uninhabitable not through some terrible cataclysmic event but by slow accumulation suffocating junk its wasteland devoid living things as opening shots pan we see that skyscrapers are actually tall mounds compressed trash that compressing is being done by wall e waste allocation load lifter earth class small solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts all his clapped out siblings wall es only companion is cockroach he fills time his trailer home during long dust storms by watching old video hello dolly wall e is unlikely hero rusty but trusty i hesitate use word cute endearing works better one day he finds single plant growing he doesnt appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as rubics cube lighter trash can lid then space ship lands eve emerges extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator eve is whole different class wall e she can fly he is earth bound she is sleek dangerous single minded while he is bumbling rather dowdy they communicate with beeps eye twitches wall e is hooked when wall e gives eve plant he has found she recognizes that her directive find evidence photosynthesis earth is fulfilled shuts down ship comes back pick her up wall e clings desperate not lose her arriving at mother ship we find last remaining humans apparently all american who have fled earth at behest ceo buy n large conglomerate who ended up running everything humans are pretty much big obese babies who have lost use their legs are spoon fed artificial food platitudinous slogans equal measure rest movie involves plot by auto pilot take over ship keep it course away earth while captain tries take it home aided by wall e entertaining array quirky malfunctioning robots let loose repair bay some best moments are be found wall es interaction with everyday objects fire extinguisher example enables him zip around space balletic dance with eve he uses lid as hat imitate dancers he sees his video screen humans are not presented as wicked or evil just unthinking movie ends positive upbeat note when they recover use their legs return earth reclaim it as their home there are nods many classic sci fi movies pixars ubiquitous pizza truck is there near beginning they are not beyond little self criticism theres discarded ipod among wall es accumulated junk i found myself caring far more about animated characters wall e than supposedly human ones many regular movies director andrew stanton everyone at pixar deserve huge credit this movie i hope it is enormous financial hit them i also hope it gets oscar nomination not best animated feature but best film,0.5223887755270734,0.11649730293347313,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"

Or on how sarcastic, yet true all the scenes are, which ones are featuring the humans, who became more like a senseless pigs tied to their chair in front of their computer.

10.0,A Nutshell Review:,"In some strange twist of Fate, the local release of recent Pixar movies always had us here twiddling our thumbs wondering when it'll finally make its way to the screens, while we hear the accolades ring from the rest of the world in marvelling at the quality that Pixar continually churns out. It's likely that the distributors want to coincide the release with the local school holidays, but frankly, the money also comes from the adult crowd, as testament to this full house in one of the largest screens downtown during a late night screening with nary a noisy kid in tow.And I may sound like a broken record, but Pixar has done it again. Quality stories with quality animation, and it kept the run time to a manageable under 100 minutes, compared to the previous offering Ratatouille, which clocked near 120 minutes (or actually felt that long). I never expected WALL·E to pack in such a strong emotional punch, not that Pixar has never animated non-living objects before (such as Cars), but there's a certain child like innocence appeal that WALL·E possesses, that makes him very charming, and very endearing to the audience.As a Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class, Isaac Asimov's Robot directives has him firmly and dutifully carrying out his duties of compacting Earth's rubbish, as the last of its class on Earth to clean up the mess. Humans have now polluted the world so much that they took to Space in Star Trek inspired ship designs, to live out there while WALL·Es take over to do some massive spring cleaning. Until of course, our WALL·E becomes like The Last Man, erm, Robot on Earth with a cockroach companion, acting and emoting superbly that puts Will Smith to shame.The fantastic thing about WALL·E is that it can tell so much by so little. The first few minutes establish everything we need to know about the current world, and paints a very humanistic, soulful value to the dusty, dirty and rickety robot. He (see what I mean?) has a lot of eccentricities, and in performing his duties, develops quirks and becomes a collector (of junk) of sorts, which allows the creators to pump in plenty of sight gags and inside jokes ranging from sound effects (I swear my Apple is now a WALL·E pre-cursor) to paying homage to movies such as 2001: A Space Odessey.In essence, WALL·E is a love story in human terms, where the boy tries hard to get the girl, only to have her spurn his advances. EVE (which stands for Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator) is WALL·E's object of affection, who got sent to Earth as a probe for life. And my, she's a difficult one to handle, being state of the art, as well as packing a mean self-defense mechanism that makes breaking the ice really difficult. Not to mention as well, a fiery temper to boot. Which means our guy has to really try, and try hard, to break that wall down. Poor thing really, because all he wanted to do, was to hold her hand. The Beatles would have been proud.But of course you'll have to throw in tougher adversary and events to make it all the more worthwhile in WALL·E's pursuit of EVE, which spans lightyears and a plant that becomes the catalyst for their romance. A lot of the movie takes place on board The Axiom, the human ship where a vision of the future is presented, which metaphorically holds a mirror up to ourselves in our over reliance in technology that we're beginning to grow sideways, and not noticing the things that nature has in store for us, human to human communication, and the things that matter. It also has an soft environmental message and stance thrown in, but done so subtly that you wouldn't feel that it's being preachy and a turn off.I hate to admit it too that the movie turned me into a big softie, especially its clichéd finale, where you know what will happen, but yet want to second guess if the filmmakers could be so heartless with an ending that I thought would really make me shed a tear. However, it's Disney after all, and when you think of merchandise opportunities, then business sense prevails.WALL·E deserves every acclaim that it's got, and let me contribute mine too. If you have time to only watch one animated movie this year, or want to bring your kids to one, then make no mistake, WALL·E is the perfect choice, without a doubt, hands down. It makes it to my books as contender for the top 10 movies of the year. Highly recommended stuff, and the leads don't even speak much save to call out to each other!Oh, do put your bum on the seat early too, as with all Pixar features, there's always a short that preluded it, and Presto is nothing short of hilarious, and a crowd pleaser to rouse the audience into a frenzy before the main act takes over.
