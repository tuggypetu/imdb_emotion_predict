,A masterpiece,"In the magnificent 1957 classic The Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning home from the Crusades with his squire Jöns (Gunnar Bjönstrand) meets Death (Benkt Ekerot) on a lonely beach and challenges him to a game of chess. If he wins, he lives. While the game goes on, he gets a reprieve. It is the 14th century and suffering and pain abound. Penitents flog themselves, seminarians rob the dead, people go mad from fear, and witches are burned at the stake. It is the time of the Black Plague and Death has his hands full. As in the Greek legend of Kronos and medieval folklore, Bergman depicts Death as the Grim Reaper, a man clothed from head to foot in a black habit and hood. In The Seventh Seal, however, Death is not frightening or sinister, just an old man performing his job with a wry detachment.The film opens and closes with the passage from Revelation from which it takes its title: `When he broke open the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour' (Rev 8:1). Bergman's message, however, is more about the silence of God on earth than in heaven. Block is tormented by the fact that God will not outwardly reveal himself. He says to a priest during confession, `I want God to stretch out his hand to me, reveal himself and speak to me. But he remains silent, I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there"". But Block still senses the God within him and is tormented. ""Why can't I kill God within me?"" he asks. ""Why does he live on inside me, mocking and tormenting me till I have no rest, even though I curse him and try to tear him from my heart' Block asks Death if he knows anything but he knows nothing. He even asks a woman being taken to the stake if he can see the Devil so that he can ask him about God but all she says is to look into her eyes. The Seventh Seal is not all heavy ""significance"", however. It has a good story with believable characters, wonderful performances, lots of comic relief and moves easily from drama to comedy as in the great Shakespearean plays. We meet an actor named Jof (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their infant son Mikael. Block looks with envy on the simple love of this family for their child. Both Jof and Block see visions of the spiritual world but Jof's visions are life affirming whereas Block sees only reflections of darkness. The film has unforgettable images such as a hawk floating in a cloudless sky, two horses standing in the surf, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary caring for her child, and a frightening procession of plague-infected flagellants. Perhaps too melodramatic for modern viewers (it has been parodied), The Seventh Seal still touches a universal longing deep within us. Some view the film as a complete denial of God, but it seems that God does show his face -- only Block and his squire cannot see it. It is there in the wild strawberries, the fun of watching a troupe of players perform, the innocence of the little boy, the eyes of the young lovers, and the haunting visions of Jof. The film ends on a note of affirmation including one of the most memorable scenes in the history of cinema, the Danse Macabre, the Totentanz -- a string of silhouetted figures dancing in a line with arms outstretched as they are about to enter the unknown. In the magnificence of his vision and the timeless beauty of his art, Bergman has answered the question about God's existence simply in the act of posing it.",masterpiece,magnificent 1957 classic seventh seal by ingmar bergman antonius block max von sydow knight returning home crusades with his squire j ns gunnar bj nstrand meets death benkt ekerot lonely beach challenges him game chess if he wins he lives while game goes he gets reprieve it is 14th century suffering pain abound penitents flog themselves seminarians rob dead people go mad fear witches are burned at stake it is time black plague death has his hands full as greek legend kronos medieval folklore bergman depicts death as grim reaper man clothed head foot black habit hood seventh seal however death is not frightening or sinister just old man performing his job with wry detachment film opens closes with passage revelation which it takes its title when he broke open seventh seal there was silence heaven about half hour rev 8 1 bergmans message however is more about silence god earth than heaven block is tormented by fact that god will not outwardly reveal himself he says priest during confession i want god stretch out his hand me reveal himself speak me but he remains silent i call out him dark but no one seems be there but block still senses god within him is tormented why cant i kill god within me he asks why does he live inside me mocking tormenting me till i have no rest even though i curse him try tear him my heart block asks death if he knows anything but he knows nothing he even asks woman being taken stake if he can see devil so that he can ask him about god but all she says is look into her eyes seventh seal is not all heavy significance however it has good story with believable characters wonderful performances lots comic relief moves easily drama comedy as great shakespearean plays we meet actor named jof nils poppe his wife mia bibi andersson their infant son mikael block looks with envy simple love this family their child both jof block see visions spiritual world but jofs visions are life affirming whereas block sees only reflections darkness film has unforgettable images such as hawk floating cloudless sky two horses standing surf jofs vision virgin mary caring her child frightening procession plague infected flagellants perhaps too melodramatic modern viewers it has been parodied seventh seal still touches universal longing deep within us some view film as complete denial god but it seems that god does show his face only block his squire cannot see it it is there wild strawberries fun watching troupe players perform innocence little boy eyes young lovers haunting visions jof film ends note affirmation including one most memorable scenes history cinema danse macabre totentanz string silhouetted figures dancing line with arms outstretched as they are about enter unknown magnificence his vision timeless beauty his art bergman has answered question about gods existence simply act posing it,0.5192343604108309,0.09458556149732625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,The Quintessential Bergman Picture,"One thing that can be certain after watching the Seventh Seal, outside of being thankful for living in this century, is that Bergman knows his film-making- and imagery. He uses subliminal and not so subliminal techniques to convey a dying, frightened world, where making a living is almost impossible and the debate of god's control over life is discussed like un-rhyming yet fascinating poetry. The result is beautiful cinema, capturing the always foreboding fear and allure of the almighty and for the waiting death, appropriately staged in post-crusades, mid dark age Europe. Max Von Sydow gives an excellent showing as the opponent of Death (in a clever and meticulous chess game), yet the character of Death, played by Bengt Ekerot with chilling conviction, steals the show, if only for the alluring quality of the character. Even if the story veers it veers in good and interesting territory, focusing on people who convey Bergman's point and or style. I can't reveal what the bottom line point is (many newcomers to Bergman's work won't either, especially if you're not in the mood for soul searching), but one thing is for certain, an allegory on life and death is shown perfectly in the second to last shot of the reaper and his minions following in a dance across the field. This is one of the most pure of cinema's masterpieces and certainly Bergman's best cine.

,"Chilling, audacious, and awe-inspiring. An undisputed masterpiece.","The mysteries of religion and death have long been a popular focus among artists of all media, including film. And while many films question these mysteries, they seldom provide any real insight into the world of the unknown. In Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, these mysteries are not only questioned; they are dissected, splayed, and scrutinized.THE SEVENTH SEAL could very well serve as sort of a manifesto for existentialism. Its deep acuity and haunting imagery is powerful enough to jar even passive viewers out of their complacency and force them to examine their own reality. The delicately crafted story centers around a 14th century knight named Antonius Block and his ongoing game of chess with a shadowy, hooded figure: Death. Bergman uses this allegory not just to personify death, but to illustrate the lengths man will go to in order to avoid it. In the end, however, Death is a much better player than any of us, and though he may humor some of his opponents by letting them think that they have the advantage, the end result is inevitable: Death always wins. No matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are to win, we can never beat Death.In Antonius's search for answers, he encounters a variety of very unique characters, each with their own outlook on life, death, faith, fear and love. Their commentary on such matters is often dryly funny and always brilliant, continuously and effectively challenging our perceptions of the world around us. For me, the dialogue was definitely the high point of the film, as it was extremely thought-provoking and carefully constructed throughout. Almost every line spoken is, in one way or another, daunting and unforgettable. Jöns's description of love as ""the blackest of all plagues"" is a quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.THE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema. It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art. More importantly, THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn't just entertain, but also has the power to change the way one thinks.",chilling audacious awe inspiring undisputed masterpiece,mysteries religion death have long been popular focus among artists all media including film while many films question these mysteries they seldom provide any real insight into world unknown ingmar bergmans seventh seal these mysteries are not only questioned they are dissected splayed scrutinized seventh seal could very well serve as sort manifesto existentialism its deep acuity haunting imagery is powerful enough jar even passive viewers out their complacency force them examine their own reality delicately crafted story centers around 14th century knight named antonius block his ongoing game chess with shadowy hooded figure death bergman uses this allegory not just personify death but illustrate lengths man will go order avoid it end however death is much better player than any us though he may humor some his opponents by letting them think that they have advantage end result is inevitable death always wins no matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are win we can never beat death antoniuss search answers he encounters variety very unique characters each with their own outlook life death faith fear love their commentary such matters is often dryly funny always brilliant continuously effectively challenging our perceptions world around us me dialogue was definitely high point film as it was extremely thought provoking carefully constructed throughout almost every line spoken is one way or another daunting unforgettable j nss description love as blackest all plagues is quote that will forever be engraved my mind seventh seal truly is remarkable accomplishment world cinema it is deep mesmerizing darkly beautiful work art more importantly seventh seal is one those rare movies that doesnt just entertain but also has power change way one thinks,0.7286842105263157,0.28217105263157893,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,"Ingmar Bergman questions the meaning of life, death, faith, and the existence of God in this masterpiece of world cinema...","Antonius Block - ""Who are you?"" Death - ""I am Death."" Antonius Block - ""Have you come for me?"" Death - ""I have long walked by your side."" Antonius Block - ""So I have noticed.""The Seventh Seal, considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement, is the desperate prayer of a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman's films are often very deep, full of symbolism, philosophy, spirituality, emotion, and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning, death with no understanding, and faith with no validity, Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind.As the Black Plague ravages the world, a Antonius Block and his squire, Jons (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand, respectively), return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague, their countrymen mad with fear, and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death (Bengt Ekerot). Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts, knowing that Block cannot escape his fate, and the two begin their game. As the story continues, Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet, as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors, who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block's castle, but Death is always around the corner, biding his time.Brilliantly conceived, and stunningly executed, Bergman's vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle.A masterpiece!",ingmar bergman questions meaning life death faith existence god this masterpiece world cinema,antonius block who are you death i am death antonius block have you come me death i have long walked by your side antonius block so i have noticed seventh seal considered by some be ingmar bergmans greatest achievement is desperate prayer sensitive introspective insightful young man confused by horrors world around him ingmar bergmans films are often very deep full symbolism philosophy spirituality emotion thought seventh seal is classic bergman expressing his fear life with no meaning death with no understanding faith with no validity ingmar bergman takes us deep into well his mind as black plague ravages world antonius block his squire jons max von sydow gunnar bjornstrand respectively return fighting crusades they find their homeland devastated by plague their countrymen mad with fear their cause lost antonius block is confronted by death bengt ekerot block challenges death game chess provide him time seek answers questions that plague his mind as death has plagued his country death accepts knowing that block cannot escape his fate two begin their game as story continues block jons meet with several testaments agony that black death has brought upon their land they find young girl who is be burned at stake having been with devil they find madness eyes all they meet as everyone is convinced that god is angry is punishing world with plague they also find small group travelling actors who appear be only souls have remained sane midst all death fear block jons move across countryside hopes finding safety blocks castle but death is always around corner biding his time brilliantly conceived stunningly executed bergmans vision is brought screen through gunnar fischers powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you rest your life strong performances everyone involved bring humanity film max von sydows brave conflicted antonius block matching wits with bengt ekerots sinister omnipotent death is microcosm forces at work this breath taking interpretation mortal struggle masterpiece,0.6548809523809525,0.02470238095238095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.01, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,"Grim, but not entirely hopeless","Middle Ages: Antonius Blok, a Swedish knight, returns from the Crusades only to find his country dying of the plague, religious fundamentalists taking over and Death himself wanting him to come along. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess and is meanwhile driven to desperation because of the absence of God. This description sounds like a very serious, philosophical and dour film, and actually it is serious, philosophical and dour; but there is also a little warmth, hope and humor, maybe not for Antonius, but for the viewer.When Blok and Death interrupt their game of chess (due to the plague, Death is very busy), he meets two actors, Jof and Mia, with their little son, the most human characters of the film, and I don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like Joseph and Mary. These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time. But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.Another reason for the impact this almost 50-year-old film has still today is the acting: Max von Sydow's face always seems to reflect what Antonius Blok is thinking, Nils Poppe's performance as the naive actor and caring father is priceless and Bengt Ekerot's Death became a part of film history and survived all its spoofs (the best one being in Woody Allen's tremendously funny ""Love and Death""). But the best performance is done by Gunnar Björnstrand as Antonios Blok's misogynist squire, dryly commenting all their encounters even in the face of death.The Seventh Seal is not subtle in raising it's questions, that's for sure. But it makes you think about these questions nevertheless. It's disturbing and grim most of the time, but at the end it gives you the hope that it might become better.",grim but not entirely hopeless,middle ages antonius blok swedish knight returns crusades only find his country dying plague religious fundamentalists taking over death himself wanting him come along antonius challenges death game chess is meanwhile driven desperation because absence god this description sounds like very serious philosophical dour film actually it is serious philosophical dour but there is also little warmth hope humor maybe not antonius but viewer when blok death interrupt their game chess due plague death is very busy he meets two actors jof mia with their little son most human characters film i dont think its coincidence that there names sound very much like joseph mary these people may be little dim but they are good at heart you can see happiness antonius eyes when he is together with them first time but main aspect ingmar bergmans arguably best film are antonius bloks grim encounters as young girl about be burnt at stake as scapegoat plague haunting image huge crowd flagellants interrupting play jof mia trying convince crowd thery are doomed hardly any other film is that direct asking controversial essential questions about god religion mankind as seventh seal another reason impact this almost 50 year old film has still today is acting max von sydows face always seems reflect what antonius blok is thinking nils poppes performance as naive actor caring father is priceless bengt ekerots death became part film history survived all its spoofs best one being woody allens tremendously funny love death but best performance is done by gunnar bj rnstrand as antonios bloks misogynist squire dryly commenting all their encounters even face death seventh seal is not subtle raising its questions thats sure but it makes you think about these questions nevertheless its disturbing grim most time but at end it gives you hope that it might become better,0.4990929705215421,0.08959183673469388,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,One of the most extraordinary movies ever made. I cannot recommend 'The Seventh Seal' highly enough.,"'The Seventh Seal' is universally regarded as a masterpiece. It's one of those classics like 'Citizen Kane', 'Rear Window' or 'The Godfather' that has subtlety entered popular culture, so even if you haven't actually seen it you recognize references to it in other movies, TV, magazines and everyday conversation. The thing is like the aforementioned and 'Rashomon' and 'Sunset Blvd' it isn't regarded as a masterpiece for nothing, it really is one. I think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by 'The Seventh Seal'. It's still one of the most extraordinary movies ever made. Visually it's stunning, the acting is first rate, and the end result is mesmerizing. Once seen never forgotten is a cliche, but it's the perfect description for this amazing film. Max von Sydow brilliantly plays Antonius Block, a knight returning from the Crusades who challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a chess match. He is accompanied on his journey home by his cynical squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Jons is my favourite character in the movie, and as good as von Sydow is Bjornstrand's performance is even better. I also was very taken by the traveling actors who become part of Block's entourage, Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and confess to developing quite a crush on Mia. I cannot recommend 'The Seventh Seal' highly enough. Don't be put off by Bergman's highbrow reputation, this is a movie that can be appreciated by anybody, especially by old school horror fans. While it isn't strictly a horror movie itself anyone who admires the James Whale and Val Lewton classics of the 1930s and 1940s will find much to enjoy here.",one most extraordinary movies ever made i cannot recommend seventh seal highly enough,seventh seal is universally regarded as masterpiece its one those classics like citizen kane rear window or godfather that has subtlety entered popular culture so even if you havent actually seen it you recognize references it other movies tv magazines everyday conversation thing is like aforementioned rashomon sunset blvd it isnt regarded as masterpiece nothing it really is one i think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by seventh seal its still one most extraordinary movies ever made visually its stunning acting is first rate end result is mesmerizing once seen never forgotten is cliche but its perfect description this amazing film max von sydow brilliantly plays antonius block knight returning crusades who challenges death bengt ekerot chess match he is accompanied his journey home by his cynical squire jons gunnar bjornstrand jons is my favourite character movie as good as von sydow is bjornstrands performance is even better i also was very taken by traveling actors who become part blocks entourage jof nils poppe his wife mia bibi andersson confess developing quite crush mia i cannot recommend seventh seal highly enough dont be put off by bergmans highbrow reputation this is movie that can be appreciated by anybody especially by old school horror fans while it isnt strictly horror movie itself anyone who admires james whale val lewton classics 1930s 1940s will find much enjoy here,0.5261494252873563,0.25143678160919547,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.2}"

10.0,Compelling Drama From Ingmar Bergman,"A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence, Ingmar Bergman's `The Seventh Seal' is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically. In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home. For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him. Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate. Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block. But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey. As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released. And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. 	Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise. His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable. By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy. Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block. It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block. 	The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat). Written and directed by Bergman, `The Seventh Seal' is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory. One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity. It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.

6.0,Didn't like it but will definitely see it again in the distant future,"First of all, I have taken the time to read some posts on this movie before writing my review because I was searching for lots of answers. Didn't get many though, the popular thing fans like to say (and please, no pun intended) is that it just takes time to understand and appreciate this movie. To this I quickly reply that my perception of ""Det Sjunde Inseglet"" was that it is a rather dull, if not eventless, movie. It has some really nice moments (and for some reason I really liked the concept of a man playing chess with death itself) but in the end almost nothing is resolved except from the main protagonist who, at the brink of his death, discovers that it's love that makes people want to live ,very roughly put, I apologize, but even this revelation was hidden from the writer of this comment. And this is what bothered me the most, I couldn't read (for the lack of a better word) any of these important details, the movie very coldly rolled in front of my eyes and I just didn't get it! Now the easiest and dumbest thing to say is that this is all the fault of the director for not having a more universal way of film-making, rather the viewer has to decipher such information if he wants to fully appreciate his movies. I've just realized that I could say the same for Kubrick's visionary movies, I didn't like most, scratch that, none of them the first time around, they grew on me after a second viewing. And I dig Kubrick, a lot!!!I was also surprised with the admiration the cinematography received, it did not impact me whatsoever (and I am more so a visual that a sensual movie buff and love this kind of stuff). All in all, as Antonius Block, I am searching for answers, important ones. It bothers me a lot that I don't appreciate this movie, and I ask anyone to help me resolve my problem. What am I missing? What don't I get? What should I know about ""The Seventh Seal"", its meaning, its importance, its making, its director...?Thank you for your time",didnt like it but will definitely see it again distant future,first all i have taken time read some posts this movie before writing my review because i was searching lots answers didnt get many though popular thing fans like say please no pun intended is that it just takes time understand appreciate this movie this i quickly reply that my perception det sjunde inseglet was that it is rather dull if not eventless movie it has some really nice moments some reason i really liked concept man playing chess with death itself but end almost nothing is resolved except main protagonist who at brink his death discovers that its love that makes people want live very roughly put i apologize but even this revelation was hidden writer this comment this is what bothered me most i couldnt read lack better word any these important details movie very coldly rolled front my eyes i just didnt get it now easiest dumbest thing say is that this is all fault director not having more universal way film making rather viewer has decipher such information if he wants fully appreciate his movies ive just realized that i could say same kubricks visionary movies i didnt like most scratch that none them first time around they grew me after second viewing i dig kubrick lot i was also surprised with admiration cinematography received it did not impact me whatsoever i am more so visual that sensual movie buff love this kind stuff all all as antonius block i am searching answers important ones it bothers me lot that i dont appreciate this movie i ask anyone help me resolve my problem what am i missing what dont i get what should i know about seventh seal its meaning its importance its making its director thank you your time,0.49421568627450974,0.20494206773618537,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Top ten favorites. The Seventh Seal.,"Seventh Seal (1957) is one of my favorite movies. I have to rank it up there with A Touch of Zen, Seven Samurai and Battleship Potemkin. If there ever was such a thing as a perfect film, this one would have to be a nominee. I've never seen such a picture (and I probably never will) that was so moving, well shot, written, acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an all-time classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.A knight and his squire are returning home from the crusades. For the past few years he's been in the middle east fighting for Christ. On his trip home he notices a familiar face, one that he has seen many times on the battlefield. It is death and it wants him to come with him to his new home. The knight strikes a bargain with death, they'll play a game of chess if he can defeat death then he'll spare his life as well as the squire's. Death is amused by this unusual challenge and accepts it. But as long as the game is on the life will continue to live. So he uses this time to look back at life and realizes how precious it is. Along the way he meets a young couple, they're from a performing troupe. They have a baby and are content with life. The husband has visions and can see interesting things like the Virgin Mary and little Jesus. He can also see the darkness that lies ahead as Black Death ravages the countryside. Will the knight defeat Death? Can the couple weather the storm of chaos that lies ahead? To find out you'll have to watch The Seventh Seal, one of the finest films ever made.If Bergman never made another film this one would have made him a legendary film maker. But he continued to make even more classic cinema. This one however is his finest work.My highest recommendation possible.",top ten favorites seventh seal,seventh seal 1957 is one my favorite movies i have rank it up there with touch zen seven samurai battleship potemkin if there ever was such thing as perfect film this one would have be nominee ive never seen such picture i probably never will that was so moving well shot written acted directed chess game between knight death is all time classic words cannot describe how great this film is there will never be another one like it truly amazing piece celluloid knight his squire are returning home crusades past few years hes been middle east fighting christ his trip home he notices familiar face one that he has seen many times battlefield it is death it wants him come with him his new home knight strikes bargain with death theyll play game chess if he can defeat death then hell spare his life as well as squires death is amused by this unusual challenge accepts it but as long as game is life will continue live so he uses this time look back at life realizes how precious it is along way he meets young couple theyre performing troupe they have baby are content with life husband has visions can see interesting things like virgin mary little jesus he can also see darkness that lies ahead as black death ravages countryside will knight defeat death can couple weather storm chaos that lies ahead find out youll have watch seventh seal one finest films ever made if bergman never made another film this one would have made him legendary film maker but he continued make even more classic cinema this one however is his finest work my highest recommendation possible,0.5067033976124886,0.15233011937557395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Fully deserves its rep as a masterpiece,"This is one amazing film, and in my view Ingmar Bergman's best. Visually, The Seventh looks wonderful, the bleak scenery adds much to the mood, the cinematography is beautifully composed and skillful and the lighting is atmospheric. It also has many memorable images like with the flagellates, the hawk flying in the cloudless sky, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary and the milk and strawberries in the dusk. Bergman's direction is superb, Erik Nordgren's score is resolutely haunting and the dialogue is some of the most thought-provoking I've heard with some nice bawdy humour with especially the squire that doesn't feel misplaced. The story is like an allegory and meditation of life, death, love and fear(amongst other things), and it is dealt with in a very intelligent and careful manner. Again there are some timeless scenes like the ending, the scene of the girl about to be burnt, Death being challenged to a game of chess and with the jester. The acting is also exemplary, Max Von Sydow gives one of cinema's finest performances, stoic yet always commanding with a face that speaks volumes about what he's thinking. Bengt Ekerot evokes chills as Death, while Gunner Bjornstrand is suitably dry as the squire. All in all, a really amazing film, fully deserving of its reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",fully deserves its rep as masterpiece,this is one amazing film my view ingmar bergmans best visually seventh looks wonderful bleak scenery adds much mood cinematography is beautifully composed skillful lighting is atmospheric it also has many memorable images like with flagellates hawk flying cloudless sky jofs vision virgin mary milk strawberries dusk bergmans direction is superb erik nordgrens score is resolutely haunting dialogue is some most thought provoking ive heard with some nice bawdy humour with especially squire that doesnt feel misplaced story is like allegory meditation life death love fear amongst other things it is dealt with very intelligent careful manner again there are some timeless scenes like ending scene girl about be burnt death being challenged game chess with jester acting is also exemplary max von sydow gives one cinemas finest performances stoic yet always commanding with face that speaks volumes about what hes thinking bengt ekerot evokes chills as death while gunner bjornstrand is suitably dry as squire all all really amazing film fully deserving its reputation 10 10 bethany cox,0.615,0.30633333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.26}"

3.0,"Death takes knight, checkmate.","I suppose one has to view the reputed great classics of cinema to sort of test one's critical faculties against established standards and coming to this iconic film I was certainly aware of some of its famous imagery, in particular that of the soldier playing chess with Death, but nothing more than this. It does make for an arresting start to the film but after that I found it rather heavy going I must say.Once said soldier Max Van Sydow treks after the family of travelling performers, I struggled to make sense of the narrative as the film follows a picaresque trail of incidents such as as the backstage seduction of a fellow-performer's wife, the humiliation of the travelling husband at an inn and the death by fire of a young female witch. Where exactly are they all headed? Well, with Death silently and unobtrusively along for the ride, I think I get the inference; nobody lives forever.Mind you, I guess in all of it there's lots of stuff I'm still missing about faith, relationships, class, superstition and the human spirit, the meaning of life in short, but I'm afraid much of its symbolism passed me by. It is well shot in black and white and language-barrier notwithstanding appears to be well played with the actors certainly giving life to their individual characters, Van Sydow in particular, but I found the bitty, episodic development of the story as mystifying and unsatisfying as the higher allegorical meaning striven for.In fact the only really memorable scene for me was the chess match, which of course I knew about already, so really there was no need for me to watch the rest of it and I'm kind of sorry I did.Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid.",death takes knight checkmate,i suppose one has view reputed great classics cinema sort test ones critical faculties against established standards coming this iconic film i was certainly aware some its famous imagery particular that soldier playing chess with death but nothing more than this it does make arresting start film but after that i found it rather heavy going i must say once said soldier max van sydow treks after family travelling performers i struggled make sense narrative as film follows picaresque trail incidents such as as backstage seduction fellow performers wife humiliation travelling husband at inn death by fire young female witch where exactly are they all headed well with death silently unobtrusively along ride i think i get inference nobody lives forever mind you i guess all it theres lots stuff im still missing about faith relationships class superstition human spirit meaning life short but im afraid much its symbolism passed me by it is well shot black white language barrier notwithstanding appears be well played with actors certainly giving life their individual characters van sydow particular but i found bitty episodic development story as mystifying unsatisfying as higher allegorical meaning striven fact only really memorable scene me was chess match which course i knew about already so really there was no need me watch rest it im kind sorry i did not my cup tea im afraid,0.4946031746031746,0.09769841269841269,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
5.0,The Seventh Seal (1957) **,"Let me make this pretty quick -- a friend brought this Ingmar Bergman ""classic"" to the house last night (on Blu-ray), and it was my first experience with this acclaimed filmmaker. All I can say is, I was immediately struck by the cinematography, and I started getting interested in the idea of a knight (Max Von Sydow) playing chess with ""Death"" himself, as a means of deciding the fate of his own soul.... but that's as far as it went.From then on, nothing made much sense and the noble core idea of the film (presumably about questioning death, and the existence of God) seemed to go out the window, as we spend our time with secondary characters I just could not become interested in. I wanted to focus more on Max von Sydow's troubled crusader and his crisis of faith, especially since I myself am presently going through some personal bouts of despair in my personal life with my own crosses to bear... but he was only sparingly used, and I just could not follow any type of coherent storyline to this thing, for all its pretty picture style. There was no story, just images... and it's not that this approach never works for me in other films, but it didn't connect for me this time. I can't say that this is going to be my last visitation with Bergman, but this is not a promising start, considering this is allegedly one of his greatest works, if not THE greatest.

9.0,Really weird but worth seeing for the experience,"This is a strange movie--period! However, it is also one of the most parodied films and for that reason alone it is worth seeing! Now, on to explain the part that is parodied: A man is returning from war in the time of the Reformation and the plague is about the countryside. The man meets the Angel of Death and is told it is him time to die. The man asks if he can first challenge him in a game of chess--if the man wins, then his life will be spared. The Grim Reaper, not wanting to be a spoilsport, agrees and they play a game that starts and stops again and again. This exact same contest has been used in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the cartoon series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and an experimental film De Düva: The Dove (starring Madeline Kahn among others). In the Bill and Ted movie, they did not play chess but a series of games including Battleship and Twister! In The Dove, it was a badminton game! I can't remember what the game was in the cartoon series, but instead of their deaths, the children played the Grim Reaper over the soul of their pet hamster! Isn't is weird how this art film has appeared again and again and in the silliest of places! Give it a try to see the FIRST death-match and because it is a good film--with excellent performances all around--from Max Von Sydow to all the supporting players.

10.0,Bergman's Brilliance Abounds,"What makes The Seventh Seal - an apocryphal and uncompromising fable of medieval Sweden - one of the masterpieces of Cinema ? Ingmar Bergman creates a believable world of dark happenings, wherein Death can play chess with a Knight, witches burn at the stake, with flagellants, and plague ever present. Through superb black and white images, each carefully composed for maximum effect, sets and costumes, his fine actors seem to truly inhabit this frightening world. Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bjornstrand, and Bengt Ekerot lead a marvelous cast. But its not all doom and gloom, as the Knight tries to determine in his quest, the meaning of life, and if God exists at all. There are moments of sheer happiness and peace, such as the sequence of the milk and strawberries at dusk, and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Which balances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of the photography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended.

8.0,A Very Personal Rejection of a Religious Childhood,"The story of Antonius Block is the story of an agnostic who has begun to doubt. Is life really meaningless? Is the only true ethic of life, to simply enjoy the moment? If God is there, why does he not answer? Why does he leave men with kind hearts and noble aspirations to fumble in the dark dying of the plague with no answers? Perhaps, Antonius reasons, the answers only come from Death.No wonder then, that as Death approaches him, he cajoles the spirit to play a game with him. His intentions are to win, but most importantly, to find answers. The little I know of Bergman's youth, the Paladin (Antonius Block) seems to symbolize Bergman's last struggles with his strict religious instruction as a child. Antonius' struggles, Antonius' angst, Antonius' withering agnosticism is a reflection of where Bergman was philosophically at this early stage in his life and career.The climax of the film is of course the final 'duel' with Death. Antonius attempts to cheat death and in the end, death cheats him. This is an especially crushing defeat for Antonius, because the answers Death gives him, about the knowledge within Death itself, is Antonius' worst fears come true.It struck me, that in the final moments, when each character faces there own mortality right in front of them, that the strongest and purest reaction of them all, is the one from the squire, the atheist voice in the film. I think if you are an atheist, this film is going to please you, because clearly the sanest characters in this film are either indifferent or deny God's existence entirely.Whether it was intentional or not, I think Seventh Seal is a very personal film. Bergman deconstructs his father's teachings to us openly. There's nothing sublime here; this is a clear rejection of religion and the notion that death somehow provides 'answers'. The only answers, according to this film, lie in life and not death. A message Bergman delivers to us in striking fashion. A message Bergman knows directly contradicts what he was taught as a child.I think this is why later in life, Bergman disowned this film. I think he saw too clearly, how much of a very personal statement it was and how in some cases it was a vindictive film against his parents. It's why I believe, Bergman, couldn't stand to watch it later in life, after he had reconciled with his parents.While Bergman disowned it, for the rest of us, we can admire it. For us, the Seventh Seal is simple genius. A dark, but beautiful film, that is pure and meaningful, because it is so very personal. I confess, I am a layman and I know little of Bergman's work and indeed have only seen this film once. But, I loved this film. It struck a very personal reaction in me, however uninformed that reaction might be.

9.0,"""I want knowledge! Not faith, not assumptions, but knowledge.""","THE SEVENTH SEAL is a film that presents a dramatic fantasy game between meaning of life and fear of death. A knight and his squire have returned to their country after a ten-year crusade. Deadly disease ravaged country. Knight faces Death. He calls Death on the multi-day game of chess...The story has touched serious philosophical and religious topics. However, the story is full of intrigue, dark humor and hope. The protagonists are distracted between the vicious disease, self-pity and torture. It is interesting to see a deeply disillusioned knight, a cynical squire who hates women, a cheating wife, evil priests, a mute girl and seemingly healthy and happy family on the same road. The truth is all around them. The main protagonist used to persistently ask questions to which only he has a valid response. This film reveals some controversial issues. Is deadly disease greater threat to man or the man is the greatest enemy to himself? Mr. Bergman has painted realistic effects of fear, horror, cynicism, surprises, love and health on human faces.Max von Sydow as Antonius Block, the knight is a more serious version of Don Quixote. Gunnar Björnstrand Jöns, the squire is a character who never changes his mood. He always has some sort of cynical jokes or words of contempt for each occurrence. Bengt Ekerot is Death in the true sense of that word. Nils Poppe as Jof is a juggler who has strange predictions. Fortunately, no one believes him. Bibi Andersson as Mia, Jof's wife is a beautiful and cheerful woman who does not fit into the landscape.Life is a hard journey. The rare moments of happiness are a sort of salvation. The end of the film emphasizes the transience of life and the power of death which no one can escape.

6.0,Death never takes a holiday...,"While I'm not going overboard in extolling the virtues of THE SEVENTH SEAL, I do think it has some striking imagery and had the potential to be the ultimate work of art Ingmar Bergman was obviously striving for. But do I think he achieved it? No...for the simple reason that it leaves us unenlightened on the subject with no new knowledge.Bergman really has no answers to the age old questions we all have about life and death and what happens in the hereafter. And giving Death a human face seems to me the wrong decision on Bergman's part. He should have kept him a hooded spectre and nothing more--faceless and unknown within the shadows of his hood. Humanizing him doesn't work, at least not for me.A cruel streak runs through some of the more boisterous moments, such as when one of the actors is put through some hazing by a sadistic man who later gets his comeuppance. Everyone laughs and applauds as the man is humiliated beyond the endurance of this spectator for the sake of bawdy humor which seems forced and contrived, as does much of the clowning by the group of actors.But there are so many good things about the richly photographed film, that I don't want to give this review an entirely negative impression. But the truth is it offers no new insights into the age old questions of life and death. It's all presented as an allegory with religious symbols (flagellation, the cross, the witch burning) and we suspect that among the many utterances we hear from The Devil will be something to ponder and think about. But no. There's only the hopelessness that Death offers when the plague is rampant over the land and is something which cannot be avoided by man, no matter how clever he thinks he is. The chess game that the Black Knight proposes is a ruse that the Devil sees through from the start. And we suspect near the end that he knows the young couple with the infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening, even behind his back. The young couple will be doomed too, eventually. Death will consume all.But Max van Sydow is excellent as The Knight questioning his reason for being and his reason for dying. The B&W cinematography evokes the Middle Ages with striking scenes that stay in the mind afterwards and the film, while bleak and disturbing, is always riveting to watch.It's a very engrossing film, but there are many weaknesses. I don't consider it the masterpiece that so many others label it.",death never takes holiday,while im not going overboard extolling virtues seventh seal i do think it has some striking imagery had potential be ultimate work art ingmar bergman was obviously striving but do i think he achieved it no simple reason that it leaves us unenlightened subject with no new knowledge bergman really has no answers age old questions we all have about life death what happens hereafter giving death human face seems me wrong decision bergmans part he should have kept him hooded spectre nothing more faceless unknown within shadows his hood humanizing him doesnt work at least not me cruel streak runs through some more boisterous moments such as when one actors is put through some hazing by sadistic man who later gets his comeuppance everyone laughs applauds as man is humiliated beyond endurance this spectator sake bawdy humor which seems forced contrived as does much clowning by group actors but there are so many good things about richly photographed film that i dont want give this review entirely negative impression but truth is it offers no new insights into age old questions life death its all presented as allegory with religious symbols flagellation cross witch burning we suspect that among many utterances we hear devil will be something ponder think about but no theres only hopelessness that death offers when plague is rampant over land is something which cannot be avoided by man no matter how clever he thinks he is chess game that black knight proposes is ruse that devil sees through start we suspect near end that he knows young couple with infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening even behind his back young couple will be doomed too eventually death will consume all but max van sydow is excellent as knight questioning his reason being his reason dying b w cinematography evokes middle ages with striking scenes that stay mind afterwards film while bleak disturbing is always riveting watch its very engrossing film but there are many weaknesses i dont consider it masterpiece that so many others label it,0.5054163483575247,0.051019013666072484,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,Intelligent and accessible with incredible imagery,"'I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams', a line spoken by Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman, the film explores, through an allegorical fashion, human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country, which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone, and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death, who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home; encountering several different characters, but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game. Bergman's style is not straight forward, rather quite symbolic and philosophical. The imagery at times is astounding, and I still (a month after seeing the film for the first time) see the image of 'the dance with Death' in my head when I think of the film. However, what I discovered was that this film carries with it a lot of intellectual and philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted. Nothing is really spelled out in this film, but it was much more easily 'accessible' than I thought it would be; I assumed I would have to put on my 'Affected Art House' hat on to watch it and nothing could be farther from the truth. Steeped in beautiful irony, the film, while having the pervasive specter of Death hanging over it, really celebrates life through its characters and their unusual circumstances. It is truly unfortunate that the powerful image of man playing chess with Death has become such a cliché, and oft repeated in some ridiculous manner or another. Bergman directed a thought-provoking and beautiful film with 'The Seventh Seal', and I personally look forward to seeing it again, this time not to grasp the story, but to marvel at the incredible images. I would recommend this film to anyone, but I especially highly recommend it to those who consider themselves students of film  it will give you a lot to chew on. 8/10--Shelly",intelligent accessible with incredible imagery,i live now world ghosts prisoner my dreams line spoken by antonius block max von sydow seventh seal is also good descriptor this critically lauded film directed by ingmar bergman film explores through allegorical fashion human relationships struggle with ones own psyche block is knight his way home crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country which has been ravaged by black plague along way he avers that he doesnt care about anyone questions existence god who could allow these things happen beginning film he meets death who informs him that it is his time block manages push off death little while by distracting him with chess game while he travels home encountering several different characters but death is always following close behind until inevitable end game bergmans style is not straight forward rather quite symbolic philosophical imagery at times is astounding i still month after seeing film first time see image dance with death my head when i think film however what i discovered was that this film carries with it lot intellectual philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted nothing is really spelled out this film but it was much more easily accessible than i thought it would be i assumed i would have put my affected art house hat watch it nothing could be farther truth steeped beautiful irony film while having pervasive specter death hanging over it really celebrates life through its characters their unusual circumstances it is truly unfortunate that powerful image man playing chess with death has become such clich oft repeated some ridiculous manner or another bergman directed thought provoking beautiful film with seventh seal i personally look forward seeing it again this time not grasp story but marvel at incredible images i would recommend this film anyone but i especially highly recommend it those who consider themselves students film it will give you lot chew 8 10 shelly,0.5899122807017544,0.18075956937799043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,"An Allegorical Take On Life, Death, Religion, Faith & Existential Angst","Painting a grim portrait of the western world plagued by the Black Death, threading together several norms of the medieval era into a single setting, and addressing its themes by observing them through contemporary lens, The Seventh Seal is a fable of life, death, religion, faith & existential angst that, despite the allegorical treatment, makes sure its narrative remains somewhat accessible.Written & directed by Ingmar Bergman, one of the first things that stands out about this sermon is the dark & deathlike atmosphere the plot comes drenched in. Add to that, the whole premise of playing chess against the Grim Reaper with one's life on the line sounds interesting on paper. The story however piles on more subplots and digs deeper into the philosophical & spiritual elements that only slow down the ride.The crisp black n white cinematography is captivating throughout. Characters of all moods are present in the picture. The period details may not be appropriate but the gloomy aura is finely captured. And comfortably steering the film past the finish line are the sturdy performances, led by Max von Sydow who plays a knight locked in a game with Death itself, latter personified by Bengt Ekerot. And the scenes between the two are easy standouts.Overall, The Seventh Seal is actually easier to navigate than what I was expecting, and the parallels viewers can draw between the medieval pandemic and one we're dealing with currently makes the journey rather intriguing. Nonetheless, the relaxed pace & numbing speeches still made it a frustrating sit for me and failed to strike an emotional chord. As is the case with previous Bergman entries, I do get its legacy & repute but don't feel any personal love for it.",allegorical take life death religion faith existential angst,painting grim portrait western world plagued by black death threading together several norms medieval era into single setting addressing its themes by observing them through contemporary lens seventh seal is fable life death religion faith existential angst that despite allegorical treatment makes sure its narrative remains somewhat accessible written directed by ingmar bergman one first things that stands out about this sermon is dark deathlike atmosphere plot comes drenched add that whole premise playing chess against grim reaper with ones life line sounds interesting paper story however piles more subplots digs deeper into philosophical spiritual elements that only slow down ride crisp black n white cinematography is captivating throughout characters all moods are present picture period details may not be appropriate but gloomy aura is finely captured comfortably steering film past finish line are sturdy performances led by max von sydow who plays knight locked game with death itself latter personified by bengt ekerot scenes between two are easy standouts overall seventh seal is actually easier navigate than what i was expecting parallels viewers can draw between medieval pandemic one were dealing with currently makes journey rather intriguing nonetheless relaxed pace numbing speeches still made it frustrating sit me failed strike emotional chord as is case with previous bergman entries i do get its legacy repute but dont feel any personal love it,0.3928120490620492,0.019083694083694085,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.47}"
3.0,I keep an open mind often enough. I'm calling this one out as superficial.,"For a movie in which a knight literally plays chess with death, this is pretty bland.Nothing happens but a bunch of bland characters just chatting.I don't care if it explores the theme of death or antithesis or something. A subtext is not the same thing as substance. In summary, despite its reputation for being nuanced, ambitious cinema, I feel that amidst its ambition it is lacking in various signifant aspects such as pacing and chatacterization and that it doesn't have as much nuance as it thinks it does.",i keep open mind often enough im calling this one out as superficial,movie which knight literally plays chess with death this is pretty bland nothing happens but bunch bland characters just chatting i dont care if it explores theme death or antithesis or something subtext is not same thing as substance summary despite its reputation being nuanced ambitious cinema i feel that amidst its ambition it is lacking various signifant aspects such as pacing chatacterization that it doesnt have as much nuance as it thinks it does,0.5741666666666667,0.03666666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
5.0,Everything but the Kitchen Sink,"It is said that one can't avoid death and taxes. In this much praised allegorical film, a man tries to avoid death. Perhaps a film about a man avoiding taxes would have been more amusing. This film is episodic rather than having a narrative flow. It seems Bergman made a checklist of all the important themes and made sure he touched each one: love, marriage, infidelity, family, society, crime, punishment, and, of course, god and death. It is populated with Bergman regulars, including von Sydow as a knight who spews platitudes every time he opens his mouth. The cinematography is impressive. Otherwise, it's tough going for those who are not Bible scholars.",everything but kitchen sink,it is said that one cant avoid death taxes this much praised allegorical film man tries avoid death perhaps film about man avoiding taxes would have been more amusing this film is episodic rather than having narrative flow it seems bergman made checklist all important themes made sure he touched each one love marriage infidelity family society crime punishment course god death it is populated with bergman regulars including von sydow as knight who spews platitudes every time he opens his mouth cinematography is impressive otherwise its tough going those who are not bible scholars,0.6622222222222222,0.3011111111111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Thought-provoking and profound,"THE SEVENTH SEAL is Ingmar Bergman's meditation on Christianity and death, told through the tableau of a medieval setting and a mixed bunch of players on the stage. Max von Sydow headlines the cast as the Crusader knight who famously challenges Death to a game of chess, and the film follows his ruminations as well as the lives of others caught up in the same time and place.This is certainly an original film, I can't think of one quite like it, and one that's tough to describe. Stylistically it has the same kind of quality as a Kurosawa film to it, such as RASHOMON. It has an almost episodic feel in places, and there's no real thrust to the narrative; instead it's more of a depiction of everyday life, exploring interactions between various folk. But despite the lack of obvious focus, it's never less than utterly watchable. Melodrama it might be, but it's good melodrama.Bergman has a way of directing that reminds me of Kurosawa; he doesn't do anything obvious but his film nevertheless looks stylish and carefully composed throughout. The Swedish cast members are all very good and there are lots of powerful moments, from a jester being bulled in a wayside inn to the ultimate fate of a hapless witch. The ending employs a classic bit of imagery that left me feeling chilled. The whole enterprise is dark, morbidly so, and yet the depth and maturity of the insight are what makes it a classic.",thought provoking profound,seventh seal is ingmar bergmans meditation christianity death told through tableau medieval setting mixed bunch players stage max von sydow headlines cast as crusader knight who famously challenges death game chess film follows his ruminations as well as lives others caught up same time place this is certainly original film i cant think one quite like it one thats tough describe stylistically it has same kind quality as kurosawa film it such as rashomon it has almost episodic feel places theres no real thrust narrative instead its more depiction everyday life exploring interactions between various folk but despite lack obvious focus its never less than utterly watchable melodrama it might be but its good melodrama bergman has way directing that reminds me kurosawa he doesnt do anything obvious but his film nevertheless looks stylish carefully composed throughout swedish cast members are all very good there are lots powerful moments jester being bulled wayside inn ultimate fate hapless witch ending employs classic bit imagery that left me feeling chilled whole enterprise is dark morbidly so yet depth maturity insight are what makes it classic,0.5382828282828281,0.07715488215488213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.06, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.49}"
9.0,"""I live now in a world of phantoms, a prisoner of my own dreams.""","On the Criterion Collection interview with Ingmar Bergman, he relates that he wrote the chess scene over his own fear of dying. This would have been an immensely interesting idea to explore, but after he mentions it, the interview is practically over. That left me rather frustrated.The film itself may also leave one rather frustrated, as it explores the principal character agonizing over God's unwillingness to show His face and answer his existential questions about the meaning of life and the certainty of death. When Death (Bengt Ekerot) makes his entrance to claim him a victim, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) challenges the Grim Reaper to a game of chess, the winner to exact his own reward. The Knight must quickly readjust his game plan after he unwittingly reveals his strategy to the black clad harvester of souls.The film is set during the time of the Black Plague, following a 'worthless' crusade of ten years that the Knight and his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) participated in. All around them are wanderers half crazed with fear at the thought of the Plague approaching. All the time Death appropriates his victims, he claims to know nothing and hold no secrets. Fearing his own demise, Block (Bergman?) disrupts the chess board, intent on prolonging his existence in a world full of uncertainty.""The Seventh Seal"" is Bergman's stunning allegory of man's search for meaning, but what I've come to understand after many years is that each person must come to terms with himself from within. Attempting to extract answers from a single source is bound to end in disappointment, trapped if you will in a Knight's world of phantoms and dreams more like nightmares. This is the kind of film that presents more questions than answers, as I'm sure Bergman understood and intended.",i live now world phantoms prisoner my own dreams,criterion collection interview with ingmar bergman he relates that he wrote chess scene over his own fear dying this would have been immensely interesting idea explore but after he mentions it interview is practically over that left me rather frustrated film itself may also leave one rather frustrated as it explores principal character agonizing over gods unwillingness show his face answer his existential questions about meaning life certainty death when death bengt ekerot makes his entrance claim him victim antonius block max von sydow challenges grim reaper game chess winner exact his own reward knight must quickly readjust his game plan after he unwittingly reveals his strategy black clad harvester souls film is set during time black plague following worthless crusade ten years that knight his squire jons gunnar bjornstrand participated all around them are wanderers half crazed with fear at thought plague approaching all time death appropriates his victims he claims know nothing hold no secrets fearing his own demise block bergman disrupts chess board intent prolonging his existence world full uncertainty seventh seal is bergmans stunning allegory mans search meaning but what ive come understand after many years is that each person must come terms with himself within attempting extract answers single source is bound end disappointment trapped if you will knights world phantoms dreams more like nightmares this is kind film that presents more questions than answers as im sure bergman understood intended,0.48395337301587305,0.050727137445887444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.48}"
