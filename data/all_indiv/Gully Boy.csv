9.0,Slow and Calm Masterpiece,"Gully Boy merges into you and makes you feel as a part of Murad's journey (Ranveer Singh). Dharavi 17 is where he stays and his daily struggles,his exposure to rap, his love life, a mistake in relationship,his guide,his well-wisher,his bonding with parents.. A common man's journey actually. We all have such stories in our life. Zoya has brilliantly captured the gully life here and shows how it moulds oneself with the amount of time you spend with people around you.With every movie this guy gets better.So once again Ranveer does his one of career's best. Alia is the show stealer with dialogues that gets the whistle. We have three supporting Vijays here in this movie Vijay Raaz(father),Vijay Maurya(Uncle),Vijay Varma(Friend) and they are spot on. Amruta Subash(mother) expresses her life's melancholy brilliantly.Kalki as sky gets limited screen time but packs a punch and last but not the least the game changer Siddhant Chaturvedi(MC Sher). He overpowers Ranveer in many scenes.I won't stop if I start mentioning how apt and brilliant is the screenplay here.. Cinematography by Jay Oza and crisp editing by Nitin Baid are felt on the screen as the movie even being slow in pace doesn't be a boring affair in 2 hrs 35 mins. Zoya has struck a win win here.Finally, what made it more lively was screen time for real life rappers like Emiway Bantaai,Stony Psycho and Dope Daddy from Dopedealicz , Kaambhaari and also a second of Brodha V.Just felt like saying this that how well the hip hop culture has been able to connect with our generation. Emiway Bantaai's one second presence in first half and the crowd erupted like never seen before. Also , his acts in second half are treat to watch. Not to forget Kaam Bhaari is there too.All in all 9/10 from my side. Go for it folks. Watch it for a beautiful journey of the guy from streets.",slow calm masterpiece,gully boy merges into you makes you feel as part murads journey ranveer singh dharavi 17 is where he stays his daily struggles his exposure rap his love life mistake relationship his guide his well wisher his bonding with parents common mans journey actually we all have such stories our life zoya has brilliantly captured gully life here shows how it moulds oneself with amount time you spend with people around you with every movie this guy gets better so once again ranveer does his one careers best alia is show stealer with dialogues that gets whistle we have three supporting vijays here this movie vijay raaz father vijay maurya uncle vijay varma friend they are spot amruta subash mother expresses her lifes melancholy brilliantly kalki as sky gets limited screen time but packs punch last but not least game changer siddhant chaturvedi mc sher he overpowers ranveer many scenes i wont stop if i start mentioning how apt brilliant is screenplay here cinematography by jay oza crisp editing by nitin baid are felt screen as movie even being slow pace doesnt be boring affair 2 hrs 35 mins zoya has struck win win here finally what made it more lively was screen time real life rappers like emiway bantaai stony psycho dope daddy dopedealicz kaambhaari also second brodha v just felt like saying this that how well hip hop culture has been able connect with our generation emiway bantaais one second presence first half crowd erupted like never seen before also his acts second half are treat watch not forget kaam bhaari is there too all all 9 10 my side go it folks watch it beautiful journey guy streets,0.4616071428571429,0.224488936988937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,The Hate U Give to Youth ...,"Gully Boy - A+ (Award Worthy)After listening to massive wave of backlash against Alia Bhatt and Gully Boy from Kangana Ranaut after untimely death of Sushant Singh Rajput (May he rest in peace). I decided to watch Gully Boy out of curiosity and I was amazed how terribly wrong Kangana was to attribute someone's death to a movie or certain people. Gully Boy for a person like me who rarely watch Bollywood movies unless it's on Netflix is such a game changer. A whole movie not only on rap music woven into struggles of a poor guys from slums with the message of empowerment to youth, friendships and dream was astounding.I don't even listen to rap music besides EMINEM, and I was enchanted by Indian rap which I have never heard in my life. I was amazed that they used no profanity laced rap in the movie to make it more appealing to younger crowed either. They showed Muslim background where singing in the family is the forbidden and empowered even Hijab wearing Alia Bhatt to speak her mind and still be the leading lady. To say she won award for 15 mints screen time is utterly ridiculous, you don't have to win an award for how much time you have spend on screen. Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs and Judi Dench in Elizabeth won Oscars for merely roles 10-15mints screen time. A movie like Gully Boy, which is one of kind real musical directed by a women is commendable.The hate towards the movie from some part of the very vocal group speaks volume of misogyny in some individuals. who want to take advantage of someone's demise to settle their own old scores against old enemies from YashRaj, Karan Johar, Bhatt Family, Hrithik's family friends Javed Akhtar etc etc. is utterly shameful. A person who never worked with him or helped him while he was being trolled for Drive and rumours now is trying to become his ally. Nepotism exists in every industry even a shopkeeper hands over businesses to his family not stranger and to train them you have to put them through the business. Some get successful, but mostly miserably fail. Legendary actors like Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan were outsiders, there is mix balance of both sides and new crop Ayushman Khurrana, Kangana Ranaut, Taapsee Panu, Rajkumar Rao, Katrina Kaif, Kriti Sanon and Bhumi Padnekar are proof that if you have talent you can make space, it won't be easy but if you want an easy life then don't chase your dreams. Chasing dreams and accomplishing them is going to be hard and I am glad that this movie shows that and put a light on such topic and I hope people understand and focus on positivity and not the negativity.A powerful movie which showed camaraderie among friends without jealousy, determination, family love and struggles living in slums with rap music is unimaginable in Bollywood mainstream cinema with top actors Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt. The movie deserves all accolades as cinema like this needs to be encouraged and appreciated.",hate u give youth,gully boy award worthy after listening massive wave backlash against alia bhatt gully boy kangana ranaut after untimely death sushant singh rajput may he rest peace i decided watch gully boy out curiosity i was amazed how terribly wrong kangana was attribute someones death movie or certain people gully boy person like me who rarely watch bollywood movies unless its netflix is such game changer whole movie not only rap music woven into struggles poor guys slums with message empowerment youth friendships dream was astounding i dont even listen rap music besides eminem i was enchanted by indian rap which i have never heard my life i was amazed that they used no profanity laced rap movie make it more appealing younger crowed either they showed muslim background where singing family is forbidden empowered even hijab wearing alia bhatt speak her mind still be leading lady say she won award 15 mints screen time is utterly ridiculous you dont have win award how much time you have spend screen anthony hopkins silence lambs judi dench elizabeth won oscars merely roles 10 15mints screen time movie like gully boy which is one kind real musical directed by women is commendable hate towards movie some part very vocal group speaks volume misogyny some individuals who want take advantage someones demise settle their own old scores against old enemies yashraj karan johar bhatt family hrithiks family friends javed akhtar etc etc is utterly shameful person who never worked with him or helped him while he was being trolled drive rumours now is trying become his ally nepotism exists every industry even shopkeeper hands over businesses his family not stranger train them you have put them through business some get successful but mostly miserably fail legendary actors like shahrukh khan madhuri dixit juhi chawla akshay kumar vidya balan were outsiders there is mix balance both sides new crop ayushman khurrana kangana ranaut taapsee panu rajkumar rao katrina kaif kriti sanon bhumi padnekar are proof that if you have talent you can make space it wont be easy but if you want easy life then dont chase your dreams chasing dreams accomplishing them is going be hard i am glad that this movie shows that put light such topic i hope people understand focus positivity not negativity powerful movie which showed camaraderie among friends without jealousy determination family love struggles living slums with rap music is unimaginable bollywood mainstream cinema with top actors ranveer singh alia bhatt movie deserves all accolades as cinema like this needs be encouraged appreciated,0.6362026185196917,0.14330852074754513,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"

2.0,Entertainment ekdum hard hai bhai..!!,"Zoya changes gear with Gully Boy. It's the story of Murad (Ranveer Singh), his aspiration, ambition, his family, his love Safeena (Alia Bhatt), his friendships and the path he takes to fulfil his dream. At the forefront, Gully Boy may seem like a movie about the underground rappers but actually, it is much more than that.The movie is mainly about human relations, connections, emotions and dynamics. There is no filmmaker better than Zoya Akhtar who can portray and handle human complexities in such a brilliant way. Gully Boy will surely be counted amongst her best work.Ranveer and Alia's chemistry is too cute to be true. They are like a house on fire...,Vijay Varma special mention - He is too good...as Moeen,, got a good depth to the character.If the writing of the movie and Zoya's direction is of the highest order, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, debutant Sidhant Chaturvedi and other actors compliment it with fabulous performances.Alia Bhatt, is the scene stealer. Every scene she appears in is a riot. She is endearing, to say the least. This is one of her best performances and her character is a crash course in women empowerment. I am sure everyone's gonna fall in love with her.On the downside though, the pacing takes a dip in the second half.Gully Boy is one of the best movies to come out of Indian cinema in recent times. Watch it for Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt's dazzling performances. And moreover, watch it for the master filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. Hats off to her. This one's a winner.",entertainment ekdum hard hai bhai,zoya changes gear with gully boy its story murad ranveer singh his aspiration ambition his family his love safeena alia bhatt his friendships path he takes fulfil his dream at forefront gully boy may seem like movie about underground rappers but actually it is much more than that movie is mainly about human relations connections emotions dynamics there is no filmmaker better than zoya akhtar who can portray handle human complexities such brilliant way gully boy will surely be counted amongst her best work ranveer alias chemistry is too cute be true they are like house fire vijay varma special mention he is too good as moeen got good depth character if writing movie zoyas direction is highest order ranveer singh alia bhatt debutant sidhant chaturvedi other actors compliment it with fabulous performances alia bhatt is scene stealer every scene she appears is riot she is endearing say least this is one her best performances her character is crash course women empowerment i am sure everyones gonna fall love with her downside though pacing takes dip second half gully boy is one best movies come out indian cinema recent times watch it ranveer singh alia bhatts dazzling performances moreover watch it master filmmaker zoya akhtar hats off her this ones winner,0.5202097505668934,0.372874149659864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.26}"

What I think also helped is the addition of a fiery romance, a cultural family dispute and a terrific ensemble cast.

8.0,"""Change your reality to match your dreams""","Gully Boy is an extraordinary film about a young Muslim student from the slums of Mumbai, who is a fan of hip-hop music and who keeps secret his dreams to make it big in the rap music scene. It is the kind of film that hooks you right from the first moments and just keeps growing on you as it goes on. The story, the setting, the cinematography, the music, the characters, and the narrative all contribute to the film's unusual feel in equal parts. The Dharavi slums of Mumbai where the film is set are shot beautifully - the congested streets, overcrowded with a diverse population of individuals, much to the point where poverty, and often sad pictures thereof, is presented as almost culturally exotic. It's amazing though that specifically these disheartening, seemingly impossible areas bring forth heartening messages of hope and opportunity where neither dire straits nor harsh realities can take them away.The film's narrative style is fantastic - it IS music. Its youthful, modern feel is there all through and, even those not particularly fond of rap music, are very likely to enjoy the rhythm and the many songs which decorate the proceedings in ways one could not imagine. The lyrics of the songs, as well as the rap sequences as performed by the characters of the film, turn out to be symbolic and poetic and very true of the challenging conditions of the speakers in question. The cinematography is stupendous, the lighting and diverse shots make it quite a visual treat in many ways and, as mentioned above, even despite the setting of not the prettiest locales. Apart from Ranveer Singh as Murad, the film's leading actor who's an aspiring singer, and Safeena, his charming and headstrong girlfriend, every character is given a story, which is part of the entire picture of a society often immersed in its primitive ways, like, for one, his bigamous father or her conservative parents.And the acting, as part of this entire picture, is spot on. Every member of the cast is natural to the hilt. Singh obviously leads the cast with an excellent performance. His portrayal of his character's reserved nature, insecurity, and then his inner self-belief in his ability to make it, is fantastic. In a smaller part, Alia Bhatt is wonderful as the free-spirited Sakeena, and she almost steals the thunder as she is highly relatable, convincing and above all enjoyable in how ambitious, determined and madly in love she is. Without taking anything away from the two leads, the supporting cast is full of stupendous character actors, led by a brilliant Amruta Subhash in a heartbreaking portrayal of Murad's mother. Vijay Raaz, as her abusive and adulterous husband, is superb, and so is Vijay Varma, as the troublemaker Moeen. Siddhant Chaturvedi is a nice find as he fits the role and does exceedingly although he does look over-confident at points, and Kalki is given a thankless role though she's good.Gully Boy is a rare combination of top-notch acting, story, music, and soul. It works as both a musical, a sports film of sorts, and a human drama. In the end, it's just very inspiring. For director Zoya Akhtar, this is clearly the best film of her career, as no film of hers, even the most celebrated and acclaimed (and some, overrated), reached the merit and beauty of this one. This film has clearly a lot invested into, and not just money but hard work in studying and preparing, because it takes us into the world as those who too often are deemed transparent, and it makes them matter. Many years ago, a movement of Indian films known as parallel cinema was producing films which often sought to give voice to the voiceless, namely people from the slums. It's nice seeing that their stories have crossed the boundaries of what was called ""offbeat cinema"" and is now given importance by mainstream filmmakers. That mass audiences find their stories valuable is not surprising, but Indian cinema is maturing, and it's great.",change your reality match your dreams,gully boy is extraordinary film about young muslim student slums mumbai who is fan hip hop music who keeps secret his dreams make it big rap music scene it is kind film that hooks you right first moments just keeps growing you as it goes story setting cinematography music characters narrative all contribute films unusual feel equal parts dharavi slums mumbai where film is set are shot beautifully congested streets overcrowded with diverse population individuals much point where poverty often sad pictures thereof is presented as almost culturally exotic its amazing though that specifically these disheartening seemingly impossible areas bring forth heartening messages hope opportunity where neither dire straits nor harsh realities can take them away films narrative style is fantastic it is music its youthful modern feel is there all through even those not particularly fond rap music are very likely enjoy rhythm many songs which decorate proceedings ways one could not imagine lyrics songs as well as rap sequences as performed by characters film turn out be symbolic poetic very true challenging conditions speakers question cinematography is stupendous lighting diverse shots make it quite visual treat many ways as mentioned above even despite setting not prettiest locales apart ranveer singh as murad films leading actor whos aspiring singer safeena his charming headstrong girlfriend every character is given story which is part entire picture society often immersed its primitive ways like one his bigamous father or her conservative parents acting as part this entire picture is spot every member cast is natural hilt singh obviously leads cast with excellent performance his portrayal his characters reserved nature insecurity then his inner self belief his ability make it is fantastic smaller part alia bhatt is wonderful as free spirited sakeena she almost steals thunder as she is highly relatable convincing above all enjoyable how ambitious determined madly love she is without taking anything away two leads supporting cast is full stupendous character actors led by brilliant amruta subhash heartbreaking portrayal murads mother vijay raaz as her abusive adulterous husband is superb so is vijay varma as troublemaker moeen siddhant chaturvedi is nice find as he fits role does exceedingly although he does look over confident at points kalki is given thankless role though shes good gully boy is rare combination top notch acting story music soul it works as both musical sports film sorts human drama end its just very inspiring director zoya akhtar this is clearly best film her career as no film hers even most celebrated acclaimed some overrated reached merit beauty this one this film has clearly lot invested into not just money but hard work studying preparing because it takes us into world as those who too often are deemed transparent it makes them matter many years ago movement indian films known as parallel cinema was producing films which often sought give voice voiceless namely people slums its nice seeing that their stories have crossed boundaries what was called offbeat cinema is now given importance by mainstream filmmakers that mass audiences find their stories valuable is not surprising but indian cinema is maturing its great,0.6100335345405768,0.279822266934943,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Ranveer ka time aa gaya,"This is such a beautifully made film. It's very rare that one walks out of a film thinking of the world in a different way. When the film starts to the end, the director(Zoya Akhtar), makes sure the audience is hooked. Dialogue writer Vijay Maurya, also played by Murad(Ranveer's uncle) wrote some amazing dialogues and a script that not only neatly ties on the gully boy himself, but his love interest, relationships with his family, friends, and his inner demons. Ranveer has slowly become Indian's Daniel Day Lewis. There is no trace of him in Murad. He is sensitive, daring, intense, and quiet. He breaths fire as he sits in his car, and raps his heart and arms out. He is brooding as he sits and writes after he sees his father's second wife come in his home. He doesn't miss a beat. Alia is growing from strength to strength. After, Udta, Dear Zindagi, Raazi, and now Gully Boy, is the latest in her kitty of great performances. A special mention to Siddarth and Vijay Varma for giving us such lovely characters to root for. Also Vijay Raaz as the abusive father. I hated him and that's a testament to how great Raaz is as an artist. This movie is a must see.

3.0,"Length, linear, predictable and linear. One time watch","It is just a lengthy, highly predictable, linear film... I must admit, it wasn't boring but not interesting as well... Not enough hard to be called 'Boht hard'...What worked: Performancs of Mechanic/Dope dealer, Ranveer's father, MC Sher, Ranveer and Alia (in the same order). Dialogues were pretty ordinary though cinematography was really good. Female right theme.What didn't: Very lengthy, too predictable, unnecessary subplots (entire Kalki Kochlin subplot), very linear story, tried too hard to insert unnecessary drama. Some things that I found really hard to digest like a person who is Car Theif/Dope dealer/ and indulges in child labour gets bail just like that and also tries to justify these acts by saying that HE FEEDS THESE KIDS.Also at many points, one way or another, it was forced on audience that all working class people suck because they are not following their passion/dream jobs. This is easier said than done thing but ok, it was a movie so I can manage that.Final Words: Lengthy, predictable, one time watch film but definitely NOT boht hard.",length linear predictable linear one time watch,it is just lengthy highly predictable linear film i must admit it wasnt boring but not interesting as well not enough hard be called boht hard what worked performancs mechanic dope dealer ranveers father mc sher ranveer alia same order dialogues were pretty ordinary though cinematography was really good female right theme what didnt very lengthy too predictable unnecessary subplots entire kalki kochlin subplot very linear story tried too hard insert unnecessary drama some things that i found really hard digest like person who is car theif dope dealer indulges child labour gets bail just like that also tries justify these acts by saying that he feeds these kids also at many points one way or another it was forced audience that all working class people suck because they are not following their passion dream jobs this is easier said than done thing but ok it was movie so i can manage that final words lengthy predictable one time watch film but definitely not boht hard,0.5286904761904762,-0.07742063492063492,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,good,"Acting-great performances very grounded in reality,Ranveer and Alia were great,the supporting cast was great and believable Plot-Enjoyable plot with great dialogues,I myself am not into the latest music scene but you can understand clearly the way struggle is potrayed.For me the love story was an addition not a necessity if you watch Gully boy again sometime youll notice you can skip all the parts and the entire subplot between Ranveer and Alia and even the little fight where Alia knocks out Kalki you will notice the rest of the movie is still a good movie and it will be a different experience. Screenplay-Heres a dilemna the screen play was very unique because heres how the movie progressed 5 min-character is having a blast,enjoying next 5 min-character is knocked out by a bad situation and is rethinking his entire life then repeat happy-sad-happy-sad-happy-sad...... Now I dont know if I would enjoy the movie more or less if the screen play was any different because at some moments I enjoyed it immensely but at some points I felt is this back and front swinging necessary cant you just go linearly like a normal person where you have first 30 minutes of sad and then next 30 minutes or hour of happy and right before interval 10 minutes of sad and so on. The ending montage was great it gives you a good feeling but still some anbiguity, because he has achieved something of value,we dont know if he will continue to grow in his career,get to marry Safeena once she becomes a doctor,will his music remain popular and continue to inspire,will his father reconcile with them,etc. Technically the movie was brilliant no doubt the sets,locations,costumes,camera work,music in songs ,background music,sound quality,lighting,colors,etc all were great",good,acting great performances very grounded reality ranveer alia were great supporting cast was great believable plot enjoyable plot with great dialogues i myself am not into latest music scene but you can understand clearly way struggle is potrayed me love story was addition not necessity if you watch gully boy again sometime youll notice you can skip all parts entire subplot between ranveer alia even little fight where alia knocks out kalki you will notice rest movie is still good movie it will be different experience screenplay heres dilemna screen play was very unique because heres how movie progressed 5 min character is having blast enjoying next 5 min character is knocked out by bad situation is rethinking his entire life then repeat happy sad happy sad happy sad now i dont know if i would enjoy movie more or less if screen play was any different because at some moments i enjoyed it immensely but at some points i felt is this back front swinging necessary cant you just go linearly like normal person where you have first 30 minutes sad then next 30 minutes or hour happy right before interval 10 minutes sad so ending montage was great it gives you good feeling but still some anbiguity because he has achieved something value we dont know if he will continue grow his career get marry safeena once she becomes doctor will his music remain popular continue inspire will his father reconcile with them etc technically movie was brilliant no doubt sets locations costumes camera work music songs background music sound quality lighting colors etc all were great,0.6347142857142856,0.28138095238095245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"

,Nothing groundbreaking,Ok..so i was hyped with movie bcoz of the reviews it got and the people are praising that you haven't seen anything like this in india..well i just wanna say i was really disappointed.There is nothing new here...the same underdog story has been told many times in different ways. Acting is good which you can expect from fine actors so nothing special about that and overall it's just an average movie.,nothing groundbreaking,ok so i was hyped with movie bcoz reviews it got people are praising that you havent seen anything like this india well i just wanna say i was really disappointed there is nothing new here same underdog story has been told many times different ways acting is good which you can expect fine actors so nothing special about that overall its just average movie,0.4167478354978355,0.14251443001443004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.1}"
7.0,Apna time aayega,The similaritieswith 8 Mile is just in the basic premise and whatever was shown in the trailer. This film does stands on its own.Simple story filled with complex characters (well all the characters from the Gully anyway) beautifully directed. Ranveer Singh is fantastic as expected. The only issue for me was that the climax could have been a bit more intense for such a story.,apna time aayega,similaritieswith 8 mile is just basic premise whatever was shown trailer this film does stands its own simple story filled with complex characters well all characters gully anyway beautifully directed ranveer singh is fantastic as expected only issue me was that climax could have been bit more intense such story,0.6735119047619048,0.2125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.78}"
6.0,Watchable but very predictable,"The film is watchable for Zoya's direction and Siddhant's performance. There is nothing new in the film - it is the age-old underdog story, and I have seen much better depictions of the underdog story in world cinema. Some sections/ communities of the society may be able to connect with the film and its characters, but I could not. Also, if you are from Mumbai, you may like the film. In terms of performances, Ranveer is better here than in some of his last films. Alia has acted like she always does - just being the normal herself. The real performance for which to check out this film is Siddhant's. This is an actor to watch out for. Disclaimer: There is too much rap in the film. I have tried to be as impartial in my review as possible - if you are not a fan of this so-called ""music"" like myself, you may not like it.",watchable but very predictable,film is watchable zoyas direction siddhants performance there is nothing new film it is age old underdog story i have seen much better depictions underdog story world cinema some sections communities society may be able connect with film its characters but i could not also if you are mumbai you may like film terms performances ranveer is better here than some his last films alia has acted like she always does just being normal herself real performance which check out this film is siddhants this is actor watch out disclaimer there is too much rap film i have tried be as impartial my review as possible if you are not fan this so called music like myself you may not like it,0.4678374655647383,0.18421487603305786,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
