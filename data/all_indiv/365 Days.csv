1.0,Insanity,"I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like ""woo lets go buy some new clothes"". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like ""oh that's good she got away from him"". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like ""Yeah fair enough"" and just sits down like this happens every day.On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like ""Posing, modelling"" faces and is not like ""Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help"". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?It also relies heavily on ""Pop"" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like ""well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in"".I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.So its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck.",insanity,i honestly dont know who thought that this movie would be good idea it is complete train wreck multiple reasons one biggest issues is plot is just nonsense it is inappropriate have man deiced that he will hold woman captive she will love him that is just not ok i dont know why they made movie romanticising this idea male character is creep he assaults female character multiple times it is not shown as bad thing its just like he is man he has power so he can do what he likes it is really really bad beyond that they just do variations same scene 6 different times this movie is just same scene over over again broken up with random montages with song played over it actions characters are nonsensical too she has been kidnapped foreign country then next day there is shopping montage where she is just like woo lets go buy some new clothes like that just wouldnt happen you would be terrified she just acts like fine with it i feel like they try get audience side by making her current boyfriend horrible person i think they think audience will be like oh thats good she got away him yeah she did get away her bad boyfriend by being kidnapped by italian mobster who is holding her captive second issue is leads cant act lot movie is just them interacting so its like watching amateur dramatics troupe half time now i cant work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all i cant deiced if this was direction she was given or she just cant act or script said she isnt scared she literally wakes up after being kidnapped tried open door get out cant because its locked is just like yeah fair enough just sits down like this happens every day top that scenes with male lead pushing her against walls stuff she pulls like posing modelling faces is not like jesus christ man is assaulting me help once again was this direction or was it acting whos knows it also relies heavily pop songs that are really loud unnecessary they constantly play one after other then when reading i found out male lead sung like big chunk them so i guess production was just like well he will give us them cheep lets throw them all i could go one about all its problems but it all circles back directing acting script it was just perfect storm believe it or not it is watchable but way that you want watch it see disaster it is no1 viewed film large amount different countries netflixs at moment i believe this be reason so its really up you if you want watch it it is very boring but also train wreck,0.4086014203661263,-0.00793933735110206,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"

6.0,Obviously '#metoo' hasn't yet made it to Poland...,"Laura is an attractive, ball-busting Polish hotel executive who fights her corner in board meetings then goes home to her slobbish partner and collection of dildos. Massimo is a gangster - but the young, sexy kind: he's described as having ""a body sculpted by God... and a dick sculpted by the devil"" (which is a pretty erotic line until the viewer unwillingly starts picturing said protuberance with horns and a little pointy beard). Having caught a fleeting glimpse of Laura some years before and been obsessed with her ever since, Massimo is delighted to discover she is holidaying on his native Sicily. He promptly kidnaps her and tells her he will hold her for 365 days while attempting to make her fall in love with him.Personally, I would have thought not kidnapping her in the first place would have been ample proof of his honourable intentions - as would not promising he will not touch without her permission whilst nonetheless pinning her to a chair and grabbing her tit. But then this film - based on a novel - is hardly politically correct. The main problem, of course, is Laura's ultimate falling in love with Massimo (c'mon, you knew she would!): although she is allowed a scene of berating herself for so doing, there is no effort to examine whether she is suffering from, for example, some form of Stockholm Syndrome - although that would have made this a far deeper film.Other flaws are the many dangling plot-threads: for instance, Laura's weak heart is mentioned several times but nothing is ever done with it. When she is offered a job as ""general manager of Preston"" (presumably not the football club) we have to guess that she turns it down; and when Massimo is told ""they"" want to kill his sweetheart we are not told who ""they"" are, despite the fact the preceding scenes have identified at least two likely candidates. On the plus side, one plot-thread that I thought it a wise decision to leave dangling was the final scene involving a tunnel: we know the outcome of what happened in there, but we are not told exactly *how* it happened, which adds a pleasing air of mystery.As for the acting, leads Anna Maria Sieklucka and Michele Morrone deserve credit for delivering much of their dialogue in English, which is presumably their second (at best) language: this does mean, however, that some of their lines sound a bit clunky to those for whom English is mother tongue. As often in this kind of production, the supporting characters - not encumbered with the requirement to be romantic heroes - are more interesting: there are fine comedic turns from Magdalena Lamparska as Laura's exuberant friend Olga, and from Otar Saralidze as a bemused young gangster.This film is, I imagine, an attempt to create a Polish version of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. It does not match the latter's theme of women's empowerment (for all the whips and chains, Anastasia is in control in a way kidnap victim Laura certainly is not), but - with apologies for shallowness - there is more nudity and sex in '365 Dni'. But it *is* similar to 'Fifty Shades' in the attractiveness not only of its cast, but also of its locations and clothes (there are several shopping scenes); and as a piece of escapist entertainment it certainly hits the spot.",obviously hasnt yet made it poland,laura is attractive ball busting polish hotel executive who fights her corner board meetings then goes home her slobbish partner collection dildos massimo is gangster but young sexy kind hes described as having body sculpted by god dick sculpted by devil which is pretty erotic line until viewer unwillingly starts picturing said protuberance with horns little pointy beard having caught fleeting glimpse laura some years before been obsessed with her ever since massimo is delighted discover she is holidaying his native sicily he promptly kidnaps her tells her he will hold her 365 days while attempting make her fall love with him personally i would have thought not kidnapping her first place would have been ample proof his honourable intentions as would not promising he will not touch without her permission whilst nonetheless pinning her chair grabbing her tit but then this film based novel is hardly politically correct main problem course is lauras ultimate falling love with massimo cmon you knew she would although she is allowed scene berating herself so doing there is no effort examine whether she is suffering example some form stockholm syndrome although that would have made this far deeper film other flaws are many dangling plot threads instance lauras weak heart is mentioned several times but nothing is ever done with it when she is offered job as general manager preston presumably not football club we have guess that she turns it down when massimo is told they want kill his sweetheart we are not told who they are despite fact preceding scenes have identified at least two likely candidates plus side one plot thread that i thought it wise decision leave dangling was final scene involving tunnel we know outcome what happened there but we are not told exactly how it happened which adds pleasing air mystery as acting leads anna maria sieklucka michele morrone deserve credit delivering much their dialogue english which is presumably their second at best language this does mean however that some their lines sound bit clunky those whom english is mother tongue as often this kind production supporting characters not encumbered with requirement be romantic heroes are more interesting there are fine comedic turns magdalena lamparska as lauras exuberant friend olga otar saralidze as bemused young gangster this film is i imagine attempt create polish version fifty shades grey it does not match latters theme womens empowerment all whips chains anastasia is control way kidnap victim laura certainly is not but with apologies shallowness there is more nudity sex 365 dni but it is similar fifty shades attractiveness not only its cast but also its locations clothes there are several shopping scenes as piece escapist entertainment it certainly hits spot,0.5136280129335685,0.16870223398001172,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"

1.0,Nothing says romance like a kidnapping and sexual assault!,"A mobster has a woman he's never met kidnapped and when she awakens from the drug given to knock her out, he informs her that she'll be living as his prisoner for 365 days. If after this period she hasn't fallen in love with him, he says he'll let her go. And, this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that in the end that the woman DOES want to be dominated, abused and forced to be a sex slave because the man is so sexy hot.I honestly think that the folks responsible for ""365 Days"" know they created an evil and dangerous film....and that was their intention. Sure, it's irresponsible to make a movie promoting kidnapping and sexual assault...and I cannot imagine any normal person thinking this is a good thing or that it would make a good movie. No, I think the filmmakers knew the film would get a lot of hate and anger...and as a result, it would get a lot of attention. In other words, if you can't make a good film to get attention, make a terrible one to get attention. And, not surprisingly, this film has earned a spot on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List.So is the film good in any way? The plot that is pro-rape and pro-kidnapping certainly isn't good. Technically speaking, the film also has a few issues.....though it is slick and 'hip' much of the time. While they do a lot of gimmicky cinematographic techniques to make the movie look good, it also often falls back on the tired use of the shaky cam. Additionally, the film turns out to be disappointing even as pornography, as you really don't get much enjoyment or sexual energy from most of the picture. You'd do much better just looking at porn online or just making consensual love with your own partner! Overall, a smarmy little picture...one that unfortunately DID get the negative attention they filmmakers wanted but which also contributes nothing positive to this world and is rather boring.In real life, I am trying to imagine an offender in court telling the judge ""I was just doing what I saw them doing in ""365 Days""...is that so wrong?!""....and promptly being sentenced to 104 years in prison!",nothing says romance like kidnapping sexual assault,mobster has woman hes never met kidnapped when she awakens drug given knock her out he informs her that shell be living as his prisoner 365 days if after this period she hasnt fallen love with him he says hell let her go this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that end that woman does want be dominated abused forced be sex slave because man is so sexy hot i honestly think that folks responsible 365 days know they created evil dangerous film that was their intention sure its irresponsible make movie promoting kidnapping sexual assault i cannot imagine any normal person thinking this is good thing or that it would make good movie no i think filmmakers knew film would get lot hate anger as result it would get lot attention other words if you cant make good film get attention make terrible one get attention not surprisingly this film has earned spot imdbs infamous bottom 100 list so is film good any way plot that is pro rape pro kidnapping certainly isnt good technically speaking film also has few issues though it is slick hip much time while they do lot gimmicky cinematographic techniques make movie look good it also often falls back tired use shaky cam additionally film turns out be disappointing even as pornography as you really dont get much enjoyment or sexual energy most picture youd do much better just looking at porn online or just making consensual love with your own partner overall smarmy little picture one that unfortunately did get negative attention they filmmakers wanted but which also contributes nothing positive this world is rather boring real life i am trying imagine offender court telling judge i was just doing what i saw them doing 365 days is that so wrong promptly being sentenced 104 years prison,0.6001154401154402,0.027914502164502156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
