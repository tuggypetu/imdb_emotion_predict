10,Barfi ! - An Inch from Masterpiece!,"Love needs expressions not language, it requires feelings no boundaries, it's beyond oceans beyond limits- Free and Beautiful but only few know how to live it. Barfi as its name is sweet, full of aroma, delicious and tasty. This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color –Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family.Barfi ! Essentially is a chapter of life which has numerable good moments to recall, laugh and to love with. Every character is well placed without being dramatic with excellent music, performances, direction and screenplay.Anurag Basu- the director has done extraordinary work in terms of narrating the story. Like 'Inception' his narrative style takes you in flashback and a flashback within a flashback to narrate a simple story in its most impactful form without creating confusions to audience. Every story has been woven perfectly till climax. Despite the destiny of characters what audience recalls some beautiful moments, cheer, laughs, true love and sacrifice. Each and every prank on screen gives you a bucketful humor and feel good factor whether it's Barfi-cop chase or Barfi's effort to impress Jhilmil and Shruti throughout the movie.Ranbir Kapoor- Well this guy has redefined himself, and the only commercial cinema star of recent time who knows how to act dances and laugh with perfection. Whether it was 'wake up sid', 'Raajneeti'or 'Rockstar' with every movie he has successfully set benchmark for himself but with this movie he has set benchmark even for so called Khans and Roshans. The beauty of his character is despite being deaf and dump in the movie not a single moment you will realize that he even require to speak. His expressions are heartwarming and simply outstanding. Priyanka Chopra – Luckily we have a pool of talented actress these days and Priyanka Chopra with this movie will give a tough challenge to her peers. Her expressions as an autism child are natural and clean. Her feelings for Ranbir as a lady could be easily readable and this is undoubtedly one of the best performances of her career.Ileana D'Cruz – She is one of the best debut of this year. Extremely good looking and charming, she never gives the feeling of a debutant. She does her job perfectly as a narrator and as an actor.Barfi is a way of life, it has potential to make you laugh without getting dirty, it has power to make you cry without getting dramatic and it has energy to teach you love for all without being a documentary. Barfi is perfect in all sense. And for those who could ask why I have written an inch away from Masterpiece ,well being a critique we always expect more than what we got but as soon as the wedding bells rings in the end it was obvious that Barfi has crossed that inch of perfection It's a Masterpiece of Indian Cinema.Thanks & Regards Yours AVA For Complete Review Please VISIT www.thecritiquelab.com Your Views are heartily welcome",barfi inch masterpiece,love needs expressions not language it requires feelings no boundaries its beyond oceans beyond limits free beautiful but only few know how live it barfi as its name is sweet full aroma delicious tasty this true sense expresses love without any language caste creed or color selfless with heart impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved friends family barfi essentially is chapter life which has numerable good moments recall laugh love with every character is well placed without being dramatic with excellent music performances direction screenplay anurag basu director has done extraordinary work terms narrating story like inception his narrative style takes you flashback flashback within flashback narrate simple story its most impactful form without creating confusions audience every story has been woven perfectly till climax despite destiny characters what audience recalls some beautiful moments cheer laughs true love sacrifice each every prank screen gives you bucketful humor feel good factor whether its barfi cop chase or barfis effort impress jhilmil shruti throughout movie ranbir kapoor well this guy has redefined himself only commercial cinema star recent time who knows how act dances laugh with perfection whether it was wake up sid raajneetior rockstar with every movie he has successfully set benchmark himself but with this movie he has set benchmark even so called khans roshans beauty his character is despite being deaf dump movie not single moment you will realize that he even require speak his expressions are heartwarming simply outstanding priyanka chopra luckily we have pool talented actress these days priyanka chopra with this movie will give tough challenge her peers her expressions as autism child are natural clean her feelings ranbir as lady could be easily readable this is undoubtedly one best performances her career ileana dcruz she is one best debut this year extremely good looking charming she never gives feeling debutant she does her job perfectly as narrator as actor barfi is way life it has potential make you laugh without getting dirty it has power make you cry without getting dramatic it has energy teach you love all without being documentary barfi is perfect all sense those who could ask why i have written inch away masterpiece well being critique we always expect more than what we got but as soon as wedding bells rings end it was obvious that barfi has crossed that inch perfection its masterpiece indian cinema thanks regards yours ava complete review please visit www thecritiquelab com your views are heartily welcome,0.6189039408866995,0.3824687764342936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9,A perfect example of art that can forever stay in your heart,"India's official entry to the Oscars - Barfi! might as well have been an acronym for: Breathtaking (cinematography), Astounding (acting), Ruthless (breaking of stereotypes about the disabled), Fantastic (music), and Invigorating (feeling in your heart as you leave the theater).This is essentially a love triangle between Barfi (played endearingly by Ranbir Kapoor), a hearing and speech impaired son of a poor chauffeur, Jhilmil (played brilliantly by Priyanka Chopra), an autistic girl almost abandoned by her rich parents, and Shruti the narrator of the tale of love (played convincingly by debutante Illeana De Cruz), the soon to be married tourist visiting Darjeeling along with her parents.The writer and director - Anurag Basu uses non linear storytelling to traverse between 1972, 1978, and 2012 Darjeeling, Calcutta, and little known places of Bengal as they three protagonists try and grapple with Love and its various heart rendering implications to their lives. For a film with hardly any dialogs, 'Barfi!' amazingly manages to say a lot, using a combination of sign language, facial expressions, first person narration, and sometimes simply stunning silences to convey a gamut of emotions.Several sequences stand out for their sheer brilliance, be it Barfi's reaction at Shruti's choice of her fiancé (Jishu Sengupta in a small but significant role), Shruti and her mother's (played beautifully by the veteran Roopa Ganguly) exchanges on certain choices in Love, Barfi and Jhilmil's night in the forest illuminated by fireflies, Barfi's cutting off of the lamp posts to test the loyalty of his friends, Jhilmil's fantasy about getting married as she watches a 'Chau Dance' in a village, Daju's (Haradhan in a superb supporting role) tear stricken face as he finally accepts Jhilmil's fate and let's her go, the unfolding of the photograph's at Shruti's house to finally reveal the truth about her entire life, and lastly, the finale. All these, and many more, are sure to be etched as a memory, not in your mind, but rather in your heart.This film shows how one can find happiness in the small things in life, and how disabilities, be in financial, mental, or physical can never really appear as a handicap to an otherwise soaring spirit that does not know how to give up on life. This film reminds us that falling in Love is natural, while staying in Love a decision that must be taken with the heart, rather than the mind. And finally, this is a film that tries, without trying too hard, to help you understand that the language of Love does not necessarily require the wisdom of words.One might argue that certain portions of the film are 'inspired' from other films. For example, certain dialogs between Shruti and her mother might remind you of the Notebook, certain mannerisms of Barfi as he tries his best to escape the bungling cop (played aptly by Saurabh Shukla) cause you to recollect sequences from the films of Charlie Chaplin, while the way Barfi tries to entertain Jhilmil & Shruti remind you of Singing in The Rain and Mr Bean. Yet, Barfi manages to stand on its own for the way it interprets these classic scenes and the logicality of their inclusion in the proceedings.The Hair and Makeup department, however, especially when it tries to show the same actors playing aged characters, is the only one that takes a slight dent. Yet almost everything else manages to come together in unison to more than compensate for this slight glitch. And it does so, at numerous places managing to make you think, smile, cry, and sigh, sometimes all at the same time, and in quick succession.Watch it for the performances (especially that of Ranbir and Priyanka), the vision of the director Anurag Basu and cinematographer Ravi Varman, the terrific score of the music director Pritam Chakravarty, and last but not the least for the innumerable ways in which Love has been expressed between the characters. Trust me - this is the perfect example of art that can forever stay in your heart.",perfect example art that can forever stay your heart,indias official entry oscars barfi might as well have been acronym breathtaking cinematography astounding acting ruthless breaking stereotypes about disabled fantastic music invigorating feeling your heart as you leave theater this is essentially love triangle between barfi played endearingly by ranbir kapoor hearing speech impaired son poor chauffeur jhilmil played brilliantly by priyanka chopra autistic girl almost abandoned by her rich parents shruti narrator tale love played convincingly by debutante illeana de cruz soon be married tourist visiting darjeeling along with her parents writer director anurag basu uses non linear storytelling traverse between 1972 1978 2012 darjeeling calcutta little known places bengal as they three protagonists try grapple with love its various heart rendering implications their lives film with hardly any dialogs barfi amazingly manages say lot using combination sign language facial expressions first person narration sometimes simply stunning silences convey gamut emotions several sequences stand out their sheer brilliance be it barfis reaction at shrutis choice her fianc jishu sengupta small but significant role shruti her mothers played beautifully by veteran roopa ganguly exchanges certain choices love barfi jhilmils night forest illuminated by fireflies barfis cutting off lamp posts test loyalty his friends jhilmils fantasy about getting married as she watches chau dance village dajus haradhan superb supporting role tear stricken face as he finally accepts jhilmils fate lets her go unfolding photographs at shrutis house finally reveal truth about her entire life lastly finale all these many more are sure be etched as memory not your mind but rather your heart this film shows how one can find happiness small things life how disabilities be financial mental or physical can never really appear as handicap otherwise soaring spirit that does not know how give up life this film reminds us that falling love is natural while staying love decision that must be taken with heart rather than mind finally this is film that tries without trying too hard help you understand that language love does not necessarily require wisdom words one might argue that certain portions film are inspired other films example certain dialogs between shruti her mother might remind you notebook certain mannerisms barfi as he tries his best escape bungling cop played aptly by saurabh shukla cause you recollect sequences films charlie chaplin while way barfi tries entertain jhilmil shruti remind you singing rain mr bean yet barfi manages stand its own way it interprets these classic scenes logicality their inclusion proceedings hair makeup department however especially when it tries show same actors playing aged characters is only one that takes slight dent yet almost everything else manages come together unison more than compensate this slight glitch it does so at numerous places managing make you think smile cry sigh sometimes all at same time quick succession watch it performances especially that ranbir priyanka vision director anurag basu cinematographer ravi varman terrific score music director pritam chakravarty last but not least innumerable ways which love has been expressed between characters trust me this is perfect example art that can forever stay your heart,0.546934051398337,0.18723781179138324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Barfi : A visual poetry,"I was not actually very keen to watch Barfi. The trailers intrigued me enough to go for it but till the last time I was unsure if it would be any good. And then on a boring Friday I found myself waiting in queue for a 3.05PM show. And I do not regret my decision.Story/Theme: I'm not sure how to tell the story without giving anything. Let me then take the help of IMDb here.Three young people learn that love can neither be defined nor contained by society's norms of normal and abnormal Actually, giving any more would spoil the movie for you.Character Development:Once in a while there comes a movie which consists of characters not stars. But, it takes a master to make his puppets grow in the short span of 2hrs and 33mins and make people feel the change. Barfi is such a movie where you could observe the characters changing with time, maturing, being tolerant to each other with passing time. Though Barfi is the central character of the movie still, Jhilmil, Shruti and Inspector are well crafted and given ample scope to go through changes. Anurag basu gets full marks from me here.Direction: Day by day directors are understanding the value of freedom and Anurag Basu once again proved that. Even though having powerful stars and big banner for his last movie Kites various restrictions took away the artistic freedom from him and we got a flop movie. This time he showed what a master director he is. Look at the character of Barfi. How beautifully its crafted. His mannerisms, gestures, postures all are shot with utmost care. Then take Jhilmil's character. An autistic girl. Who gets tangled in the Barfi's life. They fall in love and discover love in their own way. It had the risk of being a ""Koshish"" anyday. A lucrative trap for making a tearjerker, emotional serious drama but Anurag Basu took the risk of walking on rope here. He subtly showed the pain of the characters through comedy. And there he wins hands down. Then there is Shruti and confused normal person. Who gets lost in the world of few 'abnormal' persons and never survived fully. And, hats off for choosing Saurav Shukla as Inspector. He's a revelation in this movie. Other supporting casts are also good but coming out of theater I bet you would remember only these. And, the subtle touch of live background score...an intelligent touch :)Screenplay: The movie narration does not go in linear motion. We get jump cuts, flashback within flashbacks and stories from different key characters. I don't know if many would appreciate such story telling. Screenplay is neat, dialogs are few and far between. Silence plays a bigger role in this movie. Acting: I'm speechless here. Every actor seemed to be acted in this movie considering this is their last chance to prove themselves. Ranbir proved his level in Rockstar already...but Priyanaka just took reinvented herself. A very strong but sidelined character she played here. The focus was never on her but whenever she got scope she just marveled it. Kudos to her and Kudos to Anurag Basu to show us what Priyanka could do. Barfi for Priyanka is going to be what ""Jab we Met"" is to Kareena. Then, the next gem of the movie is Saurabh Shukla. Another brilliant performance. Ileana as Shruti also did well.Cinematography: The movie is a visual poetry. Every frame is such beautiful that reminded me ""Raavan"" by Santosh Shivan. After a few searches I found out the man behind this poetry and he is Mr. Ravi Varman. Just remember this name. Because if you watch the movie you are obvious to search who was the man behind camera.Songs and background score: Songs are good, specially ""Main Kaya Karoon"". And, nice melodic background score. Best thing is the story does not stop when the songs happen. The songs just help enrich the moment on-screen.Editing: In theater few were complaining about the length of the movie. I on the other hand think its the way it was meant to be. Such movies are best told in slowly, like a poetry. Such that every scene, every dialog leaves mark in your mind. Verdict: Reading this far it might seem its nothing but a romance between two invalids and Anurag Basu emotionally blackmailed you in the movie to love it. But what I've not told you is how much laugh riot it is, how this is even a thriller or how beautiful this movie is. All in all, a movie that gives the pleasure of listening a complete story. A movie to watch with your family. A movie where if you take your girlfriend does not stop saying ""how cute!""Go, watch Barfi!. Watch the best movie of 2012.",barfi visual poetry,i was not actually very keen watch barfi trailers intrigued me enough go it but till last time i was unsure if it would be any good then boring friday i found myself waiting queue 3 05pm show i do not regret my decision story theme im not sure how tell story without giving anything let me then take help imdb here three young people learn that love can neither be defined nor contained by societys norms normal abnormal actually giving any more would spoil movie you character development once while there comes movie which consists characters not stars but it takes master make his puppets grow short span 2hrs 33mins make people feel change barfi is such movie where you could observe characters changing with time maturing being tolerant each other with passing time though barfi is central character movie still jhilmil shruti inspector are well crafted given ample scope go through changes anurag basu gets full marks me here direction day by day directors are understanding value freedom anurag basu once again proved that even though having powerful stars big banner his last movie kites various restrictions took away artistic freedom him we got flop movie this time he showed what master director he is look at character barfi how beautifully its crafted his mannerisms gestures postures all are shot with utmost care then take jhilmils character autistic girl who gets tangled barfis life they fall love discover love their own way it had risk being koshish anyday lucrative trap making tearjerker emotional serious drama but anurag basu took risk walking rope here he subtly showed pain characters through comedy there he wins hands down then there is shruti confused normal person who gets lost world few abnormal persons never survived fully hats off choosing saurav shukla as inspector hes revelation this movie other supporting casts are also good but coming out theater i bet you would remember only these subtle touch live background score intelligent touch screenplay movie narration does not go linear motion we get jump cuts flashback within flashbacks stories different key characters i dont know if many would appreciate such story telling screenplay is neat dialogs are few far between silence plays bigger role this movie acting im speechless here every actor seemed be acted this movie considering this is their last chance prove themselves ranbir proved his level rockstar already but priyanaka just took reinvented herself very strong but sidelined character she played here focus was never her but whenever she got scope she just marveled it kudos her kudos anurag basu show us what priyanka could do barfi priyanka is going be what jab we met is kareena then next gem movie is saurabh shukla another brilliant performance ileana as shruti also did well cinematography movie is visual poetry every frame is such beautiful that reminded me raavan by santosh shivan after few searches i found out man behind this poetry he is mr ravi varman just remember this name because if you watch movie you are obvious search who was man behind camera songs background score songs are good specially main kaya karoon nice melodic background score best thing is story does not stop when songs happen songs just help enrich moment screen editing theater few were complaining about length movie i other hand think its way it was meant be such movies are best told slowly like poetry such that every scene every dialog leaves mark your mind verdict reading this far it might seem its nothing but romance between two invalids anurag basu emotionally blackmailed you movie love it but what ive not told you is how much laugh riot it is how this is even thriller or how beautiful this movie is all all movie that gives pleasure listening complete story movie watch with your family movie where if you take your girlfriend does not stop saying how cute go watch barfi watch best movie 2012,0.5152672292545709,0.1527739419511571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8,"Thoroughly enjoyable fable, light & bubbly...","This is a fable, a beautifully shot, light, airy, bubbly fable. It will make you laugh. A lot. And cry, or mist up, a little. If you're still not a fan of Ranbir, you will walk away as one. And the background songs just don't stop playing in your head. There are some deeper layers, as well. Why is it in India that we cannot take care of our disabled children ? Why do we get threatened by them, so scared of social approbation that we are willing to abandon our own flesh and blood, despite having the means to look after them ? Why is it that playing safe seems to be ingrained in our blood ? In love, 9 times out of 10, we will choose the guy who is rich and doesn't make us cry to the guy who is poor but makes us laugh ? Ranbir, a deaf, mute, has never let this inhibit him. He is always happy and always upto something, not all if it legal, much to the chagrin of the local cop, Saurabh Shukla, who blames him singlehandedly for reducing his waist size from a respectable 52 to a mundane 42. He falls in love with the elite, gorgeous girl, visiting Darjeeling, Ileana. She is engaged to be married to Jishu, a prize catch, the dream of every girl in college. But she has never encountered anyone as free spirited as Ranbir.Ranbir, though, is the son of a lowly driver. Who works for another elite, powerful family. Who have an autistic daughter, Priyanka. Who has been left in an old age home, Muskaan, run by the gentle, ageing, Haradhan Bandhopadhyay. When Priyanka's nana, the man who runs the house with an iron fist, but has a soft corner for his grand daughter, decides to bring her back due to his ill health, the lives of all the characters get affected and changeThe photography and the music is so good that I'm out of superlatives here. Am sure tourist traffic to Darjeeling is going to increase and the music of this film will be played many years from now, a rarity in todays world, where songs struggle for a shelf life beyond three months. Am not so sure about the editing. The flashbacks, the talking heads. Not sure they were needed in a story which was reasonably fast paced and as entertaining as this. Its almost become a fad now, to not tell a story linearly Ranbir is amazing. Gets every expression just right. Whether his happy face, the ridiculous expressions he uses to make others laugh, his angry 'speech', or his bewildered look when things go wrong, as they have a tendency to do with him. Ileana is stunning in western dresses, early on in the film. She is nice as the adarsh Bengali nari later on, but didn't think much of her older avatar. Undeniably a great actress. Priyanka proves her acting chops once again, conveying her battles with her inner demons appropriatelySpecial praise for Saurabh Shukla. The film would've been flat without his Hardy to Ranbir's Laurel. Or Bhola Raja Sapkota, Ranbir's comrade in arms and translator in chief. Or Rupa Ganguly, Ilena's mother, who understands her daughter's predicament and does what she thinks is best for her. Amongst the moments of the film are the opening credits (set to the song 'Film shuru), the comic chase sequences between Saurabh and Ranbir. The Darjeeling scenes between Ranbir and Ileana – on the train, or cycle or even the horse. And the scene when Haradhan bawls his eyes out, when the apple of his eye, Priyanka leaves the ashram, is just touching beyond belief.After a long time, a film which doesn't just show perfect, rich, urban people. But people who, despite their imperfections, seem determined to be happy. There is a lesson in there for all of us.

9,"Barfi: Splendid Blend of Ingredients, Superlative Taste!","Barfi is that gem which has the capacity of making blood in your heart rush just like children rush through the school gates at the ring of bell. All you have to do is to open yourself and let it do the magic.It offers everything that is there to take from a pure cinematic experience: real characters, genuine relationships, a simple yet poignant story and a soulful score. It offers much more th an this if you can indulge yourself into it a little more. It has acting that connects you straight with the characters and makes you feel for/with them; each frame is a lyrical composition not only by the presence of colors but through their absence as well, the screenplay is such that it either allows the emotions to be overwhelming or would take you out of the scene (completely depends on the viewer).I can only wish to visit the Darjeeling of 70's as portrayed in the movie and I am sure Basu would not have had any problems filming the Kolkata part of the movie as it is the only city which has majority of its elements from that period still intact (No pun intended). Basu has always been good at using earthly elements in his scenes and he reinforces that here too. The manner in which rain, texture of clouds, stones, bright sun have been used to complement various moods in scenes is just exemplary.What makes this movie a winner is the unending list of scenes which will make you laugh, cry and sometimes do both at the same time. Dialogue through expression and enactment has been integrated so beautifully in the movie that you sometimes forget that you are watching a movie where two of the protagonists are incapable of communicating conventionally. It's a movie which celebrates one of the most prized feelings of each human being: the joy of being loved, through a story of people who could have easily decided not to embrace it.

10,"Intoxicating, Brilliant, Inspirational, and Multi-Layered- what films are meant to be","Wow- what an incredible movie! There are so many layers to this film. one could almost see it 4 times and get something new out of it every time.There is a love story A deep love story. Ranvir handles his role with such ease that it's hard to judge whether his acting or directing of Anurag is the greater accomplishment He stands as a challenge to his conscience when he finds the correct answer in his heart Ranvir seems a natural for this role.

7,"Sorry, for me its more a Priyanka's masterpiece than a Ranbir's triumph.","There were two main reasons why I wished to see BARFI after watching his promotional trailers. One it was the Raj Kapoor kind of a silent Chaplin act perfectly done by his talented grandson Ranbir Kapoor and two, the gorgeous Ileana D'Cruz making her debut in a Hindi film posing as a Bengali girl. Hence I entered the theater with these limited expectation of mine and then came out largely satisfied with a pleasant surprise which was not at all expected, quite honestly.The delightful surprise was that contrary to all the praises being showered upon Ranbir Kapoor in so many high star reviews in the media, for me the film was more a milestone achievement of Priyanka Chopra than the over-publicized classy triumph of Ranbir. Undoubtedly Ranbir is there with one of his career best performances as the dumb and deaf boy who falls in love with an autistic girl. But truly speaking, I found the depth missing in his written character throughout the film which resurfaces and touches you deep inside only in the last 20 minutes and not before that.Now basic reason behind this perception of mine is that first of all BARFI has a confusing and less focused script which keeps wandering between comedy and sympathy in an imbalanced manner. Plus the story has many more avoidable angles of greed, murder and mystery which take the focus out of its main theme and you feel distracted. In other words, both before and after intermission it is more like a collage of different comic scenes which get the complete support from its actors, cinematography and background score. So you do enjoy them till they last on the screen but still don't get a collective major impact of the movie in the end as always seen in such ventures having a lovingly emotional conclusion.The soundtrack of the film has been widely appreciated both by the reviewers and listeners. But here too I found the lyrical beauty of the songs much ahead than their melody part, which could have taken them to a different height altogether. So for that matter, it isn't a METRO and I personally feel that one might enjoy the lyrics as mere poetry much more than the songs recorded for some special situations. However I did enjoy the title track and the ghazal on the screen as it made a better impact together in the script.Taking up the most talked about feature of this movie i.e. its performances; I strongly feel that it is a wrongly publicized project giving all the emphasis to only its one lead character, taking the limelight away from all the other deserved candidates in the film. May be its a strategy planned by the makers to sell it as a Ranbir Kapoor movie (which is sure going to get them sure shot buyers and viewers), but for me BARFI is arguably a Priyanka movie much more than a Ranbir Kapoor film. In fact Priyanka surprised me as a shock since I was never expecting such an authentic and touching portrayal of an autistically challenged girl by the lady who has come a long way from an International beauty contest winner model turning into an actress. Her performance in BARFI is undoubtedly her career best till date and I would even like to rate it a step above than Ranbir too because of a basic reason.Ranbir Kapoor in BARFI, as revealed in its promos is simply exceptional and there is no second opinion about that. The boy reminds you of two great masters of their art, Raj Kapoor and Charlie Chaplin with his single act. But his outstanding performance is mainly dependent upon all the comic sequences with which he regularly provides the much needed laughter in the film based on such challenging characters. The viewers enjoy watching him mostly because he is more or less entertaining them with his novel face making techniques, innocent gestures and Chaplin- like sequences. But Priyanka doesn't get that kind of comfort zone in her character and that's what gives her an edge over the more likable act of Ranbir posing as Barfi. Completing the triangle there is another extremely talented girl from the South, Ileana D'Cruz, who straight away announces that she is much ahead than many reputed Hindi film actresses both in the terms of beauty and talent. Supporting the three, there is Saurabh Shukla in his famous form, Rupa Ganguly with her sensitive approach to life and other actors who add their own sparkles to the film with their small but notable acts.Director Anurag Basu once again shows his regained abilities which were simply not there in his KITES. With BARFI he has bounced back strongly hitting a big score but still it cannot be called a clear century from the veteran in my opinion. Continuing with his trademark musicians visible in several scenes, the director has extracted some milestones performances from his lead actors and has made a largely satisfying project which is sure to get appreciation from all corners. However personally I found Anurag at his best only when Ranbir, Priyanka and Illeana get together in the film till its final sequence, which actually is the most impactful part of the movie as I felt.To conclude, BARFI is indisputably one of those few films which do have some exceptional, career best performances given under a fine direction. But it still somehow fails to generate a collective impact on the viewer in the end, missing the target with only a small margin.Yet, there is one message which I always take back home after watching movies made on such differently abled charactersand that's giving ""A BIG THANKS"" to the Almighty above, for blessing us with a sound mind existing in a sound complete body. So do watch it and remember to give your own thanks to the One Above as the end credits start rolling.",sorry me its more priyankas masterpiece than ranbirs triumph,there were two main reasons why i

10,A movie of cinematic excellence,"Barfi , well its a movie which I had been waiting for long. I perceive Barfi as an academy award winner as it brings out the cinematic excellence and emanates the highest attributes of human creativity. It speaks though its silent. Barfi is effortless , it flows smoothly from overture to crescendo. The comedy is so subtle and full of sweet subterfuges. Its an epitome of innocence. I will not reveal anything about the plot but the plot is superb with very miniature flaws that I would not like to notice in the purview of such momentous acting, editing, background scores and mellifluous songs. The narration in the movie is intriguing and funny as well in a sense that keeps the viewer hooked. Songs are well in place, situational comedy is more than appropriate , nothing seems imposed , every scene seems to have taken its own natural course. The movie is set in Darjeeling way back 1970. Ranbir has exuded his panache with excellent acting. Priyanka actually has evolved with this movie and she is all set to move to next level. The screenplay of the movie is amazing, the events are well woven , the movie flip-flops between past and present and the narration makes it very clear, there is no place where events confuse the viewer. Well as a final verdict I would say that I felt cathartic after watching the movie , I expunged all maturity and I found solace in craziness, the movie exposed me to simplicity of life and helped me to appreciate who I am.

10,A Nutshell Review: Barfi!,"Ranbir Kapoor's career is about 5 years old, but he has in recent years been extremely selective about his roles. And this meticulousness perhaps stemmed from his modest Saawariya debut which didn't garner as much acclaim as, say the rest of Bollywood's stars in his generation such as Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, and Ranvir SinghXXX. So while his career may not have started off with a bang, his roles to date have always been roles that make you sit up and take notice. Other than Anjaana Anjaani which also co-starred Priyanka Chopra, his scheming politician in Raajneeti, his bearded salesman in Rocket Singh, and of course, his Rockstar turn, have all been powerhouses, and goes to show he's tops amongst his peers in the industry in constantly reinventing himself and breathing life to the characters he plays.In Barfi!, he challenges himself with the role of a deaf mute, as the titular character whom his parents named after the Murphy Radio set, but for his condition, he only managed something like the title when asked of his name. But he endears himself to the townsfolk with his antics, which has shades of being Tati-esque and Chaplin-ish, and Ranbir does what would be his best impressions and homage to those two great comic greats with his role. But in true Bollywood fashion, writer-director Anurag Basu, like his previous film Kites, are never just steeped in one genre, and Barfi! actually contained two extraordinary romances, with all round great performances undoubtedly with Ranbir stepping up his act. The physical comedy gets balanced with rich emotions, and similar to Rockstar in certain shades, Barfi starts off in very sprightly fashion, before darker emotions come into play. And without the use of his voice, Ranbir has to very much exercise his facial muscles and physical presence, to bring the character to life.And also stepping up is Priyanka Chopra, who is a much better actress than most people would give her credit for. She had shown her versatility in 2 films, playing 12 characters in What's Your Rashee, and up to 7 more challenging ones in 7 Khoon Maaf, but nothing she had done had ever prepare her for this role as Jhilmil, the autistic child in a rich landowning family in Darjeeling. Dropping her usual glamorous self, she tones it really down to play a woman- child afflicted of the condition, and yet making it endearing and very much her own, without going overboard in her portrayal. It's as vividly true as can be, and becomes the fulcrum in which the story revolves around. The role called for some wide-eyed innocence, vulnerability and some fearlessness rolled into one, and she conquered this role quite effortlessly. Her initial pairing with Ranbir Kapoor in Anjaana Anjaani didn't produce the necessary sparks given that both were playing very tired modern roles, but here, both showed why they are currently at the top of their game.And added to the fray as narrator, Barfi's first love and third cog in the Barfi-Jhimil relationship is Bollywood newcomer Ileana D'cruz as Shruti. The first half of the film centered upon Barfi's love for this beauty who had just arrived in town, but lo and behold, in this 70s era, she's already betrothed to someone else, and in Darjeeling to enter into marriage. For what it's worth, societal norms had dictated she see through an arranged marriage rather than to accept Barfi's advances, but bookending this film, is how Fate decided to constantly put them in each other's paths, with fairly different outcomes. But Ileana is not flower vase here, and as if challenged by the other two leads, also had to up the ante in her delivery, making it quite a memorable debut Anurag Basu's story took on more complex proportions to tell a simple tale of romance, and the narrative at points also became like a docu-drama, where key characters in Barfi's life gets interviewed, and forms the narrative when it flashes back to key incidents, told in non- linear style. This works very well, especially when wrapped within, there's a crime mystery that centers around a kidnapping, with three ransoms, and a cliffhanger of sorts that would leave you guessing. It allowed all characters to have screen time to show what they can do, and most would been tickled pink with Barfi's delivery of amusement and fun for the girl of his dreams, before events start to really go south for the titular character. The quality in the production values show, especially with the 70s era that blended CG and production sets quite seamlessly.This heartwarming tale is set to move and touch, because it deals with the notion of choices in life, and how sometimes these choices would have varying repercussions that we will not know their impact, until much later. I can't harp enough on all the actor's delivery, because they are what made Barfi! very much what it was - cute, touching and romantic, all at the same time, with tinges of sadness that depicts what's life. I guarantee the final few scenes in the film will make one's heart ache, because it bordered on selfishness and magnanimity, and surely you wouldn't want to be in anyone's shoes when faced with such a decision. Anurag Basu has a winner in his hands, and that's without resorting to sex or violence, but a healthy dose of charm instead. And Barfi! will charm your socks off. A definite contender amongst the best this year has to offer!",nutshell review barfi,ranbir kapoors career is about 5 years old but he has recent years been extremely selective about his roles this meticulousness perhaps stemmed his modest saawariya debut which didnt garner as much acclaim as say rest bollywoods stars his generation such as deepika padukone anushka sharma ranvir singhxxx so while his career may not have started off with bang his roles date have always been roles that make you sit up take notice other than anjaana anjaani which also co starred priyanka chopra his scheming politician raajneeti his bearded salesman rocket singh course his rockstar turn have all been powerhouses goes show hes tops amongst his peers industry constantly reinventing himself breathing life characters he plays barfi he challenges himself with role deaf mute as titular character whom his parents named after murphy radio set but his condition he only managed something like title when asked his name but he endears himself townsfolk with his antics which has shades being tati esque chaplin ish ranbir does what would be his best impressions homage those two great comic greats with his role but true bollywood fashion writer director anurag basu like his previous film kites are never just steeped one genre barfi actually contained two extraordinary romances with all round great performances undoubtedly with ranbir stepping up his act physical comedy gets balanced with rich emotions similar rockstar certain shades barfi starts off very sprightly fashion before darker emotions come into play without use his voice ranbir has very much exercise his facial muscles physical presence bring character life also stepping up is priyanka chopra who is much better actress than most people would give her credit she had shown her versatility 2 films playing 12 characters whats your rashee up 7 more challenging ones 7 khoon maaf but nothing she had done had ever prepare her this role as jhilmil autistic child rich landowning family darjeeling dropping her usual glamorous self she tones it really down play woman child afflicted condition yet making it endearing very much her own without going overboard her portrayal its as vividly true as can be becomes fulcrum which story revolves around role called some wide eyed innocence vulnerability some fearlessness rolled into one she conquered this role quite effortlessly her initial pairing with ranbir kapoor anjaana anjaani didnt produce necessary sparks given that both were playing very tired modern roles but here both showed why they are currently at top their game added fray as narrator barfis first love third cog barfi jhimil relationship is bollywood newcomer ileana dcruz as shruti first half film centered upon barfis love this beauty who had just arrived town but lo behold this 70s era shes already betrothed someone else darjeeling enter into marriage what its worth societal norms had dictated she see through arranged marriage rather than accept barfis advances but bookending this film is how fate decided constantly put them each others paths with fairly different outcomes but ileana is not flower vase here as if challenged by other two leads also had up ante her delivery making it quite memorable debut anurag basus story took more complex proportions tell simple tale romance narrative at points also became like docu drama where key characters barfis life gets interviewed forms narrative when it flashes back key incidents told non linear style this works very well especially when wrapped within theres crime mystery that centers around kidnapping with three ransoms cliffhanger sorts that would leave you guessing it allowed all characters have screen time show what they can do most would been tickled pink with barfis delivery amusement fun girl his dreams before events start really go south titular character quality production values show especially with 70s era that blended cg production sets quite seamlessly this heartwarming tale is set move touch because it deals with notion choices life how sometimes these choices would have varying repercussions that we will not know their impact until much later i cant harp enough all actors delivery because they are what made barfi very much what it was cute touching romantic all at same time with tinges sadness that depicts whats life i guarantee final few scenes film will make ones heart ache because it bordered selfishness magnanimity surely you wouldnt want be anyones shoes when faced with such decision anurag basu has winner his hands thats without resorting sex or violence but healthy dose charm instead barfi will charm your socks off definite contender amongst best this year has offer,0.468778507571611,0.16395092136471448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.5}"

1,"Rotten, stale dessert gone rancid.","Thanks to multiple rave reviews in this space, elsewhere I finally caught up with ""Barfi"" today.Straight off, the film is an hour too long (yes that's right 60 minutes extra in the era of Attention deficiencies), way too convoluted and seems like a by product of a scatter brain Director/Story writer. And lo and behold in this case the Director and the Writer is one and the same - Anurag Basu.This Basu chap has a none too impressive track record consisting of eminently forgettable stuff like ""Kites"", ""Gangster"", ""Tumsa nahin dekha"", ""Saaya"", ""Kucch to hai"" etc. In ""Barfi"" he lives up to his disastrous track record. Also Anurag Basu is no Chris Nolan to narrate a non linear story spanning multiple time frames with flash backs and flash forwards. He just ends up creating a non elegant maze.Many reviewers have already pointed out the shameless copying Basu has done from movies such as ""The Note Book"", ""Singing in the rain"", ""Cops"", ""Kikujiro"" and of course many Charlie Chaplin movies (most notably ""The Adventurer"" and ""City Lights""). With so much of mish mash the end result is that an hour and half into the film you feel like you are sitting in a boring and meaningless lecture in your college and clock hands on your watch are refusing to move forward. So when the movie ends you shoot out of the movie theater like a bat out of hell all the while making a mental note to never ever watch any more of Basu's offerings.A word about the acting performances. Ranbir Kapoor puts in a competent performance for sure. Going by the current dismal acting standards of Bollywood, his performance seems award winning (atleast the Filmfare variety). Kapoor's character is set in 70's in small town Darjeeling but his mannerisms and body language are all reminiscent of 90's Bollywood films. Ranbir Kapoor should have borrowed a leaf or two from his grand uncle Shashi Kapoor's 1965 film ""Jab Jab Phool Khile"" where Shashi played the role of a poor boat man in Kashmir who falls for a rich tourist girl, Nanda. Ranbir does not get even 50% of his grand uncle's charisma, innocence and authenticity. Ileana D' Cruz has a stock of 3-4 expressions which she puts on depending upon the severity of the situation. Priyanka Chopra in the role of an autist thinks that performances are all about make up, costume and hair pieces. There is no depth and little subtlety in her performance (spare us the repeated slow blink of eyes please). Chopra is no Sean Penn (""I am Sam"") or Dustin Hoffman (""Rainman""). Neither is Ranbir Kapoor, Tom Hanks (""Forrest Gump"") or even Sanjeev Kumar (Koshish).Anurag Basu has cast some acclaimed actors such as Akash Khurana, Ashish Vidyarthi and Roopa Ganguly in supporting roles but their roles are so minuscule and uni- dimensional that they fail to add any heft to the finished product.I am going with 1.5 stars out of 5 for Barfi.

4,The story of an almost mute man who leaves you speechless,"For me, this movie was too long and too boring.Actually there are two parts in the movie, the first is excruciating as the main character tries to get a girl who reminds me of Penelope Cruz. Many times I was frustrated by the main character. I could not make any sense of his gestures. Sorry but he is not such a good communicator. Actually I started hating that actor and would not watch another movie with him on it.The second part was more entertaining. He then settles for a more accessible girl.I guess the movie would be better if it lasted 30 minutes. No more time would be needed for an able director and guionist.",story almost mute man who leaves you speechless,me this movie was too long too boring actually there are two parts movie first is excruciating as main character tries get girl who reminds me penelope cruz many times i was frustrated by main character i could not make any sense his gestures sorry but he is not such good communicator actually i started hating that actor would not watch another movie with him it second part was more entertaining he then settles more accessible girl i guess movie would be better if it lasted 30 minutes no more time would be needed able director guionist,0.4523809523809524,0.09801587301587303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"

Don't be shocked if you see Ranbir Kapoor becoming one of the best actors of bollywood history in 10-15 years..he can do any kind of roles and do without breaking a drop of sweat.. This was RK's best performance till date..Priyanka Chopra portrayed her part brilliantly but it was pleasantly shocking to see a south girl doing so good..Ileana was the soothing factor amidst the madness of Barfi n Jhilmil!Good to see Saurabh Shukla back.. Pritam comes back with a bang..all his songs are good to the ears n suit the movie as well.. last but not the least we talk about Anurag Basu..after Kites's disaster i thought he might be lost..he just nails this one..Special mention:Cinematographer Ravi Varman..,crying laughing at same time,i had lot expectations this movie it hardly disappointed dont be shocked if you see ranbir kapoor becoming one best actors bollywood history 10 15 years he can do any kind roles do without breaking drop sweat this was rks best performance till date priyanka chopra portrayed her part brilliantly but it was pleasantly shocking see south girl doing so good ileana was soothing factor amidst madness barfi n jhilmil good see saurabh shukla back pritam comes back with bang all his songs are good ears n suit movie as well last but not least we talk about anurag basu after kitess disaster i thought he might be lost he just nails this one special mention cinematographer ravi varman,0.5257275132275132,0.21706349206349204,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.14}"
1,Plagiarized,"Its director Anurag Basu is a notorious plagiarizer. True to his reputation he has made Barfi with scenes copied from multiple non-Indian movies like Singing in the Rain, Cops, The Notebook, The Adventurer and City Lights. Even film's background score is a copy of Amelie.The actors have copied the original acting pretty well.

8,"When the character is central, and not the hero","It does not revolutionize Bollywood in any way nor is it an example of superlative cinematic brilliance. There are flaws, and lots of them. But, at the same time it's a lesson in the long-lost art of simple filmmaking without being pretentious. The effort is so genuinely heartwarming that it comes out through the characters in the film. I've been extremely critical of Ranbir Kapoor in the past. Maybe he is dumb, but he can surely act! In Junior Kapoor, we do see glimpses of his grandfather. His goofiness is so bloody infectious. He does not play the sympathy-card, he just lets the film carry him along instead of trying what Bollywood heroes desperately try to do - to carry the film on their shoulders. The character is central, not the hero. One of the very few Hindi films I've seen where the audience connects with the character, and not the hero. Ileana is effortlessly sweet and quite unexpectedly brilliant. Saurabh Shukla delivers a standout and stellar performance. The strength of the film lies in the characterisation - so under-toned, and pitch-perfect to counter-balance the trappings of melodrama. The cinematography is breathtaking and so is the music. The visual imagery adds to the emotional quotient of the film. The earnestness of Anurag Basu does suffer a blow because of the predictability of the plot since the temptation of repetitiveness unwittingly underwhelms the magic created in the first half, and, of course, the disappointing performance of Priyanka Chopra. Instead of under-emoting, she overdoes it. Somehow she goes retard trying to portray an autistic girl. Don't judge this film through the prism of cerebral dissection and critical analysis. For once, listen to your heart, not the critics.",when character is central not hero,it does not revolutionize bollywood any way nor is it example superlative cinematic brilliance there are flaws lots them but at same time its lesson long lost art simple filmmaking without being pretentious effort is so genuinely heartwarming that it comes out through characters film ive been extremely critical ranbir kapoor past maybe he is dumb but he can surely act junior kapoor we do see glimpses his grandfather his goofiness is so bloody infectious he does not play sympathy card he just lets film carry him along instead trying what bollywood heroes desperately try do carry film their shoulders character is central not hero one very few hindi films ive seen where audience connects with character not hero ileana is effortlessly sweet quite unexpectedly brilliant saurabh shukla delivers standout stellar performance strength film lies characterisation so under toned pitch perfect counter balance trappings melodrama cinematography is breathtaking so is music visual imagery adds emotional quotient film earnestness anurag basu does suffer blow because predictability plot since temptation repetitiveness unwittingly underwhelms magic created first half course disappointing performance priyanka chopra instead under emoting she overdoes it somehow she goes retard trying portray autistic girl dont judge this film through prism cerebral dissection critical analysis once listen your heart not critics,0.5400343915343915,0.011611111111111107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8,Longer than expected but eternally beautiful,"Barfi - CATCH IT (A-) Barfi, an unlikely love triangle of a normal girl, mute boy and autism girl. This is an unlikely combination, which Doesn't seems like to work in Indian Cinema but things have been changed and great success of Barfi proves that even if the hero and heroine are not stereotypical a good story can lead to utmost success. Barfi is not a perfect movie, it was too long and becomes complicated as we travel back and forth between 1976, 1979 and 2012. Besides that life being so easy and cheerful for a mute boy and autism girl is hard to accept, there is a time they live alone for 6 months in big Calcutta city, he can't talk and she doesn't understand but apparently they are happier than ever, how they communicate with world is not explained. Anyways I know it's a movie and i should not go onto that much dept. So, kudos to Anurag Basu for making and attempting a brave subject matter. Ranbir Kapoor is great as always, though his performance is almost the same as in a movie ""Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani"" with Katrina Kaif ""where he tries to get her affection"". This time he was only mute. Priyanka Chopra did a fine job and looked the part. Ileana D'Cruz is a fresh faced beautiful girl. Standing next to too famous young actors and still getting noticed is a huge achievement. In the end, Barfi maybe long but it's fresh, beautiful and heartening.",longer than expected but eternally beautiful,barfi catch it barfi unlikely love triangle normal girl mute boy autism girl this is unlikely combination which doesnt seems like work indian cinema but things have been changed great success barfi proves that even if hero heroine are not stereotypical good story can lead utmost success barfi is not perfect movie it was too long becomes complicated as we travel back forth between 1976 1979 2012 besides that life being so easy cheerful mute boy autism girl is hard accept there is time they live alone 6 months big calcutta city he cant talk she doesnt understand but apparently they are happier than ever how they communicate with world is not explained anyways i know its movie i should not go onto that much dept so kudos anurag basu making attempting brave subject matter ranbir kapoor is great as always though his performance is almost same as movie ajab prem ki ghazab kahani with katrina kaif where he tries get her affection this time he was only mute priyanka chopra did fine job looked part ileana dcruz is fresh faced beautiful girl standing next too famous young actors still getting noticed is huge achievement end barfi maybe long but its fresh beautiful heartening,0.5572649572649571,0.2032828282828283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
4,Good plot but flawed direction,"Despite the IMDb rating of 9.1, I found ""Barfi"" a pretty average movie. There are several reasons for that. Some of them are: 1. Positioning of the movie in the director's mind is not very clear. Whether he wanted it to be a good blend of comedy and drama , he has failed to do that.2. As a viewer, ""Barfi"" failed to grab my consistent attention during the whole 2.5 hours. There were several missed opportunities during the movie by the director. This could've been a good blend of comedy and emotions but the emotion part was missed out on several occasions. For example, the character of Jhilmil had lots of potential and so has Priyanka however director failed to provide opportunities to both.3. The background music is monotone throughout the movie irrespective of the demand of the scene. As a result there is quite a cheerful music even on sad occasions.4. The character of Barfi was partially inspired by the great Charlie Chaplin. some of the ""creative"" scenes in the movie are 100% copy from Charlie Chaplin movies.few good points of the movie are the character of ""Shruti"" played beautifully by Ileana in 3 different life stages and some creativity including the way Barfi used to throw his shoes for Jhilmil and shadow play on the wall by Jhilmil and Barfi.If you are planning to watch ""Barfi"" and expecting an extraordinary excellent direction, story, comedy and drama like ""Munna Bhai MBBS"" you will be disappointed. However, I must say, its a good time-pass movie.

10,India's Entry for Oscars is here....,"Amazing story, perfect, thoughtful and innovative direction, superb screenplay and editing, best music and lyrics and to top it up with fantastic acting - you ask and BARFI has it ALL!! Hats off to Anurag Basu for coming up with a very thoughtful story and putting it up in the form of a fantastic movie. The story narration has been the best I have seen in the Indian cinema. Even while the movie goes back and forth in time, there was a great sense of clarity in the story flow and the movie doesn't lose the attention or the interest of the viewer even for a second. The climax does the perfect justice to the entire movie and makes it complete. The music and lyrics fits well to the situations and make it a musical treat. Priyanka Chopra impresses the most with pure acting (she hardly had two or three different dialogs to say), very accurate expressions which showed she had done her homework well (understanding her role of an Autism affected person). She steals the show from Ranbir even with less screen time. The movie constantly added new dimensions to her role from a portrayal of a mentally challenged girl who can also be a loving girl friend and then a jealous wife – Priyanka does all that so very seamlessly. Ranbir impresses as always. This film goes into his all-time-best movies which also includes Wake Up Sid and Rocket Singh. As an actor, this is the first time he has taken up a challenging role and proves that he is here for some serious business. While a lot of acting is already there in the blood, this kind of role required an extra effort which he does. Illena does good in her first Bollywood movie. She does make a mark within the limited scope that she was provided with. I would support this movie for India's entry to Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category for its sheer excellence delivered.",indias entry oscars is here,amazing story perfect thoughtful innovative direction superb screenplay editing best music lyrics top it up with fantastic acting you ask barfi has it all hats off anurag basu coming up with very thoughtful story putting it up form fantastic movie story narration has been best i have seen indian cinema even while movie goes back forth time there was great sense clarity story flow movie doesnt lose attention or interest viewer even second climax does perfect justice entire movie makes it complete music lyrics fits well situations make it musical treat priyanka chopra impresses most with pure acting she hardly had two or three different dialogs say very accurate expressions which showed she had done her homework well understanding her role autism affected person she steals show ranbir even with less screen time movie constantly added new dimensions her role portrayal mentally challenged girl who can also be loving girl friend then jealous wife priyanka does all that so very seamlessly ranbir impresses as always this film goes into his all time best movies which also includes wake up sid rocket singh as actor this is first time he has taken up challenging role proves that he is here some serious business while lot acting is already there blood this kind role required extra effort which he does illena does good her first bollywood movie she does make mark within limited scope that she was provided with i would support this movie indias entry oscars best foreign language film category its sheer excellence delivered,0.47501635401635406,0.32961231361231363,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.21}"
