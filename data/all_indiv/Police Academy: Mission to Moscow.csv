2.0,"""They've been doing this act for over a hundred years.""","What is it that's so resolutely unfunny about Mission to Moscow? Is it the lifeless direction? The disinterested performances? The lack of atmosphere? The joke-free script? It's all of these things, of course, but there's also something inexplicably poor about it that you just can't quite put your finger on.The regulars are the major weak point. While the guest cast have the misjudged enthusiasm to irksomely overact, all the usual culprits seem embarrassed by the whole thing. None of them sell their underwritten, reheated lines, and the fact that Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey failed to sign up is a damning indictment. What comes through the screen, from George Gaynes to David Graf, is the sense of souls bleeding. ""Please get me a proper job, there must be a better way to pay my mortgage"" these actors scream with every fibre of their being. Leslie Easterbrook gets her usual single ""my character's got big breasts"" joke - why does she even bother to sign up for this crap? Michael Winslow looks old, tired, and frankly bored with the whole thing. Was his involvement only confirmed at the last minute? Because while he gives a curiously muted performance throughout, the script also fails to accommodate his talents in almost any way. Note that this is the ONLY Police Academy sequel in which he doesn't do his (admittedly run into the ground) ""Bruce Lee"" schtick.Police Academy managed to keep up the same level of quality between films three to six - they were all rubbish. But even by their low standards Mission to Moscow plumbs the depths, making Citizens on Patrol look like Annie Hall. New recruit Charlie Schlatter, there for the completely incongruous love interest theme, is never funny and the Russian characters are the crass stereotypes you'd expect. Any film that promises ""we're going to kick buttski"" is clearly dumber than is tolerable, and a tasteless reference to Chernobyl doesn't help matters.The only Police Academy film made outside the 80s, it was produced five years after the last one - why?!!?? Was there a big demand in the market for sh*te? Some cartoon sound effects (whistles, birdcall, etc.) are added to the action to try and pep things up, but this really is a DOA of a movie. True to form (or should that be formula?) it ends with an extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing.Just look at scenes like the one where G.W. Bailey gets hit in the face with stew. The stew is clearly missing his face and just lands on his chin, so Bailey (the only regular who tries) moves his face so that the full brunt of the stew will land on it. This dedication to duty is admirable, but also perfectly highlights the sloppy desperation of the whole thing. The series' move from the teen fodder of the first two, 15 certificate, movies had been subverted into the last five, PG cert entries. This is at its lowest ebb here; a comedy that seems wholly aimed at the under-5s and doesn't know what to do with its characters. Russian acrobats entertain the kiddies while its ... er... ""stars""... are left to stand around like second bananas, giving unfunny reaction shots.Maybe it's the ""fish out of water"" feel of it all, with the somewhat flat Russian espionage themes failing to ignite. But whatever it is, Mission to Moscow feels like a TV sitcom with the canned laughter track removed. In any other franchise this would be described as an ""unfortunate, sad end"" to the series. With Police Academy however, finishing with one of the unfunniest comedies of all time seems strangely apt. 2/10.",theyve been doing this act over hundred years,what is it thats so resolutely unfunny about mission moscow is it lifeless direction disinterested performances lack atmosphere joke free script its all these things course but theres also something inexplicably poor about it that you just cant quite put your finger regulars are major weak point while guest cast have misjudged enthusiasm irksomely overact all usual culprits seem embarrassed by whole thing none them sell their underwritten reheated lines fact that bubba smith marion ramsey failed sign up is damning indictment what comes through screen george gaynes david graf is sense souls bleeding please get me proper job there must be better way pay my mortgage these actors scream with every fibre their being leslie easterbrook gets her usual single my characters got big breasts joke why does she even bother sign up this crap michael winslow looks old tired frankly bored with whole thing was his involvement only confirmed at last minute because while he gives curiously muted performance throughout script also fails accommodate his talents almost any way note that this is only police academy sequel which he doesnt do his admittedly run into ground bruce lee schtick police academy managed keep up same level quality between films three six they were all rubbish but even by their low standards mission moscow plumbs depths making citizens patrol look like annie hall new recruit charlie schlatter there completely incongruous love interest theme is never funny russian characters are crass stereotypes youd expect any film that promises were going kick buttski is clearly dumber than is tolerable tasteless reference chernobyl doesnt help matters only police academy film made outside 80s it was produced five years after last one why was there big demand market sh te some cartoon sound effects whistles birdcall etc are added action try pep things up but this really is doa movie true form or should that be formula it ends with extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing just look at scenes like one where g w bailey gets hit face with stew stew is clearly missing his face just lands his chin so bailey only regular who tries moves his face so that full brunt stew will land it this dedication duty is admirable but also perfectly highlights sloppy desperation whole thing series move teen fodder first two 15 certificate movies had been subverted into last five pg cert entries this is at its lowest ebb here comedy that seems wholly aimed at under 5s doesnt know what do with its characters russian acrobats entertain kiddies while its er stars are left stand around like second bananas giving unfunny reaction shots maybe its fish out water feel it all with somewhat flat russian espionage themes failing ignite but whatever it is mission moscow feels like tv sitcom with canned laughter track removed any other franchise this would be described as unfortunate sad end series with police academy however finishing with one unfunniest comedies all time seems strangely apt 2 10,0.4671358211680792,-0.001439219382767775,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,Awful,"The original Police Academy movie was the best comedy film ever in my opinion. Ten years after it's release we got to see the quite awful Police Academy 7.It ruins the spirit of a film series when later installments fail to match up to the original. The Police Academy films were brilliant with the exception of Part 4 but even Part 4 was better than this.For starters, it was too serious. The first six Police Academy films had our heroes battling bumbling foes such as street punks and bumbling diamond thieves. But in this movie the heroes battled the Russian mafia. It didn't seem right.There were very few laughs in this movie, in fact there were none really. Maybe it would have been better if there had been more laughs and a less serious storyline. Being serious didn't do this film any justice.I felt real disappointed when I first watched this in 1994 because it got me thinking about how I had sat in a cinema ten years earlier enjoying a really funny movie.",awful,original police academy movie was best comedy film ever my opinion ten years after its release we got see quite awful police academy 7 it ruins spirit film series when later installments fail match up original police academy films were brilliant with exception part 4 but even part 4 was better than this starters it was too serious first six police academy films had our heroes battling bumbling foes such as street punks bumbling diamond thieves but this movie heroes battled russian mafia it didnt seem right there were very few laughs this movie fact there were none really maybe it would have been better if there had been more laughs less serious storyline being serious didnt do this film any justice i felt real disappointed when i first watched this 1994 because it got me thinking about how i had sat cinema ten years earlier enjoying really funny movie,0.4827257799671592,0.027898193760262733,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.19}"
,"One weak, stupid pratfall after another","The fine men and women of the Police Academy get seconded to Moscow to help the police there deal with the threat of the Moscow Mafia. Namely one Konstantine Konali who has invented a video game that is sweeping the nation. He plans a sequel that will include a piece of software that will him access to any computer that comes in contact with the game. Can the officers get enough evidence before he succeeds? Meanwhile Lassard gets lost and moves in with a Russian family.I always feel that when even the support characters start to back out of a film series then you're onto a loser. Surely the fact that even Steve Guttenberg felt he'd had enough by part 4 should have told the makers and the audience that enough was enough. The plot is  oh arse, what's the point!!? Imagine all the characters being allowed to get into all sorts of stupid and unlikely situations all in the name of dumb jokes and you'll have an idea of what this is about. The plot of bringing down the Russian mob is only evident at the start and end  the rest of it is just one silly pratfall after another. Some of it is amusing  I've always found Lassard's innocent wanderings to be pretty funny and the only smile I had was where he wnet off with a Russian family!None of the cast have anything approaching ambition or drive. They seem happy to be sitting in their cartoon characters for 7 movies! Gaynes is as dopey as ever but I like that. Graf is dead now and it's sad to think this is his legacy. I have seen him in other films and he's OK when he's not just shouting and firing comedy guns. Winslow needs to get a new act  does anyone find `the human sound effect' funny anymore? Easterbrook is blonde with large breasts  and that's all the film needs her to do. Schlatter makes a weak lead man and is real poor. But wait  my God but who are these support actors?Is that Claire Forlani? Why yes it is, well I suppose she was still at the bottom of her career ladder. Oh no  tell me that isn't Ron Perlman, but it was and he just seems content to be in an American movie no matter how bad it is. Worse still is the fact that Christopher Lee is in this at all  I know he is having a great spell at the moment but is this how low he sunk at one point?Overall this has almost no smiles in it never mind laughs of any form.

,now it's stupid,"I now know how everyone felt about these films. The first six I got through ok, I have a pretty wide sense of humor. But this, oh is it awful. I mean come on, George Gaynes is now the lead actor in the credits?! Bubba's gone, Matt McCoy's gone, not even Lance Kinsey's Proctor came back. And poor Charlie Schlatter. Six years ago he was starring opposite the legendary George Burns in ""18 Again,"" and now he's doing stuff like this. I feel for ya, bro. But as far as the film goes, here's what passed for a joke: Gaynes getting into the wrong car and riding with strangers...oh stop, your killin me! And way too painful sight gags like Bailey's inner ear being yanked with an earpiece through a wall. Mmm, that was just tough to watch, not funny. I have to come clean here, though. I did not see this entire movie. I gave it 45 minutes but just couldn't take it anymore, it was just too putrid.

,A serious drama about mental illness,"Imagine having your testicles ripped off by a Grizzly and you're half way to appreciating how painful an experience this movie is. Whatever you thought about the previous Police Academy movies (and I'm not particularly fond of any of them) they at least fitted in to the genre of comedy. This one creates it's own sub-genre: the anti-comedy. There's not a single joke in the entire film that makes any sense, and this is partly due to the fact that the script reads as though it was translated from English into Russian and then back again. And I'm not trying to insult the Russians. They get a hard enough time in the movie. If the makers of this film are to be believed, the Russian people are a humourless bunch, and so you imagine that the producers thought that a film with absolutely no humour in it would go down a storm with Moscow audiences. Now, I've never seen a Russian comedy, but I think it's safe to bet that they're better than this.In one scene, a character batters a hole in a hotel room door using an ice bucket stuck to his head. I don't know why, and it's typical of this film that you're never quite sure what it is you're supposed to be laughing at. The jokes just rattle on and on like this making no sense whatsoever.If you were to convince yourself that what you were actually watching was a serious drama about the mental illness of a high-ranking police officer lost in Moscow, you might get some perverse pleasure out of this. On the video packet, though, the distributors assure us that it's a comedy, so you can't even give the film the benefit of the doubt.It's interesting to note that after the Police Academy team's adventure in Moscow, the authorities saw fit to let them back into their own country, where they went on to make Police Academy : The Series which is, believe it or not, even worse than this.Best to watch this drunk.

1.0,Worth Waiting 5 Years For...,"...said no one ever. So, the last Police Academy sequel was in 1989. It was terrible. This one came out in 1994 and it proudly picks up where the last one left off. Christopher Lee plays a Russian police commandant who can't catch criminal kingpin Ron Perlman. So he sends to America for the Police Academy losers. This is surreal. The plot is so deeply stupid that I lose IQ points just typing it. Series regulars George Gaynes, Michael Winslow, David Graf, Leslie Easterbrook, and G.W. Bailey return. No laughs are to be had. The cast, whose likability kept the series afloat early on even when the jokes missed the mark, can do nothing to save this sinking ship. Actually, it had already sunk by this point. Now it's just a few survivors desperately trying to stay afloat before the sharks eat them.

2.0,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,"So Russia finally lets the US of A film in their country around important historical communist landmarks, and what is the first production to gain this honour...Police Academy 7.The first sequence in the film and straight away I notice a huge blooper! The news reporter on TV is playing with a Gameboy (I think), apparently playing a new popular game. On closer inspection, as we get close ups, you notice there isn't actually a game cart in the back of the GB, utter fail in the first five minutes.The plot kinda sounds OK when you think about it, the Russian mafia laundering money under the guise of a highly addictive and popular video game. The bad guys use this game to be able to hack into any computer system it has been played on, hence they are able to commit many crimes. So Lassard and his best men are brought in to bring down this Russian gang led by a well cast Perlman.The cast for this final outing is sparse, we still have Tackleberry, Jones, Callahan, and Harris, but we are missing many of the regular officers such as Hightower, Hooks, Proctor, Fackler, Nick Lassard and of course old Mahoney. This time without Nick Lassard as the Mahoney replacement, we have another replacement, this time for Nick Lassard! This new recruit looks like a young Matt McCoy (Nick Lassard) but has none of the charm, I'm not even sure why he's in the film really as he pretty much does nothing.That is the whole problem with this film, nothing actually happens. There aren't really any pranks, not many laughs, no training sequences (thank god) and not much plot excitement. There is one amusing sequence where Harris and Tackleberry join in on a Russian ballet performance in full get up, but that's about it really. There are some silly acrobatics from some Russian cops that seem to be mute, a mediocre car chase and a small hint of humour. Not even Harris or his Russian equivalent can help this film.Unfortunately its a poor exit for the franchise with this final film, the last film was quite good at times but this is really dull and not at all visually exciting, its all filmed on location in Russia but it looks grim. Cultural differences are of course used but none of it really works, its just not funny. The fact that Cmdt.

I wonder how many people that trashed this film actually watched it. And I wonder if they are the same ones that sing the praises of Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo. There is at least two genuinely funny scenes, one of which I referred to in the subject. I won't spoil the other one for you. The plot isn't completely contrived either. The premise of the Russian video game as a criminal tool is great. I wish it had been explored further. Konstantin Kanali (Ron Pearlman) is genuinely funny and charismatic. Cmdt. Lasard (George Gaines) also steals a few scenes. I never tire of his deadpan expression.This isn't Citizen Kane but it might induce a few chuckles. Just don't try to analyze it as if it were the Godfather. **/*****",im de bathrooooom,spoilers as if anybody cares i just found this movie imdbs bottom 150 films as longtime fan pa series decided watch it again see if its really as bad as people are claiming it be folks its not that bad its just your average slapstick comedy errors i wonder how many people that trashed this film actually watched it i wonder if they are same ones that sing praises deuce bigelow male gigolo there is at least two genuinely funny scenes one which i referred subject i wont spoil other one you plot isnt completely contrived either premise russian video game as criminal tool is great i wish it had been explored further konstantin kanali ron pearlman is genuinely funny charismatic cmdt lasard george gaines also steals few scenes i never tire his deadpan expression this isnt citizen kane but it might induce few chuckles just dont try analyze it as if it were godfather,0.4848484848484848,-0.09507575757575756,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.15}"
2.0,The franchise is running on fumes...if at all.,"The first ""Police Academy"" was a mildly funny film with a lot of jokes...some very funny, many not. It's surprising because of this that six other film sequels followed as well as a short-lived TV series. While I have only seen the first two films, I decided to watch this final movie for one big reason...it's currently on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 lowest rated major release films. Somehow it turned out to be the only entry in the series to make the list.The plot involves SOME of the idiots from the previous films being invited to Russia to help the Russian police capture a gangster named Kanali (Ron Perlman). And, once there, the team act like a bunch of brain-dead buffoons. Steve Guttenberg left the series after the fourth film (a sure sign that the franchise stinks when even Guttenberg won't appear in the movies), he's replaced with a bland wimp played by...well, who cares?? He's not the only absence...several other series regulars are strangely absent....their good luck, actually as the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever....none.How bad all this? Well, for starters nothing about this is funny. Instead of laughs, they use a lot of bad slapstick...such as a scene where the perennial foil, Captain Harris, has a dog urinate in his face and several scenes where guys are hit in the crotch. Also, for big laughs(?) all the sound effects not done by Michael Winslow were stangely loud and exaggerated. None of the film makes much sense and it's obvious that the actors were simply going through the motions in order to get a paycheck and they had pretty much given up on their careers.Overall, a film that is LESS funny than cancer...and a truly cynical excuse to squeeze the last few dollars out of a failing franchise. See it only if, like me, you actually WANT to see all of the Bottom 100. I can think of no other reason to see it...unless you are a masochist or plan on using it to torture someone.I give this one a 2....as at least the film has nice cinematography and is in focus and has sound.",franchise is running fumes if at all,first police academy was mildly funny film with lot jokes some very funny many not its surprising because this that six other film sequels followed as well as short lived tv series while i have only seen first two films i decided watch this final movie one big reason its currently imdbs infamous bottom 100 list 100 lowest rated major release films somehow it turned out be only entry series make list plot involves some idiots previous films being invited russia help russian police capture gangster named kanali ron perlman once there team act like bunch brain dead buffoons steve guttenberg left series after fourth film sure sign that franchise stinks when even guttenberg wont appear movies hes replaced with bland wimp played by well who cares hes not only absence several other series regulars are strangely absent their good luck actually as film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever none how bad all this well starters nothing about this is funny instead laughs they use lot bad slapstick such as scene where perennial foil captain harris has dog urinate his face several scenes where guys are hit crotch also big laughs all sound effects not done by michael winslow were stangely loud exaggerated none film makes much sense its obvious that actors were simply going through motions order get paycheck they had pretty much given up their careers overall film that is less funny than cancer truly cynical excuse squeeze last few dollars out failing franchise see it only if like me you actually want see all bottom 100 i can think no other reason see it unless you are masochist or plan using it torture someone i give this one 2 as at least film has nice cinematography is focus has sound,0.4848197471078827,0.0006355932203389845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,A masterpiece.,"After perusing some of the other reviews of this superb film, it occurred to me that most -- if not all -- reviewers are simply missing the point of this film. Yes, it is a light hearted, often brilliantly funny comedy, but it is also a serious and reverent look at Russian culture, shown in perhaps the only truly effective way it can be shown, from the perspective of a policeman in training. A cop on the street, a cop on the beat. I challenge you to watch this film, and take the title to heart: Mission to Moscow. Make it your mission to enter the heart of this great city seen through the eyes and ears of both comic genius and police authority.

This is a comedy without any jokes, no story, no anything. It's not hard to get why this is the last credit for both screenwriters. We see something with a bellboy in a hotel, then something with Lassard getting in the wrong car, some bike tricks with Jones, just try to make a plot out of this. The actors all look incredibly bored, even the new guy seems like he's already sick of these movies. The attempts to humour are just really bizarre. Of course you have the usual reused jokes from the original, but now they've added weird cartoon sound effects to them like you're on a really bad trip. In reality you're just watching a really bad movie. Really it's no surprise this movie tanked, just check out the tagline. Oh God the tagline. Kicking buttski(cringe).

7.0,Not bad considering it was a low budget direct to video release,"I never saw this movie in it's original US direct to video release back in 1994 and I would not have paid to see it had it been released theatrically in the US like it was in the UK but considering it can be downloaded for pennies online I decided to check it out today. I was actually amused and even chuckled at this silly movie. I do admit that seeing the great Christopher Lee in this movie was surprising but then I read on some other websites that he did it as a personal favor to the director ?? or something.Mr Lee does try hard with the limited time he's on screen,I laughed at his scenes with Gaynes,especially when they kissed each other on the mouth at the end of the movie, I fell out of my chair laughing. Michael Winslow has two funny scenes with Mr Lee too,he is so funny with his mouth noises.Ron Perlman doesn't fair as well as the bad guy,he comes off like a Boris and Natasha cartoon character. I did think Leslie Easterbrook was funny in that big hairdo and especially when she falls off the piano while singing. Look for GW Bailey dressed in a tutu doing ballet ,the scene is so stupid that it's funny. I also remember Charlie Schlatter as a cadet who sneaks his way into the Moscow Mission,he did some other better movies before PA but unlike some other actors ,if your not a high tier you might have to just take what comes your way to earn a paycheck.Hey I would do a PA movie ,it would be good fun and to get paid for it too would just be a bonus. One thing noted,they did film it in Moscow ,if you watch the backgrounds during the car chase scenes you will see some beautiful buildings and scenery in Moscow. The ceremony scene at the end was filmed in Red Square. I also read this article about what was going on during the film shoot.""In the midst of shooting, cast and crew had to retreat quickly when Government troops began their October 1993 assault on the Russian parliament building. Series producer Paul Maslanski (who also made The Russia House in Moscow) and director Alan Metter (Back to School) were lunching at the US Embassy when the confrontation began. They decided to regroup with their company at the quaintly-named Hotel Gorbachev Finance Academy about five miles from the chaos. After a few days indoors and confident that President Yeltsin had regained control, their fictitious mayhem was able to resume.So there was some actual mayhem going on. Still not bad for a movie that actually got filmed in Russias capital of all places.Enjoy",not bad considering it was low budget direct video release,i never saw this movie its original us direct video release back 1994 i would not have paid see it had it been released theatrically us like it was uk but considering it can be downloaded pennies online i decided check it out today i was actually amused even chuckled at this silly movie i do admit that seeing great christopher lee this movie was surprising but then i read some other websites that he did it as personal favor director or something mr lee does try hard with limited time hes screen i laughed at his scenes with gaynes especially when they kissed each other mouth at end movie i fell out my chair laughing michael winslow has two funny scenes with mr lee too he is so funny with his mouth noises ron perlman doesnt fair as well as bad guy he comes off like boris natasha cartoon character i did think leslie easterbrook was funny that big hairdo especially when she falls off piano while singing look gw bailey dressed tutu doing ballet scene is so stupid that its funny i also remember charlie schlatter as cadet who sneaks his way into moscow mission he did some other better movies before pa but unlike some other actors if your not high tier you might have just take what comes your way earn paycheck hey i would do pa movie it would be good fun get paid it too would just be bonus one thing noted they did film it moscow if you watch backgrounds during car chase scenes you will see some beautiful buildings scenery moscow ceremony scene at end was filmed red square i also read this article about what was going during film shoot midst shooting cast crew had retreat quickly when government troops began their october 1993 assault russian parliament building series producer paul maslanski who also made russia house moscow director alan metter back school were lunching at us embassy when confrontation began they decided regroup with their company at quaintly named hotel gorbachev finance academy about five miles chaos after few days indoors confident that president yeltsin had regained control their fictitious mayhem was able resume so there was some actual mayhem going still not bad movie that actually got filmed russias capital all places enjoy,0.4968412698412699,0.13589417989417987,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"

This one sees the few remaining familiar faces heading off to Russia to combat an evil megalomaniac who plans to put Trojan horse software into a popular video game franchise he's created.It's as ludicrous as it sounds, but what really hurts MISSION TO MOSCOW is the lack of talent involved. I never thought I'd miss Steve Guttenberg but I really did and David Graf is no substitute. Michael Winslow is the only one I have any remaining liking for and even he's more annoying than funny here. Poor old George Gaynes and G.W. Bailey play out the same tired gags that they've been running since the first instalment.It's fair to say that I never laughed once during this puerile gag-fest in which all the jokes are well telegraphed, the slapstick is painful rather than amusing, and the acting embarrassing. This is the infamous POLICE ACADEMY that Christopher Lee appeared in as a favour, although thankfully he's not on screen too much.
