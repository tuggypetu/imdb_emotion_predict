10.0,Best romantic comedy ever,"* May contain spoilers *Let's face it: everyone's a sucker for romantic comedies, but this one is something special. This movie has as much charm as it has bite, thanks to a fantastic script and Murray's excellent performance. Never dull or cheesy, this wonderful fantasy tale just hits all the right notes, and if anyone knows a better rom-com, please name it. I mean: what other romantic comedies are there where the protagonist commits suicide and you just have to laugh?I've watched 'Groundhog Day' countless times and, without a doubt, I will watch it again and again (or for as long as I keep waking up to that nerve-wrecking song by Sonny & Cher). Priceless.

10.0,"A perfect blend of comedy, clever plotting, and character study","Even the funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after I've watched them enough times that the humor no longer surprises me. A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as ""Groundhog Day,"" which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.Superficially, this film belongs roughly in the same genre as ""All of Me"" and ""Liar Liar,"" comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy, whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film, where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman, Murray's hard-edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is, ""I may be having a problem."" Uh, no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film, he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation, like ""My years are not advancing as fast as you might think."" It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully, but it reflects a well-conceived screenplay.In this comedy, the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough, but every time that alarm clock goes off, and the radio starts playing, ""I Got You Babe,"" and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy (""Phiiiil?""), I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film (I've met one or two) emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint, since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. ""Groundhog Day,"" however, works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.The film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hour-and-a-half showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that ""Groundhog Day"" avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities, since most high-concept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. ""Groundhog Day"" is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise, leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely: it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic, and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.It is in the middle, centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita, when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things (such as his exploits with Nancy) under ordinary circumstances, without the hocus pocus. In the end, his powers don't matter, because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing, but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god, but he isn't all-powerful.Phil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita, the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap, for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning, even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier, Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's ""defining characteristic,"" and, indeed, he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end; he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.I have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth, but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film, the effect is intentional, for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.Though this film has a serious message, it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point. After the laughter has worn down, ""Groundhog Day"" turns out to be one of the richest and deepest films I've ever seen.",perfect blend comedy clever plotting character study,even funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after ive watched them enough times that humor no longer surprises me joke never has same effect when you know punch line advance but every once blue moon comedy comes along that is so thoughtful meaningful addition being funny that after seeing it dozen times laughing less often i start noticing its depth insight me no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as groundhog day which happens be my favorite movie all time superficially this film belongs roughly same genre as all me liar liar comedies which character becomes victim some weird supernatural fate must adapt insane logic situation but steve martin jim carrey are geniuses physical comedy whereas bill murray specializes understatement i cant imagine any other approach having worked this film where world is going crazy around phil weatherman murrays hard edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up what makes initial scenes which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is mounting panic his demeanor even as he tries act like everythings normal all he can think say is i may be having problem uh no kidding throughout rest film hell deliver similarly muted lines describe his situation like my years are not advancing as fast as you might think its striking that man who has all time world would choose his words so carefully but it reflects well conceived screenplay this comedy laughs are reinforced by repetition absurdity phil discovering that hes repeating same day is funny enough but every time that alarm clock goes off radio starts playing i got you babe phil goes through same motions meets same people then goes out into street be accosted by same annoying high school buddy phiiiil i laugh again because im reminded how funny it was first time around people who didnt like this film ive met one or two emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated i sort understand that complaint since jokes repeated over over usually fail miserably groundhog day however works uniquely well because situation gets increasingly absurd phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails pass film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent entire hour half showing phil meeting same people doing same things time again fact that groundhog day avoids this fate is one its more striking qualities since most high concept comedies this sort fall apart third act groundhog day is rare example one that completely follows through with its premise leading initial situation logically ending only jeopardy scene feels like skit that could have appeared anywhere but this scene actually is placed wisely it occurs when phil is becoming increasingly bored lethargic it is used separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports it is middle centering phils attempts seduce rita when film reveals itself be more than just comedy underlying implication these scenes is that phils powers are less important than he thinks they are he probably could have done same things such as his exploits with nancy under ordinary circumstances without hocus pocus end his powers dont matter because rita is too smart sees right through him she may not understand full supernatural implications what hes doing but she senses that hes somehow manipulating situation phil may think hes god but he isnt all powerful phils character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe situation would force him look inward because he loves such sincere woman as rita only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it change he undergoes isnt implausible leap he maintains many same basic character traits he had at beginning even though he becomes kinder more caring earlier rita says that egocentrism is phils defining characteristic indeed he doesnt stop being egocentric at end he merely learns channel egocentrism positive direction i have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off murray is not only comic actor have proved himself capable dramatic depth but hes one few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous serious side into same character hes master at conveying complex emotions through apparent deadpan when his delivery sounds stilted this film effect is intentional hes playing man whose life has become script though this film has serious message it is still quintessentially comedy but its comedy that uses psychological exploration fascinating character make its point after laughter has worn down groundhog day turns out be one richest deepest films ive ever seen,0.5305834204110068,0.057882208787381206,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Neglected Masterpiece,"I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.* * * * *ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. ""When you hit it right, those things last.""I found that quote in a story on Ramis' death. The story curiously did not mention ""Groundhog Day.""

9.0,When the gods wish to punish us...,"In Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude. I love this movie  not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away  they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing? Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing. 9.5/10",when gods wish punish us,harold ramiss groundhog day 1993 intriguing comedy about repeating past bill murray is phil connors arrogantly self centered cynical tv weatherman sent fifth time small town punxsutawney pa cover groundhog ceremony held every february 2nd he stumbles into time warp winds up repeating same day over over again until forced look at himself distance examine his attitude i love this movie not only it is one best most original clever funniest comedies ive seen it also makes you think serious questions instance when gods want punish mean arrogant sob they would not take his sanity away they will make whole world around him mad let him deal with situation or another question what would you do if you have eternity your hands is it curse or blessing groundhog day does not reuse tired stupid jokes its humor comes situations characters bill murray was born play phil connors movie uses his talent as comedian fullest i think it was best role murray ever played his character has gone through transformation before our eyes it was very convincing 9 5 10,0.5767857142857143,0.039087301587301594,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,"Ingenious concept, enthusiastically presented.","Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).Pittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.It seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways.

10.0,An eternal movie.... (DVD),"I thought at first that it was only a concept movie: a ""what-if"" story; an unbelievable story in reality but a very funny & rich one in the philosophical reflexion, like only arts can offer. Another example of this free creativity would be for me ""Back to the future""... You can't go back in your past, but your imagination does! Here's the bottled-up feeling of eternity is excellently considered: the assets (you have time to learn, you know everything & every one...) and the pitfalls (a final boredom, the sadness of losing people without preventing it,...)Then, I realised that this movie is closer to every one's life than many others.... The revelation occurred while the chat between Bill Murray & 2 buddies at the bar:""What would you do if you were stuck in one place, every day was exactly the same, nothing you did mattered ?""""That about sums it up for me;""It's my life: I always complain about today is like yesterday & as tomorrow! Getting up tired, taking crowded subways, managing different kind of people with a perverse boss, back to the home to eat nearly the eternal same supper, complicated relationship..... Well, same day over, over & over....That's me, maybe you, and you or you..... This movie appeals to every one: Fantastic! And it offers in addition a solution: being socially generous....

Here's what a 2 hours movie can do!!!But that's not all: all this would have been impossible without this superb duo of Bill Murray & Andie MacDowell: I am a fan of both and they excel in this movie: I think they never have been closer than their true self: Murray has really two faces: the cynic & the kind... MacDowell: well, she smiles, she laughs, she plays, she is kind, romantic, honorable, trustful... the perfect soulmate for every one...And the final touch: the Director: Harold Ramis.. I was a fan of National lampoon, Ghostbusters and with his DVD commentary, I discover a great man: sympathetic, spiritual.

9.0,A Soul Reclaimed,"This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the ""gift"" or ""curse"" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the ""characters"" he meets. But like most ""everymen,"" he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.He can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long.

10.0,A Masterpiece! Bill Murray is Terrific!,"Harold Ramis's 'Groundhog Day' is A Masterpiece! A wonderful, meaningful film, that also offers loads of entertainment. And Bill Murray delivers a yet another Terrific Performance! 'Groundhog Day' Synopsis: A weatherman finds himself living the same day over and over again.'Groundhog Day' is perfection, believe me it is. Here's a comedy, that offers meaning. I was engrossed from start to end. The journey of its protagonist Phil Connors, played by Murray, is so entertaining & meaningful, that I was taken aback. The Screenplay Written by Danny Rubin & Ramis himself, is simply marvelous. Ramis's Direction, on the other-hand, is efficient.

9.0,Perfectly-judged comedy,"GROUNDHOG DAY is a classic comedy of 1993 that goes to show that the best premises are the simple ones. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as a jerk of a local TV weatherman who finds himself forced to live the same mundane day over and over again. I was partly dreading this because of the focus on his romance with Andie MacDowell, fearing another vomit-inducing film in the style of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, but I needn't have worried. MacDowell is very good here (although the film belongs to Murray) and the romance handled sensitively. However, it's much more than just a romance. It's a film which explores the human condition and has a lesson for both Murray and the viewers in how to treat people. It's funny rather than preachy, and comes across in a very similar fashion to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE except with many more laugh-out-loud moments.",perfectly judged comedy,groundhog day is classic comedy 1993 that goes show that best premises are simple ones bill murray is perfectly cast as jerk local tv weatherman who finds himself forced live same mundane day over over again i was partly dreading this because focus his romance with andie macdowell fearing another vomit inducing film style four weddings funeral but i neednt have worried macdowell is very good here although film belongs murray romance handled sensitively however its much more than just romance its film which explores human condition has lesson both murray viewers how treat people its funny rather than preachy comes across very similar fashion its wonderful life except with many more laugh out loud moments,0.49161255411255417,0.3089256198347108,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Excellent comedy that anyone can relate to.,"Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager :)--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes ""Groundhog Day"" so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale ""A Christmas Story,"" which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called ""Scrooged."" Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, ""I'm-smarter-than-you"" face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis, director of ""Analyze This,"" star of ""Stripes,"" directed ""Groundhog Day."" Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.Another thing that is great about ""Groundhog Day"" is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but ""Groundhog Day"" does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of ""Groundhog Day."" I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named ""Delirious."" It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where ""Groundhog Day"" steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in ""Groundhog Day."" And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.5/5 stars",excellent comedy that anyone can relate,bill murray plays phil connors weatherman local news station every year he goes puxatawney pennsylvania puxatawney phil event commonly recognized as groundhog day you know how it goes groundhog comes out if it sees its shadow its six more weeks winter if it doesnt its spring well only problem about going this event every year phil is that he hates it he hates cheery people little town weather event story everything he hates it he is lonely desolate forsaken soul with great cynical side andie mcdowell plays new manager err womanager who goes with phil event along with chris elliot cameraman phil reports they tape it its done deal end phil goes back home only one problem due severe weather roads have all been closed leaving only one option stay puxatawney until storm blows over so phil heads back his cheery hotel tucks dreaded nap but when he wakes next morning something odd happens day is exact same day as before it is groundhog day again phil panics as he finds everything exactly same as it was day before he knows everything that is going happen he shrugs it off as weird case deja vu heads back sleep but when he wakes up alas day is yesterday again technically so phil comes terms with fact that there is now way out this small little town he tries everything he steps front moving car he electrocutes himself he jumps off building all no avail oh he dies all right but next day hes back its groundhog day again part what makes groundhog day so excellent is story characters actors alone are great enough recommend this movie but truth is i cannot think better story throw someone like bill murray into he uses his smart alecky ways new extreme his character is bit like scrooge tale christmas story which is ironic because murray was parody scrooges tale called scrooged anyway bill murray is perfect as irreverent cynical phil everything he does he carries out with dumb im smarter than you face he thinks himself better than everyone else he thinks he is smart by skipping big holiday ordeal it is all so stupid him but as this story teaches us having attitude like that can get you big trouble harold ramis director analyze this star stripes directed groundhog day bill he are old pals it sure shows i bet they had great time making this movie but what is good about it is that while making fun movie they didnt forget come up with interesting audience catching tale another thing that is great about groundhog day is that phil connors does what we would do example when he finds out he has this ability repeat same day over over he does things average person would do human weakness too many comedies with same formula dont try exploit this human weakness but groundhog day does we see phil memorize steps successfully robbing armored truck filled with cash but reason he can go bed with clear conscience is because he knows next day that everything will be back normal again he will never have robbed truck never have bought ferarri etc phil does what we would do that is one importance aspect groundhog day i would never rob armored truck but if i was stuck living same day over over it would do no harm take cash it would be back truck morning so i might do that although my conscience would still get way there was little comedy with john candy named delirious it was about soap opera writer getting trapped his own world everything he writes his typewriter comes true while movie was good pretty interesting there were so many things candy could have done with ability create control any every thing he didnt do them i think thats where groundhog day steps filling blanks theres nothing i love more than watching comedy where main character divulges into human nature other words i love watching character do something average human would do when given power s thats exactly what phil does groundhog day that is why among other things it is one my favorites 5 5 stars,0.48762305595638933,0.15443903318903315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"

,Movies can change lives,"Often you hear the adage, ""It is just a film"". Well, for most times it is true. But on rarest of rare occasions, it isn't. This was one of them. Like a great piece literature, painting, poetry, speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Waking Life, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the ""intro"" to the review might suggest. In fact it an extremely entertaining and funny film with one of the best performances ever by Bill Murray. The plot revolves around a weather man (Bill Murray) is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting ""rat"" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay, editing and performances. Bear in mind that, the ""loops"" Bill Murray's character goes through, might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play, who seem to introduce a ""novelty"" factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes, it is funny, but make no mistake about it, it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent. It tells you what it intends to on your terms. It deals with the questions that bother us for a better part of our lives i.e. meaning of life, purpose of life, existentialism, death, god but never preaches, nor propels any propaganda. But by the end of it, you know that something has changed, something you didn't see coming has happened. And then you watch it again only to realize the moment of Epiphany that eluded you the first time.Every time I am down or losing perspective this is the movie that eases everything and makes me ask a simple question, ""What is important?"".

10.0,"Bill Murray's greatest movie and one of the greatest comedies, no, one of the great movies of all time.","Two clues to tell if a movie is great is how often it is copied and how it has become a part of American slang. Groundhog Day has had both happen to it. Warning: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Bill Murray played Phil Connors, a egocentric and grumpy weatherman in Pennsylvania who goes to Punxsutawny, Pa every year to see if the groundhog sees his shadow for the local television station with his producer, played by the wonderful Andie MacDowell, and his cameraman, played by a low keyed Chris Elliot.Everything goes as Phil expects on the first day, except he is caught in a blizzard and has to stay the night. The next morning he awakes and it's Groundhog Day again! This pattern happens over and over again until he realizes he cannot escape Groundhog Day. In time Phil realizes the advantages of knowing what's going to happen before it happens and Murray takes full comic advantage of it. However if this film was just that, it would be just a normal run of the mill comedy. Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person during the course of the film and learns to love the town in which he felt he was trapped in.

,"There is a fifth dimension, beyond that known to man....","This one is a winner in almost all respects, a kind of comic Twilight Zone episode that never quits. Murray has had roles in which he does nothing funny but seems to stand around waiting for laughs anyway, wearing a goofy expectant smile, as in ""Stripes."" But not here. This is probably his best role. He may still have the goofy expression but this time the laughs arrive on time.The movie excells at three levels.One is the overall conception, the comic theme itself. Murray, a sarcastic and sadistic weatherman finds himself stuck in a small dreary town in Pennsylvania with two colleagues, one of them Andie MacDowell, his producer. They cover the local Groundhog Day celebration then find themselves unable to leave because of a blizzard. The next morning Murray wakes up to find that it's the same Groundhog Day all over again. And the next morning too. And so on ad almost infinitum. So far so good. A nice concept but it could go either way, depending on how it's handled. In fact, it's handled very well. What could have been a one-gag movie that ran out of steam after the first quarter hour turns instead into a neatly logical progression of plot and character development. Murray of course is the centerpiece of the tale and it is his changes that occupy our attention; the other roles, although well done, are mostly there to provide reflections on Murray's moral evolution. (Andie MacDowell, wardrobed in slacks, white blouse and checked vest, and done up with long fluffy curly black hair, looks radiantly appealing.)Murray's reaction discovering that he is now living Day Two is one of a terrible anxiety. He manages to get this across effectively, even though it is tinged with his own brand of distant amusement. On Day Three he is depressed and gets drunk. On Day Four he realizes that tomorrow will have no consequences and tests this hypothesis by breaking all of the rules of traffic. As the days pass, he plans to seduce MacDowell, and he implements his plan cleverly, discovering more and more about her -- her favorite drink, her favorite toast, the kind of man she is looking for. He has so much time on his hands that he learns to play the piano expertly because MacDowell likes men who play instruments. His scheme seems to be working but no matter how perfect his playacting he simply cannot get her into bed in one single day -- and every day he must start over with her from scratch. (""Twelve years of Catholic school speaking,"" she tells him.) Eventually, however, he comes to realize that he really DOES care for her because, after all, he's gotten to know her quite well with the passage of time, although she doesn't know it. When he undergoes this epiphany he goes about doing good, no longer just acting nice but actually BEING nice, whether it advances his desire to get her in the sack or not. Obliquely, indirectly, it works without his having intended it to. She falls for him and they live happily ever after. That's the overall conception and it's very well handled.Level Two is the script, the dialogue, and this too is superior. How many movies can throw in a handfull of quotes from Sir Walter Scott and people of that ilk -- one quote is in French -- without making a contemporary audience, used to MTV, squirm? ""And winter/ slumbering in the open ground/ wears upon his smiling face/ a dream of spring."" And it isn't just stuck into the script; it fits into the scene and is an appropriate comment on the plot. But more than that, the lines are not only intelligent but sometimes very witty. Just a few examples that come to mind.On Day Two, I believe, Murray is sitting in a bowling alley with two local drunks, bemoaning his fate. He once spent a beautiful day in the Carribean with a gorgeous girl. They drank pina coladas. They watched the sun go down and then they made love like two otters. Why couldn't he be stuck in THAT day instead of this one? ""How would you feel,"" he asks his pals, ""if you woke up every morning and it was the same awful day and nothing you ever did made the slightest difference because nothing meant anything?"" One of the drunks, glumly replies: ""That about sums it up.""On Day Three, Murray and MacDowell are sitting in the Tip Top Cafe and he has a huge tray of fattening food in front of him. He lights a cigaretteand stuffs whipped-cream pastries into his mouth. MacDowell: ""I hate to see a man of your advanced years destroying himself."" Murray: ""Maybe they're not advancing as fast as you think.""Last example from dialogue, somewhere down the time line, after he's begun worming his way into her affections: Murray and MacDowell are walking along at night in the snow, her arm through his, and she tells him, ""Thank you for a very nice day. It's the kind of day that could never be planned."" Murray: ""Well -- it CAN be planned but it takes a lot of work.""The third level at which the movie works is, very simply, the actual small bits of business that the actors involve themselves in. Ramis, the director, plays the doctor who checks out X-rays of Murray's skull to see if there's any pathology. Ramis stares at the photos and says, ""No clots, no tumors, no aneurysms -- at least as far as I can see,"" then he turns around and squints tightly and rapidly three time in a row. (Who thinks up something like that?) And Murray takes a girl to a Clint Eastwood movie and does an expert impression of Eastwood, from the Man With No Name costume to the voice. When he turns his back and speaks, it sounds exactly like Eastwood. There are running gags about things like innocent-looking but bottomless puddles in the gutter. I know that some of these things sound old, but they are so well realized here that we can forget their age. They seem born anew, just like Murray.There is one danger in a story like this that the movie skirts neatly. The romance between Murray and MacDowell, had more been made of it, could easily have turned cloying. That's what happens to Jack London's characters in ""The Sea Wolf."" You've got to handle this carefully, because, as we all know, comedy in itself is of no significance. (How many comedies win academy awards?) The movie has to be about something deeper, of course, and the sort of logic that comes to that conclusions must also come to the conclusion that the audience consists of an unwashed horde of semi-moronic dolts who must have the ""seriousness"" pounded into their heads with a sixteen-pound sledge hammer. The problem is deftly avoided in ""Groundhog Day."" The romance is funny more often than not. And during the moments when it isn't played for laughs, it advances our understanding of the changes in Murray's character. And MacDowell looks angelic enough that Murray's growing feelings for her are believable. I should also mention the use of appropriate musical numbers on the track. ""The Pennsylvania Polka"" is used as punctuation throughout. Midway through the movie, we get Ray Charles' ""You Don't Know Me,"" underlining the uncertainty of the romance. By the end we have an even more romantic theme from Rachmaninoff that begins in sincerity and ends in a jolly jazzed-up version.This is one of the best comedies of the last ten or fifteen years, including ""The In Laws"" and ""The Freshman"" and ""My Cousin Vinny."" Before that, there were ""Love at First Bite"" and ""Murder by Death."" Pure comedies, successful ones, come along rarely.",there is fifth dimension beyond that known man,this one is winner almost all respects kind comic twilight zone episode that never quits murray has had roles which he does nothing funny but seems stand around waiting laughs anyway wearing goofy expectant smile as stripes but not here this is probably his best role he may still have goofy

10.0,Delightful film with great performances and a surprisingly refreshing concept,"Groundhog Day is a wonderful movie. Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas. The script is a delight, always funny, quotable and witty, while the story has a surprisingly refreshing concept and several great scenes.The cinematography is beautiful, and the locations and production values are consistently striking. Also Harold Ramis's direction is excellent, the pace rarely lags and all the characters are credible. The acting is wonderful too, and by far one of the best assets of this film. Bill Murray gives one of the best performances of his career, Stephen Tabolowsky gives a superb turn as the nerdy insurance salesman and the lovely Andie McDowell has never been better.In conclusion, a delightful film that works on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox",delightful film with great performances surprisingly refreshing concept,groundhog day is wonderful movie essentially it is one joke comedy but what makes groundhog day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative predictable film is always full life full brim with fresh ideas script is delight always funny quotable witty while story has surprisingly refreshing concept several great scenes cinematography is beautiful locations production values are consistently striking also harold ramiss direction is excellent pace rarely lags all characters are credible acting is wonderful too by far one best assets this film bill murray gives one best performances his career stephen tabolowsky gives superb turn as nerdy insurance salesman lovely andie mcdowell has never been better conclusion delightful film that works all levels 10 10 bethany cox,0.7362068965517242,0.5620689655172413,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,Bill's Best,"Not counting Caddy shack, this is Bill Murray's best performance. While Christmas and Halloween have their annual holiday movies, who would have thought that Groundhog Day would have a movie of its own.A terrific (family) movie, Bill Murray stars as a sullen / sarcastic news reporter who is stuck living the same day over and over again....until he gets it right. This comedy stands alone as one of the funniest and most original movies of the 90's. Not many comedies can be funny and also end with a moral. Groundhog Day has both. Before the Farrelly Brothers or Wes Anderson found an audience, there was Groundhog Day. Pennsylvania never looked better or funnier.",bills best,not counting caddy shack this is bill murrays best performance while christmas halloween have their annual holiday movies who would have thought that groundhog day would have movie its own terrific family movie bill murray stars as sullen sarcastic news reporter who is stuck living same day over over again until he gets it right this comedy stands alone as one funniest most original movies 90s not many comedies can be funny also end with moral groundhog day has both before farrelly brothers or wes anderson found audience there was groundhog day pennsylvania never looked better or funnier,0.5815934065934066,0.33543956043956047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Timeless classic,"One of the greatest comedies of all time. The 80s and early 90s were the pinnacle of comedies and this one is one of the greats. Not only does it have a brilliant story, but it has heart and a moral to it. Weatherman Bill Connors played by the excellent Bill Murray is a miserable and selfish type character who is a weatherman for the news. He reports on a tradition called Ground hog day in a small Town with his crew. I won't go into detail of the story, but he basically wakes up in a time loop reciting the same day over and over again. He tries to better himself as a person and help others around him as he's in a situation he can't escape from. A timeless classic I have seen over 10 times. They don't make movies like this anymore.",timeless classic,one greatest comedies all time 80s early 90s were pinnacle comedies this one is one greats not only does it have brilliant story but it has heart moral it weatherman bill connors played by excellent bill murray is miserable selfish type character who is weatherman news he reports tradition called ground hog day small town with his crew i wont go into detail story but he basically wakes up time loop reciting same day over over again he tries better himself as person help others around him as hes situation he cant escape timeless classic i have seen over 10 times they dont make movies like this anymore,0.593452380952381,0.1416666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,"""Will Phil come out to see his shadow?""","I was ready to question why this movie would have found a place in IMDb's 'Top 250', but I read a few insightful reviews offered by other viewers and their ideas made me stop and think. In particular, user 'KFL' had some really meaningful insights that I had to take into consideration and his comments changed my thinking about the picture. So thank you once again to IMDb and the thoughtful folks who share their ideas on these boards.Before that, I only saw this film as pretty much a lighthearted romantic comedy. The repetition didn't bother me because slight changes to Phil Conners' (Bill Murray) routine each day kept things moving in a spontaneous manner. The interesting thing is, Murray's character was becoming a better person day by day as he got to know the residents of Punxatawney and they got to know him. Falling in love with Rita (Andie McDowell) was the impetus needed to break the spell of the time loop and was a neat way to close out the story.And besides, any movie that includes a polka has to be a happy one. The story took place in Punxatawney, PA, so what better tune to get the town revved up than The Pennsylvania Polka!",will phil come out see his shadow,i was ready question why this movie would have found place imdbs top 250 but i read few insightful reviews offered by other viewers their ideas made me stop think particular user kfl had some really meaningful insights that i had take into consideration his comments changed my thinking about picture so thank you once again imdb thoughtful folks who share their ideas these boards before that i only saw this film as pretty much lighthearted romantic comedy repetition didnt bother me because slight changes phil conners bill murray routine each day kept things moving spontaneous manner interesting thing is murrays character was becoming better person day by day as he got know residents punxatawney they got know him falling love with rita andie mcdowell was impetus needed break spell time loop was neat way close out story besides any movie that includes polka has be happy one story took place punxatawney pa so what better tune get town revved up than pennsylvania polka,0.5539473684210526,0.29342105263157897,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,What's not to like about this film?!,"While GROUNDHOG DAY is not my favorite Bill Murray comedy, it is one of three brilliant comedies he made during the early 90s and all three are absolute must-sees. And, interestingly enough, while the film is very funny, it also has some wonderful and poignant moments--something I usually hate in comedies.The plot is pretty simple. Murray plays a jerk or a TV weather man who is sent against his will to cover the annual festivities concerning America's second favorite rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, as he tells us whether or not we'll have a long, hard winter (a very stupid tradition if you ask me). Naturally after having done this repeated times he's less than thrilled, but there's more to it than that--Murray is a nasty jerk and he delights in looking down on all the locals that take such pride in this event. Apparently, the fate is not happy with Murray, as he is oddly punished and made to repeat this same day again and again and again. Why exactly is unknown but his reactions to this exact same day are priceless--ranging from insanely funny to weird to touching.In addition to Murray's excellent performance, Andi McDowell does a good job in support and the film makers really did a wonderful job of capturing the wacky essence of small town America as well as creating a wonderful and quirky script.This film is terrific--you must see this film...now!",whats not like about this film,while groundhog day is not my favorite bill murray comedy it is one three brilliant comedies he made during early 90s all three are absolute must sees interestingly enough while film is very funny it also has some wonderful poignant moments something i usually hate comedies plot is pretty simple murray plays jerk or tv weather man who is sent against his will cover annual festivities concerning americas second favorite rodent punxsutawney phil as he tells us whether or not well have long hard winter very stupid tradition if you ask me naturally after having done this repeated times hes less than thrilled but theres more it than that murray is nasty jerk he delights looking down all locals that take such pride this event apparently fate is not happy with murray as he is oddly punished made repeat this same day again again again why exactly is unknown but his reactions this exact same day are priceless ranging insanely funny weird touching addition murrays excellent performance andi mcdowell does good job support film makers really did wonderful job capturing wacky essence small town america as well as creating wonderful quirky script this film is terrific you must see this film now,0.657078257659653,0.15219638242894057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
