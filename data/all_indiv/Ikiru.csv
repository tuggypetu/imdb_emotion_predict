10.0,"""Only when he learned he would die did he start to live!""","Ikiru (""to live"")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...",only when he learned he would die did he start live,ikiru live is kurosawa film devoid samurai or toshiro mifune it is oddity his canon neither adaptation nor epic or even detective story instead it is simple touching story last months life man watanabbe public official who decides give meaning his life by transcending obtuse stiff mind government bureaucracy get small public childrens park built as parable soulless workings modern bureaucracy goal is set pretty high kurosawa goes even further giving this story lot character frequent humor life most all heart going beyond strengths direction script is central performance by takashi shimura later kambei seven samurai shimura gives his character such transparently good heart such great pain that every second watanabes plight struggle tugs at your heart not overwhelmingly sentimental manner but one than feels honest pure if even many hardened souls will be drawn tears it is not pity but admirably because envy watanabes beautiful human dignity end film have such power is beyond pure accomplishment as need see this more importantly feel it goes beyond pure necessity,0.4728957528957528,0.1807107757107757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.06, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.56}"
10.0,"a cinematic experience that's a near-nexus of existentialism- life, living, dying, death, and can be done while alive- remarkable","Akira Kurosawa knew how to get in touch with human nature through his art. With his visual expressiveness and storytelling, he could pierce through his subjects, even in his big and occasionally comical samurai films, and find the elemental things do work. What he probably learned off of Rashomon probably helped out with Ikiru (To Live), a story of an old man who finds out he will die within a year, as both stories deal with perceptions of the significance of a life spent and a life wasted. Though that was to a different degree in Rashomon, with Ikiru Kurosawa expands into full-on existentialism. The old man Kanji Watanabe (in a wholly believable and often heart-breaking performance by Takashi Shimura) knows his life hasn't amounted to much as a (chief) clerk for the city. He knows he hasn't had a great kinship with his son. He's accepting his fate with a heavy soul. One of the tenets of existentialism is that there's free-will, and the responsibility to accept what is done with one's life. Kurosawa might've (as I speculate, I don't entirely know) caught onto this for his lead, and it works, especially with the little details.Such little details, unforgettable ones, have been expounded upon by other reviewers and critics, such as the drunken, sullen singing of ""Life is short, fall in love my maiden"" in the bar. A scene like that almost speaks for itself and yet it's also subtle. But one scene that had me was one not too many talk about. It's when Watanabe is in the Deputy Mayor's office, asking for permission so that a park can be built. At first the Mayor ignores him, but then Watanabe begs, but not in a way that manipulates the audience for sympathy with the old man. The mayor must be sensing something in his eyes, desperate and weak, however determined, and it's something that probably most of the audience can identify with as well, even if they don't entirely identify with the character.But aside from the emotional impact Ikiru can have on a viewer, composition-wise (with the help of Asakazu Nakai, wonderful cinematographer on less than a dozen Kurosawa films) and editing-wise the film is ahead of its time and another example of Kurosawa's intuitive eye. There are some to-tomy shots sometimes (which could be called typical via master Ozu or other), but everything appears so precise on a first viewing, so descriptive. I think I almost can't go into all of them without a repeat viewing, but there were two that are still fresh in me. The first was right as Watanabe was about to sing in the bar, and there were these bead-strings looming in front of the camera. Perhaps mysterious, but definitely evocative. The other was when Watanabe and one of the other clerks are on a bridge during a dark part of the day. Both characters are in silhouette, and Watanabe gives an indication to the character that he will die soon. But for me, I wasn't even paying a terrible amount of attention to the words. The way the two are lit as they are, with the light in the background and darkness in the foreground, it could maybe give an indication of what Kurosawa's trying to say: we're all not in the light of life, but it doesn't have to be an entire down-ward spiral if the will is good. Whether you're into philosophy (ies) or not, Ikiru won't disappoint newcomers to Kurosawa via his action pictures.

8.0,Complex and thought-provoking masterpiece,"Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely 'hero' of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it's all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed 'The Mummy' by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he's learned that his life has a limit; it's time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.Ikiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa, a man better known for his samurai films, but it's a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as 'our hero' throughout the film, and at first this struck me as rather odd because, as I've mentioned, he's probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed; but that's just it! This man is not a superhero samurai, but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn't want to be useless anymore. That's why he's 'our hero'. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he's on screen - we're sorry that he's wasted his life, and we're sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However, despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out, there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life; because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way, it's easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.It could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third - and this is true. The movie needs it's final third in order to finish telling the story, but it really doesn't work as well as the earlier parts did. However, Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you've seen so far; that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant.",complex thought provoking masterpiece,ikiru is film about life constantly complex thought provoking although simple at same time it tells story about lifes limits how we perceive life fact that life is short not be wasted our hero is kanji watanabe most unlikely hero all time he works dreary city office where nothing happens its all very meaningless watanabe is particularly boring which has lead him being nicknamed mummy by fellow worker he later learns that he is dying stomach cancer that he only has six months live but watanabe has been dead thirty years now that hes learned that his life has limit its time watanabe escape his dreary life finally start living what follows is probably most thoughtful analysis life ever filmed ikiru marks departure akira kurosawa man better known his samurai films but its welcome departure my opinion kurosawa constantly refers watanabe as our hero throughout film at first this struck me as rather odd because as ive mentioned hes probably least likely hero that kurosawa has ever directed but thats just it this man is not superhero samurai but rather ordinary guy that decides he doesnt want be useless anymore thats why hes our hero kurosawa makes us feel character every moment hes screen were sorry that hes wasted his life were sorry that his wasted life is about be cruelly cut short however despite bleak miserable facade that this movie gives out there is distinct beauty about it that shines through beauty emits way that watanabe tries redeem his life because we feel him are with him every step way its easy see why watanabe acts way he does ikiru is psychologically beautiful film it could be said that fantastic first hour half is let down by more politically based final third this is true movie needs its final third order finish telling story but it really doesnt work as well as earlier parts did however kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery shot watanabe swing is most poetically brilliant thing that kurosawa ever filmed together with music rest film that youve seen so far that picture that kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant,0.5512684240362812,0.008585858585858587,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,To Live in Death,"Probably one of the most difficult aspects a film like ""Ikiru"" has to overcome is the very rough march of time. To actually find someone these days, let's say a crowd of regular movie-goers to sit down and watch a film about an old Japanese man dying of cancer would be too much to ask.Long held shots, hardly uplifting subject, to westerners very foreign. An array of reasons not to see it. And yet, once you actually start getting into the picture it doesn't let you go. Which is why it may be rightfully considered to be a classic.Of all of Kurosawa's films this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on a universal level. Because at its core it is about one of the most basic desires of human existence...namely to be able to look back on your life and say ""It was worth it.""In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched.

9.0,"The Older You Get, the More It Means","I too have seen all the Samurai films. It was gratifying to watch this tender little film. How would we act if we knew when the end was coming? There are so many terrifying and tender moments in this film. The scenes with the young office mate went from charming to cold-- we knew there was no more than companionship, but she can't really even give him that anymore. The scene when he is about to tell his son about his condition and the young man goes off on a rant about how embarrassingly his father has been acting actually brought me to tears. Of course, it's the price he pays for his cold distance all those years. Then there's the whole bureaucratic nightmare of the office. Even at the wake they don't want to give credit.

10.0,The most moving and human film I have ever seen.,"I can safely say that I have seen no finer film than Kurosawa's true masterpiece, Ikiru. The story of a dying petty bureaucrat in 1950's Japan, Ikiru is as uncompromisingly honest and beautiful a film as has ever been made on the subject of life. Kurosawa elevates a story that could have been simple melodrama to the level of masterwork with a genuine love of his characters, and with an incredible technical direction. The film's structure accentuates and deepens its many, many lessons on life, and the performances, including a heartbreakingly earnest turn by Shimura are all flawless.In short, Ikiru is easily one of the greatest works committed to film, and no discerning film aficionado should avoid experiencing it. Had Kurosawa directed only this film, it would still be enough to include him in the pantheon of the greatest storytellers who ever lived. Fortunately for us, it is simply the pinnacle of a staggeringly amazing career. It is the absolute definition of a 10/10 film.",most moving human film i have ever seen,i can safely say that i have seen no finer film than kurosawas true masterpiece ikiru story dying petty bureaucrat 1950s japan ikiru is as uncompromisingly honest beautiful film as has ever been made subject life kurosawa elevates story that could have been simple melodrama level masterwork with genuine love his characters with incredible technical direction films structure accentuates deepens its many many lessons life performances including heartbreakingly earnest turn by shimura are all flawless short ikiru is easily one greatest works committed film no discerning film aficionado should avoid experiencing it had kurosawa directed only this film it would still be enough include him pantheon greatest storytellers who ever lived fortunately us it is simply pinnacle staggeringly amazing career it is absolute definition 10 10 film,0.6172380952380953,0.3746666666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Kurosawa is Kafka going Kawabata...,"Being one of the Founding Fathers of Cinema, Kurosawa shines to all directions. In his diverse oeuvre it is hard, if not impossible, to find a weak work.Ikiru is the most humane film of this grand Humanist. Kurosawa's story telling skills are sublime, and he has surpassed himself with this movie.The slow pace and ditto camera movements (except in the night with 'Mephistofeles' where all is logically much more frantic) enhances the story superbly.

10.0,"Not just a film, but an incredible learning experience","A quiet, but very moving film. Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a clerk who has been living a dull, unsatisfying life working in the government's offices who is diagnosed with cancer and is given one year to live. He tries to enjoy his days by picking up a former co-worker (Miki Odagiri) and taking her out on the town. She finally convinces him that this is not the way to spend the rest of his life. He soon realizes that he has a strong desire to do something with his life so that it will not have been a total waste. Therefore he begins to work in cooperation with the people... accomplishing something that nobody in the office had the nerve to do before.I consider Ikiru to be Kurosawa's first truly excellent film.

10.0,Simply Brilliant - Kurosawa's Greatest,"Kanji Watanabi is a quiet, melancholy man who has spent all his life behind his office desk doing sweet eff-all. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he realizes that he has been petty much dead his whole life, and searches desperately for away to live again.This is Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, yes, even better than Rashomon and The Seven Samauri. It is a perfect true story of everybody's life- how we don't even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi's quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it's one of the greatest film performances of all time. Not everyone will love this movie. It was made a long time ago, the main character is an old fogey, it has subtitles, and it's pretty long. Many people today, especially young kids, would find it boring. Well, let 'em. There's no need to worry about them, they'll always have Pirates of the Carribbean, they'll always have The Matrix.

9.0,An incredibly well-written and acted story about the meaning of life,"The main character, so ably played in this movie, is an older bureaucrat whose life has little, if any, significance. After 30 years on the job, he has little to show for himself. This becomes very apparent once he finds out that he is dying from stomach cancer and has only months to live.Now, so far, this does NOT sound like a movie most people would want to see. However, instead of dwelling on death and the meaningless of life, Kurasawa goes beyond that. Much of the movie actually focuses on this man trying to find meaning in his life and ultimately deciding to devote his final days to fighting for the creation of a park in some godforsaken part of Tokyo. Despite a general atmosphere of apathy, he ultimately succeeds in getting the park created.About 2/3 of the way through the picture, the man dies. I thought the movie was over, but then it cuts to a scene at his funeral. A group of bureaucrats and the deputy mayor attend, but few others. What happens next is important, as the movie becomes very philosophical and those in attendance begin to ponder his life and their own as well.In many ways, this movie is both uplifting and cynical.

It is as always beautifully made, sumptuous in look and the cinematography simple yet interesting. Kurasawa's direction is at its most delicate, making a story that could easily be mawkish and manipulative into a genuinely moving, powerful and quite inspiring one instead, and making us also care every step of the way for the dignified central character of Watanabe.

10.0,"death exposes life and bureaucracy, showing why Kurosawa was one of the greatest","Any film buff is bound to have heard of Akira Kurosawa, and likely knows his most famous movies (""Rashomon"", ""Seven Samurai"", etc). But there's a lesser known one that's just as good. 1952's ""Ikiru"" focuses on the approaching death of government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe, and how it turns into a quest for his life's meaning. After an introduction in which the protagonist's cancer gets addressed - complete with an X ray of it - we see a sequence where several people try to bring attention to a cesspool that they want cleared, but the sheer level of bureaucracy prevents any action (and Japan is supposed to be the most well run country in the world). But probably the most important scene is at the Watanabe's wake. The attendees are supposed to praise him, but one person addresses an unpleasant topic and gets chastised by his peers. Even as these men vow to live their lives with the same dedication that the deceased did, it's clear that the bureaucracy will continue to plague their lives.While an obvious indictment of bureaucracy, the movie also addresses the issue of life and death. Can a person truly live if his job dominates his life? Watanabe sings ""Gondola no Uta"", which references life's brevity. His singing expresses loss. Indeed, Watanabe doesn't have much of a relationship with his son, meaning that the children have faltered in their duty to take care of their parents.

10.0,Truly a masterpiece,"Kanji Watanabe is a civil servant. He has worked in the same department for 30 years. His life is pretty boring and monotonous, though he once used to have passion and drive. Then one day he discovers that he has stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. After the initial depression he sets about living for the first time in over 20 years. Then he realises that his limited time left is not just for living life to the full but to leave something meaningful behind...Written and directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa, this is his magnum opus. Yes, Seven Samurai, Rashomon or Yojimbo might be more popular or more critically acclaimed but this, for me, is his greatest work.Incredibly profound and thought-provoking, examining life and living it plus death and what you leave behind. Also takes a dig at politicians and the wastefulness of the civil service.Very engaging too: characters are well-formed and develop throughout the movie. Moreover we empathise with Watanabe and his issues, issues which are relatable.Highly emotional towards the end too, as we see the impact he has made.A timeless classic.",truly masterpiece,kanji watanabe is civil servant he has worked same department 30 years his life is pretty boring monotonous though he once used have passion drive then one day he discovers that he has stomach cancer has less than year live after initial depression he sets about living first time over 20 years then he realises that his limited time left is not just living life full but leave something meaningful behind written directed by legendary akira kurosawa this is his magnum opus yes seven samurai rashomon or yojimbo might be more popular or more critically acclaimed but this me is his greatest work incredibly profound thought provoking examining life living it plus death what you leave behind also takes dig at politicians wastefulness civil service very engaging too characters are well formed develop throughout movie moreover we empathise with watanabe his issues issues which are relatable highly emotional towards end too as we see impact he has made timeless classic,0.5671532091097309,0.16601166948993037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,"Never is too Late to Live, Watch the Sunset and Plant a Seed of Love","In a Post-War Tokyo, when the bureaucratic chief of department of the City Hall Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) finds that he has a terminal cancer, he decides to intensively live his last months of life.

The story is very touching and shows the lifestyle of Japan in the 50's.

10.0,"""I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that""","There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" (To Live), 1952, is one of them. The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny ""Ikiru"" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life; something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.Two years before he played the tough lead in ""Seven Samurai"", Takashi Shimara gave even finer performance in a very different role as a government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe who seemed to lead a life of quiet desperation at his job and at home. Then, he learns that he has terminal cancer and faced with the fact of death, he first tries to take from life as much as possible and spends the half of his savings on gambling, drinking and women. It leads him nowhere and gradually he determines to achieve one good thing before he dies, and settles on converting a junkyard into a playground for children. Rather than make a feel good movie with co-workers helping Kanji Watanabe in his quest and his family around him at his last moment, Kurosawa portrays him as a lonely crusader. No one can understand why this park is so important to him. The answer is very simple, he does not have time and he wants to live to see the park open. His family and co-workers don't even know how ill he is, and that makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant. His words, ""I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that"", the look at his face when asked by a mafia member if he did not care for his life - these scenes are heartbreaking. The film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.For me, watching ""Ikiru"" was as close to earth shattering experience as it goes. I think it is one of very few films that could really change one's life. I could not help comparing it to ""Cries and Whispers"" - how devastated I was by the theme of inevitable death, how ugly it is, and how helpless we all are while facing it. ""Ikiru"" is about a dying man, too, but how hopeful and life affirming it is. The film did not tell or teach me something I had not known before but it confirmed once more that it is never too late to do something even if you have only few months to live.",i am not angry with anyone i have no time that,there are good very good even great movies but among them there are just few that go beyond great they belong league their own akira kurosawas ikiru live 1952 is one them film rare humanity profoundly moving often funny ikiru tells story dying mans last crusade that turned out be his triumph best thing he had ever done his life something he will be remembered film reveals both absurdity life ability man find meaning it through selfless action two years before he played tough lead seven samurai takashi shimara gave even finer performance very different role as government bureaucrat kanji watanabe who seemed lead life quiet desperation at his job at home then he learns that he has terminal cancer faced with fact death he first tries take life as much as possible spends half his savings gambling drinking women it leads him nowhere gradually he determines achieve one good thing before he dies settles converting junkyard into playground children rather than make feel good movie with co workers helping kanji watanabe his quest his family around him at his last moment kurosawa portrays him as lonely crusader no one can understand why this park is so important him answer is very simple he does not have time he wants live see park open his family co workers dont even know how ill he is that makes some scenes even more powerful poignant his words i am not angry with anyone i have no time that look at his face when asked by mafia member if he did not care his life these scenes are heartbreaking film has many quiet but compelling moments like these me watching ikiru was as close earth shattering experience as it goes i think it is one very few films that could really change ones life i could not help comparing it cries whispers how devastated i was by theme inevitable death how ugly it is how helpless we all are while facing it ikiru is about dying man too but how hopeful life affirming it is film did not tell or teach me something i had not known before but it confirmed once more that it is never too late do something even if you have only few months live,0.5976587301587303,0.17680976430976433,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,Coming Alive,"'Ikuru' (Japanese for 'To Live') was one of Kurosawa's personal favorites. Prominent film critics worldwide put it, along with ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Rashomon"", on their lists of the best films ever made by anyone. When first shown in the USA during the 1950's , all three quickly earned widespread critical acclaim and strong patronage. USA film enthusiasts by then had clearly grown weary of the tired formulas followed by Hollywood studios in the timid post-war years. They welcomed the more thoughtful and challenging films from Kurosawa and from other acclaimed film directors in Japan (Ozu and Misoguchi), Italy (Rosselini, De Sica), France (Troufault, Bresson), and England (Lean). All of these great film directors were also able to hold and move their audiences while developing somber themes. 'Ikuru', however, is even more deeply philosophical than any other film that I recall by asking what is needed for us 'to live' well.Takashi Shimura gives an absolutely convincing performance of a tired old man, numb and alone. After learning he has terminal cancer, he learns that dissipation offers no solution. Then he clings to a cute, vivacious girl, taking her to shops and restaurants. She wearies of his dreary, cringing manner but agrees to have one more dinner together. In the powerful climactic scene at the restaurant, he learns why she is happy in her new job packaging toys. 'I feel all the babies in Japan are my friends!!' This gives him an idea. He, too, can do something to help children. 'There's still time!!', he cries, and runs off while she stares in bewilderment. He keeps moving quickly towards his cheerful new life. Shimura reminded me of Albert Camus' essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus.' Sisyphus plods off to yet another day of struggle but has won over the gods, after all, because he is aware of his quest. 'We must imagine Sisyphus happy,' urges Camus. We must also feel the same for the old man in Ikuru when we see how he is reborn and truly alive for the first time.",coming alive,ikuru japanese live was one kurosawas personal favorites prominent film critics worldwide put it along with seven samurai rashomon their lists best films ever made by anyone when first shown usa during 1950s all three quickly earned widespread critical acclaim strong patronage usa film enthusiasts by then had clearly grown weary tired formulas followed by hollywood studios timid post war years they welcomed more thoughtful challenging films kurosawa other acclaimed film directors japan ozu misoguchi italy rosselini de sica france troufault bresson england lean all these great film directors were also able hold move their audiences while developing somber themes ikuru however is even more deeply philosophical than any other film that i recall by asking what is needed us live well takashi shimura gives absolutely convincing performance tired old man numb alone after learning he has terminal cancer he learns that dissipation offers no solution then he clings cute vivacious girl taking her shops restaurants she wearies his dreary cringing manner but agrees have one more dinner together powerful climactic scene at restaurant he learns why she is happy her new job packaging toys i feel all babies japan are my friends this gives him idea he too can do something help children theres still time he cries runs off while she stares bewilderment he keeps moving quickly towards his cheerful new life shimura reminded me albert camus essay myth sisyphus sisyphus plods off yet another day struggle but has won over gods after all because he is aware his quest we must imagine sisyphus happy urges camus we must also feel same old man ikuru when we see how he is reborn truly alive first time,0.5412786400591276,0.2401330376940133,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.25}"

If you are willing to go there and still have the strength to go there, you will be rewarded.But then again, the whole movie is a great experience.

10.0,Kurosawa's greatest achievement,"As difficult as some Japanese films can be, Akira Kurosawa was always welcomed by Western audiences due to the director's embracing of the cinematic, as opposed to, say, the static, conversation-heavy work of Yasujiro Ozu. Still known primarily for his samurai action films and his film noir homages, Kurosawa's movies were action-packed and grandiose, shot beautifully through a lens that brings to mind the great American westerns or the shadowy mise-en-scene of Orson Welles, making them almost Western in tone. Ikiru, one of Kurosawa's most spiritual and tonally dark films, took a few years to make it across Pacific Ocean, and it's not hard to see why. Although, in my opinion, this is probably Kurosawa's greatest achievement, the subject matter is sobering, it's satire alarming and it's story-telling techniques unconventional.The film opens with an X-ray of our protagonist, Watanabe (Takashi Shimura). The narrator tells us he has stomach cancer, but he does not yet know this, and so we join him, reluctantly, as he goes about stamping his papers in his stagnating job as a bureaucrat. Quiet and eternally hunched, Watanabe is an introverted man, spending little of what he earns to the frustration of his selfish son. When he learns that he has only about a year to live, Watanabe goes through the familiar stages of acceptance as he drinks, parties, fails to turn up for work, becomes involved with a much younger woman and angers his family. But he soon turns his attention to building a children's playground, a project he has seen passed around by the many pencil-pushers in the various departments within the council he works for, which has frustrated the residents of the decaying area.It's with this shift of focus that comes the true masterstroke of Ikiru. Up to this point, we have been with Watanabe every step of the way, but suddenly, as the narrator informs us, he's dead. We no longer get the first-person perspective, but the third-person perspective, as various colleagues and political players gather for Watanabe's funeral. The film becomes less a human drama, and more of a social-political statement, as the other dead-eyed civil servant's in his office slowly come to realise the greatness of the man. The deputy mayor is there, claiming Watanabe's work was within the confines of his job and proving the bureaucratic machine works. This, of course, is simple electioneering, but the others reminisce and the truth begins to slowly reveal itself in the final months of Watanabe's life.A lot of the film relies on the performance of Shimura, a long-time collaborator with Kurosawa. He is utterly magnetic here, remaining a hushed presence and developing his persona into a weapon to ensure his work gets done before he bites the bullet. In a heart-breaking moment, he croaks a quiet song in a packed bar for it to fall silent. The young hipsters slowly move away, while Watanabe's companion, a booze-addled writer, looks emotional. Kurosawa, only 40 at the time, was also making a comment on the post-war social outcasting of the elderly, embodied in the aforementioned bar scene and in Watanabe's success and money-drive son. Ikiru is many things, but it's the humanity of the story that will linger on in your mind after the credits have rolled, and it ends with one of the finest closing shots in history.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",kurosawas greatest achievement,as difficult as some japanese films can be akira kurosawa was always welcomed by western audiences due directors embracing cinematic as opposed say static conversation heavy work yasujiro ozu still known primarily his samurai action films his film noir homages kurosawas movies were action packed grandiose shot beautifully through lens that brings mind great american westerns or shadowy mise en scene orson welles making them almost western tone ikiru one kurosawas most spiritual tonally dark films took few years make it across pacific ocean its not hard see why although my opinion this is probably kurosawas greatest achievement subject matter is sobering its satire alarming its story telling techniques unconventional film opens with x ray our protagonist watanabe takashi shimura narrator tells us he has stomach cancer but he does not yet know this so we join him reluctantly as he goes about stamping his papers his stagnating job as bureaucrat quiet eternally hunched watanabe is introverted man spending little what he earns frustration his selfish son when he learns that he has only about year live watanabe goes through familiar stages acceptance as he drinks parties fails turn up work becomes involved with much younger woman angers his family but he soon turns his attention building childrens playground project he has seen passed around by many pencil pushers various departments within council he works which has frustrated residents decaying area its with this shift focus that comes true masterstroke ikiru up this point we have been with watanabe every step way but suddenly as narrator informs us hes dead we no longer get first person perspective but third person perspective as various colleagues political players gather watanabes funeral film becomes less human drama more social political statement as other dead eyed civil servants his office slowly come realise greatness man deputy mayor is there claiming watanabes work was within confines his job proving bureaucratic machine works this course is simple electioneering but others reminisce truth begins slowly reveal itself final months watanabes life lot film relies performance shimura long time collaborator with kurosawa he is utterly magnetic here remaining hushed presence developing his persona into weapon ensure his work gets done before he bites bullet heart breaking moment he croaks quiet song packed bar it fall silent young hipsters slowly move away while watanabes companion booze addled writer looks emotional kurosawa only 40 at time was also making comment post war social outcasting elderly embodied aforementioned bar scene watanabes success money drive son ikiru is many things but its humanity story that will linger your mind after credits have rolled it ends with one finest closing shots history www wrath blog blogspot com,0.4199816849816848,0.04671328671328671,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.45}"
7.0,The second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first.,"Looking back at Akira Kurosawa's impressive fifty-year career in filmmaking, it's impossible to determine which film was his best. Fans of the late Japanese legend might cite The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress, while critics believe that it should be Rashomon or Ran.A growing band of Kurosawa worshippers has recently named Ikiru as his indisputable masterpiece. Unfortunately, I don't see myself joining the latter soon. Yes, Ikiru is Kurosawa's most deepest and reflective film, though in my opinion it's far from the masterpiece that it's touted to be. Ikiru is a film best described as 'a game of two halves'. The first hour is vintage Kurosawa. It starts out with an X-ray image of a stomach diagnosed with cancer, and then introduces the film's pitiful lead character Kanji (Takashi Shimura) to the viewers. Kanji is a government official who has been loyally serving his department for many decades.Upon receiving news that he's suffering from terminal cancer, he decides to take an extended break from work (which he has never done before) to reflect about his life. After some inner soul searching, Kanji realized that he has been missing out on life since he began working. He sets himself on a quest to live out his final months with a motto, ""I cannot die until I'm satisfied with my life"".Cancer has taught people that life cannot be taken for granted. Kanji is a character that we can all relate to, from his humble personality to his simple outlook on life. Kurosawa cajoled out a magnificent performance from Shimura, not only was Shimura able to make us feel sympathetic toward his character, but his character was also able to earn our admiration by the end of the picture.However, Kurosawa is no Yasujiro Ozu (Tokyo Story, Late Spring). Those familiar with the works of these two Japanese legends will know that Ikiru is the kind of story that Ozu would have relished. Kurosawa is simply not as capable in handling intense dramatic material as Ozu. This is perhaps the reason the second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first. Kurosawa focused too much on the bureaucratic aspects and its faceless officials during the long funeral sequence than Kanji's final farewell gift to the community after an immense struggle involving politics and red tape.Ikiru's lackluster second half dilutes the film's emotional value. Kurosawa did not have an off day; it's just that he was too ambitious to have attempted such a complex urban drama, though his ambitions have often led him to more successes than failures in life.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",second hour film fails capture greatness first,looking back at akira kurosawas impressive fifty year career filmmaking its impossible determine which film was his best fans late japanese legend might cite seven samurai or hidden fortress while critics believe that it should be rashomon or ran growing band kurosawa worshippers has recently named ikiru as his indisputable masterpiece unfortunately i dont see myself joining latter soon yes ikiru is kurosawas most deepest reflective film though my opinion its far masterpiece that its touted be ikiru is film best described as game two halves first hour is vintage kurosawa it starts out with x ray image stomach diagnosed with cancer then introduces films pitiful lead character kanji takashi shimura viewers kanji is government official who has been loyally serving his department many decades upon receiving news that hes suffering terminal cancer he decides take extended break work which he has never done before reflect about his life after some inner soul searching kanji realized that he has been missing out life since he began working he sets himself quest live out his final months with motto i cannot die until im satisfied with my life cancer has taught people that life cannot be taken granted kanji is character that we can all relate his humble personality his simple outlook life kurosawa cajoled out magnificent performance shimura not only was shimura able make us feel sympathetic toward his character but his character was also able earn our admiration by end picture however kurosawa is no yasujiro ozu tokyo story late spring those familiar with works these two japanese legends will know that ikiru is kind story that ozu would have relished kurosawa is simply not as capable handling intense dramatic material as ozu this is perhaps reason second hour film fails capture greatness first kurosawa focused too much bureaucratic aspects its faceless officials during long funeral sequence than kanjis final farewell gift community after immense struggle involving politics red tape ikirus lackluster second half dilutes films emotional value kurosawa did not have off day its just that he was too ambitious have attempted such complex urban drama though his ambitions have often led him more successes than failures life grade b www filmnomenon blogspot com all rights reserved,0.48922077922077917,0.10293388429752068,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,The affirmation of life through the exploration of death. A powerful film.,"""Ikiru"" is a film that expresses itself through two separate parts. The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality, recalled by those whom he knew best.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the protagonist of the story, a bureaucrat whose job provides him with little more than paper-shuffling and pen-pushing.The movie opens with an x-ray of Watanabe's stomach and the cancer that thrives within it. His doctor tells him he will die soon.Throughout the first half of the film, Watanabe stumbles about helplessly, remembering his life and trying to figure out what has come of it. He lives with his son, whose resentment for his own father has peaked over the years.Watanabe realizes no one in his life actually knows or loves him. He walks about in a permanent stupor of self-loathing. He embarks on a friendship with a younger female co-worker, but even she soon hates him and thinks he is ""creepy."" Towards the end of the film, Watanabe finally dies and the second half is the recounting of his final days by co-workers. We realize Watanabe's life changed drastically towards the end and he dedicated his final days to the construction of a playground for children.The Criterion DVD is excellent, and inside is an essay written by a Kurosawa biographer. He notes that the film is a study of existentialism and mirrors a few themes from Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane,"" which is true - I was very much reminded of Welles' film at certain moments throughout ""Ikiru."" Both films offer solid examinations of life and death and what propels the man stuck in between - in both cases the cruelties of life broke apart the men, leaving hollow shells where souls once existed. In Watanabe's case, his seeking of his own soul finally brings him to a state of contentment and inner satisfaction - his death is, at the beginning of the film, a lingering doom; and at the end a peaceful pact.This movie can change the way you look at life if you open your eyes. Kurosawa might have made better films but ""Ikiru"" is his most emotionally resonant and powerful that I've seen.",affirmation life through exploration death powerful film,ikiru is film that expresses itself through two separate parts first half is exploration bitter mans death second half is affirmation life provided through awareness mortality recalled by those whom he knew best kanji watanabe takashi shimura is protagonist story bureaucrat whose job provides him with little more than paper shuffling pen pushing movie opens with x ray watanabes stomach cancer that thrives within it his doctor tells him he will die soon throughout first half film watanabe stumbles about helplessly remembering his life trying figure out what has come it he lives with his son whose resentment his own father has peaked over years watanabe realizes no one his life actually knows or loves him he walks about permanent stupor self loathing he embarks friendship with younger female co worker but even she soon hates him thinks he is creepy towards end film watanabe finally dies second half is recounting his final days by co workers we realize watanabes life changed drastically towards end he dedicated his final days construction playground children criterion dvd is excellent inside is essay written by kurosawa biographer he notes that film is study existentialism mirrors few themes orson welles citizen kane which is true i was very much reminded welles film at certain moments throughout ikiru both films offer solid examinations life death what propels man stuck between both cases cruelties life broke apart men leaving hollow shells where souls once existed watanabes case his seeking his own soul finally brings him state contentment inner satisfaction his death is at beginning film lingering doom at end peaceful pact this movie can change way you look at life if you open your eyes kurosawa might have made better films but ikiru is his most emotionally resonant powerful that ive seen,0.485083655083655,0.13838159588159588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.47}"

9.0,The examined life...,"This great film by Kurosawa is probably less well known than his Samurai tales, but is none the worse for that. The film is both long and slow-paced, but the impact is incredible.We begin with 'our hero' (as Kurosawa calls him) Watanabe's stomach x-ray, and we are told that he has cancer. We then see Watanabe sitting at his desk in the Tokyo city civil service, slowly marking a great pile of papers with his little rubber stamp. He sits at the head of a group of people doing much the same thing, shuffling papers from one place to another, and we are told that he has been doing this for 30 years! We see a group of ladies complaining about stagnant water directed from one office to another as the bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards.Against this background, Watanabe goes to the doctor with his stomach complaint. He meets a strange man who precisely describes Watanabe's symptoms, and tells him that the doctors will lie to him, as the disease is terminal. This comes true and Watanabe realises that he is to die soon. The stunning waste of his life then becomes apparent to him, and in a really powerful scene he falls asleep, crying below a commendation from the office for 25 years of service. He isn't worried by dying, rather he's worried by never having lived. He stops going to work, he buys expensive sake and goes to the bright lights, but this fails to make him happy. He then spends time with a young girl from the office, and it is on an evening out with her that he realises what he must do. This realisation is combined with a roomful of people singing 'Happy Birthday' for a friend...but it is clear that they are singing for Watanabe's rebirth. Watanabe goes back to the office and picks up the file concerning the stagnant water...he is determined to do something about it after 30 years of doing nothing!The next section of the film is the real key to its impact. We are at Watanabe's funeral, with a number of the technocrats from the City Council. My expectation was that they would all be complimenting the memory of Watanabe and his achievement in clearing the stagnant water and building a park in record time...but they aren't! I was frustrated...I wanted them to recognise that he knew he was ill, and fought the established order so as to achieve something with his life.As they drink more and more, they begin to reflect on what Watanabe had achieved. They become emotional, realising that he knew he was ill, and realising that with determination, the system can be used to achieve things. The final scene, however, is of one of the men present at the funeral subsiding below a pile of papers, unable to change anything.The bitter ending is tempered by the powerful feelings stimulated by Kurosawa during the funeral scene. I reached the end feeling that one man can make a difference if he is determined, and that this can only be achieved by reflecting on your life and achievements, and then making a conscious decision to do something!",examined life,this great film by kurosawa is probably less well known than his samurai tales but is none worse that film is both long slow paced but impact is incredible we begin with our hero as kurosawa calls him watanabes stomach x ray we are told that he has cancer we then see watanabe sitting at his desk tokyo city civil service slowly marking great pile papers with his little rubber stamp he sits at head group people doing much same thing shuffling papers one place another we are told that he has been doing this 30 years we see group ladies complaining about stagnant water directed one office another as bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards against this background watanabe goes doctor with his stomach complaint he meets strange man who precisely describes watanabes symptoms tells him that doctors will lie him as disease is terminal this comes true watanabe realises that he is die soon stunning waste his life then becomes apparent him really powerful scene he falls asleep crying below commendation office 25 years service he isnt worried by dying rather hes worried by never having lived he stops going work he buys expensive sake goes bright lights but this fails make him happy he then spends time with young girl office it is evening out with her that he realises what he must do this realisation is combined with roomful people singing happy birthday friend but it is clear that they are singing watanabes rebirth watanabe goes back office picks up file concerning stagnant water he is determined do something about it after 30 years doing nothing next section film is real key its impact we are at watanabes funeral with number technocrats city council my expectation was that they would all be complimenting memory watanabe his achievement clearing stagnant water building park record time but they arent i was frustrated i wanted them recognise that he knew he was ill fought established order so as achieve something with his life as they drink more more they begin reflect what watanabe had achieved they become emotional realising that he knew he was ill realising that with determination system can be used achieve things final scene however is one men present at funeral subsiding below pile papers unable change anything bitter ending is tempered by powerful feelings stimulated by kurosawa during funeral scene i reached end feeling that one man can make difference if he is determined that this can only be achieved by reflecting your life achievements then making conscious decision do something,0.5613095238095237,0.060615079365079386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.4}"
5.0,Overrated,"This 1952 film by Akira Kurosawa, about a civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer, and trying to do something socially meaningful in the last months of his life to redeem his boring and uneventful life, has become a bit overrated. Some people has even called this film a masterpiece. The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer. Realistic movies were not Kurosawa's forte. One cannot help but notice that at about the same time Ikiru came out such directors as Ozu and Naruse were making much stronger, fluid and unmawkish movies dealing with the everyday life in postwar Japan.",overrated,this 1952 film by akira kurosawa about civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer trying do something socially meaningful last months his life redeem his boring uneventful life has become bit overrated some people has even called this film masterpiece material is certainly moving but movie is stilted static performance main actor is one note dialogue explains often what is obvious viewer realistic movies were not kurosawas forte one cannot help but notice that at about same time ikiru came out such directors as ozu naruse were making much stronger fluid unmawkish movies dealing with everyday life postwar japan,0.44075091575091574,0.04212454212454213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
