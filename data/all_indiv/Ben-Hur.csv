10.0,Epic,"When I first saw 'Ben Hur' I was 8 years old and hadn't seen many films, since we were hardly ever allowed to watch television. Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films - which, of course, is not at all a bad thing).The experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. Despite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.It's hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it's Ben Hur. And even now, after I've seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don't mean that in a religious sense).My verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many ""sandal and sword"" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.Pure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",epic,when i first saw ben hur i was 8 years old hadnt seen many films since we were hardly ever allowed watch television imagine what impact this film had me my movie diet had so far consisted chaplin disney films which course is not at all bad thing experience was simply mesmerizing awe wonder filled me as i watched this story shocking betrayal revenge forgiveness unfold screen by time heart stopping chariot race was over my fate as future movie addict was sealed despite its 212 minutes running time this is storytelling at its finest that knows how entertain as we follow judah ben hurs dramatic journey jerusalem rome back again film just never lets up immerses you completely its hard imagine anything more cinematic especially at time if ever there was epic that was meant be seen big screen all its bombastic glory its ben hur even now after ive seen film many many times i feel like this story has certain sense greatness it that is touching i dont mean that religious sense my verdict this film was is nothing like many sandal sword or bible films that era it is at least me ultimate film epic with its touching story fantastic action sequences which i think hold up amazingly well ben hur is among milestones its era part film history pure cinema must see 10 stars out 10 favorite tv shows reviewed imdb com list ls075552387 favorite films imdb com list mkjokvqlsbs lesser known masterpieces imdb com list ls070242495 favorite low budget b movies imdb com list ls054808375,0.5529315476190477,0.11873511904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,The Tale of all Tales...,"In the ears and minds of any movie lover, the word ""Ben-Hur"" resonates like the quintessential Hollywood classic oozing respectability in every inch of celluloid but the same respect we owe to an old relic. In our cynical modern world, who would enjoy a pompous-looking big-budget swords-and-sandals religious epic when you have Tarantino and Appatow?I saw ""Ben-Hur"" for the first time in fourth grade, it was part of our history course and being an Asterix buff, I loved watching real-life legionaries, galley slavery not to mention the chariot race, the film also enlightened me on Christianity and on Judaism (when my only religious reference was monotheism number three) and scared the hell out of me with leper. It worked on a cinematic level as much as educational, I guess even in its TV-sized crappy 80's VHS look, we kids enjoyed ""Ben-Hur"" especially the rivalry between Judah (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).I never watched ""Ben-Hur"" after that but nor did I have any doubt over its status as a colossal masterpiece. Watching it again a few years ago and then a few days ago, I was surprised by how engraved in my memory ""Ben-Hur"" was, and how the moments that stood out were still having the same effect. When Ben-Hur and Messala meet after many years, I'm always anticipating that first breech in the fortress of their friendship when the young Roman tribune will have one word too many about Ben-Hur's people, taking for granted their friendship and Judah's nobility as marks of submission. The second encounter is even more thrilling because it's like watching a shaking edifice waiting to collapse.It was a nice call from the director Wyler to mark the feud between the two ex-friends at the second encounter, hence putting more gravitas around their relationship, that screenwriter Gore Vidal tried to impregnate with homoerotic subtext. The story is known by movie buffs, Vidal wanted to make the interactions look as the two rivals were former lovers, the subtext works even more when you look at Stephen Boyd's ""enamored"" eyes toward Charlton Heston. But 'Chuck' never knew the trick and was annoyed about it, I guess I prefer the way their hatred epitomize the conflict between Romans and Jews sealing as one of the most memorable rivalries in history of cinema, with the most heart-pounding climactic face-to-face (or should I say wheel-to-wheel).I had positive feelings about ""Gladiator"" but ""Ben-Hur"" is the masterpiece that dwarfs any contemporary masterpiece, a sweeping revenge story that doesn't rely at all on fake CGI and special effects. It took William Wyler's expertise built up in three decades of experience to make ""Ben-Hur"" equal the reference of the time that was Cecil B. De Mille's 1925 version. As a matter of fact, ""Ben-Hur"" has been blockbuster material from the start, ever since Lewis Wallace's best-seller of the late century, it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story, with galley combats, a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told, with a hero going from idealism to anger, from revenge to love, all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion, ""Ben-Hur"" was an instant classic Hollywood couldn't ignore.If 1925 had the race and the thrills, the 1959 one had a bigger scope, bigger budget, the colors, the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50's audience that TV wasn't yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies, like ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"", ""Guns of Navarone"" or ""Taras Boulba"" you would think he went there, inside the screen. And right now, I can't imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race, there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element, but as a real race, and it never, never suspends your disbelief, it's like at any new viewing, Messalah can finally win.There are so many classic moments that filled the three-hour-and-half journey that you're never in a state of non-anticipation, when the new inquisitor's parade starts, you keep an eye on that loose roof tile, the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert, you wait for the 'greatest cameo ever made', in the galleys, the big fight and Ben-Hur rescuing Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race, the film gets a tad too long, but only because you can't just sweep off such a rich epic with a five-minute resolution, and Charlton Heston, in his greatest role, contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film, I don't think he gets the credit he deserved, he brings to his Judah Ben-Hur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.Other cast members include Oscar-winning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah's mentor, Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther, Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as Judah's mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast, editing, directing, having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins, only to be matched in 1997 with ""Titanic"" and ""The Return of the King"" and oddly enough, these titles could somewhat apply to ""Ben-Hur"". I haven't seen the 'original' and I'm in no hurry for the remake, but I don't get I'll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn't see it many times in my life but it's always present in my memories as if it wasn't about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let's not forget the name of the director: William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece, which is saying a lot, given his previous streaks.""Ben-Hur"": A Christ Tale, a tale of vengeance, in fact a tale of all tales...",tale all tales,ears minds any movie lover word ben hur resonates like quintessential hollywood classic oozing respectability every inch celluloid but same

10.0,One of the Top Five Films of All Time!,"Anyone want to know how to make a darned good EPIC remake? Then this is the film to see.William Wyler made an epic, a film that is exciting, violent, heartfelt film. Make no mistake, it is the story of two childhood friends, one gets drunk with power and the other who was a Jewish Prince gets thrown into a life of hardship though his boyhood 'friend'. But he has faith and keeps on going. The ultimate battle to beat all battles, to settle the score...is at the Chariot race and that is a sight to behold.Films like Ben-Hur will NEVER get greenlighted today and if it did, too much CGI and not enough of what Director Wyler and old Hollywood was good at. The actors, well, they are to die for. Excellent acting. And let me share with you my favorite part...(tee-hee) when Pilate holds up his hankerchief to start the chariot race, plays with the racers and audience - he's very smug ya know..then the WAY he finally drops it. Who couldn't tell how he'd eventually turn out, hmmmmmmm?There is nothing more I can add that others have said. This film is near and dear to me and for my vote -- is one of the top five films of all time. I never tire of watching this film, I find something new in it every time, its done that well.This is an epic remake, something else that Hollywood has trouble doing -- to remake a film on this scale that finds new audiences year after year, after year.

10.0,Film-making on a truly epic scale,"What's not to love about BEN-HUR? It's a film that tells an epic story in an epic way, filling every shot with artistry and colour until the screen overflows with splendour. Despite a lengthy running time, the pacing never flags. The episodic structure of the storyline works in the film's favour, ably chronicling the adventures of the titular character as he undergoes a thrilling journey to hell and back.It has Charlton Heston playing his most famous role and being incredibly manly and heroic in it. It has a cast of seasoned performers in support, not least Jack Hawkins as the sympathetic Roman. It has Stephen Boyd as a truly nasty piece of work villain. It has the most spectacular and complex action sequence ever put on film in the shape of the chariot race, which is just as thrilling and breathtaking as it was when it was first released in cinemas back in the day.And, finally, it's a film engages the senses and the emotions. It never forgets, amid all the glory and the epic wonder of the scenery and action, that this is a human story about real people struggling with their lives. There's a message there for any viewer, Christian or otherwise, and that's the reason why BEN-HUR hasn't dated a day since it was first released.

10.0,Deserved All The Honors,"Wow, what can you say about a film that won 11 Academy Awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored, not the garbage they salute today.In other words, this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time. Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race, for instance, perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects. This can be a very sad film as well. I doubt if I've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points. The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film. They can just tear you apart. The combination of drama, action and romance, along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack, once again one of the best ever put on film. The more one hears this music, the more was is moved by it. To fully appreciate the cinematography in this film I recommend you purchase the recently-released 4-disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story, the silent movie ""Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ."" That was name of the book, by the way, the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films. However, there is a reverence for Jesus Christ in this film, which should be there since it's a key element of the storyline, even though most folks forget that.In summary, this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an ""epic"" movie.

10.0,"Human Drama, Grand Spectacle, Moving Divinity","This film is so much more than the chariot race. Undoubtedly, that is the most famous sequence and for good reason. It is stunning, electric, tense and the so very exciting. There is nothing like simply seeing a chariot race unfold by actually filming a group a chariots. But the sequence is filled with meaning because the film spends so much time building up the personal relationship between Judah and Messala; their hatred for each other displayed in the chariot race is alive and bitter. Because we have seen them expressing deep kinship and spiritual love.There is a famous dispute between Wyler and Vidal about how much of the Judah-Messala relationship was intended to have a subtext of a gay jilted lovers. I think to dwell on that is to sort of miss the point. While it it is really easy to read an erotic love (especially on Messala's part) between the two it is clear that spiritual love is present in anycase. The erotic element is present if one cares to look but it is not needed. There is clearly an emotional intimacy between the two. This intimacy gets soured by politics. The story is richer, deeper and more personal as a result.Richer is a good word for this movie. It is nearly 4 hours long but it is a fully fleshed out epic that engages the entire time. I rather enjoyed how the Christian themes are restrained-You never see Christ's face, you only hear what he says second hand etc.-it makes the film feel about Jesus of Nazareth and not necessarily Jesus Christ. I feel like it makes the film more accessible to nonChristians while Christians can infer what the wish. Biblical epics can often be very stuffy and overwrought. Wyler's use of deep focus really gives the film a feel of intimate epicness. The scope is grand; the focus personal,Wyler was a very good filmmaker; this is something of a departure for him. Nonetheless this film is still the work of a master.",human drama grand spectacle moving divinity,this film is so much more than chariot race undoubtedly that is most famous sequence good reason it is stunning electric tense so very exciting there is nothing like simply seeing chariot race unfold by actually filming group chariots but sequence is filled with meaning because film spends so much time building up personal relationship between judah messala their hatred each other displayed chariot race is alive bitter because we have seen them expressing deep kinship spiritual love there is famous dispute between wyler vidal about how much judah messala relationship was intended have subtext gay jilted lovers i think dwell that is sort miss point while it it is really easy read erotic love especially messalas part between two it is clear that spiritual love is present anycase erotic element is present if one cares look but it is not needed there is clearly emotional intimacy between two this intimacy gets soured by politics story is richer deeper more personal as result richer is good word this movie it is nearly 4 hours long but it is fully fleshed out epic that engages entire time i rather enjoyed how christian themes are restrained you never see christs face you only hear what he says second hand etc it makes film feel about jesus nazareth not necessarily jesus christ i feel like it makes film more accessible nonchristians while christians can infer what wish biblical epics can often be very stuffy overwrought wylers use deep focus really gives film feel intimate epicness scope is grand focus personal wyler was very good filmmaker this is something departure him nonetheless this film is still work master,0.513014455782313,0.2270833333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Stunning Film That Was Worthy of 11 Oscars,"""Ben-Hur"" is a dominant Best Picture Oscar winner that is perhaps more impressive now than it was when it was first released in 1959. Charlton Heston (Oscar-winning) stars as a rich Jewish nobleman during the time of Jesus Christ who is turned into a slave by the Romans after a freak accident. Now he is manning an oar in a ship's galley and his family is imprisoned. Years pass and now Heston is after the former childhood friend (Stephen Boyd), a Roman, that turned against him. The 17 minutes of footage for the chariot race is some of the best during the history of the cinema. Hugh Griffith won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and William Wyler won his third and final Best Director Oscar.

10.0,"A ""Real"" Character","General Lew Wallace, a somewhat controversial commander of the Union forces in the Civil War happened to be on a train with Robert Ingersoll, noted atheist in the 19th century. Wallace was a moderately religious man and attempted to debate Ingersoll. The story has it that Ingersoll whipped him to a frazzle and Wallace knew it. But he resolved to study the Bible and learn about his faith so that he would be better prepared.He never got to debate Ingersoll again, but Wallace got so immersed in religion that he decided to put that knowledge to use. While he was Territorial Governor of New Mexico and while he wasn't dealing with the Lincoln County War and the hunting down of Billy the Kid, he spent his spare time creating what became the widest selling work of fiction in his century, Ben-Hur, A Tale of the Christ.He did his research well. Judah Ben-Hur and his mother and sister are descended from a very ancient family of Hebrew nobility. The founder of this house was Hur who in the Bible was the husband of Miriam who was Moses's sister. Hur pops up as a peripheral character during the whole story of the Exodus. He invested the characters that Charlton Heston, Martha Scott, and Cathy O'Donnell play with a heroic lineage which makes their fall all the more tragic.So on the consciousness of the public were the Hur family that one often thinks of them as real people. Case in point, many years ago a teacher of mine wanted to demonstrate how many true characters Charlton Heston played on the screen. I count 15 in his list of credits on IMDb, some he's played in more than one film or television show. Inevitably more than just one person named Ben-Hur as a real character. A tribute to the timelessness of the character and to Charlton Heston's abilities as actor.The story is that Heston and his family greet an old friend newly arrived back in Judea province, Messala who is now a tribune. Messala played by Stephen Boyd, is one ambitious fellow and he wants Heston to rat out potential leaders of rebellion in this most unruly of Roman provinces. Heston refuses.The next day Boyd frames an incident where a piece of old tile accidentally falls from the Hur family home while the new Judean governor is passing by into an assassination attempt. Scott and O'Donnell are thrown in prison and Heston is sentenced to the galleys. The story is then Ben-Hur's adventures in trying to get back to Judea and set things right.Ben-Hur meets a whole host of people who aid him in his endeavor. Jack Hawkins as a commander of the galley fleet he's serving on, Finlay Currie as Balthazar one of the Three Wise Men now seeking the child whose birth he witnessed in the year Anno Domini, Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim whose horses Ben-Hur races.It's not often mentioned, but among the Oscars collected for this most honored film, besides the ones that the film itself, Wyler, and Heston won, was Hugh Griffith's for Best Supporting Actor. His Arab sheik is a blustering, but very wise and compassionate fellow. The events of this film are taking place some six centuries before the Prophet Mohammed arrived on the scene. The Arab people at that time were involved in a hedonistic animist kind of religion, but it's left up in the air that they might turn Christian. Certainly some of them did and some are Christian to this day as the country of Lebanon attests.Griffith had the wildest pair of eyes in film history next to Jack Elam's and he used them to great effect. Watch his expressions during the film, they're what got him the Oscar.Stephen Boyd also got rave notices for the evil Messala. When he's not stepping on people to move up in Roman politics, Messala likes to race chariots. During his odyssey Ben-Hur becomes a charioteer and the climax of the film is the thrilling chariot race that turns into a race for survival. You'll see in the film, Messala doesn't exactly play by Marquis of Queensbury rules for charioteers. Boyd did some leads after Ben-Hur, but never really took as a hero. But he was one grand villain.While Ben-Hur is a prisoner being led to the galleys the Roman prison convoy stops in a town called Nazareth and a carpenter faces down a Roman guard to give the thirsting Ben-Hur a drink of water. The two men go their separate ways, Ben-Hur's is described in the book by Lew Wallace, the carpenter's way in the first four books of the New Testament. Later on after Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister and what's become of them, they hear about Jesus of Nazareth, a rabbi with a message of hope and reputation for miracles. Of course when they seek Jesus it's when He's just been tried and condemned and on the way to the cross. It's now Ben-Hur's turn to offer the carpenter a drink of water on the way, to show his trust and faith. And as the sky darkens and Jesus breathes his last, the film depicts what the New Testament describes as the blackest day in Earth's history. But even at that point Heston's new found faith is rewarded, a miracle at the point of death. What was the miracle, for that you buy the DVD or wait until Ben-Hur is on television.Ben-Hur should really be seen in a theater, even a letter box version doesn't do justice to the chariot race or the sea battle with pirates.Ben-Hur is the story of two paths, one of vengeance and one of faith.

9.0,OMG! Ben-Hur is one of the best movies ever made. It's a sweet chariot. That's worth the ride.,"Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 1959, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor. 'Ben-Hur' remains one of the most inspirational, epic action spectacles ever made by a major Hollywood studio. It was a landmark achievement in grand peplum/biblical genre storytelling. Directed by William Wyler, the film tells the story of a kind, wealthy Jew, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) whose life is thrown upside down, when he is betrayed and falsely accused of crimes against the Roman Empire by his childhood friend, turn tribune Messala (Stephen Boyd). Spending three years as a galley slave, Judah must find, a way to restore himself to high standing and while, also seeking revenge on his enemies. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while everybody thinks that this movie was the original; it was in fact, the third movie, follow after 1907 & 1925 of the same name to be made from Lew Wallace's successful novel, 1880's 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ'. It can be argued that a talking picture made from the same story as an earlier silent film is not a true remake, since the storytelling techniques each employ are so radically different, but that's up to debate, but at least, it's more original than the later films that came after it, like the 2003's animation version & the 2016 remake. Anyways, like the book, the movie also has a sub-story running in parallel with Judah's main event narrative; which was the unfolding story of Jesus. While, Jesus does play a more important role in this story more than other films, his cameo presence is still somewhat tangential. It's jarring to see a violent revenge plot, mixed his story about love thy neighbor. Thank God, the film cut the sequences of Ben-Hur faking his death, and raising a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, as it felt that Christ's message of forgiveness, could be lost. Still, 'Ben-Hur' is the only Hollywood film to make the Vatican approved film list in the category of religion, despite having scenes of him killing an innocent guard. However, the film does have other problems than the mixed messages, it was presenting. The book and the films have always been accuse of being too similar to the book, 'The Count of Monte Cristo"" by author Alexandre Dumas to the point that some critics have stated out that the film is 'The Count of Monte Cristo meets Quo Vadis'. While, me, personal, I don't see much of anything comparable; some critics says, the film is ripping off, that premise, way too much. Regardless, I did like the changes by the many screenwriters, did, to couther, being too similar to the novel, like having Messala's vindictiveness be motivated by a sexual and romantic rejection as much as a political one. I'm one of the few people that, kinda like the somewhat hidden homoerotic overtones between Judah and Messala. I also love how Heston didn't know about this; adding an interesting uncomfortable dynamic to the tense dialogue scenes between the two actors. It adds some spice and realism that was really needed for this period film. I also like how the film, add symbolism to the ocean scenes and also cut other things, like the character of Ira from the novel. I always felt that the scenes with her, was time-wasting. On top of that, the other changes like having Judah's sister being the one who dislodge the roof tile & how they treat Messala after the climatic chariot race were equally as important. However, the movie still have pacing issues. 212 minutes running time is way too long. While, I get why, the soul-stirring scenes of Christ's birth and crucifixion was needed, as it provide biblical bookends for MGM's action-packed epic. I think the outdated, theatrical overture & intermission sequence should had been delete in future releases. If anything, scenes like Judah declines the race at times, even after he learns that Messala will also compete, could had been delete as well, as the famous chariot race sequence did happen, later on the film, regardless of Judah wanting to do it or not. It felt like filler. Despite that, the climactic chariot race, which includes collisions, men dragged under chariots, bloody injuries, and intensely suspenseful competition, was so impressive in the stunt work & make up that it set new standards for action-filmmaking without modern cinematic razzle-dazzle. It was very surprising to hear that nobody got kill or seriously hurt. The colorful 1959 version was the most expensive film ever made up to its time, and the most expensive film of the 50s decade. Shot on the grand scale of $15 million, the film took six years to prepare, and over a half year in production, it was a tremendous make-or-break risk for MGM Studios. Luckily, for them, the project, ultimately saved the studio from bankruptcy as it became a box office hit, earning three times more than it took to make. Does it hold up? Yes, while it's slow at times, and some of the acting feels now, mannered, stiff, and awkward like Hugh Griffith in blackface. It still worth the praise and achievements, it got, when it first released. It still has great acting from all the cast, including more physically than emotionally compelling Heston, amazing color widescreen cinematography from Robert Surtees, beautiful music from composter Miklós Rózsa & wonderful costumes from Elizabeth Haffenden and her crew. However, this movie might be too intense to be rated G, even at the time. After all, this movie has a leper colony where two principles characters are shown with open, rotting sores and a few men drowning in the ocean battle. If anything, it could be rated PG or PG-13 now. Regardless of that, I have say, Ben-Hur is one of the ultimate epics movies of all time. A legendary movie that needs to be rewatch, time after time again. Highly recommended.",omg ben hur is one best movies ever made its sweet chariot thats worth ride,winner 11 academy awards 1959 including best picture best director best actor best supporting actor ben

8.0,the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era,"The newest iteration of BEN-HUR (2016) made by schlockmeister Timur Bekmambetov crashed and burned in the box-office front, which prompts my belated viewing of this grandiose historical epic under the supervision of William Wyler, the film won him a third Oscar for directing and swept with 11 wins out of its total 12 nominations (only Karl Tunberg lost BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY to Jack Clayton's ROOM AT THE TOP).Adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE Christ, this Hollywood juggernaut opens with the birth of Jesus Christ, jand condones quite a chunk of time in padding out the Calvary crucification after the iconic chariot racing money shot (which partially explains its drawn-out length, running up to 212 minutes), vehemently gets its feet wet as a Christianity- moralizing tale by casting J.C. as the Messiah who literally saves our hero Judas Ben-Hur (Heston) from perishing during his trials and tribulations, and jumps the shark in its miraculous ending, gratifyingly throws humankind's fate under the omnipresence's whims, which gives a staid aftertaste. The main plot is of course, about Judas, a wealthy Jewish prince in Jerusalem, AD 26, falls foul of his childhood friend, now a Roman tribune, Messala (Boyd), who swears allegiance to the Roman Empire, and fails to rope the freedom-advocating Judas into joining his side. Under Messala's cunning malfeasance out of a mere accident, Judas is sentenced to toil in the galleys whilst his mother Miriam (Scott) and sister Tirzah (O'Connell) are cooped up in prison. Revenge is the mainspring behind Judas' odyssey from a galley slave to an heir of the childless Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Hawkins), it is hatred that keeps his head above water against adversity, alert to a golden window to enact his exit strategy and he even magnanimously hatches a son-father rapport with the tyrannical Arrius. This is the thorny knot in the otherwise rather Manichaean racial feud depicted in the story, how far one can go to love your enemy? Which remains a quintessential challenge for those who endorse Christianity, and the film could have delved deeper into Judas' psyche on that issue, yet, Arrius wholly disappears from the narrative after the mid-stream, and he merely functions as a springboard to Judas' glorious homecoming with his rehabilitation, reunion and rediscovery. At the end of the day, justice belatedly prevails, but Judas still gets all shaken up in the aftermath, revenge might keep him alive but it is religion that gives him the ultimate peace.For what it's worth, BEN-HUR's visual spectacle still holds water to an awe-inspiring amazement and thrill, it is a historic accomplishment not just because of its cutting-edge technicalities but also for the staggering manpower it strenuously deploys, the film itself is a panegyric of human's creativity, which is something no dissenter can take away. Romans are played by a crop of top-notch British thespians, whilst Jews are mostly impersonated by Americans, although how come Hugh Griffith's ludicrously swarthy portrayal of the Arabic Sheik can walk off with that Oscar statute still eludes me, he is not even the top-pick among the supporting cast in the film, both Hawkins and Boyd can easily upstage him with their more engaging agent and emotive bravura, especially the latter, truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination which usurped by Griffith. That is not to say, Heston wins his Oscar all fair and square, but at least one can understand the logic, Heston has a dominating role whacked by an unimaginable baptism of fire, he is undeniably sympathetic and mostly affective with a very theatrical flair. An unsung heroine, is Israeli beauty Haya Harareet's divine presence as Esther, the daughter of Judah's former slave Simonides (Jaffe), and Judah's sweetheart, who livens up the scenes whenever poignancy comes into play, a classic godsend. When all is said and done, BEN-HUR is the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era, its phenomenal scale, its breathtaking grandeur and the imposingly plangent score by Miklós Rózsa can unnerve any redux project even tries to emulate its success, and furthermore, its ""revenge is never the cure"" message can earnestly transcend any religious persuasions and reach to a broader demography out of its faith-base home-turf.",apotheosis mainstream studio production hollywoods golden era,newest iteration ben hur 2016 made by schlockmeister timur bekmambetov crashed burned box office front which prompts my belated viewing this grandiose historical epic under supervision william wyler film won him third oscar directing swept with 11 wins out its total 12 nominations only karl tunberg lost best adapted screenplay jack claytons room at top adapted lew wallaces 1880 novel ben hur tale christ this hollywood juggernaut opens with birth jesus christ jand condones quite chunk time padding out calvary crucification after iconic chariot racing money shot which partially explains its drawn out length running up 212 minutes vehemently gets its feet wet as christianity moralizing tale by casting j c as messiah who literally saves our hero judas ben hur heston perishing during his trials tribulations jumps shark its miraculous ending gratifyingly throws humankinds fate under omnipresences whims which gives staid aftertaste main plot is course about judas wealthy jewish prince jerusalem ad 26 falls foul his childhood friend now roman tribune messala boyd who swears allegiance roman empire fails rope freedom advocating judas into joining his side under messalas cunning malfeasance out mere accident judas is sentenced toil galleys whilst his mother miriam scott sister tirzah oconnell are cooped up prison revenge is mainspring behind judas odyssey galley slave heir childless roman consul quintus arrius hawkins it is hatred that keeps his head above water against adversity alert golden window enact his exit strategy he even magnanimously hatches son father rapport with tyrannical arrius this is thorny knot otherwise rather manichaean racial feud depicted story how far one can go love your enemy which remains quintessential challenge those who endorse christianity film could have delved deeper into judas psyche that issue yet arrius wholly disappears narrative after mid stream he merely functions as springboard judas glorious homecoming with his rehabilitation reunion rediscovery at end day justice belatedly prevails but judas still gets all shaken up aftermath revenge might keep him alive but it is religion that gives him ultimate peace what its worth ben hurs visual spectacle still holds water awe inspiring amazement thrill it is historic accomplishment not just because its cutting edge technicalities but also staggering manpower it strenuously deploys film itself is panegyric humans creativity which is something no dissenter can take away romans are played by crop top notch british thespians whilst jews are mostly impersonated by americans although how come hugh griffiths ludicrously swarthy portrayal arabic sheik can walk off with that oscar statute still eludes me he is not even top pick among supporting cast film both hawkins boyd can easily upstage him with their more engaging agent emotive bravura especially latter truly deserves at least oscar nomination which usurped by griffith that is not say heston wins his oscar all fair square but at least one can understand logic heston has dominating role whacked by unimaginable baptism fire he is undeniably sympathetic mostly affective with very theatrical flair unsung heroine is israeli beauty haya harareets divine presence as esther daughter judahs former slave simonides jaffe judahs sweetheart who livens up scenes whenever poignancy comes into play classic godsend when all is said done ben hur is apotheosis mainstream studio production hollywoods golden era its phenomenal scale its breathtaking grandeur imposingly plangent score by mikl s r zsa can unnerve any redux project even tries emulate its success furthermore its revenge is never cure message can earnestly transcend any religious persuasions reach broader demography out its faith base home turf,0.4462643678160918,0.13821839080459772,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"If you're going to watch one Biblical epic, this is the one","It's odd, but during the 1950s, Hollywood made a huge number of Biblical epics--most of which were pretty wretched films. SAMSON AND DELILAH and David AND BATHSHEBA quickly come to mind, but even the more respected TEN COMMANDMENTS was, despite all the hype, a pretty lousy film--with cardboard characters and silly writing. Even QUO VADIS was a pretty uninspired film, despite the violent nature of the film. So, in light of this, I am so happy to say that a Biblical epic CAN be exceptional and worth seeing!What makes BEN-HUR so worth while? Well, of course the film does contain some of the very greatest (if not the greatest) action scenes of all-time. You just can't do better than the unbelievable chariot race sequence for excitement and spectacle. Even the naval battle scene is great despite it being filmed with large models--it's state of the art for the time it was made. In addition to the spectacle, it also handles the religious aspects of the film in a less heavy-handed manner than most of its contemporaries. You do see Jesus from behind throughout the film and you do not hear him speak--instead, the film focuses on Jesus' teachings on others. And, while they do not show the resurrection, you are not left with the impression that he stayed dead like the 1925 version--a definite No-No for a Biblical film!Now as for the acting, it was generally exceptional--especially from Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith. I also liked Charlton Heston in the title role, but I could see how some might see this performance as a bit more wooden. Also, there are times (especially at the very beginning and end) where the pacing is just too slow. However, given the exceptional nature of the film on every other level, this can easily be forgiven and the film is a truly magnificent work--not to be missed by any true fan of film.",if youre going watch one biblical epic this is one,its odd but during 1950s hollywood made huge number biblical epics most which were pretty wretched films samson delilah david bathsheba quickly come mind but even more respected ten commandments was despite all hype pretty lousy film with cardboard characters silly writing even quo vadis was pretty uninspired film despite violent nature film so light this i am so happy say that biblical epic can be exceptional worth seeing what makes ben hur so worth while well course film does contain some very greatest if not greatest action scenes all time you just cant do better than unbelievable chariot race sequence excitement spectacle even naval battle scene is great despite it being filmed with large models its state art time it was made addition spectacle it also handles religious aspects film less heavy handed manner than most its contemporaries you do see jesus behind throughout film you do not hear him speak instead film focuses jesus teachings others while they do not show resurrection you are not left with impression that he stayed dead like 1925 version definite no no biblical film now as acting it was generally exceptional especially steven boyd jack hawkins hugh griffith i also liked charlton heston title role but i could see how some might see this performance as bit more wooden also there are times especially at very beginning end where pacing is just too slow however given exceptional nature film every other level this can easily be forgiven film is truly magnificent work not be missed by any true fan film,0.5953869047619046,0.17234623015873016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Claude Heater (who played Jesus Christ) - one of the last surviving main actors of Ben-Hur,"Along with Haya Harareet, I think Claude Heater is one of the last of the surviving main cast members from Ben-Hur (1959). Quite symbolic in a way given Mr Heater's moving performance as Jesus Christ in the movie. When I saw Ben-Hur at a church gathering night a few years ago, the Pastor(who was quite conservative) told us that even though Ben-Hur is a ""Hollywood"" movie, it's the one that probably came closest to honoring and glorifying the Son of God. In Ben-Hur you never see the face of Jesus Christ, and that was a deliberate choice by the director. But Claude Heater gives the emotional gravitas required for the role.Ben-Hur is a movie that stands the test of time. No wonder we say ""It's bigger than Ben-Hur"" to describe something spectacular. Ben-Hur is an epic, it's spectacular, and it's moving.",claude heater who played jesus christ one last surviving main actors ben hur,along with haya harareet i think claude heater is one last surviving main cast members ben hur 1959 quite symbolic way given mr heaters moving performance as jesus christ movie when i saw ben hur at church gathering night few years ago pastor who was quite conservative told us that even though ben hur is hollywood movie its one that probably came closest honoring glorifying son god ben hur you never see face jesus christ that was deliberate choice by director but claude heater gives emotional gravitas required role ben hur is movie that stands test time no wonder we say its bigger than ben hur describe something spectacular ben hur is epic its spectacular its moving,0.425,0.1433333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10.0,Wonderfully epic.,"Some movies are so good that they just haven't age. They are timeless, like any work of art. This is one of those movies, perhaps one of the best movies ever and surely one of the biggest and most epic biblical movies ever made. The story is based on a novel by Lew Wallace (which I have read and I have at home) and is so famous that it doesn't allow spoils: the injustice committed against Judah Ben-Hur and his path of revenge, deeply linked to the life and death of Jesus, a latent and ever palpable subplot, even when it does not arise. Epic in every detail, the film features scenarios and costumes carefully crafted in the style of Imperial Rome. Some sequences are truly anthological, as is the case with the chariot race. The representation of the Roman legionaries influenced for decades the conception that we have, individually, on how they were and fought. The visual and special effects used in the film were the best there was at the time and even today, more than half a century later, they're able to surprise by the realism. The color is vivid and intense, cinematography is truly imposing and accentuates the epic ambiance. As for the cast's work, it's definitely the movie of Charlton Heston's life. He not only became famous with it but made here the most remarkable character of his career. Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott and Hugh Griffith also shone. It's a long movie, but the audience gets so caught up in it that they don't even feel the time go by.

9.0,New DVD version is a full restoration of sight and sound...brilliant achievement!,"'Ben-Hur' is such a great film, it's a pleasure to report that the newly restored Wide Screen 4-Disc DVD version (which includes the 1925 silent screen film with Ramon Novarro) is right on the mark. The color has been restored to its original brilliance with every scene clearly in focus and the soundtrack gives full range to Miklos Rozsa's impressive score. More than ever, Rozsa's score seems to have an energy and force of its own, underlining all the drama inherent in a story of this kind. And Charlton Heston's work in the title role is sheer perfection. He captures the character so completely that he IS Ben-Hur.Not often does such an epic have human characters that are not dwarfed by all the spectacle. The characters are all fully-dimensional human beings--particularly the two antagonists (Judah Ben-Hur and Messala), once great friends but now divided by political loyalties. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are outstanding in the leads (Boyd should definitely have won an Oscar as Messala for his chilling death scene alone!). All the other important roles are flawlessly cast. The chariot race is the most explosive and breathtaking seventeen minutes ever given to such a spectacular event--and all of the stunts look perfectly real. It's hard to believe that none of the stunts ended with more than minor injuries.The final scene, which follows soon after the chariot race, with Ben-Hur returning home and slowly climbing the steps to find that his mother and sister have been cured, still gives me goose bumps when I see it. As does the poignant scene in the leper colony where he insists on seeing their cave dwelling.

,"Sometimes Overdone, But Entertaining & Worthwhile","It's hard to deny that William Wyler's lavish version of ""Ben-Hur"" is sometimes a bit overdone, but it nevertheless remains an entertaining and worthwhile classic. The material does justify the big-budget approach, since the story contains several interesting themes as well as plenty of action sequences. While some parts could have been stream-lined with little loss, in order to make the movie as a whole flow more smoothly, in general the film as it is keeps a good balance between action and substance. There are some very good dramatic moments in addition to the action highlights.Charlton Heston is well-cast as Ben-Hur, a role that plays right to his strengths. The strained relations between Ben-Hur and Messala provide one set of themes for the story, as well as driving much of the action. Heston handles his end of it pretty well, although Stephen Boyd could have been a little less static in his portrayal of Messala. Jack Hawkins works very well as Quintus Arrius, and his scenes with Heston are used well in establishing some of the inner workings of Heston's character. Hugh Griffith also has a couple of good scenes as Sheik Ilderim.The chariot race and other action sequences usually get most of the attention, but there are also some worthwhile ideas in the story (which are really the focus of the original novel) that are developed well enough. There is also a very good silent movie version of ""Ben-Hur"" from 1925, which at times takes a different approach from this version, and which is well worth seeing in itself for those who like the story.",sometimes overdone but entertaining worthwhile,its hard deny that william wylers lavish version ben hur is sometimes bit overdone but it nevertheless remains entertaining worthwhile classic material does justify big budget approach since story contains several interesting themes as well as plenty action sequences while some parts could have been stream lined with little loss order make movie as whole flow more smoothly general film as it is keeps good balance between action substance there are some very good dramatic moments addition action highlights charlton heston is well cast as ben hur role that plays right his strengths strained relations between ben hur messala provide one set themes story as well as driving much action heston handles his end it pretty well although stephen boyd could have been little less static his portrayal messala jack hawkins works very well as quintus arrius his scenes with heston are used well establishing some inner workings hestons character hugh griffith also has couple good scenes as sheik ilderim chariot race other action sequences usually get most attention but there are also some worthwhile ideas story which are really focus original novel that are developed well enough there is also very good silent movie version ben hur 1925 which at times takes different approach this version which is well worth seeing itself those who like story,0.41737514518002333,0.21233449477351915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.63}"
10.0,The pinnacle of film making,"I own over 2,000 movies on DVD or VHS. I have gone to many many more movies that have not been worthy of my collection, thus my exposure to film has been extensive. I mention this because through every film I have seen; I still come back to a film from 1959 as the greatest achievement in cinematic history. I have seen great films like: Return of the King, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart and many more. While the modern films are wonderful and have a fantastic richness to them, they still are a ""small"" notch below Ben-Hur. Today's films use a lot of computer effects for their battles scenes, their backgrounds, and even computer images for the stunts of their actors. Yet, Ben-Hur did it all without computers. I am still fascinated by the chariot race. Never, in film history, has anything matched the depth and excitement of the chariot race. Remember folks, this is 1959, nothing is computer generated. Some may say the naval battle scenes look a bit cheesy, but again it was 1959 and the scenes still work today. What can you say about the acting? Every single actor is wonderful. Heston is in top form as Ben-Hur. Steven Boyd is incredible playing the merciless Messala. Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott--all fantastic in their roles. Each performing the role of a life time. The actors are fantastic, but William Wyler brings more out of each actor than any director ever could in this day and age. Wyler had no computer animation to rely on, he had no high tech special effects crew, he had no computer program to fill in extras. Wyler had to find thousands of extras for many scenes and maintain control. Did you ever see Steven Boyd better? Probably not. Did you ever see any of the actors (except Heston, who is an acting marvel) better in any other role? Wyler just pulled the greatest performance out of each actor. The story: fantastic from beginning to end. While the film is over 3 hours long, you do not feel that it is that long. Every scene is lovingly crafted: the reunion between Messala and Judah, the trek to the gallows, the rowing scene, the naval battle, the chariot race, the Messala death scene, the reunion with Judah and his family, etc. After seeing thousands and thousands of movies, I always come back to Ben-Hur. This is the mark of fantastic movie making. Today's film makers could learn a lot by watching this film and ""learning"" about acting, directing, and screen writing.",pinnacle film making,i own over 2 000 movies dvd or vhs i have gone many many more movies that have not been worthy my collection thus my exposure film has been extensive i mention this because through every film i have seen i still come back film 1959 as greatest achievement cinematic history i have seen great films like return king saving private ryan braveheart many more while modern films are wonderful have fantastic richness them they still are small notch below ben hur todays films use lot computer effects their battles scenes their backgrounds even computer images stunts their actors yet ben hur did it all without computers i am still fascinated by chariot race never film history has anything matched depth excitement chariot race remember folks this is 1959 nothing is computer generated some may say naval battle scenes look bit cheesy but again it was 1959 scenes still work today what can you say about acting every single actor is wonderful heston is top form as ben hur steven boyd is incredible playing merciless messala jack hawkins haya harareet martha scott all fantastic their roles each performing role life time actors are fantastic but william wyler brings more out each actor than any director ever could this day age wyler had no computer animation rely he had no high tech special effects crew he had no computer program fill extras wyler had find thousands extras many scenes maintain control did you ever see steven boyd better probably not did you ever see any actors except heston who is acting marvel better any other role wyler just pulled greatest performance out each actor story fantastic beginning end while film is over 3 hours long you do not feel that it is that long every scene is lovingly crafted reunion between messala judah trek gallows rowing scene naval battle chariot race messala death scene reunion with judah his family etc after seeing thousands thousands movies i always come back ben hur this is mark fantastic movie making todays film makers could learn lot by watching this film learning about acting directing screen writing,0.5764058956916098,0.3086678004535147,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,The firstand for a long time the finestfilm spectacular,"With his distinctive visual style and a taste for solemn material, William Wyler was meticulously individualistic director, triple winner of the Best Picture Oscar... As a devoted artist, he showed visual clarity and sensitive portrayal of character, dignifying melodrama, epic and Westerns... His ""Ben-Hur"" is a semi-biblical adventure set in the First Century AD, during the life of Christ...In ""Ben-Hur,"" Heston reaches the peak of his career winning an Oscar for his outstanding performance of Judah Ben-Hur... Judah is a peaceful Jewish prince who stands the tyranny of Rome through the sadistic mind of Messala... Heston gives a spiritual performance of the title role... Judah is noble, aggressive, proud and warm... He is authentic, believing that his existence had a purpose, and that his God will free him to take revenge on his enemy... He is a man of terrific complexity and great courage and fortitude... From the land of Judea, to the galley of a Roman warship and to the Valley of the Lepers, Judah struggles for dignity and freedom... Judah's spirit is nearly broken until a hand reaches toward him with a ladle of water... Judah/Messala friendship is great, but their relationship, damaged for ideological differences, makes them become bitter enemies... Messala (Stephen Boyd) sees only a Roman world in the future... Judah believes in the future of his people... Tribune Messala had the same attributes, the same traits of Judah, but inverted upside down ideologically... Messala is an ambitious autocratic commander, and a despot ruler, who wants Judea a more obedient and disciplined province...Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) realizes much about Judah's character... After whipping his back, he told him: ""You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it. Your eyes are full of hate, forty-one. That's good. Hates keeps a man alive. It gives him strength."" And that's why Judah can be called more a survival than a hero...Sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith), is the wealthy Arabian horse trainer, who needed a real man to race his strong and magnificent Arabian team...Haya Harareet is the Jewish maiden who tenderly falls in love with Judah...Sam Jaffe is Simonides, Judah's loyal friend and keeper of the Hur fortune... André Morell is Sextus, the pagan ruler whom Messala replaces...With dramatic musical score, breathtaking sets and costumes, huge masses of people, a vigorous sea battle between Roman fleet and Macedonian pirates, a memorable and spectacular chariots race, this inspiring film is an unforgettable solid motion picture, more religious than ""The Ten Commandments.""",first long time finest film spectacular,with his distinctive visual style taste solemn material william wyler was meticulously individualistic director triple winner best picture oscar as devoted artist he showed visual clarity sensitive portrayal character dignifying melodrama epic westerns his ben hur is semi biblical adventure set first century ad during life christ ben hur heston reaches peak his career winning oscar his outstanding performance judah ben hur judah is peaceful jewish prince who stands tyranny rome through sadistic mind messala heston gives spiritual performance title role judah is noble aggressive proud warm he is authentic believing that his existence had purpose that his god will free him take revenge his enemy he is man terrific complexity great courage fortitude land judea galley roman warship valley lepers judah struggles dignity freedom judahs spirit is nearly broken until hand reaches toward him with ladle water judah messala friendship is great but their relationship damaged ideological differences makes them become bitter enemies messala stephen boyd sees only roman world future judah believes future his people tribune messala had same attributes same traits judah but inverted upside down ideologically messala is ambitious autocratic commander despot ruler who wants judea more obedient disciplined province quintus arrius jack hawkins realizes much about judahs character after whipping his back he told him you have spirit fight back but good sense control it your eyes are full hate forty one thats good hates keeps man alive it gives him strength thats why judah can be called more survival than hero sheik ilderim hugh griffith is wealthy arabian horse trainer who needed real man race his strong magnificent arabian team haya harareet is jewish maiden who tenderly falls love with judah sam jaffe is simonides judahs loyal friend keeper hur fortune andr morell is sextus pagan ruler whom messala replaces with dramatic musical score breathtaking sets costumes huge masses people vigorous sea battle between roman fleet macedonian pirates memorable spectacular chariots race this inspiring film is unforgettable solid motion picture more religious than ten commandments,0.5235008818342153,0.26948853615520274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"

The film looks wonderful, the sets are beautiful, the costumes are nice and the cinematography is excellent, and Miklos Rosza's rousing score is one of his best. William Wyler's direction is superb, and the story is engrossing complete with a fine script and solid pacing. As for effective scenes, I cannot stress how riveting the chariot racing climax is, no wonder it is one of cinema's iconic moments. The acting is also fine, Charlton Heston of course is excellent and the supporting cast including Stephen Boyd and Finlay Currie(Magwitch in David Lean's Great Expectations) solidly support him. Overall, this is how an epic should be made. 10/10 Bethany Cox",amazing epic,simply one best epics film it is long but with everything so good i was never bored even talky more leisurely parts film looks wonderful sets are beautiful costumes are nice cinematography is excellent miklos roszas rousing score is one his best william wylers direction is superb story is engrossing complete with fine script solid pacing as effective scenes i cannot stress how riveting chariot racing climax is no wonder it is one cinemas iconic moments acting is also fine charlton heston course is excellent supporting cast including stephen boyd finlay currie magwitch david leans great expectations solidly support him overall this is how epic should be made 10 10 bethany cox,0.577832512315271,0.4770114942528735,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,Oscarized adaptation based on Lew Wallace's novel with huge production design and wonderful scenarios,"This monumental version of renowned story during the time of Christ which was filmed several times, concerning on a wealthy Jewish named Ben-Hur results to be an impressive movie . It is a big budget version by William Wyler that won a record of 11 Oscars and was the most expensive picture of its time , being one of the greatest movies of all history. The story is well known , a rich Jewish nobleman Ben Hur (Charlton Heston in the title role, he was initially offered the role of Messala , though Burt Lancaster was considered) and his confrontation to military Messala (Stephen Boyd , though Robert Ryan was also considered , Boyd and other actors playing Romans wore dark contact lenses, so their eyes appeared brown), though they were childhood friends . When happen a distress , Ben Hur incurs the hostility his previous friend and is condemned to galley slavery , reduced to manning an oar , and his family is sent to prison during several years into a room completely locked . When he's in a galleon as slave rower saves to Quinto Arrio (Jack Hawkins) who subsequently appointed him as a heir . Years later he goes back to seek revenge upon his Roman tormentor . This culminates in a groundbreaking chariot race . As he returns Palestina where his mother Miriam and sister Tizrah (roles performed Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell respectively) are prisoned at Antonia fortress . This classic tale is added religious issues about Jesus life , as are described the pilgrimage , Mountain sermon , Passion , crucifixion and resurrection .Lavishly produced by Sam Zimbalist and uncredited Sol Siegel, the production cost MGM a massive $15 million and was a gamble by the studio to save itself from bankruptcy . Sensational main cast and enjoyable support actors such as Hugh Griffith as Sheik , Sam Jaffe as Simonides , Finlay Currie as Balthasar , John Le Mesurier as Doctor , Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate , Andre Morrel as Sextus and many others . Marvellously staged battle ships and a breathtaking chariot races . As the chariot race required 15,000 extras, on a set constructed on 18 acres of backlot at Cinecitta Studios outside Rome , eighteen chariots were built, with half being used for practice ; the race took five weeks to film and 15,000 extras were used . Three hundred sets, five years of research, and fourteen months of labor were required for the sets . The dialogue , colorful images , majestic set design from Edward Carfagno and William Horning , glamorous photography by Robert Surtees , evocative musical score combine to cast a spellbinding movie . Rousing soundtrack by the classical Miklós Rózsa who wrote the musical score over a period of nearly a year . His first-rate score deservedly won an Academy Award . The motion picture was stunningly realized by director William Wyler who took on the project because he wanted to do a Cecil B. DeMille type picture . Although William Wyler was Jewish, he particularly wanted to make a film that would appeal to all religious faiths . Wyler selected all the camera angles for the chariot race, but left all the details of its actual shooting in the hands of his second-unit directors Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt . Rating : 9 , extraordinary and awesome , it ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Epic"".There are numerous renditions based on Lee Wallace's Ben Hur , as stage version , classic MGM's mammoth silent version ¨Ben Hur¨ (1926) by Fred Niblo with Ramon Novarro; and this the remake Ben-Hur (1959) in which Stuntman Cliff Lyons worked as a stuntman/chariot driver in both Ben Hur (1925) and this one .

10.0,still a gigantic achievement in epic film-making,"What distinguishes Ben-Hur as a powerful film in epic scope is not simply that it is shot and stylized and acted and executed in action sequences to iconic effect (though there is that to a degree), but that it's human dimensions stay intimate in scope. I was expecting what I had heard about with Ben-Hur, and got that- the vengeance plot, the chariot race, a story of redemption with Christ as a background figure and major presence- but I wasn't expecting such things revealed like the devastation left on a family by leprosy, and the disintegration of one's morality by the cloud of vengeance on one's mind. Even if you're not much of a Christian (and even as a non-practicing Jew as I am), there are some deep chords that are struck with the material for an audience that is going in not expecting a lot of sermonizing. Only in the final reels, as we see first-hand the 'Christ' as he is sent to die on the cross, does the film get overbearing with the symbolism and heavy weight of the circumstance of this being a ""tale of the Christ.""This isn't to say also that with Judah Ben-Hur having the strife in coming to terms with his family being at first, he thinks, dead, and then later as made deformed thanks to the Roman's imprisonment, that this is all the film is. It's also grand spectacle, a film that takes you along on its epic ride with imagery that pierced the public consciousness so strongly that you've seen the scenes as parodies or referenced before you've even seen the film. Surely we have the chariot race to contend with, which has been so influential on modern action sequences and chases that Lucas copied most of the choreography for the pod race in Phantom Menace. And to give credit where it's due, you could show that same sequence in any theater today and it would unquestionably bring down the house, not just for its technical achievement but for the visceral impact (i.e. the downfall of Ben-Hur's rival by his own undoing).But there's also other great images; possibly my favorite are the scenes with Judah Ben-Hur as #41 among the rowing slaves, all moving at the whim of the drum beat. That in and of itself would make Ben-Hur a must-see. But then there are more emotionally impactive places and settings, like the valley of the lepers, Judah's struggle across the desert (and the tastefully done angle of Jesus' back only), many others that would take too long to mention. It's all so massive a production that it's almost TOO big (according to Charlton Heston the budget, at 14 million then as the most expensive film ever made, would today cost something like 250 million), and it's a credit to William Wyler that he never makes it too dull, even as supporting characters may verge on leaning to overacting. With only calling attention to it at certain moments (and sometimes not at all with a more subtle effect), Wyler is a virtuoso here in corralling all aspects of the production under his firm handle.And then there's Heston, who gives one of the very best of his (now late) career. He's full of bravura and gusto, and seems like a guy- for those guys who crave action film stars- who can get things done in the right mindset. But he's also excellent at conveying the tragedy of this character, a very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need to get his respite. Underneath all of that machismo and the swagger that eventually became old hat for Heston, is a strong presence at the helm of Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd, too, is also very good as the boyhood friend turned rival. In fact, most of the actors here are very good, from Hawkins to Hazareet to Jaffe to O'Donnel and so on, as they all contribute to the epic scope. It's massive and directly concerning the efforts of then Rabbi from Nazareth to bring peace and love to humanity. Despite it being not-too-thinly veiled religious fable (and not without a couple of things noticeable as parody in Life of Brian), Ben-Hur is a great success for its time, surviving today in good, not-too-dated tact.",still gigantic achievement epic film making,what distinguishes ben hur as powerful film epic scope is not simply that it is shot stylized acted executed action sequences iconic effect though there is that degree but that its human dimensions stay intimate scope i was expecting what i had heard about with ben hur got that vengeance plot chariot race story redemption with christ as background figure major presence but i wasnt expecting such things revealed like devastation left family by leprosy disintegration ones morality by cloud vengeance ones mind even if youre not much christian even as non practicing jew as i am there are some deep chords that are struck with material audience that is going not expecting lot sermonizing only final reels as we see first hand christ as he is sent die cross does film get overbearing with symbolism heavy weight circumstance this being tale christ this isnt say also that with judah ben hur having strife coming terms with his family being at first he thinks dead then later as made deformed thanks romans imprisonment that this is all film is its also grand spectacle film that takes you along its epic ride with imagery that pierced public consciousness so strongly that youve seen scenes as parodies or referenced before youve even seen film surely we have chariot race contend with which has been so influential modern action sequences chases that lucas copied most choreography pod race phantom menace give credit where its due you could show that same sequence any theater today it would unquestionably bring down house not just its technical achievement but visceral impact i e downfall ben hurs rival by his own undoing but theres also other great images possibly my favorite are scenes with judah ben hur as among rowing slaves all moving at whim drum beat that itself would make ben hur must see but then there are more emotionally impactive places settings like valley lepers judahs struggle across desert tastefully done angle jesus back only many others that would take too long mention its all so massive production that its almost too big according charlton heston budget at 14 million then as most expensive film ever made would today cost something like 250 million its credit william wyler that he never makes it too dull even as supporting characters may verge leaning overacting with only calling attention it at certain moments sometimes not at all with more subtle effect wyler is virtuoso here corralling all aspects production under his firm handle then theres heston who gives one very best his now late career hes full bravura gusto seems like guy those guys who crave action film stars who can get things done right mindset but hes also excellent at conveying tragedy this character very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need get his respite underneath all that machismo swagger that eventually became old hat heston is strong presence at helm ben hur stephen boyd too is also very good as boyhood friend turned rival fact most actors here are very good hawkins hazareet jaffe odonnel so as they all contribute epic scope its massive directly concerning efforts then rabbi nazareth bring peace love humanity despite it being not too thinly veiled religious fable not without couple things noticeable as parody life brian ben hur is great success its time surviving today good not too dated tact,0.4939878375592662,0.19530663780663782,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,One You Must See on the Big Screen,"Ben-Hur (1959) **** (out of 4)Winner of a whopping eleven Academy Awards, this epic religious tale is considered by many to be one of the greatest films ever made as it follows the Jewish Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who manages to overcome being thrown into slavery and eventually see the rise of Jesus Christ. I will admit right off the bat that I think there are some flaws in this movie and especially some ""down"" time after the ship attack and the start of the chariot race. I will also admit that I think the original 1925 silent has an overall better flow to it but there's certainly no way to deny the power of this film and not have your jaw on the floor from the mammoth production. There's no doubt that this film wanted to out-do the previously released epics and the size of the sets and the entire number of extras will just have you shaking your head wondering how any of it was done. Obviously, the film will always be remembered for its legendary chariot race, which still looks downright amazing all these decades later. You'll certainly be holding your breathe throughout the entire race and just the epic scale of this is just something we will never see again. The camera shots of the race taken over the statue's head remains some of the greatest scenes in movie history. It also doesn't hurt that we're given other great sequences including the ship attack but there are also some great quiet moments. One such moment happens when Heston's character falls down and his greeted with some water from a stranger. Another moment happens as we see a white figure on a hillside with people gathering around. There's no question that Heston makes this role his very own and the supporting cast is excellent as well. It should go without saying but the cinematography is some of the greatest you're ever going to see and the same can be said for the editing. BEN-HUR wowed people when it was released and it still manages to have that same power after all these years and that's really saying something.",one you must see big screen,ben hur 1959 out 4 winner whopping eleven academy awards this epic religious tale is considered by many be one greatest films ever made as it follows jewish ben hur charlton heston who manages overcome being thrown into slavery eventually see rise jesus christ i will admit right off bat that i think there are some flaws this movie especially some down time after ship attack start chariot race i will also admit that i think original 1925 silent has overall better flow it but theres certainly no way deny power this film not have your jaw floor mammoth production theres no doubt that this film wanted out do previously released epics size sets entire number extras will just have you shaking your head wondering how any it was done obviously film will always be remembered its legendary chariot race which still looks downright amazing all these decades later youll certainly be holding your breathe throughout entire race just epic scale this is just something we will never see again camera shots race taken over statues head remains some greatest scenes movie history it also doesnt hurt that were given other great sequences including ship attack but there are also some great quiet moments one such moment happens when hestons character falls down his greeted with some water stranger another moment happens as we see white figure hillside with people gathering around theres no question that heston makes this role his very own supporting cast is excellent as well it should go without saying but cinematography is some greatest youre ever going see same can be said editing ben hur wowed people when it was released it still manages have that same power after all these years thats really saying something,0.4863512949039264,0.2577652464494569,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,"The best of it is unsurpassed epic movie-making, but it's a message heavy movie","Ben-Hur (1959)Long. Epic. Beautiful.Is it also ponderous? Maybe--especially if you have seen other Biblical era epics (""Greatest Story"" or ""Spartacus"") or if you don't quite click with the material. Is it what you would call a good movie, or a great one? It has the credentials, including Best Picture. But it also is filled with secondary actors to support the dubious leading man, Charlton Heston (who gives one of the performances of his life, for sure, and has openly credited the director for that).The director is none other than the consummate professional, the ever-versatile and polished William Wyler. And he takes a huge story with grandiose necessities and makes it really watchable. And epic. And with cinematographer Robert Surtees (look at that man's film list!) it's certainly an exquisitely beautiful movie, and very very widescreen, shot with double sized 65mm film, the IMAX of its day.The story is of a Jewish man named Ben Hur who survives persecution from the Romans, including his boyhood friend, and becomes a master chariot driver and a believer in the peaceful ways of his contemporary, and upstart Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, the movie is supposedly about Prince Hur but in fact it's all aimed at illuminated Christ, always indirectly, but in the end with surprising power. We only see Jesus from behind, or from a distance, or in small part (his hand is shown nailed to the cross, for example), yet we feel his aura in the few scenes where his is present. His affect on Hur in their brief encounter is touching and pointed.We need to see that Hur himself is a kind of Christ figure, but a flawed one, a secondary man by comparison (which elevated the primary one further). Hur says early on that he rejects violence, which was not an especially contemporary attitude, especially as the Romans are occupying his home town. He then goes on to show mercy to the very people who want to abuse and kill him (that is, he turns the other cheek). He wins in the end not by killing, but by setting a good example, by being deeply good in the face of unfair hardship. It isn't clear he is a believer in particular, other than his deep rooted faith in his people, the Jews.Context matters here, just a decade or so after the defeat of the Nazis. The Romans are presented as the evil colonizing empire, greeting each other by raising their arms in what I grew up calling the ""Nazi salute."" Their colors and even their symbolism (a big eagle) are Nazi echoes. And the victims of the Nazis and the Romans equally are the Jews. Take this an important step further, and we see that there is a not-so-subtle subtext that the contemporary inhabitants of this area, recently named Israel, belong there. Hur even reminds his Roman friend to remember that the Jews lived there before the Romans ever came along.The movie works best as a story of power, of virtue, of Christian morality, of individual triumph. It also works as a visual and visceral epic. Scene after scene is stunning to just look at, and I'm sure in a big theater (remember going to movies in a full sized theater?) it was a true spectacle movie. We forget how important the venue is in ""getting"" the movie in spatial, visual terms (that's one reason Westerns survived so well into the 1950s and are not thriving now).The themes of love, romantic as well as family love, are important here but are thin, filled with empty clichés and total lack of chemistry (perhaps on purpose for a movie with religious intentions). The writing is solid but lacks magic. The editing might be faulted for being a bit indulgent at times, letting scenes roll for their pageantry when we might rather get moving. And ultimately the acting is often more functional than inspired. In a way I respect Heston for pulling off a role burdened with stiff archetypes of the wise hero. Many of the actors are doing their level best with a script that has a message, and you can't quite get the drama directly when the message is itching to be heard, too. Some of the acting is actually a hair lame (Cathy O'Donnell, who I adore in other movies like ""They Live by Night,"" is really awful once you notice her, which is really a casting problem more than anything).So I resort to nitpicking because somehow as wonderful and impressive as it all was and is, I wasn't swept away. It's not a completely gripping and moving film.Yes, there are ways of approaching this weighty classic other than saying its a dated religious picture or that it's a profound late-Golden Age masterpiece. It's neither, and both.

7.0,Weak with a couple of great set pieces and one great performance,"For a long while, I've described Ben-Hur as the biggest film that I had not yet seen. Now I have. This is one of those classics whose status has been fading with time, and it's no wonder once you've seen the film. Sure, there are a few scenes that are very memorable, and have become part of our common culture. Who can forget the scenes where Judah Ben-Hur is a slave in the galleys, rowing fiercely as the weaker slaves collapse around him? The music in this scene is what I find particularly memorable. And then there's the chariot race, which I think cements this film as one that is worth seeing more than any other. I also like how the story is constructed, as a side story to the life of Jesus. Christ pops up every once in a while. Early in the film, there is a memorable scene where Christ defies a Roman soldier and gives the parched Ben-Hur water. When the soldier tries to reprimand him, a quick look from Jesus silences him completely. Unfortunately, a whole hell of a lot of the film is very forgettable. Each scene seems to take 25% longer than it really needs to  not only are the scenes protracted far beyond their limitations, but the actors stumble slowly through their lines, as if each and every syllable was carrying the cross on its back. It gets old, and quick. The film has very little passion as it lumbers along. Most of the direction seems lackluster. Big, but mostly lacking heart. William Wyler directed one of the most emotionally touching films of all time, Mrs. Miniver, an utterly intimate affair that will stay with me forever. Ben-Hur often just sat there without trying to connect to the audience at all. The acting itself is generally weak. Charlton Heston's performance is certainly not among his best. I actually like him as an actor, but I don't think it's very good here. To be fair, his performance gets better as the film moves along. Ben-Hur's moral dilemma is intriguing, and as his desire for revenge and violence did ultimately touch me. Many of the other performances are just bad  the one that comes immediately to mind is Haya Harareet as Esther, the slave girl whom Ben-Hur loves and later marries. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell, who play his mother and sister respectively, are too dull to really care too much what happens to them. And I'm disappointed in Sam Jaffe, whom I love as an actor in films such as The Scarlet Empress and Gunga Din. I didn't even recognize him, he has so little energy in this film. Hugh Griffith won an Oscar for playing a sheik, but his character is not memorable at all. The only actor who really hits a home run is Stephen Boyd as Messala, Ben-Hur's childhood friend, now his bitterest enemy. He really projects his inner turmoil. Overall, I say that I am glad that I saw this finally. It may have not worked very well, but I was generally entertained. Not moved at all, but it was nice to watch (and a lot more fun to criticize!). Only the chariot sequence and a couple of Messala's scenes did anything more than that for me. 6/10.",weak with couple great set pieces one great performance,long while ive described ben hur as biggest film that i had not yet seen now i have this is one those classics whose status has been fading with time its no wonder once youve seen film sure there are few scenes that are very memorable have become part our common culture who can forget scenes where judah ben hur is slave galleys rowing fiercely as weaker slaves collapse around him music this scene is what i find particularly memorable then theres chariot race which i think cements this film as one that is worth seeing more than any other i also like how story is constructed as side story life jesus christ pops up every once while early film there is memorable scene where christ defies roman soldier gives parched ben hur water when soldier tries reprimand him quick look jesus silences him completely unfortunately whole hell lot film is very forgettable each scene seems take 25 longer than it really needs not only are scenes protracted far beyond their limitations but actors stumble slowly through their lines as if each every syllable was carrying cross its back it gets old quick film has very little passion as it lumbers along most direction seems lackluster big but mostly lacking heart william wyler directed one most emotionally touching films all time mrs miniver utterly intimate affair that will stay with me forever ben hur often just sat there without trying connect audience at all acting itself is generally weak charlton hestons performance is certainly not among his best i actually like him as actor but i dont think its very good here be fair his performance gets better as film moves along ben hurs moral dilemma is intriguing as his desire revenge violence did ultimately touch me many other performances are just bad one that comes immediately mind is haya harareet as esther slave girl whom ben hur loves later marries martha scott cathy odonnell who play his mother sister respectively are too dull really care too much what happens them im disappointed sam jaffe whom i love as actor films such as scarlet empress gunga din i didnt even recognize him he has so little energy this film hugh griffith won oscar playing sheik but his character is not memorable at all only actor who really hits home run is stephen boyd as messala ben hurs childhood friend now his bitterest enemy he really projects his inner turmoil overall i say that i am glad that i saw this finally it may have not worked very well but i was generally entertained not moved at all but it was nice watch lot more fun criticize only chariot sequence couple messalas scenes did anything more than that me 6 10,0.4982451499118166,0.14995287698412704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
