10.0,My Introduction To Satyajit Ray,"Even as the middle segment of a trilogy, this was my introduction to Satyajit Ray, turning me into an instant fan, and is one of the greatest films I've seen. The neo-realist leanness the film is completely absorbing & is perfectly matched to the characters. Not having been to India, I'll admit to being unsure of how true to reality the look of the film is, but Ray's gift for detail is in a league of its' own - I consider the opening scenes (establishing shots from Benares intercut with shots of young Apu running through narrow lanes) to be among cinema's most memorable moments, and a great example of allowing images and rhythm to tell a story. I don't want to overstate it, but this is a really beautiful, haunting film - from it's warmest to it's most tragic elements, I was thinking about it for quite a while afterwards. APARAJITO is obviously the work of a genuinely enthusiastic filmmaker, and also a great thinker as well - every cinephile should see it. Would love to see all of Ray's work available in the US, and on DVD.",my introduction satyajit ray,even as middle segment trilogy this was my introduction satyajit ray turning me into instant fan is one greatest films ive seen neo realist leanness film is completely absorbing is perfectly matched characters not having been india ill admit being unsure how true reality look film is but rays gift detail is league its own i consider opening scenes establishing shots benares intercut with shots young apu running through narrow lanes be among cinemas most memorable moments great example allowing images rhythm tell story i dont want overstate it but this is really beautiful haunting film its warmest its most tragic elements i was thinking about it quite while afterwards aparajito is obviously work genuinely enthusiastic filmmaker also great thinker as well every cinephile should see it would love see all rays work available us dvd,0.7007936507936507,0.34523809523809523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Superior Film-making,"Although Satajit Ray was to old, sick and spent to fully appreciate his special Oscar, it was to the Academy's credit that it finally did recognize this supreme artist.It's often been said that ""Aparajito"" is the lesser of the three film that comprise ""The Apu Trilogy."" I personally don't buy that. Here is a finely etched portrait of a young man as he leaves his primitive Indian village and widowed mother to better himself through education at a Calcutta University.The relationship between mother and son are beautifully presented, with their differing values representative of passing generations. The circumstances may be specific, while the story is universal.It is about the age-old tension between human choices and challenging environments, about the balancing of values in achieving one's heart's desires.The emotional fluctuations felt by both mother and son are sharply depicted, including the loss of one's parents as a unique, one-time experience. One must pick up the pieces and move on, as Apu does.Viewing ""Pather Panchali,"" ""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu"" in one continuous sequence is the proper way to get the full impact of this incredible piece of work.",superior film making,although satajit ray was old sick spent fully appreciate his special oscar it was academys credit that it finally did recognize this supreme artist its often been said that aparajito is lesser three film that comprise apu trilogy i personally dont buy that here is finely etched portrait young man as he leaves his primitive indian village widowed mother better himself through education at calcutta university relationship between mother son are beautifully presented with their differing values representative passing generations circumstances may be specific while story is universal it is about age old tension between human choices challenging environments about balancing values achieving ones hearts desires emotional fluctuations felt by both mother son are sharply depicted including loss ones parents as unique one time experience one must pick up pieces move as apu does viewing pather panchali aparajito world apu one continuous sequence is proper way get full impact this incredible piece work,0.5305900621118014,0.18737060041407871,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,Another Masterpiece from Ray,"'Aparajito', the second film of Satyajit Ray's brilliant 'Apu Trilogy', is one of the great masterpieces of film. The gritty realism melds expertly with the beautiful shot selection and cinematography. In fact, I would say Ray's India is presented at least as well as John Ford's American West.

Soon Apu asks his mother to study in the local school where he becomes a distinguished student. When Apu is a teenager, the headmaster offers a scholarship to him to study in Calcutta and her mother gives her savings to him to support his new life. Apu works at a printing press at night to support himself in Calcutta while his mother misses him. But soon he neglects his mother and the college. When he learns that his mother is sick, he returns to the village where she is to visit her, but it may be too late.""Aparajito"" is a realistic drama with the coming of age of Apu in a big city and the loneliness of his mother in a village in the poor Bengal countryside. The story is very simple but with great performances that give the sensation of a documentary. Apu's new life makes him forget his beloved mother and in the end he learns that parents do not live forever and he should have given more attention to her before it is too late.

,"Haunting, moving, enduring","This is one of the few films that, ever since first viewing, have reverberated daily in my consciousness--and no doubt on a subconscious level as well.If somebody wanted to acclaim ""Aparajito"" as the finest film ever made, I would not offer resistance, though of course that's a kind of meaningless claim to make. It's similar to calling Mozart the finest composer who ever lived--meaningless, yet somehow appropriate.See ""Aparajito"" and find out if you don't agree. This film can change the way you look at life and human interaction--forever.Only slightly weaker, in my opinion, is the first of the three films in this ""Apu Trilogy,"" ""Pather Panchali."" ""Pather Panchali"" may be even stronger than ""Aparajito"" in that it repeatedly reaches heart-wrenching emotional peaks with the slightest of cinematic means. Both films are testimony to the great human heart of Satyajit Ray, surely one of the masterful geniuses of any day, in any medium.I wish the third member of the trilogy, ""The World of Apu,"" lived up to the standard of the first two. Unfortunately, it's flawed by an excess of sentimentality and melodrama. Still a fine film by ordinary standards, it does fail when measured against its two masterful predecessors. But that's often the way in multi-volume works. All three films should be seen by anybody who considers film important as a means of human communication, or who cherishes learning about other cultures, or who simply feels in need of some affirmation of the occasional nobility of spirit and mysterious ways of the souls of ordinary human beings.",haunting moving enduring,this is one few films that ever since first viewing have reverberated daily my consciousness no doubt subconscious level as well if somebody wanted acclaim aparajito as finest film ever made i would not offer resistance though course thats kind meaningless claim make its similar calling mozart finest composer who ever lived meaningless yet somehow appropriate see aparajito find out if you dont agree this film can change way you look at life human interaction forever only slightly weaker my opinion is first three films this apu trilogy pather panchali pather panchali may be even stronger than aparajito that it repeatedly reaches heart wrenching emotional peaks with slightest cinematic means both films are testimony great human heart satyajit ray surely one masterful geniuses any day any medium i wish third member trilogy world apu lived up standard first two unfortunately its flawed by excess sentimentality melodrama still fine film by ordinary standards it does fail when measured against its two masterful predecessors but thats often way multi volume works all three films should be seen by anybody who considers film important as means human communication or who cherishes learning about other cultures or who simply feels need some affirmation occasional nobility spirit mysterious ways souls ordinary human beings,0.4827756327756328,0.05878378378378378,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"

10.0,continuation of a masterpiece,"Ray's 'Aparajito' continues with its second installment as we see the beautiful but harsh world through the eyes of 'Apu'. Ray's portrayal of Apu's innocence and curiosity during his maturation into adolescence was spectacular. However, the pinnacle of the film is heart wretching performance of Apu's Mother, whose portrayal of fretfulness, nurturing, and loneliness pulled at this reviewer's heart strings. Although this film is filled with moments of sadness and despair, this film is about Apu weathering the seemingly endless storm of personal tragedy and eventually reaching maturation.",continuation masterpiece,rays aparajito continues with its second installment as we see beautiful but harsh world through eyes apu rays portrayal apus innocence curiosity during his maturation into adolescence was spectacular however pinnacle film is heart wretching performance apus mother whose portrayal fretfulness nurturing loneliness pulled at this reviewers heart strings although this film is filled with moments sadness despair this film is about apu weathering seemingly endless storm personal tragedy eventually reaching maturation,0.65,0.21785714285714283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.21}"

8.0,Excellent,"The first film of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy, Pather Panchali, was such a great film that, naturally, the second film in the series was bound to suffer a bit of a let down. Thus, Aparajito (The Unvanquished)- based on the novel Aparajita, by Bibhutibhushan Banerjee, is not the unadulterated great piece of art that Pather Panchali is. Like many middle films of a series, it suffers from the infamous middle filmitis; when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters, the chronology of prior events, and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in.Aparajito falls into this trap, however, in a way different from your average Hollywood blockbuster film. Whereas most middle films feel a need to fall back on what already passed in a first film, Aparajito spends too much time ignoring the traits and actions that occurred in Pather Panchali; almost as if Ray wanted to sever connections between the two films. He achieves this by having the film's lead character, Apu, not being played by the child who portrayed him in the first film- Subir Banerjee. In this film, Apu is first played by Pinaki Sen Gupta, when ten; and later by Smaran Ghosal, when in hi slate teens. Two of the actors from the first film were retained: Kanu Banerjee as Harihar- Apu's father, and his wife Sarbajaya- still played by Karuna Banerjee. However, there has been a major personality shift in Sarbajaya- likely the only evidence of the death of Durga- Apu's older sister, from the first film. Whereas Sarbajaya was bossy and condescending in the first film- while also being loving, in this film she's timid and let's life play her; whereas in the first film she was restive, and dissatisfied with what life brought....The abrupt and disappointing ending is merely the most manifest sign of this tendency to rely on the fact that the viewer will have seen Pather Panchali. If coming to Aparajito on its own, most viewers will be a) lost, or b) more likely simply not as prone to care for either Sarbajaya nor Apu.That stated, this is an excellent film which, asides from the death scenes, contains excellent poesy and metaphors- such as a scene where Apu enters Calcutta on a train, holding a small globe, given to him as a gift by the headmaster at the school in his mother's employer's village. The film also makes good use of humor, such as scenes where the young Apu plays around with monkeys and bells, and later, as a student, in an English class, where he falls asleep (due to working a job and his studiousness) during a lecture on synecdoche and metonymy. It also has moments of universality, such as when the mother and son reacquaint after a long stay at school, and the first thing Sarbajaya says is that Apu has grown taller and doesn't appear to be eating well, despite the fact that neither is true. But, the film's greatest strength is its depiction of fortuity. Despite its flaws, Aparajito is a great what if? movie- had his sister and father not died early, would Apu have ended up in college? Had his mother not been emotionally devastated by both losses, would she have domineered her son into submission when he wanted to go abroad? All of his family's losses, and deaths- his auntie, his sister, his father, his mother, all serve Apu's benefit. In short, death has been very, very good for Apu- both in allowing him to grow and removing obstacles to his own self-fulfillment, which may be the most damning (and tangential) criticism of religion (and its fetishizing by religion) that Ray makes in this whole film (as well as in the first film).Like the domestic troubles and idiocies that abound in a typical Yasujiro Ozu film, which almost always transcends to the universal, Satyajit Ray's films seem to likewise contain personal and comic moments that all viewers, from any background, can relate to. The problem with Aparajito- especially in relation to Pather Panchali, is that- as far as domestic troubles go, the first film's were more existential and deeper in nature, making those suffered in Aparajito seem trivial by comparison. But, that is the trouble with comparing excellent art to great art- it always suffers by the comparison. On its own, Aparajito is an outstanding film, and, hopefully, provides merely a relatively weak link to a final film that is the equal of Pather Panchali, and one that shows Apu finally taking center stage in his titular trilogy's plight.",excellent,first film satyajit rays apu trilogy pather panchali was such great film that naturally second film series was bound suffer bit let down thus aparajito unvanquished based novel aparajita by bibhutibhushan banerjee is not unadulterated great piece art that pather panchali is like many middle films series it suffers infamous middle filmitis when films that are not first series rely too heavily upon audiences memories earlier films inform them traits characters chronology prior events general knowledge world film series is set aparajito falls into this trap however way different your average hollywood blockbuster film whereas most middle films feel need fall back what already passed first film aparajito spends too much time ignoring traits actions that occurred pather panchali almost as if ray wanted sever connections between two films he achieves this by having films lead character apu not being played by child who portrayed him first film subir banerjee this film apu is first played by pinaki sen gupta when ten later by smaran ghosal when hi slate teens two actors first film were retained kanu banerjee as harihar apus father his wife sarbajaya still played by karuna banerjee however there has been major personality shift sarbajaya likely only evidence death durga apus older sister first film whereas sarbajaya was bossy condescending first film while also being loving this film shes timid lets life play her whereas first film she was restive dissatisfied with what life brought abrupt disappointing ending is merely most manifest sign this tendency rely fact that viewer will have seen pather panchali if coming aparajito its own most viewers will be lost or b more likely simply not as prone care either sarbajaya nor apu that stated this is excellent film which asides death scenes contains excellent poesy metaphors such as scene where apu enters calcutta train holding small globe given him as gift by headmaster at school his mothers employers village film also makes good use humor such as scenes where young apu plays around with monkeys bells later as student english class where he falls asleep due working job his studiousness during lecture synecdoche metonymy it also has moments universality such as when mother son reacquaint after long stay at school first thing sarbajaya says is that apu has grown taller doesnt appear be eating well despite fact that neither is true but films greatest strength is its depiction fortuity despite its flaws aparajito is great what if movie had his sister father not died early would apu have ended up college had his mother not been emotionally devastated by both losses would she have domineered her son into submission when he wanted go abroad all his familys losses deaths his auntie his sister his father his mother all serve apus benefit short death has been very very good apu both allowing him grow removing obstacles his own self fulfillment which may be most damning tangential criticism religion its fetishizing by religion that ray makes this whole film as well as first film like domestic troubles idiocies that abound typical yasujiro ozu film which almost always transcends universal satyajit rays films seem likewise contain personal comic moments that all viewers any background can relate problem with aparajito especially relation pather panchali is that as far as domestic troubles go first films were more existential deeper nature making those suffered aparajito seem trivial by comparison but that is trouble with comparing excellent art great art it always suffers by comparison its own aparajito is outstanding film hopefully provides merely relatively weak link final film that is equal pather panchali one that shows apu finally taking center stage his titular trilogys plight,0.4982189793480117,0.1727628434886499,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,My favourite film of all time,"After watching Pather Panchali, I watched the sequel Aparajito the next day. My only criticism with the first film was the slow pace, but it looks like Satyajit Ray improved on this aspect for the sequel and thus eliminated any pacing issues I may have had with the original. This time the story moved along at a fairly quick pace, as we see months and sometimes years go by in a matter of minutes.Although I often hear about Pather Panchali being regarded as the best in the Apu Trilogy, I personally liked Aparajito even better than the first. The story was gripping throughout the entire film, Karuna Bannerjee gave a truly Oscar-worthy performance as Apu's mother (even though it was only her second film) and the ending was just as powerful as the original (although Pather Panchali had a more powerful theme music). In fact, I might even go as far as saying Aparajito could possibly be my favourite film of all time.10/10",my favourite film all time,after watching pather panchali i watched sequel aparajito next day my only criticism with first film was slow pace but it looks like satyajit ray improved this aspect sequel thus eliminated any pacing issues i may have had with original this time story moved along at fairly quick pace as we see months sometimes years go by matter minutes although i often hear about pather panchali being regarded as best apu trilogy i personally liked aparajito even better than first story was gripping throughout entire film karuna bannerjee gave truly oscar worthy performance as apus mother even though it was only her second film ending was just as powerful as original although pather panchali had more powerful theme music fact i might even go as far as saying aparajito could possibly be my favourite film all time 10 10,0.6567460317460317,0.2579365079365079,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Aparajito: Possibly The Best of The Apu's Trilogy,"Aparajito (The Unvanquished), second film in Apu's trilogy by Ray, is truly a masterpiece in the sense that it can still captivate any sensitive audience even after 56 years of its making and it can easily figure in any selected list of forever-classic films. The film unfolds a story of Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee), Sarbojoya (Karuna Bannerjee) and their child Apu (Pinaki Sengupta) living in the city of Banaras after leaving Nishchintapur (their ancestral village in Bengal) mainly due to the tragic death of their daughter Durga as shown in Pather Panchali, the first film of the Apu's trilogy. For earning, Harihar, who is a Brahmin reads the holy Hindu scriptures on the banks of holy Ganges to some Bengali widows who prefer to live in the holy city of Banaras after getting widowed. Sarbojoya is busy in her housework while Apu is spending most of his time by playing with his friends. But these moments of prosperity were cut short by the untimely death of Harihar after a brief illness. Sarbojoya was compelled to take the job of a cook in a wealthy Bengali family settled in Banaras. But to save her child from the inevitable slavery Sarbojoya left Banaras for Bengal to live in her uncle's house at Manasapota village. Apu started his study in the village school, fared very well and got a scholarship for the higher study in Calcutta. After much hesitation Sarbojoya gave his son (now played by Smaran Ghosal) the permission to pursue the higher study in Calcutta. Apu began his struggle in the city of Calcutta to pursue his study as well as earning money for the same and became busy in it. In the mean time Sarbojoya became seriously ill and died just before Apu's final examination. Apu comes back to the village only to retrieve his mother's belongings and then returned to the city again to appear for the examination with a promise to his grand-uncle to perform his mother's post-death rites (Shradhwa) in Calcutta. Aparajito or The Unvanquished is primarily a story of struggle between the tradition and progress first by Sarbojoya in Banaras and then by Apu. The film transcends its linear narrative style with Ray's majestic touches and excellent cinematography by Subrata Mitra. The way the film captured some fascinating glimpses of Banaras mainly through the eyes of Apu who plays and roams around the narrow and shabby lanes of Banaras, steep stairs on the banks of the river Ganges, old and squalid houses and sometimes in temples with the monkeys is truly beyond description. The depiction Harihar's death here with the groaning of Sarbojoya fit into the scene of suddenly dispersed pigeons on the banks of Ganges can fit among the best scenes of the Indian cinema. Some other unparalleled metaphors of the film include Apu's entry to the city of Calcutta with a geographic globe in his hand (meaning entry into the wider world), the English class in which the topic synecdoche is being taught and Apu falls asleep or in the last shot where Apu is heading for the city with his mother's last belongings and the sky is heavily overcast with the sounds of thunders indicating the Apu's severing of ties with the traditional occupation and journey to an uncertain and tumultuous world. The music by Ravi Shankar sublimed the whole film. Use of the Multani tune in flute of Pather Panchali to unravel the visualisation of the green landscape of Bengal in the shot when Sarbojoya and Apu are returning to Bengal is simply breathtaking.",aparajito possibly best apus trilogy,aparajito unvanquished second film apus trilogy by ray is truly masterpiece sense that it can still captivate any sensitive audience even after 56 years its making it can easily figure any selected list forever classic films film unfolds story harihar kanu bannerjee sarbojoya karuna bannerjee their child apu pinaki sengupta living city banaras after leaving nishchintapur their ancestral village bengal mainly due tragic death their daughter durga as shown pather panchali first film apus trilogy earning harihar who is brahmin reads holy hindu scriptures banks holy ganges some bengali widows who prefer live holy city banaras after getting widowed sarbojoya is busy her housework while apu is spending most his time by playing with his friends but these moments prosperity were cut short by untimely death harihar after brief illness sarbojoya was compelled take job cook wealthy bengali family settled banaras but save her child inevitable slavery sarbojoya left banaras bengal live her uncles house at manasapota village apu started his study village school fared very well got scholarship higher study calcutta after much hesitation sarbojoya gave his son now played by smaran ghosal permission pursue higher study calcutta apu began his struggle city calcutta pursue his study as well as earning money same became busy it mean time sarbojoya became seriously ill died just before apus final examination apu comes back village only retrieve his mothers belongings then returned city again appear examination with promise his grand uncle perform his mothers post death rites shradhwa calcutta aparajito or unvanquished is primarily story struggle between tradition progress first by sarbojoya banaras then by apu film transcends its linear narrative style with rays majestic touches excellent cinematography by subrata mitra way film captured some fascinating glimpses banaras mainly through eyes apu who plays roams around narrow shabby lanes banaras steep stairs banks river ganges old squalid houses sometimes temples with monkeys is truly beyond description depiction harihars death here with groaning sarbojoya fit into scene suddenly dispersed pigeons banks ganges can fit among best scenes indian cinema some other unparalleled metaphors film include apus entry city calcutta with geographic globe his hand meaning entry into wider world english class which topic synecdoche is being taught apu falls asleep or last shot where apu is heading city with his mothers last belongings sky is heavily overcast with sounds thunders indicating apus severing ties with traditional occupation journey uncertain tumultuous world music by ravi shankar sublimed whole film use multani tune flute pather panchali unravel visualisation green landscape bengal shot when sarbojoya apu are returning bengal is simply breathtaking,0.477125850340136,0.16381416202844776,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,Classic Masterpiece,"This is so much heart touching movie with extra ordinary acting. The acting of the mother of apurba by Karuna Bannerjee is marvelous. The relationship between mother and son, showing in the film is so much heart touching. I watched with my friend at 7 pm and before complete the movie i called the mom and again after completing i calling her twice. She wondered what happened to me !

8.0,"In a simple world, Apu lives a profound life and Satyajit Ray captures his Apu's transition wonderfully in Pather Panchali's sequel, Aparajito","The sun wakes up in the land of Benaras. An aged temple priest scatters seeds for the pigeons. Men take their morning dip in the holy river bordering a ghat (series of steps). Women wash their clothes in the same waters. A couple of pehelwans (wrestlers) exercise with gadas (heavy Indian club) close to the river banks. Priests sit close by sermonizing to their loyal devotees. Ships can be heard at a distance. It is morning. Have we never seen a morning like this? We probably have, at least most who live or have lived in India. Yet why do we watch this morning with a quaint fascination? This is because Satyajit Ray doesn't regard his morning sequence as an establishment shot as most directors would – his camera gazes with wonderment at how life begins in the land of Benaras, and that gives his morning a wholly distinctive identity. We find young Apu walking beside the ghat one morning, passing by the chanting priests and their devotees and stopping where a pehelwan is exercising. He fixedly gazes at the gada which the hefty pehelwan is swinging around his body, and then leaves. After his father's untimely demise, he reluctantly becomes a priest at the insistence of a male relative. But he seems to have little interest in this, as evident in a scene where he watches, in his priest's attire, a couple of young boys his age tumbling and gamboling happily at a distance and then follows them after ditching his dhoti. He watches as they enter a school and then at night asks his mother whether he can join the same school. Once he gets admission, he's found to be a bright student who can recite lok-geet (folk music) fluently, and we realize maybe his short stint as a priest did pay off well. Apu's world is simple, yet his life is profound. There isn't explicit symbolism anywhere yet but we know how symbolic each event in his journey is, as evident from the paragraph above. Moving to a big city like Benares from a tiny village like Nischindipur, living the city life shortly till the death of his father, moving to another village called Dewanpur, attending a school nearby and earning a scholarship, moving to Calcutta for further studies with little enthusiasm to return to the dismal village life are covered in Aparajito.Apu's thinking, values and priorities blossom as his life passes these phases; take a scene in the film where Apu, in his teens, watches a couple of street children performing but finds their act uninteresting and leaves. Had this been young Apu, he'd be very enthused by their performance and watched it till the end. Aparajito is Apu All Grown Up.His self-sacrificing mother Sarbajaya gives him all her hard-earned money so he can move to Calcutta, and she surrenders herself to a life of loneliness. Apu's priorities shift towards college studies and printing press work, and he only visits her once in every few months. Satyajit Ray uses still shots to capture her emotions and actress Karuna Banerjee's eyes speak volumes; her memorable 'Opu!' for calling Apu (Bengalis usually pronounce many of their words with an 'O' intonation) stayed with me long after the film ended. Apu's college life was probably the only sequence that impressed me less, only because I've already seen similar scenes in many other recent movies. But what matters at last is our strong attachment to Apu's world; we laugh with, weep for and find joy in watching his world. Part of the credit has to go to Ravi Shankar's enchanting score, dominated by sitar, flute and dholak, for creating the right mood for each scene. Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali and Aparajito give the pleasure of experiencing the same world through his eyes.

8.0,Ray's finest film?,"I am always a bit dismayed by the attention that Pather Panchali and Charulata command in discussions on Ray because while they are fine films, they do not account for Ray's cinema as a whole. In fact, I would resist from picking one or even three films that 'speak for Ray'- but I would be lying if I said I didn't have a favourite. Aparajito is a wonderful work of art, an extremely moving melodrama and a remarkably accurate portrayal of adolescence. Of course, it would be shameful to give all the credit to Ray. Bibhuti Bhusan Bandhyopadhaya's novels (Aparajito is adapted from the last part of Pather Panchali and the first half of Aparajito) are meticulously descriptive and Ray's success with the film owes much to the simplicity and honesty of his source. But there is something in Aparajito that belongs exclusively to the cinema - something that has to do with the the mixture of distance and intimacy in the movies, of identification and unfamiliarity. You want to feel like Aparajito is a film about you, but you secretly admit that it isn't, it cannot be - because you experience it outside yourself, in Ravi Shankar's beautiful music, in the photography that oscillates between banality and the deeply metaphoric, in the wonderful performances (especially by Karuna Bannerjee), and finally in Ray's masterful vision in putting it all together.

9.0,Brilliant,"A film that so completely immersed me into India that in a small way, I felt like I had travelled there. The cinematography from Subrata Mitra is gorgeous, and I found both artistry and great humanism in Satyajit Ray's direction. He continues the story of Apu and his family with his coming of age and going off to college, wanting to do more than follow in his father's footsteps as a local priest. It's always heartwarming to see someone craving knowledge, especially when they've got to work so hard to get an opportunity rather than having it handed to them, and that's the case with Apu. Tension comes from his mother, who supports him but is devastated by the 'empty nest,' and both Ray and the two primary actors (Karuna Banerjee as mom and Smaran Ghosal as the older Apu) do a fantastic job of bringing out emotions that are poignant and universal. On top of everything he's learned in school, Apu learns an important lesson in life in scenes that hit like a hammer.

9.0,Somewhat less powerful than its predecessor *SPOILERS*,"After having watched and fallen in love with Pather Panchali, I immediately rented its sequel, Aparajito. I did not get around to watching it until around a month later. Now I have, and I am a little disappointed. It is a very good film, to be sure. It's often moving and it is extraordinarily directed and acted. But I think my problem with it is that it had less fluidity. It seemed more like a collection of events than a complete story with an overriding theme. The beginning of the film works the best. Apu is still a child, and he enjoys his life. There are some great scenes of life in a Bengali city and it is always interesting to watch. After tragedy strikes, Apu and his family move to work for a rich woman. This part contains one really great scene, where Apu enters a school and is given books to read. It is an absolute joy to watch the boy learn and try to teach his mother what he has learned. Then there is a flash-forward to Apu as a young man. Now here is where I began to lose interest. First of all, the actor who plays the older Apu is downright ugly. Sorry to complain about such a petty thing, but this guy is just hard to look at, where the young Apu is the cutest child you're ever likely to see. The third part of the picture takes place in Calcutta, where Apu has gone to college. Unfortunately, although they ring true, the events in this part of the film are somewhat formulaic. Apu's mother experiences empty nest syndrome, and tries to make Apu feel guilty about it. Apu tries his hardest not to feel guilty about it. You know, the kind of stuff that does actually happen between a mother and child when college comes between them. Another tragedy strikes at the end of Aparajito, but by this point, having watched four death scenes in the first two films of the Apu Trilogy, it did not affect me very much. It should have, since the character who dies at the end of Aparajito is a well established and very well written character. I cared for this person, but was not affected at all when they passed on. Oh well. It still had some great moments. And I will definitely rent The World of Apu sometime soon. Maybe the main problem in Aparajito is that it feels like the center of a trilogy. It doesn't introduce anything new and it doesn't solve anything. I'll see soon how it all turns out. 8/10",somewhat less powerful than its predecessor spoilers,after having watched fallen love with pather panchali i immediately rented its sequel aparajito i did not get around watching it until around month later now i have i am little disappointed it is very good film be sure its often moving it is extraordinarily directed acted but i think my problem with it is that it had less fluidity it seemed more like collection events than complete story with overriding theme beginning film works best apu is still child he enjoys his life there are some great scenes life bengali city it is always interesting watch after tragedy strikes apu his family move work rich woman this part contains one really great scene where apu enters school is given books read it is absolute joy watch boy learn try teach his mother what he has learned then there is flash forward apu as young man now here is where i began lose interest first all actor who plays older apu is downright ugly sorry complain about such petty thing but this guy is just hard look at where young apu is cutest child youre ever likely see third part picture takes place calcutta where apu has gone college unfortunately although they ring true events this part film are somewhat formulaic apus mother experiences empty nest syndrome tries make apu feel guilty about it apu tries his hardest not feel guilty about it you know kind stuff that does actually happen between mother child when college comes between them another tragedy strikes at end aparajito but by this point having watched four death scenes first two films apu trilogy it did not affect me very much it should have since character who dies at end aparajito is well established very well written character i cared this person but was not affected at all when they passed oh well it still had some great moments i will definitely rent world apu sometime soon maybe main problem aparajito is that it feels like center trilogy it doesnt introduce anything new it doesnt solve anything ill see soon how it all turns out 8 10,0.5456618265993266,0.12157354797979797,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,aparajito,"While this film is generally thought to be the weakest link in the Apu chain, and I generally agree, it's a bit like saying that Ava Gardner's legs are her third best feature. I mean, they're still pretty spectacular, right? So what you have here is a timeless story of a youth emerging into manhood and, in the process, freeing himself, quite literally, from the thrall of his parents, especially that of his loving, too controlling mother. And while the story is well told, with magnificent set pieces, such as the life of the city of Benares which centers on the spirituality industry of the Ganges complete with competing holy men and constant immersions, and the sadness in the eyes and body language of Apu's mother once she realizes that she has lost him to the wider world being the two most indelible for me, there are undeniable lapses in writer director Satyajit Ray's story choices. The father's death, in my opinion, occurs too soon so that it lacks the dramatic impact it should have had and certain characters, like the lecherous neighbor in Benares and the kindly great uncle who rescues Apu and his mother after the dad dies, are woefully under explored, while too much time is given to Apu's college life in Kolkata and his friendship with a male student (another character not gone into with sufficient depth). And while these story lapses are not fatal or even harmful, when you compare them to the seamless flow of Ray's preceding film, ""Panther Panchali"", where there is not a single scene or character wasted, you can see why film critics at the time were not as impressed with this second installment in the triptych. For me, however, the biggest disappointment has nothing to do with the foregoing story problems but is centered around the fact that I will no longer get to see the magnificent Karuna Banarjee turn in one of the great performances of all time as perhaps the most maddeningly poignant cinema mom of all time.

I have been watching a lot of Satyajit Ray films lately, and wondering at how he managed to create such different atmospheres in each of them, and leaving a touch of his own self in each. The story is a fairly depressing one, and yet there are moments of delightful optimism within the lead characters. The two boys playing Apu at different ages are both very convincing in their roles, but Karuna Banerjee's performance seals the deal for me. The way she has used her dialogues and her silence to bring out the emotions felt by her character and the interactions she has with her on-screen son, have been truly remarkable. The run-time is about an hour and 45 minutes but this movie will stay with you.There have been many poignant moments in this movie, but one which is most hard-hitting is where a critical point in the film is signified with a shot of a flock of pigeons flying away against the beautiful backdrop of the river Ganges - powerful!

As said,I prefer ""Pather Panchali"" to this one and it is because of the element of surprise and characters that is better and broader worked out in the first movie.Still,some great scenes are in ""Aparajito"" for instance the scenes in which Apu's mother Sarbojaya,again a great role by Karuna Bannerjee,awaits her son's arrival from the University of Calcutta by train.The use of the arrival of the train in the distance is very well done and has a significant role in all three films.The joy and sorrow is very closely linked in ""Aparajito"",the joy that Apu gets for getting the chance to study in Calcutta causes the sorrow of his mother who becomes lonely and eventually dies alone.The final shot of the movie resembles quite a lot the last shot of ""Pather Panchali"",only now Apu is going away from the country on his own.Also of lesser quality is the music of Ravi Shankar,although it is a very good soundtrack.I still very much prefer the music of ""Pather Panchali"".A very good movie and although I haven't seen ""Apur Sansar"" yet(I will do so tonight since I rented all three movies) I can't quite say yet which one is the best although one could very easily say that all three movies combine as one film about life,family and humanism.

10.0,"Unvanquished, simply","Aparajito (The Unvanquished) is the second part of Satyajit Ray's ""Apu Trilogy"" – the three films chronicling the life of Apu from his childhood to adulthood.Aparajito begins with Apu as a teenager and culminates with him in his youth. This journey is arduous for him, riddled with pitfalls and puzzles. And Ray attempts to portray how Apu triumphs all hurdles, setbacks and sorrows. Or maybe, ""triumph"" would be too sweeping a statement. Aparajito, as the title suggests, is more about weathering storms than storming forts. Apu's spirit and relentless struggle finds him walking past tragedies and setbacks and hold his own in unknown battlegrounds.Like its predecessor, Aparajito is brilliant, in its images and its artists, and the master, Ray, takes the viewer with him onwards in the journey of Apu, till the final installment of the trilogy.",unvanquished simply,aparajito unvanquished is second part satyajit rays apu trilogy three films chronicling life apu his childhood adulthood aparajito begins with apu as teenager culminates with him his youth this journey is arduous him riddled with pitfalls puzzles ray attempts portray how apu triumphs all hurdles setbacks sorrows or maybe triumph would be too sweeping statement aparajito as title suggests is more about weathering storms than storming forts apus spirit relentless struggle finds him walking past tragedies setbacks hold his own unknown battlegrounds like its predecessor aparajito is brilliant its images its artists master ray takes viewer with him onwards journey apu till final installment trilogy,0.6174603174603175,0.14444444444444446,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.39}"
