8.0,What's the most money you ever lost on a coin toss?,"Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile.

10.0,A Look into an Abyss,"I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.What are Anton Chigurh's true motives? Does he have a philosophical doctrine that we the audience are unaware of or are just unable to comprehend? What Anton does is create a lot of questions that arise from his actions and his interactions with the other characters. To watch a character as odd as him is fascinating and I cannot give enough credit to Javier Bardem in portraying such a character that is so enigmatic and just his presence alone is able to evoke so much mystery. Even though Anton is very incomprehensive, it is all made up for by being able to be somehow captivated by him.How every character deals with Anton is interesting, to say the least and as the film progresses, the feeling of despondency increases gradually. The lack of heroes is what gives this film its sense of hopelessness and that feeling of hopelessness is basically set in stone from the first few shots coupled with Tommy Lee Jone's epic voice-over narration in introducing the story. It is the perfect introduction to what we will witness in the story and what it all means for a sheriff like him in comprehending these events. As the events occur, we the audience reflect on these situations just as much as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this role is impressive and is injected with a great sense of humanity. I commend his portrayal as Bell, in that he is the character who carries the weight of the story.The acting is a huge fragment in bringing this film to life, but what also does that is how the visuals are executed and it is definitely utilized to a great effect. From its majestic shots to its beautiful lighting and color tones, the Coen brothers set a mood that permeates the whole film. Its barren settings really add a feeling of desolation that is at the same time hypnotic and surreal. While the film can be suspenseful and its suspense is definitely executed perfectly, the film still somehow manages to maintain an air of mystique. The non-existence of a soundtrack really gives the film a feeling of loneliness, all the while adding an even greater sense of sterility to its already barren wasteland.I can go on and on about the great acting, its memorable shots and its great script, but what makes 'No Country' a great film is that it manages to be truly idiosyncratic in its execution just like how the Coen Brothers' other great films are. Even if a film like this leaves me more questions than answers, if it still manages to captivate me to a point that I'm willing to return to it, then that shows that it doesn't matter if I don't have any answers to my questions. There are only a few films that are able to pull this off naturally and 'No Country for Old Men' is definitely one of those special films that can do just that.",look into abyss,i expect film like no country old men be polarizing some especially if theyre expecting big finale with good guy bad guy drawing their guns end settle score no country old men is film that dabbles more existentialism despite all crime that occurs basically what im saying is that film adapted novel is very unconventional not only its genre but also its approach storytelling what coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements creating something with its own unique character while there are subtle throwbacks old wild west story takes place modern society where technology has advanced society has advanced unfortunately crime has too what are anton chigurhs true motives does he have philosophical doctrine that we audience are unaware or are just unable comprehend what anton does is create lot questions that arise his actions his interactions with other characters watch character as odd as him is fascinating i cannot give enough credit javier bardem portraying such character that is so enigmatic just his presence alone is able evoke so much mystery even though anton is very incomprehensive it is all made up by being able be somehow captivated by him how every character deals with anton is interesting say least as film progresses feeling despondency increases gradually lack heroes is what gives this film its sense hopelessness that feeling hopelessness is basically set stone first few shots coupled with tommy lee jones epic voice over narration introducing story it is perfect introduction what we will witness story what it all means sheriff like him comprehending these events as events occur we audience reflect these situations just as much as sheriff ed tom bell tommy lee jones performance this role is impressive is injected with great sense humanity i commend his portrayal as bell that he is character who carries weight story acting is huge fragment bringing this film life but what also does that is how visuals are executed it is definitely utilized great effect its majestic shots its beautiful lighting color tones coen brothers set mood that permeates whole film its barren settings really add feeling desolation that is at same time hypnotic surreal while film can be suspenseful its suspense is definitely executed perfectly film still somehow manages maintain air mystique non existence soundtrack really gives film feeling loneliness all while adding even greater sense sterility its already barren wasteland i can go about great acting its memorable shots its great script but what makes no country great film is that it manages be truly idiosyncratic its execution just like how coen brothers other great films are even if film like this leaves me more questions than answers if it still manages captivate me point that im willing return it then that shows that it doesnt matter if i dont have any answers my questions there are only few films that are able pull this off naturally no country old men is definitely one those special films that can do just that,0.5386497064579255,0.24359099804305284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"

8.0,No Country For Old Men - Explanation - Spoilers,"The meaning of Sheriff Bell's dream was that he was ashamed of himself because his fear of death prevented him from doing his duty. In other words: Ed knew the criminal was in the motel room, but his fear of death prevented him from doing his job, which, in this case, was to die honorably in the line of duty.He interprets this moral failure as a desecration of the legacy of his father.This is contrast with the moral failure of Anton: Anton killed the woman who refused to play his coin game, which forced him to assume the moral responsibility for murdering her. This incident is immediately followed with Anton's car accident, which represents him being punished by God and forced to rely on the charity of others for survival. This is why Anton demands the kid take the money in exchange for the shirt - because he recognizes that he's being punished (i.e. he recognizes the charitable symbol and that he doesn't deserve charity) which is an indirect admission of guilt.",no country old men explanation spoilers,meaning sheriff bells dream was that he was ashamed himself because his fear death prevented him doing his duty other words ed knew criminal was motel room but his fear death prevented him doing his job which this case was die honorably line duty he interprets this moral failure as desecration legacy his father this is contrast with moral failure anton anton killed woman who refused play his coin game which forced him assume moral responsibility murdering her this incident is immediately followed with antons car accident which represents him being punished by god forced rely charity others survival this is why anton demands kid take money exchange shirt because he recognizes that hes being punished i e he recognizes charitable symbol that he doesnt deserve charity which is indirect admission guilt,0.31346153846153846,-0.12756410256410255,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,Some Interesting Characters,"While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. ""No Country For Old Men"" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.""No Country For Old Men"" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.",some interesting characters,while hunting trip sportsman josh brolin finds dead men stash cash remote back country west texas result drug deal gone wrong greedy hunter takes cash but soon discovers that resourceful criminal responsible drug deal outlaw named anton chigurh javier bardem has way tracking loot hunter thus finds that he is hunted meanwhile aging texas sheriff named ed tom bell tommy lee jones is after both sportsman chigurh story is set early 1980s some extent this film is character study sheriff bell honest lawman who is wise observant grounded reality has long memory no country old men is really his story he doesnt know quite what make drug war that has crossed over mexico into texas its something new 1980s it makes land that has always been hostile settlers even more hostile dangerous films premise is quite simple story is straightforward with minimal twists lot time care are taken with procedural actions loading gun dressing bloody wound constructing pole retrieve package air vent example dialogue is minimal theres lots silence overall casting acting are impressive i especially liked performance tommy lee jones who seemed natural choice role sheriff javier bardem josh brolin are also well cast several minor roles are extremely well performed like store owner who is asked call coin toss rotund lady who with dour face defies chigurhs requests characteristic texas twang films color cinematography is quite good there are lots sweeping wide angle outdoor shots i really enjoyed geographic setting with that whistling west texas wind silence stunning vistas its landscape that is starkly beautiful yet despite its beauty wilderness traits it can quickly turn hostile unforgiving anyone unprepared its hidden risks no country old men is fine film id describe it as chase story character study combo with elements noir especially visuals violence may be tad much some viewers but given subject matter it is entirely appropriate,0.520909582841401,0.15196280991735533,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair.,"No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor. More than this, it's also about as good a morality play as one could ask for, because it plays and tools and makes very serious questions about what is moral, or what isn't, or what is so ambiguous that it's all up to the toss of a coin or a chance ride out of town. There are a few interpretations to Bardem's character Anton that could be taken, but one thing is certain- he's less a symbol than a real presence, a ""ghost"" as Jones's sheriff calls him that can come around at the drop of a pin, usually in the dark, and strike the utmost fear (or confusion if you're a clerk) in the hearts of men and women. You'll never look at a coin toss the same way again. Or an air-gun. Or fixing a bullet wound in a leg. Or a hunt at a motel. Or even the aftermath of a car crash.But at the same time it's the purest time of cinema, recalling Hitchcock and Leone and Welles's Touch of Evil and the best of noir and westerns. There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could- you can't look at his eyes, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what professional who can say), which occasional tear- and it's obviously worthy of an Oscar. And Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally ""emote"". Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.It's gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense (I clenched many a knuckle during some scenes), surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner not seen by the Coens in many years, and artistically fashioned to a beat that is meditative (watch the opening moments with Jones's voice-over), simple, and doomed. It's beautiful and terribly tragic, for McCarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest to his material- even if you haven't read the book itself the Road will give an indication of the mood and atmosphere at hand- and at the moment I can't think of any other film that would be the best pick of the year- maybe one of the best films I've ever seen.",you need call it i cant call it you it wouldnt be fair,no country old men is as exceptional mix two creative talents coen brothers joel ethan coen author cormac mccarthy recent winner pulitzer road his own masterpiece as one could imagine as they converge story that lessor hands would be just b movie story concerns average joe out hunting one day texas who comes across bunch dead bodies heroin satchel with 2 million cash he takes it but without knowing that true embodiment psychopath javier bardem is his trail as he evades him it becomes more more clear fatalism that lies store as weathered sheriff tommy lee jones is also trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking his stolid demeanor more than this its also about as good morality play as one could ask because it plays tools makes very serious questions about what is moral or what isnt or what is so ambiguous that its all up toss coin or chance ride out town there are few interpretations bardems character anton that could be taken but one thing is certain hes less symbol than real presence ghost as joness sheriff calls him that can come around at drop pin usually dark strike utmost fear or confusion if youre clerk hearts men women youll never look at coin toss same way again or air gun or fixing bullet wound leg or hunt at motel or even aftermath car crash but at same time its purest time cinema recalling hitchcock leone welless touch evil best noir westerns there are so many exceptional shots lighting so much depth perception characters through mis en scene so much tension that through this its all up actors make or break near perfection that is mccarthy source bardem embodies anton like no other could you cant look at his eyes often steel cold horrifically professional what professional who can say which occasional tear its obviously worthy oscar josh brolin tommy lee jones are also fantastic we see brolin often midst action scene moment save your life going one can finally see actor his caliber completely breaking out role that doesnt require him ever totally emote jones other hand gives compassionate turn film thats about struggles desperate men land without law order hes gone through so much that it comes out completely his voice eyes sorrowful but holding back he reaches level connection with character that makes fugitive look like simpleton tv kelly mcdonald who plays llelands wife is also excellent when called upon especially crucial scene later film its gut wrenching bleak violent super tense i clenched many knuckle during some scenes surprisingly funny darkly comic manner not seen by coens many years artistically fashioned beat that is meditative watch opening moments with joness voice over simple doomed its beautiful terribly tragic mccarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest his material even if you havent read book itself road will give indication mood atmosphere at hand at moment i cant think any other film that would be best pick year maybe one best films ive ever seen,0.5424908424908425,0.12836080586080584,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Coens firing on all cylinders. Brilliant.,"If this doesn't end my year in the top two films of the year then we are in for one hell of an awesome year of movies.The new film from two of the best filmmakers working today No Country For Old Men shows the talents of the Coen Brothers on top form. After a couple of disappointments (Intolerable Cruelty had flashes of Coen genius but felt more of a Coen imitation than the real thing; Ladykillers had the odd funny moment but was the blandest film the brothers ever made, and there's just no excusing Marlon Wayans!) they knock this violent western drama out of the park.More in the vein of their superb early mostly-serious efforts Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing (my personal favourite of the Coen back catalogue) No Country For Old Men is a slow-moving, character-driven masterpiece about uncompromising and uncompromised characters. It is very violent and bloody and not always for the squeamish.Shot through with moments of humour these come, as in life, from real situations and observations so don't be fooled into thinking this will be the serious film with goofy-characters Coens of Fargo. No Country For Old Men is a tough, gritty story.The unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills.Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. And, yes, I have seen The Sea Inside and he in superb in that but here he is simply extraordinary. It is a portrayal of unrelenting evil, of true derangement, of a human being with no shreds of humanity that ranks at the very top of studied film psychopaths. And I say film not movie because this is not a clichéd character. This is not a character whose lunacy you enjoy over popcorn. This is one of the most frightening performances ever committed to celluloid. I felt truly nervous of what was going to happen every time he walked on screen.Josh Brolin essentially carries the bulk of the movie and he is excellent in a role that challenges him. I have never seen him perform to this level and if Bardem didn't steal the film you'd be talking about Brolin all the way home. As it is this gives him a showcase for his talents that should see him get a lot more attention.Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly but to great effect. Sounding more like Michael Parks than ever before his scenes pepper the movie with a wearied view on a world he doesn't really like or understand to great effect.I did find Stephen Root a little distracting as i have never seen him in a serious role before and he just looks amusing but he is in very little.Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking as usual and the Coens' script is superbly crafted. There are moments, almost asides from the main plot, that would be superfluous in most scripts and excised in most studio films but which work perfectly in the overall context of the movie as only the Coens can achieve. One scene featuring Bardem in a gas station is up there with the best scenes i have ever seen on film.I have not gone into the plot here because I saw this film having not read Cormac McCarthy novel and knowing little other than the basic log-line - a man out hunting comes upon a scene of dead bodies, guns, drugs and money on the Mexican border and comes to the attention of both those behind the scene and a local world-wearied sheriff - and i think that's the way to see this film.Go in knowing as little as you can but knowing at least this: this is a serious, violent, slow-paced character piece from the Coens. This is not a Fargo. If you are squeamish don't see it. If you have a short-attention span don't see it. If you only love the Coens for their fantastic comedies like O Brother and Big Lebowski and the comedy/thriller Fargo don't see it. But if you want to see an intelligent, superbly acted, powerful, beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it, see it, see it. It's a masterpiece.

8.0,A hauntingly flawed unconventional masterpiece,"Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed.

1.0,Despicable Snuff Film with Pseudo-Intellectual Pretensions,"""No Country for Old Men"" is for the kind of film fan who remarks, ""Gee, wasn't that murder a clever mise-en-scene?"" and who asks, ""What kind of lens do you think they used in that strangulation shot?"" The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.One of many completely implausible scenes: an arresting officer, defying any logic, turns his back on Chigurh. Chigurh, displaying the supple sinuosity of a Cirque du Soleil contortionist, or an orangutan, slips out of his handcuffs. This is done out of camera view, because for Bardem it would be impossible; thus the scene's implausibility. Chigurh then, in real time, strangles the young police officer to death on camera. This is an extended sequence. This is the payoff for ""No Country for Old Men"": watching one human being kill other human beings, in scene after scene after scene, using various weapons, including a captive bolt pistol usually used on livestock. Guess Chigurh couldn't get hold of a Texas chainsaw. This is a slasher flick for the pretentious.Early on, there are well-done, if standard, chase scenes. A man outruns a car: not believable, but fun to watch. A pit bull chases this fleeing man down a whitewater river. The man reloads his gun at the very last moment (of course) and shoots the pit bull dead just as it is about to sink its teeth into the man. Later, in a hotel, a beeping transponder informs the killer where his prey hides. Your pulse may race and you may think that this is all leading up to something interesting. You will be disappointed.Tommy Lee Jones, whose ear lobes appear to be metastasizing as he ages, wanders aimlessly through the film as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, delivering cornpone, homespun, cowboy poet ruminations that are more or less opaque in meaning. No doubt the film's fans are even now feverishly compiling a companion volume that decodes Bell's dreams and conveys their depth.Woody Harrelson, late the bartender of the TV sitcom ""Cheers,"" shows up for a completely pointless half-hour role that yanks the viewer right out of the movie. ""What is Woody Harrelson doing here?"" Some years back, some bored English majors decided that conventional narrative structure was not intellectual enuf, and decided to play games with narrative. ""No Country for Old Men"" plays these sorts of games. The viewer is invited to invest time getting to know characters who are eliminated from the plot in ways that convey no meaning and are not moving. The narrative flow is truncated and yet the movie keeps going; viewers ask themselves why the movie is continuing -- sometimes out loud, even in a movie theater -- this is supposed to be a deep, intellectual experience. It is not. It is merely annoying.Other than bratty English major head games, pretty much the entire substance of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a series of murders and tortures committed by Chigurh, who may symbolize your high school's worst bully  a bully so terrifying exactly because he targeted English majors. His victims are often courteous; their likability makes watching them be humiliated and then murdered an uncomfortable, and, given the film's structure, ultimately pointless exercise. Not only are the Coen Brothers torturing their characters, they also torment their ticket-buying audiences.Chigurh's nice victims are often poor, rural, Southern, whites, the kind of people often not featured as positive, lead characters in Hollywood entertainments. They are often villains  witness films like ""Deliverance."" Here they are murder victims. Chigurh is associated with Mexicans, part of a rising ""dismal tide,"" as one Anglo character puts it. No matter how you feel about immigration, you may find this association of Mexicans with a rising tide of evil to be offensive.The film's boosters insist that the movie offers three deep and shocking lessons: life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure; evil often triumphs; and the old days were more peaceful and, nowadays, things are getting really bad. In truth, everyone walking in to the theater already knows the first two ""lessons."" No one needs the Coen brothers to inform him that life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure, or that evil often triumphs. We expect filmmakers, and all artists, to offer us a more substantial thesis. As for the third ""lesson,"" that the old days were more peaceful and things are getting really bad today -- have the Coens, or Cormac McCarthy, heard of Attila the Hun, or any number of other less-than-peaceful and courteous personages from our common human past? One might well be dubious about ""No Country""'s ""lessons."" Visit internet discussion boards devoted to this movie, and you will find fans asking, not ""What is fate?"" or ""What is the role of a good man in a bad world?"" but questions like, ""If Hannibal Lector and Anton Chigurh were locked in a room, who would come out alive?"" Given such reflections, one is safe in concluding that the appeal of this film is its emphasis on graphic violence, rather than on any more advanced intellectual or artistic merit.",despicable snuff film with pseudo intellectual pretensions,no country old men is kind film fan who remarks gee wasnt that murder clever mise en scene who asks what kind lens do you think they used that strangulation shot skeleton no country old men is cheap 78 minute gun monster chase b movie javier bardem plays anton chigurh monster he is frankenstein he is max cady cape fear he is your childhood nightmares he may be death personified one many completely implausible scenes arresting officer defying any logic turns his back chigurh chigurh displaying supple sinuosity cirque du soleil contortionist or orangutan slips out his handcuffs this is done out camera view because bardem it would be impossible thus scenes implausibility chigurh then real time strangles young police officer death camera this is extended sequence this is payoff no country old men watching one human being kill other human beings scene after scene after scene using various weapons including captive bolt pistol usually used livestock guess chigurh couldnt get hold texas chainsaw this is slasher flick pretentious early there are well done if standard chase scenes man outruns car not believable but fun watch pit bull chases this fleeing man down whitewater river man reloads his gun at very last moment course shoots pit bull dead just as it is about sink its teeth into man later hotel beeping transponder informs killer where his prey hides your pulse may race you may think that this is all leading up something interesting you will be disappointed tommy lee jones whose ear lobes appear be metastasizing as he ages wanders aimlessly through film as sheriff ed tom bell delivering cornpone homespun cowboy poet ruminations that are more or less opaque meaning no doubt films fans are even now feverishly compiling companion volume that decodes bells dreams conveys their depth woody harrelson late bartender tv sitcom cheers shows up completely pointless half hour role that yanks viewer right out movie what is woody harrelson doing here some years back some bored english majors decided that conventional narrative structure was not intellectual enuf decided play games with narrative no country old men plays these sorts games viewer is invited invest time getting know characters who are eliminated plot ways that convey no meaning are not moving narrative flow is truncated yet movie keeps going viewers ask themselves why movie is continuing sometimes out loud even movie theater this is supposed be deep intellectual experience it is not it is merely annoying other than bratty english major head games pretty much entire substance no country old men is series murders tortures committed by chigurh who may symbolize your high schools worst bully bully so terrifying exactly because he targeted english majors his victims are often courteous their likability makes watching them be humiliated then murdered uncomfortable given films structure ultimately pointless exercise not only are coen brothers torturing their characters they also torment their ticket buying audiences chigurhs nice victims are often poor rural southern whites kind people often not featured as positive lead characters hollywood entertainments they are often villains witness films like deliverance here they are murder victims chigurh is associated with mexicans part rising dismal tide as one anglo character puts it no matter how you feel about immigration you may find this association mexicans with rising tide evil be offensive films boosters insist that movie offers three deep shocking lessons life doesnt always follow neat narrative structure evil often triumphs old days were more peaceful nowadays things are getting really bad truth everyone walking theater already knows first two lessons no one needs coen brothers inform him that life doesnt always follow neat narrative structure or that evil often triumphs we expect filmmakers all artists offer us more substantial thesis as third lesson that old days were more peaceful things are getting really bad today have coens or cormac mccarthy heard attila hun or any number other less than peaceful courteous personages our common human past one might well be dubious about no country s lessons visit internet discussion boards devoted this movie you will find fans asking not what is fate or what is role good man bad world but questions like if hannibal lector anton chigurh were locked room who would come out alive given such reflections one is safe concluding that appeal this film is its emphasis graphic violence rather than any more advanced intellectual or artistic merit,0.4773838243741156,-0.007326139340702432,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.48}"

10.0,"Old Man, That Is","Fargo II: The Country of Old Man could've been the title and that would be cool since it had no continuity with the Cohen's other film.I loved, LOVED, No Country for Old Men. And I'm not even a western kind of guy. Before you squint, this is truly a western.The movie is not modern day. The film deals with multiples of outlaws and firearms. And it's even set in Texas. It contains all an old-west feel with twists of many story lines.This Best Picture winner has so many story lines, in fact, that it's hard to nail a synopsis on it. Suffice to say, it's about a drug deal that went wrong, a man who takes advantage of it, a psycho who's smarter than the average robber, a cop on the way out and so much more. I've already given too much away. But, I will say, this is a gem that appreciates in value and cinematography.Some might have a problem with the finale. Or even all the events leading up to the closing. I am not one of those people.

10.0,It's a hard world for little things ...,"With its fatalistic resonance, the quote, used by the Coen brothers in ""Raising Arizona"" and borrowed from ""The Night of the Hunter"" could almost work as a subtitle for ""No Country for Old Men""And any critic toward 2007' Best Picture Winner, is irremediably confronted to that opening ""No"" summarizing everything the film stands for: nothing. The Coens brothers made fun of nihilists in ""The Big Lebowsky"" gave the word an entire new dimension here, thrilling like a dream and haunting like a nightmare. Indeed, in this film, it's not the night, but the ""Nightmare of the Hunter"".But I'll be honest, I didn't get it the first time I saw it, but I give myself the benefit of the doubt since I was 25 at that time, and I think I was intelligent enough to grasp the film's concept. And indeed, I saw it again yesterday, 5 days before my 32nd birthday, and I didn't get it more than the first time; except that I started looking at the so-called flaws with more comprehensive eyesI remembered the words I choose to title my review of ""Shane"", an old-fashioned and traditional Western classic, ""the unseen and the unspoken elevate it to its iconic status"". This description also works for ""No Country for Old Men"", except that the unseen is what divided opinions the most, it's for what we didn't see that some believed this movie had more a lot to say than what its first acts presented, but it's also why the rest felt betrayed and dismissed it as a pretentious attempt of making art for the sake of it.But let's get back to the film. There are three men that fate reunited (although they'll never meet), each one is in one side of what we, humble mortals, call morality. There's Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones, an old timer contemplating the degeneration of humanity through the peaks of barbarity crimes had reached. But we can't be fooled, surely he belongs to a time where lynching, rapes and horrific crimes prevailed, he's not too old but too good and goodness and strength don't form quite an efficient pair.On the other side, there's the one who elevated the film to its iconic status, Anton Chigurh (Oscar-winning Javier Bardem) the most impacting movie villain since Hannibal Lecter. He's dark, tall, looking even bigger thanks to a meticulous camera work, has a deep authoritative voice and an ominous aura above his shoulder, like a real-life Darth Vader. He would indeed look like Darth Vader from behind with his weird haircut. And there's his inseparable oxygen tank hiding under an everyday banality, a spectacularly deadly weapon. Anyway, in vileness department, Anton means business. And in the course of his morbid odyssey, he'll meet friendly people from the American side of Rio Grande, and many of them will pay the biggest price to their encounter, a price that can be worth a quarter sometimes. Anton reminded me of a story about a king who was so cruel that when he surprised one of his slaves mocking him in public, he then told him the worse punishment had to come. What did he do? Nothing, and that was even worse, because the poor man died out of fearful stress. This is what we, what the poor gas station attendant understand, life can hang on nothing, a simple call, a coin, two millions, whatever.Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a hunter who found two million dollars in the middle of the desert, only trophy from a drug deal that left many Mexican cadavers and a dog rotting in the desert, the crime scene is magnificently rendered by Roger Deakins' cinematography, like a still-life painting. There's still life indeed, Moss takes the money and run, but out of principles, gets back to the crime scene to give some poor man's water. Wrong move, he puts himself on the track and worse, gets Chigurh on his footsteps. Moss is in the crossroads, bad enough to steal and endanger his sweet and caring wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald) but good enough to care. You know at that time that either him or Anton will survive.We have a sadistic killer, whose use of violence is random, remorseless and even more chilling when you try to give it a meaning. Then, you have a fatalistic journey where despite all of Moss' efforts, you feel like there's no way he'll get through it, because there's a movement incarnated by Chiugurh' slow walk in the middle of a motel, from nowhere to someone, this is the Great Reaper coming, you can't escape from it, you can only postpone the delay. And there's the main protagonist, a defeatist sheriff who can't face the facts that he's not cut for the job anymore, and spends most of his time desperately static, the's the nihilistic, he's the ""No"" in the title. He's the main character, the key of the story.That might explain the narrative liberties the Coens took  both Moss and Chigurh are neatly drawn characters, they're mysterious but not their motives, and the movie's intelligence shall rise above obviousness. Bell, in his last courageous attempt to listen to Carla Jean's pleas, to save Moss and get Anton, comes too late, he didn't see what happened, neither did we. Why insisting on so many details, so many on-screen deaths, why making Woody Harrelson introduced as a bad-ass bounty hunter and killed as mercilessly as you stamp on a cockroach?Because it's the unseen that best expresses life's futility, things either guided by God or the devil's hand, and there's no guarantee that goodness will be rewarded and that's what scares the most. The film has style, yes, but it's not about being deep, depth is nothing when nothingness can be deeperSo, don't blame the Coens brothers for what you didn't see, blame Sheriff Bell.",its hard world

It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before.

It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event.

,Great Till the End,"No Country for Old Men (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A hunter (Josh Brolin) comes across a group of trucks with dead bodies everywhere and discovers $2 million in cash, which he takes. Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what's going on. I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I've seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I'm not sure if that's how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don't expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he's on screen you can't take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I'm usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love.

10.0,Expect the Unexpected as the Coen's deliver a pneumatic jolt to the head,"There's very little ""good"" in No Country for Old Men beyond the mesmerizing acting and viciously dark screenplay. Instead, the unholy trinity of temptation, cynicism and pure, dark, evil take center stage in this modern western directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun.Bearing little in common with pretty much any previous Coen film with the possible exception of Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men is a dark, bleak, ode to the baser elements of the human soul, and a spit in the eye to the noble ones as well.With a structural trademark hinging upon breaking the conventional norms of predictability, No Country is a movie that will unsettle you at successive turns - in the way deaths are dealt out; by its palpable tension that can almost be cut with a knife, and its periodic deviations from the narrative norm  the latter likely the only Coen brothers ""quirk"" for which their movies are renown.Switching back and forth between the game of cat and mouse being played out by Moss and Chigurh and the investigation of unfolding events by cynical aging Texas Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the Coens weave a web of dangled threads that one can't help but expect will be neatly tied together at story's end, only to tie them up in ways that buck the storytelling norm and manage to be both unsatisfying and true to their nature at the same time.Unforgettable among this tableau is Bardem's Chigurh. The Spanish actor who has also appeared in Love in the Time of Cholera and Goya's Ghosts evokes the most amazing presence of a ruthless killer with his own twisted adherence to a bizarre code of ethics that nothing short of witnessing his performance can do it justice.Sadly, however, justice is one of the few items in abundance in this movie. And yet, as unhappy as I am that the Coen's screenplay defiantly refuses to cater to the audience's inherent desire for satisfaction, I grudgingly have to admire them for opting for the unpredictable.Consider the movie akin to one big coin toss  will it be heads or tales?

1.0,Gallons and gallons of blood,"Not to mention bloated dead bodies of dogs and humans and a ""man who wouldn't die"".""No Country for Old Men"" has Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh, a monstrous motive-less killer (unless you count the money, but how does he know about it?) He slides in and out of scenes, you are always chilled but like the clichéd train-wreck victims you see reeling on the side of the road, he never engages you, you never speculate on what made him this way, he is simply a nerveless, passionless cypher.Actually the clichés were too many to count in this truly, truly disappointing effort from the Coen brothers. A police officer turns his back on the monster and is promptly dispatched and of course the monster manages to squeeze bloodily out of his own handcuffs. H'mm. The instrument used to kill by Chigurh is some kind of stun gun with an oxygen tank. Surely to God he could get hands on a gun with a silencer and not have to lug this tank around like some deranged Fred Munster? There is so much blood, the only conclusion I could make was that this was the whole point, raise the barf meter with everyone, show acres of gratuitous violence to draw in the desirable adbash demographic and forget any kind of plot. A slasher film for the pseudo-sophisticated.The movie grabs you early and you think, as you survey a field full of fallen felons (they were involved in a drug heist) discovered by an officer played by Josh Brolin, that this movie is going to unwind a great mystery. You settle in for the denouement.Poor you. You are sidetracked by an absolutely meaningless sub-plot involving Woody Harrelson (another grisly ending) and by Tommy Lee Jones who was left without any relevant script and wanders cynically in and out of scenes, delivering tired old witticisms as a sheriff. We can count the ways and days of tired old cynical sheriffs. I was waiting for ""life is just a box of chocolates and Chigurh the hardboiled candy"". It would have improved things.I was baffled as to the narrative. Was there one? Why didn't I get it? Was this movie, in spite of the barrels of blood, too deep for me? I was asking myself these questions long before it was over.Was this movie reaching for pretension or was it truly in the stratum of the intellectual elite? Coin toss answer.For me, it seemed fitting that there was no ending to this. No plot should equal a no ending. The beast didn't die and went on his stumbling way. All the good guys died, apart from aforementioned slow-drawl sheriff, who is now retired.Zero artistic merit, zero plot. I gave it a 1 to bring down the over-rating.

1.0,Wasn't that good,"I was not biased against the film when I saw it. I loved ""The Big Lebowski"", and was even amused by the similar theme in the two: both involve a suitcase full of money which the main character carts around, for events to get the suitcase lost, and inevitably leave the audience in the dark as to the eventual fate of the money.Unfortunately, as great as the movie started out, it devolved into pretentious art-film-like movie-making and a muddled ending with no clear ending. Not defined ending or happy ending, but CLEAR ending. The whole thing came to an abrupt end like a train that hits an invisible wall at low speed.The cinematography was something worth an Oscar in itself, and I especially loved the way it was shot when Llewellyn discovered the botched drug deal and eventually the money. It was so realistic, you could almost feel the mucky grime of blood drying in the sand or the greasiness of an overused dump-truck, the plainness of the brand-less milk, all the homey settings of a western border-city.The character Llewellyn isn't very likable. He reminds me something of The Dude in that he's very much aloof to the horrors of seeing the shot-up drug dealers, and casually takes their money and goes home, suddenly remembering one of the dying men asked him for water, and deciding to go back with a gallon of tap water for him, until Anton Shigurh comes after him and he panics, and is forced to become resolute.In the beginning, Anton Shigurh, played by Javier Bardem, seemed the ideal villain; quiet, utterly irredeemable, seeming the kind of person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort of honor. Even the scene where he makes a shopkeep gamble on his life with the flip of his coin, you fully expect Anton to kill him at any moment, even when he lets the man live.At about the mid-way point of the movie, it starts to unravel. Perhaps I need to see the movie again, but for the life of me, I cannot begin to wonder what Tommy Lee Jones's character's purpose in the movie is. He promises Llewellyn's wife that he'll make sure Llewellyn lives, and goes about doing nothing but reading the newspaper and lounging about in the office or at a diner. Only once does he visit the crime scene, and towards the end does he come close to the killer.Next come the nameless character played by Woody Harrelson, and the oh-so-elegantly named ""Man in the Office"" played by Stephen Root. Woody Harrelson's character describes Anton for us, and then wanders off to meet with Llewellyn, and then get killed by Anton for some reason. Anton then randomly appears in the Office man's office and kills him in the middle of interviewing some guy for a job. Anton doesn't say anything of worth to the other man, and is then back to the western area chasing Llewellyn. I have no idea what that was supposed to be about.The thing is a mess, as the movie skips ahead slightly with Llewellyn dead, and Anton flustered that he lost the money. In a moment that completely changes my opinion of Anton from cold, calculating, assassin of pure evil, to a pitiful, pathetic, stubborn childish creature that kills Llewellyn's wife just because Llewellyn didn't let Anton kill him.For some random reason, as Anton is driving off from her house, he gets hit by a car, staggers out with a broken arm, and walks away.For another random reason, Tommy Lee Jones's character has some retrospect, then gives a long, rambling soliloquy about a dream he had. I have heard many accents, and I have very sharp hearing. I can understand some of the most rambling of mumblings and mutterings, but for the life of me, I could not understand more than a few words of Tommy Lee Jones's heavily accented, mumbling, rambling speech about dreaming about his father.And it suddenly ended with ""And then I woke up.""",wasnt that good,i was not biased against film when i saw it i loved big lebowski was even amused by similar theme two both involve suitcase full money which main character carts around events get suitcase lost inevitably leave audience dark as eventual fate money unfortunately as great as movie started out it devolved into pretentious art film like movie making muddled ending with no clear ending not defined ending or happy ending but clear ending whole thing came abrupt end like train that hits invisible wall at low speed cinematography was something worth oscar itself i especially loved way it was shot when llewellyn discovered botched drug deal eventually money it was so realistic you could almost feel mucky grime blood drying sand or greasiness overused dump truck plainness brand less milk all homey settings western border city character llewellyn isnt very likable he reminds me something dude that hes very much aloof horrors seeing shot up drug dealers casually takes their money goes home suddenly remembering one dying men asked him water deciding go back with gallon tap water him until anton shigurh comes after him he panics is forced become resolute beginning anton shigurh played by javier bardem seemed ideal villain quiet utterly irredeemable seeming kind person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort honor even scene where he makes shopkeep gamble his life with flip his coin you fully expect anton kill him at any moment even when he lets man live at about mid way point movie it starts unravel perhaps i need see movie again but life me i cannot begin wonder what tommy lee joness characters purpose movie is he promises llewellyns wife that hell make sure llewellyn lives goes about doing nothing but reading newspaper lounging about office or at diner only once does he visit crime scene towards end does he come close killer next come nameless character played by woody harrelson oh so elegantly named man office played by stephen root woody harrelsons character describes anton us then wanders off meet with llewellyn then get killed by anton some reason anton then randomly appears office mans office kills him middle interviewing some guy job anton doesnt say anything worth other man is then back western area chasing llewellyn i have no idea what that was supposed be about thing is mess as movie skips ahead slightly with llewellyn dead anton flustered that he lost money moment that completely changes my opinion anton cold calculating assassin pure evil pitiful pathetic stubborn childish creature that kills llewellyns wife just because llewellyn didnt let anton kill him some random reason as anton is driving off her house he gets hit by car staggers out with broken arm walks away another random reason tommy lee joness character has some retrospect then gives long rambling soliloquy about dream he had i have heard many accents i have very sharp hearing i can understand some most rambling mumblings mutterings but life me i could not understand more than few words tommy lee joness heavily accented mumbling rambling speech about dreaming about his father it suddenly ended with then i woke up,0.49831623931623936,0.04112537462537462,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"

,AWFUL =The WORST Movie Going Experience Of My Life,"I'm sorry but anyone that thinks this movie is clever or deep is certifiably insane.I've literally seen thousands of films at the theatre in my life and the response to this thing was something I've never seen before. It was a near revolt. I actually saw people angrily walking to get a refund. This exchange perfectly sums up this waste of film...The woman seated behind me turns to the people she was with and says, ""Bill, that was the LAST time you pick the movie."" He responds, ""I'm soooo sorry. That was completely awful."" I turned to my friends and apologized as well. They were there because I wanted to see it. I had to apologize all the way to the parking lot.Anyone here labeling it a masterpiece or thinking it's a textured, complex film couldn't be more wrong. This was nothing more then a blatant attempt to shatter the cookie cutter Hollywood genre picture using poor dialogue and offbeat characters. That was its ONLY goal. Creating unpredictable crap may have helped it accomplish that goal but that doesn't make it good work in any way. It certainly doesn't qualify as entertainment.SPOILERS follow but I'd advise those who haven't seen it to read them. This could save you money and wasted time...Killing the lead barely three quarters of the way through the movie, OFF SCREEN, may seem clever to some but it's just so irritating to most. The movie does take the tedious time to try to emotionally involve you with the characters and the story. What I can't understand is how anyone can think that frustrating an audience is good cinema. Callously killing multiple characters with no consequences, killing the lead off screen, killing his wife, having the insane psychopath villain walk away scott free (hurt by a random car wreck no less) and having Tommy Lee Jones' character quit and babble to the camera before a cut to black is as bad of a theatre experience as anyone could imagine.

3.0,No answers to key questions,"When some movies are over, everything is tied up in a neat little package; for better or worse, someone worked really hard to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder ""What would I do in that situation?"" ""Was the hero really a hero?"" ""Do I agree with the film's moral?"" etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.Bad ones, however, leave you questioning the story itself: ""Why did he do that?"" ""What happened to so-and-so?"" ""Did that make any sense?"" ""What did I miss?"" Such films make you see the holes in the plot, not the story that surrounds them. When the film is a huge critical or commercial success, the pertinent question may well be ""So, what's the big deal?"" NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a ""so-what's-the-big-deal"" type of movie. It is undoubtedly THE film of 2007, an Oscar-winning, critic's choice, top ten darling. Yet, for the most part, it is an utterly conventional modern day western; so predictable that Charles Bronson could be resurrected from the grave and plopped down into the middle of it without missing a beat. It is adequately directed and decently acted, but otherwise -- for the first two-thirds -- it is largely without distinction. Perhaps, because the filmmakers work so hard to seem unconventional in the last third, the defenders think they see something unique in the whole.The set up is routinely plotted: A poor, but relatively honest young man, while hunting in the west Texas desert, stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. While callously rooting around amidst the dead bodies, he helps himself to over two million dollars in illicit cash. He takes off and is soon pursued by a relentless, but relatively insane mob assassin -- and they are both -- sorta -- pursued by an honest, but relatively ineffectual local marshal. Leaving a predictable trail of dead bodies along the way, the film seems to be promising a confrontation where any two or more of the protagonists should face each other in a traditional showdown.At least, that is how the writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen set things up. It could be argued that Coen brothers are playing around with the audience, mischievously creating expectations that they have no intentions of meeting. But in side-stepping the obvious tried and true plot twists and dramatic confrontations that such a climax normally would offer, the Coens don't really replace them with anything better. The last third of NO COUNTRY is shocking and challenging only because it is so vapid and devoid of drama. Characters die off-camera with only the vaguest explanation, while other characters' fates are left an obtuse mystery. The finale peters out into three separate and pointless conclusions: the thief dies, the killer apparently gets away and the policeman quits, never to cross each other's paths. And the audience isn't given much reason to care about any of them.The anemic narrative wouldn't matter so much, I suppose, if the film were instead a incisive or compelling study of one or more of the characters. Though the actors give decent enough performances, they can't flesh out the characters beyond ciphers. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, the hunter turned thief, is a solid presence, a modern day twist on the iconic figure of the strong, silent and resourceful cowboy. But beyond the good-boy-gone-bad tradition of the western, the film gives Llewelyn little backstory and no particular depth beyond being both foolish and yet smarter than one would expect. Ed Tom Bell, the gruff, world-weary, retirement-bound, small-town sheriff, is played by Tommy Lee Jones as a safe and comfortable stereotype; only denied by the uninspired script either the traditional age-cultivated wisdom or the opportunity to be even vaguely heroic. He spends most of the film wistfully longing for the good old days.Javier Bardem's much praised work as the tiresomely inscrutable and indestructible hit-man Anton Chigurh is largely a one-note performance -- Oscar win notwithstanding. His persistence, in lieu of any personality, has been inexplicable interpreted as having mythic dimensions as the embodiment of cruel fate or death incarnate. Only desperation to find meaning in the slight story justifies such heavy-handed symbolism. Lumbering through the film with all the emotional complexity of a slasher movie serial killer, Chigurh is little more than a lazy gimmick; with his over-sized weapons (one requires he lug around a 30-pound tank of compressed air!) and arbitrary flip-a-coin sadism, he is a ludicrous character who survives only due to the manipulations of a generously contrived script.But, it is no wonder the film focuses on Chigurh, who like Coens' films, embodies a cold, dispassionate emptiness. It is not that they don't do compassion (let alone passion) well, they don't even try. In their best effort, BLOOD SIMPLE, the chill of their drama is counteracted with a coy air of satire. Even FARGO is unpleasantly empty as far as emotional depth. You can tell a lot about filmmakers by how they treat even their minor and incidental characters; most characters in Coen films are disposable plot devices. It is no wonder a key character is killed off screen; the Coens don't care about his fate and assume we shouldn't either.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN builds to one of the least satisfying conclusions of all time. The film is ultimately riddled with gaps in logic and figure-it-out-for-yourself ambiguities; things that the audience may not need to see, but have a right to expect to experience as part of the drama. NO COUNTRY isn't just weak film-making, it is an act of bad faith. The final question facing the viewer might well be ""Is that it?""",no answers key questions,when some movies are over everything is tied up neat little package better or worse someone worked really hard make sure there were no unanswered questions other movies arent so considerate others may be messy but good ones leave you asking key questions about philosophy story they may make you wonder what would i do that situation was hero really hero do i agree with films moral etc these films draw you into story point where ending is really beginning films lasting power sometimes messy is good bad ones however leave you questioning story itself why did he do that what happened so so did that make any sense what did i miss such films make you see holes plot not story that surrounds them when film is huge critical or commercial success pertinent question may well be so whats big deal no country old men is so whats big deal type movie it is undoubtedly film 2007 oscar winning critics choice top ten darling yet most part it is utterly conventional modern day western so predictable that charles bronson could be resurrected grave plopped down into middle it without missing beat it is adequately directed decently acted but otherwise first two thirds it is largely without distinction perhaps because filmmakers work so hard seem unconventional last third defenders think they see

helps himself over two million dollars illicit cash he takes off is soon pursued by relentless but relatively insane mob assassin they are both sorta pursued by honest but relatively ineffectual local marshal leaving predictable trail dead bodies along way film seems be promising confrontation where any two or more protagonists should face each other traditional showdown at least that is how writing directing team joel ethan coen set things up it could be argued that coen brothers are playing around with audience mischievously creating expectations that they have no intentions meeting but side stepping obvious tried true plot twists dramatic confrontations that such climax normally would offer coens dont really replace them with anything better last third no country is shocking challenging only because it is so vapid devoid drama characters die off camera with only vaguest explanation while other characters fates are left obtuse mystery finale peters out into three separate pointless conclusions thief dies killer apparently gets away policeman quits never cross each others paths audience isnt given much reason care about any them anemic narrative wouldnt matter so much i suppose if film were instead incisive or compelling study one or more characters though actors give decent enough performances they cant flesh out characters beyond ciphers josh brolin as llewelyn

10.0,Enjoy It Every Time,"I really enjoyed this film on the first viewing and every one since.It reminded me of the Coen Brothers' first film, ""Blood Simple"" (1984). with its understated but quirky and violent characters, odd dialog and sudden brutality. It's an odd crime film, but that what's the Coen Brothers usually deliver us: odd and entertaining movies. Whether it's the ""Best Picture Of The Year,"" I question, but I did find it fascinating. Many times the villain is the most interesting character in a movie, and I'd have to say that's the case here, too. Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, plays ""Anton Chigurh"" and this guy is one strange dude, with an even-stranger weapon. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are almost as intriguing. Brolin is ""Llewelyn Moss,"" a guy out hunting one day and finds dirty money at a bloody crime scene, takes it, and is on the run from the crooks who own it. Jones is the local sheriff, ""Ed Tom Bell,"" who actually tries to help Moss by grabbing him before the killers do. Ed Tom admits times sure have changed and deranged killers like ""Anton"" are totally unexplainable. To me, Jones is always a great actor to watch.The supporting actors in here are all good, too, and also quirky....just like the Coens like them (see ""Fargo"" for a good example).Another star of this film is cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the best - if not the best - in the business. Deakins was up for two Academy Awards this year: this movie and ""The Assassination of Jesee James By The Coward Robert Ford."" That's how good a photographer Deakins is, nominated for two films.To me, though, the highlight of this film was the dialog. Man, there were some strange sentences uttered in here with some odd grammar and expressions thrown in. Early on, I put on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any of it, or misinterpret what everyone said. In other words, this was not only a fun movie to watch, but to hear. It was very suspenseful most of the way as this turns out to be a long cat-and-mouse chase story. That's usually entertaining to watch, and this is no exception.Are there flaws in here? Sure, a couple beauties, too, but nothing unusual for Hollywood. Shootouts in the street and a major car crash - all in city and residential areas - and nobody comes out to see what happened? Also, what happened to ""Moss"" is a big issue. Maybe I missed that. Finally, the abrupt anti-climactic ending is a biggest issue, one I know displeased a lot of viewers.....but I don't find any movie or story as perfect. I'm willing to forgive the Coens for these transgressions, because, overall, this is so entertaining.Nonetheless, it's nice to finally see a ""Best Picture"" movie that wasn't totally disappointing.",enjoy it every time,i really enjoyed this film first viewing every one since it reminded me coen brothers first film blood simple 1984 with its understated but quirky violent characters odd dialog sudden brutality its odd crime film but that whats coen brothers usually deliver us odd entertaining movies whether its best picture year i question but i did find it fascinating many times villain is most interesting character movie id have say thats case here too javier bardem spanish actor plays anton chigurh this guy is one strange dude with even stranger weapon josh brolin tommy lee jones are almost as intriguing brolin is llewelyn moss guy out hunting one day finds dirty money at bloody crime scene takes it is run crooks who own it jones is local sheriff ed tom bell who actually tries help moss by grabbing him before killers do ed tom admits times sure have changed deranged killers like anton are totally unexplainable me jones is always great actor watch supporting actors here are all good too also quirky just like coens like them see fargo good example another star this film is cinematographer roger deakins one best if not best business deakins was up two academy awards this year this movie assassination jesee james by coward robert ford thats how good photographer deakins is nominated two films me though highlight this film was dialog man there were some strange sentences uttered here with some odd grammar expressions thrown early i put english subtitles so i wouldnt miss any it or misinterpret what everyone said other words this was not only fun movie watch but hear it was very suspenseful most way as this turns out be long cat mouse chase story thats usually entertaining watch this is no exception are there flaws here sure couple beauties too but nothing unusual hollywood shootouts street major car crash all city residential areas nobody comes out see what happened also what happened moss is big issue maybe i missed that finally abrupt anti climactic ending is biggest issue one i know displeased lot viewers but i dont find any movie or story as perfect im willing forgive coens these transgressions because overall this is so entertaining nonetheless its nice finally see best picture movie that wasnt totally disappointing,0.5429431216931219,0.19076388888888887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.22}"
9.0,Joel and Ethan's Country,"Llewelyn Moss: Can't help but compare yourself to the ol' timers. Can't help but wonder how'd they do in these times.The Coen brothers have been making movies for over 20 years now. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is their twelfth feature together. While they were once considered princely collaborators held at the highest esteem by film enthusiasts the world over, they have recently been the victims of their own identity crisis. Caught between their signature exploration of all things quirky and abnormal found in the parts of America thought to be forgotten and the demanding pressures of delivering bankable Hollywood fare, the Coen's finished by delivering sub-par work that tarnished their lustrous reputation. The film enthusiasts thought they might have lost great talents to Hollywood while Hollywood wasn't even sure they wanted them. What were these ""aging"" filmmakers to do? They could have polished off another Tom Hanks picture and crossed their fingers. They could have appealed to their fans and told another tale of the idiosyncrasies of those living in the middle of nowhere. They could have tried appeasing both parties by attempting THE BIG LEBOWSKI 2. Instead, they did none of these things. No, instead, the Coen brothers crafted a film that is unlike any film they have ever made and is also perhaps the best film they've ever made.Translating Cormac McCarthy's novel about the relationship between the hunter and the hunted to the screen may be smoothest decision these boys have made for years. Not only does it allow for the brothers to explore the grim sides of characters consumed by money and an unnerving peace derived from killing, but NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN also leaves the door open for an interpretive commentary on the Coen's career itself. Allow me to explain by painting a picture from the film. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) aims his rifle at an unsuspecting animal grazing alongside the herd. He is right now in charge, in control, the hunter. He fires and misses, thus beginning his steady descent into ruin. He moves toward the spot where his prey once stood only to find the site of a drug deal massacre. Here, he innocently stumbles upon an enormous amount of money. He picks it up and goes without realizing the hell that is about to be brought upon him. He inadvertently becomes the hunted. He spends the remainder of the film calculating and executing different attempts to regain the superior position he once held. The comparisons are subtle and come about naturally rather than existing as the initial basis for the film to grow out of, reinforcing their genuine nature. I could explain my logic behind this analogy but that would be very un-Coen like.Another consistency throughout the Coen Brothers' careers is the elevated caliber of talent they attract to their diverse projects. With their writing at top of its game, performances by Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones are pushed to the heights of their potential. Moss is a quiet man, focused and constantly thinking about what his next play will be. He has no time for ego, only function, and though most of his motivation is to avoid drawing attention to himself, Brolin's interpretation cannot help but capture our notice. For the second time this year (in conjunction with his slimy crooked cop turn in American GANGSTER), Brolin reinvigorates his skills by inhabiting Moss fully as an instinctual and reactionary being. While Jones is also impressive as a police officer resigned to following the action without any possibility of curbing the outcome, it is Bardem's performance as Anton Chigurh that will leave audiences with a haunting chill after experiencing it. His portrayal of a psychopathic hunter is both disturbing and riveting. This is a man who enjoys torturing his victims mentally by asking them questions meant to expose the inconsistencies in the way they live their lives before ushering them out of this world. He abides by some form of ethical code that only makes sense in his own mind and fully justifies his killings. His adherence to this code is what sends him to an internal state of ecstasy as he chokes a man and stares intently at the ceiling. The hunter is always frightening but Bardem is worse; he's unsettling.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is entirely disconcerting but is somehow still a tranquil experience. There is a normality amidst the unrest that thrives in the plain, natural manner in which the story unfolds. The chase is constantly surprising without ever seeming forced. Each move made makes perfect sense but is not seen coming. On this level, even their formal execution of this film speaks to the trajectory of their career. Who knew that leaving quirk behind for harrowing humour and a story that serves itself instead of as a platform for character would invigorate the Coen's method and assert their place as two of the greatest American filmmakers operating in a country thought not to have any place for the them? I like to think they did. In doing so, they have also made a movie for a sharp adult audience in a country bent on catering to all things youthful and disposable.GRADE: A",joel ethans country,llewelyn moss cant help but compare yourself ol timers cant help but wonder howd they do these times coen brothers have been making movies over 20 years now no country old men is their twelfth feature together while they were once considered princely collaborators held at highest esteem by film enthusiasts world over they have recently been victims their own identity crisis caught between their signature exploration all things quirky abnormal found parts america thought be forgotten demanding pressures delivering bankable hollywood fare coens finished by delivering sub par work that tarnished their lustrous reputation film enthusiasts thought they might have lost great talents hollywood while hollywood wasnt even sure they wanted them what were these aging filmmakers do they could have polished off another tom hanks picture crossed their fingers they could have appealed their fans told another tale idiosyncrasies those living middle nowhere they could have tried appeasing both parties by attempting big lebowski 2 instead they did none these things no instead coen brothers crafted film that is unlike any film they have ever made is also perhaps best film theyve ever made translating cormac mccarthys novel about relationship between hunter hunted screen may be smoothest decision these boys have made years not only does it allow brothers explore grim sides characters consumed by money unnerving peace derived killing but no country old men also leaves door open interpretive commentary coens career itself allow me explain by painting picture film llewellyn moss josh brolin aims his rifle at unsuspecting animal grazing alongside herd he is right now charge control hunter he fires misses thus beginning his steady descent into ruin he moves toward spot where his prey once stood only find site drug deal massacre here he innocently stumbles upon enormous amount money he picks it up goes without realizing hell that is about be brought upon him he inadvertently becomes hunted he spends remainder film calculating executing different attempts regain superior position he once held comparisons are subtle come about naturally rather than existing as initial basis film grow out reinforcing their genuine nature i could explain my logic behind this analogy but that would be very un coen like another consistency throughout coen brothers careers is elevated caliber talent they attract their diverse projects with their writing at top its game performances by brolin javier bardem tommy lee jones are pushed heights their potential moss is quiet man focused constantly thinking about what his next play will be he has no time ego only function though most his motivation is avoid drawing attention himself brolins interpretation cannot help but capture our notice second time this year conjunction with his slimy crooked cop turn american gangster brolin reinvigorates his skills by inhabiting moss fully as instinctual reactionary being while jones is also impressive as police officer resigned following action without any possibility curbing outcome it is bardems performance as anton chigurh that will leave audiences with haunting chill after experiencing it his portrayal psychopathic hunter is both disturbing riveting this is man who enjoys torturing his victims mentally by asking them questions meant expose inconsistencies way they live their lives before ushering them out this world he abides by some form ethical code that only makes sense his own mind fully justifies his killings his adherence this code is what sends him internal state ecstasy as he chokes man stares intently at ceiling hunter is always frightening but bardem is worse hes unsettling no country old men is entirely disconcerting but is somehow still tranquil experience there is normality amidst unrest that thrives plain natural manner which story unfolds chase is constantly surprising without ever seeming forced each move made makes perfect sense but is not seen coming this level even their formal execution this film speaks trajectory their career who knew that leaving quirk behind harrowing humour story that serves itself instead as platform character would invigorate coens method assert their place as two greatest american filmmakers operating country thought not have any place them i like think they did doing so they have also made movie sharp adult audience country bent catering all things youthful disposable grade,0.5238033234126984,0.10493946158008657,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,MY REVIEW: Flawed Perfect Western Thriller!!,"No Country For Old Men. It's a near perfect western thriller gone somewhat wrong in the end. Hero a hunter himself finds a bag full of money from a crime scene but then gets hunted down by a crazy lunatic killer. Adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying to help hero without his knowledge. The movie starts and flows like a clean water with edgy characters, tricky situations and some clever ideas. Then when you are all set for bang-bang climax, movie takes a different route, plot becomes ambiguous, motives become unclear and our hero is out of the story just like that. If you are not overly miffed by the deviation in last half an hour, then you would be attracted to this like an iron to magnet because of its crazy characters, witty dialogs, haunting atmosphere and chilling silence.",my review flawed perfect western thriller,no country old men its near perfect western thriller gone somewhat wrong end hero hunter himself finds bag full money crime scene but then gets hunted down by crazy lunatic killer adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying help hero without his knowledge movie starts flows like clean water with edgy characters tricky situations some clever ideas then when you are all set bang bang climax movie takes different route plot becomes ambiguous motives become unclear our hero is out story just like that if you are not overly miffed by deviation last half hour then you would be attracted this like iron magnet because its crazy characters witty dialogs haunting atmosphere chilling silence,0.5728835978835979,0.006481481481481474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.36}"
