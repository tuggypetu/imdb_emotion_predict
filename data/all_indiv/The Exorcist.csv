,The truth about the Exorcist.,"There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, ""the scariest movie ever made"", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing ""scariest movie of all time"" associated with this movie.First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist ""the scariest movie ever made."" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a ""greatest/scariest/best"" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, ""And how does one go about getting an exorcism?"" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, ""No. There is only one."" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the ""scariest movie ever made"", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.",truth about exorcist,theres lot anxiety that goes into viewing exorcist scariest movie ever made very first time with that anxiety comes lot expectations preconceived ideas about what exorcist should be especially someone born after film then top that waited years before finally seeing it i love exorcist after exposure god knows how many horror films exorcist remains my favorite within genre even die hard fan i have admit i hate

10.0,An intense and very terrifying movie that will make you sleep with the bible a few nights in a row,"The Exorcist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70's and deserves better than slowly descending down the top 250. It's one of those essential films you have to see in order to understand what a movie truly is and this is more than a horror film. Unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored, I think because they expected a terrifying movie, people! This isn't a slasher movie, this isn't some scary Michael Myers that you can shoot, this is a story about normal people in a normal house and upstairs there is a little girl who happens to be possessed by ""The devil himself"". Faith is so strong and when it's shaken, anything in your imagination can run wild.First off the actors: Ellen Burstyn plays Chris McNeil, an actress working in Washington, D.C. on a film. She is the mother of Regan, the little girl who is possessed. I felt such sorrow for Chris, when she begs Father Karras to help her with Regan, I almost cried for her. Her daughter is not sick, this is nothing she can give Regan a pill and she'll be better. Her speech to Father Karras later on in the film: ""You show me Regan's double, same face, same voice, everything. And I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut. Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!"" sent shivers down my spine, this woman knows what Regan needs and will do whatever she can.We have Linda Blair who plays Regan and she was so great for a 12 year old actress. This little apple faced girl became one of the most frightening images of the 70's and still to this day. She's not scary because she's swearing, this little innocent girl has been taken over by forces that she shouldn't even know about. Jason Miller as Father Karras, for a man who had never acted professionally before, he was quite amazing as a priest who just lost his mother and his faith has been shaken up. Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin was so strong and he was like in his 20's playing a man in his 90's. He was robbed of an Oscar, he was so believable and just amazing during the exorcism scene.The effects? People! This was the 70's and they made a bed float! They turned this little angel's face into a hideous creature! If you watch the documentary ""Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist"", Ellen Burstyn gets slapped by Regan in the film and she had kind of a rope tied around her waist. When the stunt man pulled her back, Billy the director told the guy to let her have it and he YANKED her back hard causing real pain in Ellen's back and that was an actual scream in the movie. They froze the room to the point as were moisture got into the set and there was a layer of snow in the morning they were shooting. There was no CGI, this was the real deal and I believe could truly help the actors. Linda Blair was being thrashed up and down during one of the possessed scenes where the bracing came loose and caused slamming of metal to her back repeatedly and her screams were also very real and bone chilling.William Freidkin is the director of The Exorcist, and there was no better choice. This guy took this picture seriously, so far as to shoot a gun offstage or scream obscenities to get an actor's shocked reaction on film. He slapped almost punched Reverend William O'Malley who played Father Dyer to get him to shake during his reciting the Last Rites to Father Karras. He almost would have killed to make this picture and anyone doing it.Weither or not the set of The Exorcist was truly cursed with a total of 9 deaths linked to the film, a fire on the set with no apparent reason, and the total feeling of evil around the room, we'll never know. But The Exorcist is a true motion picture never to missed or deserve no more than the true compliments it should get! This is the film that should be shown to any aspiring film makers. It's a masterpiece of a film that's more than a mere horror flick.10/10",intense very terrifying movie that will make you sleep with bible few nights row,exorcist is one best movies come out 70s deserves better than slowly descending down top 250 its one those essential films you have see order understand what movie truly is this is more than horror film unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored i think because they expected terrifying movie people this isnt slasher movie this isnt some scary michael myers that you can shoot this is story about normal people normal house upstairs there is little girl who happens be possessed by devil himself faith is so strong when its shaken anything your imagination can run wild first off actors ellen burstyn plays chris mcneil actress working washington d c film she is mother regan little girl who is possessed i felt such sorrow chris when she begs father karras help her with regan i almost cried her her daughter is not sick this is nothing she can give regan pill shell be better her speech father karras later film you show me regans double same face same voice everything id know it wasnt regan id know my gut now i want you tell me that you know fact that theres nothing wrong with my daughter except her mind you tell me fact that exorcism wouldnt do any good you tell me that sent shivers down my spine this woman knows what regan needs will do whatever she can we have linda blair who plays regan she was so great 12 year old actress this little apple faced girl became one most frightening images 70s still this day shes not scary because shes swearing this little innocent girl has been taken over by forces that she shouldnt even know about jason miller as father karras man who had never acted professionally before he was quite amazing as priest who just lost his mother his faith has been shaken up max von sydow as father merrin was so strong he was like his 20s playing man his 90s he was robbed oscar he was so believable just amazing during exorcism scene effects people this was 70s they made bed float they turned this little angels face into hideous creature if you watch documentary fear god making exorcist ellen burstyn gets slapped by regan film she had kind rope tied around her waist when stunt man pulled her back billy director told guy let her have it he yanked her back hard causing real pain ellens back that was actual scream movie they froze room point as were moisture got into set there was layer snow morning they were shooting there was no cgi this was real deal i believe could truly help actors linda blair was being thrashed up down during one possessed scenes where bracing came loose caused slamming metal her back repeatedly her screams were also very real bone chilling william freidkin is director exorcist there was no better choice this guy took this picture seriously so far as shoot gun offstage or scream obscenities get actors shocked reaction film he slapped almost punched reverend william omalley who played father dyer get him shake during his reciting last rites father karras he almost would have killed make this picture anyone doing it weither or not set exorcist was truly cursed with total 9 deaths linked film fire set with no apparent reason total feeling evil around room well never know but exorcist is true motion picture never missed or deserve no more than true compliments it should get this is film that should be shown any aspiring film makers its masterpiece film thats more than mere horror flick 10 10,0.5098849816849818,0.033147374847374844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,The Devil Made Her Do It,"In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.The first time I had heard of something called The Exorcist was on late night television when the author, William Peter Blatty, was a guest on The Tonight Show. The conversation centered around how horrible some of the things in the book were. I had also seen the novel listed on The New York Times Bestseller List, and it seemed as if it would remain there forever. After having been on the waiting list for what seemed like an eternity at the local library, I was finally able to obtain a copy. It was the first book I had read in one sitting since probably Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase quite a few years earlier. And yes, for it's time it was filled with gut wrenching details of what happens when for some unexplained reason; an innocent girl is possessed by Satan. While reading the book I was sure that if it ever made its way to film, most of the details would certainly be either `cleaned up' or omitted altogether. As you know the film was made and it spared the movie going public absolutely nothing in the way of details.Certainly many of the people who lined up to see The Exorcist did so to watch some of the more gruesome scenes, the worst of which involved Regan's masturbation with a crucifix. Yet, the hysteria went well beyond the fact that such scenes were so vividly depicted. I think one needs to look no further than Mel Gibson's The Passion to find the answer as to why. I'm sure most of you have read the story of people leaving Mel's film in tears, some to the point of being hysterical. From most articles I have read, it seems that the majority of the audience that was moved were those people of strong religious beliefs. For many others, the depiction of the brutality in The Passion may have been uncomfortable to sit through, but weren't emotionally effected to any degree. Much of this same feeling can explain the hysteria surrounding The Exorcist. Those who had a definitive belief in Heaven and Hell, of Good and Evil, of Jesus as The Savior and Satan as the epitome of pure evil were affected by The Exorcist far more than those who were agnostic or just never had a strong belief in spiritual matters. There is no doubt though that much in the way The Passion did, The Exorcist caused many to reconsider how they felt about their faith. The Exorcist made the prospect of Satan being alive and well and a life of eternal damnation a very uncomfortable prospect. The fact that Blatty claims his book and screenplay were based on a true story seemed to give the film even more credibility.For me, The Exorcist has always been more about the never ending conflict between pure evil and pure innocence than about being an average horror story. There are many more levels to this film than what initially meets the eye. There is no doubt that while the main story revolves around an innocent young girl, Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), being inhabited by Satan himself, Blatty enhances it greatly by adding different characters in various stages of conflict. Regan's mother, Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) obviously cares deeply for her daughter. Yet she is not beyond reproach. In one scene when Reagan's father hasn't called on Regan's birthday, we see her desperately on the phone doing battle with an overseas operator. The problem is not how vicious the phone call is, but that she does it within ear shot of her daughter as if to drive the point home to Regan how worthless her father is. When, she finally does seek the aid of Father Damian Karras, we don't feel that she believes in exorcism anymore than he does, but is desperate enough to accept the fact that it is possible and will take any and all measures to save her daughter.Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest torn by conflict. He is ridden by overwhelming guilt for having abandoned his mother to enter the priesthood. He is torn spiritually by the confessions of those priests who seek his help as a psychiatrist, so much so that he now questions his own faith. When he states to the Bishop that `Regan's case meets all the criteria,' we know that even more than Chris, he doesn't really believe in the power of Satan to inhabit a living being in the manner that it has taken over Regan. Yet, he will do what is required of him as a priest concerned about the health of a child.Jack McGowran gives a terrific performance as the alcoholic director filming Chris's latest film in Georgetown. Kitty Winn is Sharon Spencer, the secretary who works for Chris and always seems to be in the line of fire when Chris is angry. She is always there but for all the horror she witnesses, Winn appears too bland and emotionless and her performance is probably the weakest in the film.Max Von Sydow as Father Lancester Merrin is a no nonsense aging priest. He has done battle with evil before and he shows us its effect in every scene he occupies. One could pass it off to being just good make-up but it is so much more than that as Sydow demonstrates all the nuances that brings to life a man who has faced Satan and lived to tell about it. He knows what he is up against, understands he must do it again and the consequences of what that battle may be.If I have a small complaint with The Exorcist it is in regards to the character of Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). I have never been able to buy into the character. It is not the fault of Cobb who is his usual stalwart self in the role. The whole character should at best have only been necessary for a few brief scenes yet; he has several that go on way too long and do not add anything to the story. Even in his scenes with Chris or Damian, Kinderman is so odd that he distracts us too much from their characters and it is Chris and Damian's reactions that are more important to us, not his investigation. For all you trivia buffs out there, Blatty once sued the producers of Columbo, stating they based Peter Falk's character on Kinderman. If memory serves me correctly Blatty lost that one.As for Director William Friedken, although he won the best director award for The French Connection, for me The Exorcist will always remain his defining film. The Final half hour of The Exorcist are still as dynamic today as they were 31 years ago, French Connection car chase be damned.It seems that to many of the younger movie audiences of today, The Exorcist has become more of a joke than anything else. That's not surprising considering how many times it has been lampooned, even by Linda Blair herself in Repossessed. Yet, if they were to view the film in a more serious vein, not as just another creature feature, they may just find that there really is more to this film than a little girl spewing pea soup and spinning her head around 360 degrees. It is the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell and Good and Evil. It is the story of the complete and total degradation of innocence. It is a study in character, and whether a man torn by the forces surrounding him, can regain his faith and his belief in God and mankind to save the life of a little girl, caught up in forces beyond her control.Call it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A.",devil made her do it,late 1973 early 1974 women men were lined up blocks

10.0,One of the greatest ever!!,"Some movies are landmarks. This is one of them.Good : There are a lot of goods that I can talk about this particular film. First off, every gothic horror, for example, The Conjuring, are inspired by this film in one way or the other. But, none of them are as good as this one. I love Conjuring 1 & 2, but that might have never existed if it weren't for this movie. So, what makes it so good? We are given a mysterious introduction to an old priest who would play a prominent role later. It gives layers to the character of young priest, which is quite interesting. The set up is done quite well. The story is being told quite well. And it has the most important aspect that most horror films today lack - the dread and actually terrifying scenes. Right from the opening credits, it feels uneasy. It tries to give us a really terrifying vibe. And it just intensifies further and further. Even the scenes having no tension don't feel like so. And, it cuts to some terrifying scenes so suddenly but smoothly that we will be exclaiming ""holy (you know what)!"". That's some true horror film. It was 1973. You had absolutely no technology or CGI. They still made an entire bed shake which looked so scary and realistic! The 180 degree turn is still an awesome effect. They did it way better, and all of it looked more realistic than CGI! It had some ideas involving Ouija board and exorcism, which are now termed as ""clichés"". Having watched so many horror films before watching this, it should've felt corny. But it felt real good. There is probably no horror movie, in particular a supernatural or gothic horror movie, that has not been inspired by this movie in some way or the other. And the ones which got as many things right as possible as in this one, were respectively better. This movie is a masterpiece!!Bad : It has sequels. Damn those pathetic sequels!!

10.0,One of the few movies to genuinely unsettle me,"The horror genre is a genre that has been growing on me overtime, and I genuinely believe The Exorcist is a landmark of it. Not just how much it's talked about or parodied, but also its ability to unnerve and unsettle me even years later. The Exorcist is a fantastic film, both as a film of its genre and of film full-stop. The effects are superb and have held up very well, and the sound is marvellous and adds to the many startling moments. The cinematography and scenery are also incredibly well done. The macabre, obscene demonstrations of manifest evil on display still startle even now, while William Friedkin's direction is one of his best and most intelligent of his career, not just making the scares genuine but also combining these with allegorical religious subtleties. The performances also lift, Linda Blair is really quite startling, and you couldn't have had more perfect support from Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn.

10.0,THE EXORCIST---A PERFECT FILM,"Many people complain that this movie's too slow but those are the kind of folks who only like 80-minute splatter films with characters so dumb and one-sided, you pray for the bad guy to kill them.

It takes the audience into the darkest recesses of humankind and then brings them back through a message of hope and self-sacrifice. The movie is NOT anti-religion, it's anti-evil. Anyone who likes smart, clever, meaningful horror-drama should see this film at least twice.

8.0,"Suspense , mystery , shocks and grisly horror is this classic terror film","This known story concerns about a mother (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter (Linda Blair), the latter is possessed and two Fathers , Karras (Jason Miller) and Merrin (Max Von Sidow) attempt to free Regan MacNeil from possession by the devil . Meanwhile , a Police Inspector (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the weird events . And the priests suffering incredible risks trying to unravel mystery of demon living inside Regan .This is a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story, based on a supposedly true flick . The movie begins well and grows more and more until the scary and eerie finale . Top-notch picture, thanks to fine acting , tight pacing , well mounted edition and skillful special effects with magnificent make-up by Dick Smith . Creepy acting by Linda Blair , due to death threats against Linda Blair from religious zealots who believed the film ""glorified Satan"", Warner Bros had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film's release . On the first day of filming the exorcism sequence, Linda Blair's delivery of her foul-mouthed dialogue so disturbed the gentlemanly Max Von Sydow that he actually forgot his lines . The script is awesome , the acting excellent and the direction by William Friedkin plenty of good pace and conviction . Enjoyable secondary cast such as Lee J Cobb , Kitty Winn and Jack McGowran who died at the time finished the movie and added a legend about Exorcist's curse . Dark cinematography in sinister and mysterious atmosphere by Owen Roitzman and frightening musical score adding Mike Oldfield's soundtrack ¨Tubular bells¨ .

10.0,"""You're telling me I should take my daughter to a witch doctor, is that it?""","When I reflect back on the movies of the 1970's, I'm struck by how many of them helped reinvigorate their respective genres. There was ""Star Wars"" for fantasy, ""Alien"" for sci-fi, and ""Jaws"" for the shark crowd, though I don't think that's really a genre. For horror fans, ""The Exorcist"" was the one that had everyone talking in 1973, and not only talking, but lining up around the block to get a chance to see it. In fact, the first time I tried, the person directly in front of me in line was the last one allowed in for that showing.When I finally did get to see it, the experience left a marked impression. It was fascinating, horrific, sensational and scary all at the same time. Having read the book, I wondered how much liberty would be taken with the story, but it was pretty much all there. At the time, hands down, it was the most frightening film I'd ever seen.The movie played last night as part of AMC's Halloween Fest, and though largely sanitized for TV, the impact of the film is still alive and well. It's a movie that plants a nagging seed of doubt in one's mind - what would happen if Satan himself could take over the body and soul of an innocent young girl? The gradual unfolding of the parallel stories in ""The Exorcist"" are built on credible real life situations, so that by the time Linda Blair's demon face appears on screen, you're ready to grab the holy water and say a prayer.Now if you're a younger viewer born of a more recent era, I'll grant that the film might not have the same effect. Though Blair's possession makeup was visually stunning at the time, special effects since then have far surpassed that effort. But it had to start somewhere, and as a precursor to virtually everything that followed, this was the one to top. And when Regan's head spins, yikes!, but I thought mine would too. For 1973, that was an incredible piece of work, with visuals that stay with you long after the film is over.",youre telling me i should take my daughter witch doctor is that it,when i reflect back movies 1970s im struck by how many them helped reinvigorate their respective genres there was star wars fantasy alien sci fi jaws shark crowd though i dont think thats really genre horror fans exorcist was one that had everyone talking 1973 not only talking but lining up around block get chance see it fact first time i tried person directly front me line was last one allowed that showing when i finally did get see it experience left marked impression it was fascinating horrific sensational scary all at same time having read book i wondered how much liberty would be taken with story but it was pretty much all there at time hands down it was most frightening film id ever seen movie played last night as part amcs halloween fest though largely sanitized tv impact film is still alive well its movie that plants nagging seed doubt ones mind what would happen if satan himself could take over body soul innocent young girl gradual unfolding parallel stories exorcist are built credible real life situations so that by time linda blairs demon face appears screen youre ready grab holy water say prayer now if youre younger viewer born more recent era ill grant that film might not have same effect though blairs possession makeup was visually stunning at time special effects since then have far surpassed that effort but it had start somewhere as precursor virtually everything that followed this was one top when regans head spins yikes but i thought mine would too 1973 that was incredible piece work with visuals that stay with you long after film is over,0.500516795865633,0.1228497600590624,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,Blair Gets Exorcised!,"The Exorcist (1973): Dir: William Friedkin / Cast: Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb: Terrifying masterpiece based on the book by William Peter Blatty. There are many Biblical accounts where Jesus himself drove demons out of people, so an exorcist is obviously someone who rids what doesn't belong. Ellen Burstyn stars as an actress whose daughter is possessed by demonic forces. After the shocking image of her daughter screaming atop a shaking bed, she seeks professional help. When doctors fail in finding answers it is suggested that a Priest see the girl. Intelligent, shocking with a sense of insight where Burstyn asks the right questions regarding exorcism. Quite an accomplishment for director William Friedkin who previously made another masterpiece in The French Connection. Burstyn brilliantly mirrors frustration mixed with fear. Linda Blair is both sympathetic and commanding as the possessed victim. Jason Miller plays a troubled Priest whom questions his faith after his mother's death. Lee J. Cobb steals moments as a police inspector. Then there is Max Von Sydow is compelling as the exorcist who sensed the demonic force in the film's opening and ultimately understands the standoff he will eventually face. A masterpiece in horror with excellent makeup and spellbinding measures of faith.

10.0,"Simply, the greatest ""Horror"" film ever made ...","What scares us more than anything? The answers are multiple : the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable. And when you think about it, all these elements have something in common: they refer to an unknown force whose presence is palpable. Indeed, the unknown scares, because it can't be seen, can't be controlled, therefore, can't be fought.These are the primitives fears that tortured the life of people since the dawn of humanity, and we inherited this fears in the same unconscious way our children will. We're aware of our mortal nature, and each of our fears is driven by this awareness, which is due to the biggest fear, the fear of the unknown. And the genius of ""The Exorcist"" is that it perfectly plays on these primitive instincts of ours, to provide the greatest Horror film ever made, a thrilling masterpiece of realism that'll haunt cinematic memories for ever. As soon as the Tubular bells start ringing, the film is inhabited by an atmosphere that will never desert it, a fearsome and gloomy ambiance absorbing any place we're watching the film in. Everything is directed with such confidence and meticulousness, the thrills almost come precociously. Indeed, before anything happens, we feel something WILL happen, but we don't know what. It seems like a cinematic trick, but not any director has the guts to let you wait more than almost half an hour before the oddities happen. The set-up is slow paced in ""The Exorcist"" because it's a movie that respects our intelligence, and doesn't try to provide cheap thrills. William Friedkin who had just made another realistic masterpiece, the Best Picture Winner ""The French Connection"" is so confident he gives us enough time to discover the characters, to get into their daily life, patiently waiting for the pivotal point that will join their fates. The direction, the writing are all in subtlety, and work because even though nothing happens yet, we keep our guard up, we know there's an evil presence somewhere, we can feel it.This is an old cinematic device started by directors who hadn't enough money to portray credible monster-type villains: they understood that sometimes, the scare is more efficient from the suggestion of a presence than its explicit depiction. When you see, you know, and if you know, you can control, but in ""The Exorcist"", the villain is here, but we never see him, he's like the shark from ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"", with a slight difference, he's not visible because he controls the body of a poor little girl. Linda Blair, as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil , is so convincing, it broke my heart to see how the evil can have so devastating effects on a pure little soul. And the tragedy of Regan is the torment of her mother, Chris, Ellen Burstyn, perfect as a totally helpless woman, incapable of saving her little girl. And this is the fascinating aspect of the film, more than a horror drama, it also works as a thrilling mystery. A mystery where the Lieutenant Detective Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience: we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And ""The Exorcist"" would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level: visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see ""The Exorcist"" in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting ""The Exorcist"" among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch ""The Exorcist"", one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations. And watching it at night (with someone, I would recommend) gets more hypnotic and absorbing after each viewing  ""The Exorcist"" is a must-see and ... be careful, any second, it can surprise you,

9.0,"One Genre Renewal movie: The Exorcist - Horror with no Crime, instead Horror with Spirits","Two terrible sequels and one irrelevant remake were never replaced with the original, the 1973 version of The Exorcist; and no other version will never be any more. Written for the screen and produced by William Peter Blatty, both The Exorcist movie and the novel are incident driven basis of the actual happenings from 1949.Looking at the most remarkable movies of 1973, there are 3 other important ones that the history of cinema will remember: -- A slow and touching movie from Ingmar Bergman ""Cries and Whispers"" -- Bernardo Bertolucci's depressive movie, a study of love ""Last Tango in Paris"" -- A crime story with Redford and Newman ""The Sting"". Among all and all the other movies that are produced in this year, The Exorcist stands one step further than the rest for its uniqueness on genre renewal. It's not the first movie that features the Demon in its content, yet in the Exorcist the Demon is introduced in the human level. The idea of being possessed by a spirit is used for the first time ever on the silver-screen. Horror genre featuring spirits didn't need to refer to Crime any more like it used to be in Hitchcock ages. Thus crime became a separate genre, and mostly acted conjointly with thrillers from now on.This uniqueness profits from its sound mixing, great lighting techniques and of course a perfect screenplay. Director William Friedkin was lucky to find his producer Blatty, being also the novel-writer and the idea creator. The plot and the story development goes very smoothly: From Father Merrin's encountering with the Demon Pazuzu in Iraq; to Ellen Burstyn looking for the cure for her daughter's disease, going for visits to every type of doctor... From the noises in the attic, to Regan's peeing on the rug... From decoding the Demon's speech of speaking English in reverse, to the arriving of Merrin... Both the editing and directing gave high qualities to this film.The 25th Anniversary edition DVD is in my movie collections. It's a must to have for horror fans. Either you have this version of DVD or the year 2000 version; you should check out the special features that reveals the real-life 1949 incident, the missing and the deleted scenes including the Spider-walk scene, sound mixing and sound effects tests show how they created the demon's voice and the BBC documentary: The Fear of God, all in the special features.",one genre renewal movie exorcist horror with no crime instead horror with spirits,two terrible sequels one irrelevant remake were never replaced with original 1973 version exorcist no other version will never be any more written screen produced by william peter blatty both exorcist movie novel are incident driven basis actual happenings 1949 looking at most remarkable movies 1973 there are 3 other important ones that history cinema will remember slow touching movie ingmar bergman cries whispers bernardo bertoluccis depressive movie study love last tango paris crime story with redford newman sting among all all other movies that are produced this year exorcist stands one step further than rest its uniqueness genre renewal its not first movie that features demon its content yet exorcist demon is introduced human level idea being possessed by spirit is used first time ever silver screen horror genre featuring spirits didnt need refer crime any more like it used be hitchcock ages thus crime became separate genre mostly acted conjointly with thrillers now this uniqueness profits its sound mixing great lighting techniques course perfect screenplay director william friedkin was lucky find his producer blatty being also novel writer idea creator plot story development goes very smoothly father merrins encountering with demon pazuzu iraq ellen burstyn looking cure her daughters disease going visits every type doctor noises attic regans peeing rug decoding demons speech speaking english reverse arriving merrin both editing directing gave high qualities this film 25th anniversary edition dvd is my movie collections its must have horror fans either you have this version dvd or year 2000 version you should check out special features that reveals real life 1949 incident missing deleted scenes including spider walk scene sound mixing sound effects tests show how they created demons voice bbc documentary fear god all special features,0.48641496598639455,0.21114625850340132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10.0,Unmatched brilliance,"There is a reason for the hysteria and mystique surrounding THE EXORCIST. And it's called genius.Never have I seen a film matched in shock, terror, writing, or performances. This isn't a horror movie. The film itself is both a moving and terrifying drama that takes a realistic look at what would actually happen if a young girl were possessed in modern America. William Peter Blatty's script is amazing, bringing depth to the characters, and presenting the mystery of faith that they all deal with. Is Regan possessed? Is she insane? And most importantly, Is there a God? In the course of two hours, we see a sweet and innocent young girl become a cross masturbating, head spinning, murderous, creature. We see a successful actress overcome skepticism to save her daughter, and we see a brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion to God as a priest.Friedkin's direction is marvelous, with wonderful uses of light, dark, and color throughout the film. Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) is beautifully subtle in his first film acting role. Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb provide engaging supporting performances as the experienced priest who senses his impending doom, and a detective who senses something sinister is at work. Ellen Burstyn gives a brutally honest performance as a grief stricken woman trying to save her daughter. And most of all, a 12-year-old Linda Blair gives one of the most terrifying, convincing, and beautiful performances ever shown on film. Her range of emotion and connection to Regan are astonishing. She deserved that Oscar!THE EXORCIST presents to us the mystery of faith in it's most raw form--the battle of good and evil. It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects. It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work. In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there.",unmatched brilliance,there is reason hysteria mystique surrounding exorcist its called genius never have i seen film matched shock terror writing or performances this isnt horror movie film itself is both moving terrifying drama that takes realistic look at what would actually happen if young girl were possessed modern america william peter blattys script is amazing bringing depth characters presenting mystery faith that they all deal with is regan possessed is she insane most importantly is there god course two hours we see sweet innocent young girl become cross masturbating head spinning murderous creature we see successful actress overcome skepticism save her daughter we see brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion god as priest friedkins direction is marvelous with wonderful uses light dark color throughout film jason miller as damien karras is beautifully subtle his first film acting role max von sydow lee j cobb provide engaging supporting performances as experienced priest who senses his impending doom detective who senses something sinister is at work ellen burstyn gives brutally honest performance as grief stricken woman trying save her daughter most all 12 year old linda blair gives one most terrifying convincing beautiful performances ever shown film her range emotion connection regan are astonishing she deserved that oscar exorcist presents us mystery faith its most raw form battle good evil it is incomparable masterpiece film done without aid computers special effects it relies story performances give us marvelous terrifying piece work end it makes us ask ourselves what we believe keeps us wondering shuddering at exactally what might be out there,0.652317062782179,0.1897606269699293,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"

7.0,It just doesn't scare me anymore...,"... and it was pretty scary when I saw it in 1974. Maybe the horror has shifted somewhat for me. In 1974 I was 16 and I was sheltered from the horror of real life. So horror films were the only thing that probably could scare me.Today it plays like a very good drama, and what scares me the most is being put in Ellen Burstyn's place as the mother and not having a clue as to what is going on with her daughter and the patronizing doctors with their useless and apparently painful tests. Also the parallel drama of Father Karras having a crisis of faith and of conscience over the death of his mother is well done and well played as part of the larger story.There is a great supporting cast with old veteran Lee J. Cobb as the cop. But there are some holes in the plot. I mean, what does Cobb think is going on anyways? Does he think a girl that sick can push a man out of a window? He's like a noir character in search of a villain. And, at least in the film, there is never a connection made between a girl in Georgetown, Washington D.C. suddenly becoming possessed and digging up an artifact in a foreign land. I haven't read the book, maybe there the connection is made. And what is going on with leaving a window open at night in Washington,D.C. As somebody who lives near there, I can tell you if you do this, something much scarier than a demon is coming in through that window! This is the big city, not Mayberry!Some production notes: Linda Blair was in fact 15 when this movie was made, not 12. The radiology technician in the hospital scene was a legitimate active serial killer at the time of filming. Max Von Sydow was only 44 at the time of filming, not a very old man. It's odd how he has always and convincingly played men much older than himself. The ""spider walk"" scene was added back into the film years later. I have no idea why they elected to take that out of the original release. It's a sledgehammer to the face. On second thought, maybe that is the reason they took it out.",it just doesnt scare me anymore,it was pretty scary when i saw it 1974 maybe horror has shifted somewhat me 1974 i was 16 i was sheltered horror real life so horror films were only thing that probably could scare me today it plays like very good drama what scares me most is being put ellen burstyns place as mother not having clue as what is going with her daughter patronizing doctors with their useless apparently painful tests also parallel drama father karras having crisis faith conscience over death his mother is well done well played as part larger story there is great supporting cast with old veteran lee j cobb as cop but there are some holes plot i mean what does cobb think is going anyways does he think girl that sick can push man out window hes like noir character search villain at least film there is never connection made between girl georgetown washington d c suddenly becoming possessed digging up artifact foreign land i havent read book maybe there connection is made what is going with leaving window open at night washington d c as somebody who lives near there i can tell you if you do this something much scarier than demon is coming through that window this is big city not mayberry some production notes linda blair was fact 15 when this movie was made not 12 radiology technician hospital scene was legitimate active serial killer at time filming max von sydow was only 44 at time filming not very old man its odd how he has always convincingly played men much older than himself spider walk scene was added back into film years later i have no idea why they elected take that out original release its sledgehammer face second thought maybe that is reason they took it out,0.47232794982794984,0.03973998223998225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,The Power of The Exorcist Compels You To Watch it!,"Almost 40 years has passed since ""The Exorcist"" was released and it still is a haunting, exciting, thrilling and frightening horror movie. Lists after lists are made to elect the best horror movie of all time and this film always manage to get to the Top of almost every single list. Not only that: it's also an very complex dramatic film with a compelling story. A story of a devoted mother to save her teen daughter of a strange possession.After finishing the filming of a movie the actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) finds herself with an awkward situation after her adorable daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave differently. She is taken to all the best doctors but nothing is found and doctors suspicion is that the kid may have a brain tumor. But after all the medical treatment fails and when Regan's starts to move frantically Chris is told to get a bigger help: a priest to exorcise what possessed her daughter. Father Karras (Jason Miller, incredible acting in his film debut) is called, but he himself is a tormented man, who has recently loss his elderly mother, almost faithless and with few skills to perform an exorcism. Even with all that he agrees to see the girl who has increasingly gone worst. She vomits, masturbates with a crucifix and says countless bad words and profanation. Karras's verdict: she's possessed by Pazuzu, a mysterious and powerful demon. But this demon has a weakness and this weakness is Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow in a very aged makeup), or better saying The Exorcist. Father Merrin knows everything about exorcisms and demons and he knows how to fight it. Even with all this knowledge (as it is showed in the beginning of the movie when he's in Iraq investigating an occurrence) you can feel that he has some fears, (his hands shaking) but he'll do everything to kill the demon and save the poor girl. The last 40 minutes with Karras and Merrin together performing the exorcism in that freezing and haunting bedroom is priceless, scary and the best horror moment of the 1970's. I must salute director William Friedkin for his efforts on present us a movie greater in its genre different of everything seen before. He was mean with actors to create realism but he get what he wanted and the audience was terrified by those images (Ellen Burstyn's face when she was thrown to the floor; Jason Miller's face after the vomit comes right into his face which wasn't supposed to happen). On the technical side of ""The Exorcist"" an interesting thing must be noticed: all the horror moments are shown without music. This works really great, it's not a manipulated movie where a soundtrack must be added to create tension. And without the music it was much more scarier and fun to watch, listening to all the strange sounds created by the sound group (Won Oscar). Makeup effects and visual effects are stunning and many of it it's not dated or old-fashioned. Impressive! About the screenplay: William Peter Blatty writer of the original book and the film's writer created a whole new thing here. The drama, the horror and even some humor are perfect. Although I think that some scenes, characters and clues aren't well explained, there's too much mystery. For example, we heard that the film director (Jack McGowran) died on the long stairs. This scene isn't showed and if it was it would be too frightening and unforgettable. After that the movie lover detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb, very good and funny) starts a investigation about the event. Then he gets some clues about many things he didn't even saw. The public may wonder how did he get to that evidence or clue. Two moments I would like to see or questions to be answered: Who puts the crucifix under Regan's bed? And what happened to Father Merrin in that bedroom after he leaves Karras and exorcise the girl alone? Not only the technical team worked well. All the actors have fantastic performances: Burstyn, Cobb, Miller, Sydow, Blair, even not professional actor the Reverend William O'Malley has a great performance here, and at last Mercedes McCambridge who plays the devil's voice (one thing I hated in the Portuguese dubbing version is that her voice was made by a man). Even being the biggest blockbuster of 1973 it only won 2 Academy Awards (Adapted Screenplay and Sound), and it deserved the award of Best Picture cause it was greater than ""The Sting"". And it must get a higher rating on IMDb's Top 250 list. This movie is awesome, one of the very few horror movies to still shock me, to not be dated or cheesy. If you haven't watched yet or didn't find time to watch it run and buy it if you can. The power of this film compels you to watch it now and over again. Must see film for horror fans and for movie lovers just like Lt. Kinderman. 10/10",power exorcist compels you watch it,almost 40 years has passed since exorcist was released it still is haunting exciting thrilling frightening horror movie lists after lists are made elect best horror movie all time this film always manage get top almost every single list not only that its also very complex dramatic film with compelling story story devoted mother save her teen daughter strange possession after finishing filming movie actress chris mcneil ellen burstyn finds herself with awkward situation after her adorable daughter regan linda blair starts behave differently she is taken all best doctors but nothing is found doctors suspicion is that kid may have brain tumor but after all medical treatment fails when regans starts move frantically chris is told get bigger help priest exorcise what possessed her daughter father karras jason miller incredible acting his film debut is called but he himself is tormented man who has recently loss his elderly mother almost faithless with few skills perform exorcism even with all that he agrees see girl who has increasingly gone worst she vomits masturbates with crucifix says countless bad words profanation karrass verdict shes possessed by pazuzu mysterious powerful demon but this demon has weakness this weakness is father merrin max von sydow very aged makeup or better saying exorcist father merrin knows everything about exorcisms demons he knows how fight it even with all this knowledge as it is showed beginning movie when hes iraq investigating occurrence you can feel that he has some fears his hands shaking but hell do everything kill demon save poor girl last 40 minutes with karras merrin together performing exorcism that freezing haunting bedroom is priceless scary best horror moment 1970s i must salute director william friedkin his efforts present us movie greater its genre different everything seen before he was mean with actors create realism but he get what he wanted audience was terrified by those images ellen burstyns face when she was thrown floor jason millers face after vomit comes right into his face which wasnt supposed happen technical side exorcist interesting thing must be noticed all horror moments are shown without music this works really great its not manipulated movie where soundtrack must be added create tension without music it was much more scarier fun watch listening all strange sounds created by sound group won oscar makeup effects visual effects are stunning many it its not dated or old fashioned impressive about screenplay william peter blatty writer original book films writer created whole new thing here drama horror even some humor are perfect although i think that some scenes characters clues arent well explained theres too much mystery example we heard that film director jack mcgowran died long stairs this scene isnt showed if it was it would be too frightening unforgettable after that movie lover detective kinderman lee j cobb very good funny starts investigation about event then he gets some clues about many things he didnt even saw public may wonder how did he get that evidence or clue two moments i would like see or questions be answered who puts crucifix under regans bed what happened father merrin that bedroom after he leaves karras exorcise girl alone not only technical team worked well all actors have fantastic performances burstyn cobb miller sydow blair even not professional actor reverend william omalley has great performance here at last mercedes mccambridge who plays devils voice one thing i hated portuguese dubbing version is that her voice was made by man even being biggest blockbuster 1973 it only won 2 academy awards adapted screenplay sound it deserved award best picture cause it was greater than sting it must get higher rating imdbs top 250 list this movie is awesome one very few horror movies still shock me not be dated or cheesy if you havent watched yet or didnt find time watch it run buy it if you can power this film compels you watch it now over again must see film horror fans movie lovers just like lt kinderman 10 10,0.553193976805088,0.1834545187322965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,They don't make em like they used to...,"""The scariest movie of all time"". Some movie goers agree and some disagree. I belong to the former group, though I would like to rephrase it to ""One of the scariest movies of all time"". For those of you who have been living in a cave for the past twenty two years, the story is of a pre-pubescent girl, Regan (Linda Blair), possessed by a demon whom purports to be the Devil himself (""Now kindly undo these straps!"").In this day and age of schlock fest horror films being relentlessly released (or spewed out for want of a better term) by the big wig studios on a quest to cash in on the latest teenage trend, this premise for a horror story may not seem so scary to most. However, it's the road we take to arrive at this supposition that makes this film stand out from the rest.The seeds of dread and fear are planted early with screen legend Max Von Sydow's Father Merrin receiving disturbing and familiar Omens of what is to come during an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.We're then taken to the setting where the real horror will begin in the Georgetown home of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a successful divorcée film actress living with her daughter Regan. We're initially presented with a Regan who loves horses, has a close and loving relationship with her mother, is uncomfortable with the strained relationship between her parents and has the innocent demeanour and narrow vocabulary of every normal young girl.The carefully crafted and ever so gradual change in Regan's personality, the strange drawings and figurines she creates, the emergence of Captain Howdy (Regan's imaginary friend) and strange outbursts (""You're gonna die up there"") and so called physical convulsions force Chris to turn to doctors and eventually psychiatrists to try and get to the bottom of Regan's ever worsening behaviour. Her vocabulary becomes quite extensive with spine chilling, sudden maturity and her outbursts more terrifyingly violent. After exhausting all the ""somatic"" possibilities for Regan's troubles Chris desperately seeks help from world weary Jesuit Psychiatrist Priest Father Karras (Jason Miller) requesting an exorcism.By the time Karras meets Regan, any semblance of the innocent young girl has completely vanished. Karras is grappling with his faith and subsequently doubts she is truly 'possessed'. Finally convinced that an exorcism is the way to go, he seeks permission from the Catholic Church, who grant him with the condition that he perform it with the help of the experienced Father Merrin.Merrin arrives like a knight in shining armour for the ultimate showdown! A great screenplay by William Peter Blatty (based on his book), intelligent directing from William Friedken and outstanding performances from all the cast, particularly Ellen Burstyn as the traumatised mother make for a classic piece of horror that will stand the test of time. 10/10",they dont make em like they used,scariest movie all time some movie goers agree some disagree i belong former group though i would like rephrase it one scariest movies all time those you who have been living cave past twenty two years story is pre pubescent girl regan linda blair possessed by demon whom purports be devil himself now kindly undo these straps this day age schlock fest horror films being relentlessly released or spewed out want better term by big wig studios quest cash latest teenage trend this premise horror story may not seem so scary most however its road we take arrive at this supposition that makes this film stand out rest seeds dread fear are planted early with screen legend max von sydows father merrin receiving disturbing familiar omens what is come during archaeological dig northern iraq were then taken setting where real horror will begin georgetown home chris macneil ellen burstyn successful divorc e film actress living with her daughter regan were initially presented with regan who loves horses has close loving relationship with her mother is uncomfortable with strained relationship between her parents has innocent demeanour narrow vocabulary every normal young girl carefully crafted ever so gradual change regans personality strange drawings figurines she creates emergence captain howdy regans imaginary friend strange outbursts youre gonna die up there so called physical convulsions force chris turn doctors eventually psychiatrists try get bottom regans ever worsening behaviour her vocabulary becomes quite extensive with spine chilling sudden maturity her outbursts more terrifyingly violent after exhausting all somatic possibilities regans troubles chris desperately seeks help world weary jesuit psychiatrist priest father karras jason miller requesting exorcism by time karras meets regan any semblance innocent young girl has completely vanished karras is grappling with his faith subsequently doubts she is truly possessed finally convinced that exorcism is way go he seeks permission catholic church who grant him with condition that he perform it with help experienced father merrin merrin arrives like knight shining armour ultimate showdown great screenplay by william peter blatty based his book intelligent directing william friedken outstanding performances all cast particularly ellen burstyn as traumatised mother make classic piece horror that will stand test time 10 10,0.540243271221532,0.10561594202898553,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,Deep Archetypical Contrasts,"In the documentary on the DVD, von Sydow says that if you are open to it, this film will scare you and perhaps affect you spiritually. Certainly true. Why this and not the many other similar films? Keep in mind that essentially all the rest of Friedkin's work is mundane, worthless.A large part of the question, I think, is that the creators of the film have stumbled into a rich field of archetypal conflicts, stuff deeper than just a sweet kid cursing and masturbating.The film is set in a Jesuit University. Even today, if you go there, you find a very strange vibe. The notion of authoritarian faith being crammed down from above certainly has a place in society, but such a brotherhood running an academy of open inquiry is a puzzling, disturbing mix. And that's underscored and mirrored by a similar (though less militant) conflict around psychiatry. Here we have the priests of `medicine' torturing this little girl to confirm their theories.The priest is the center of the film, and embodies all this: Arcane `faith' versus modern inquiry; Taking direction blindly rather than acting on knowledge; Understanding the mind versus understanding the soul; Serving the weak (his mother) versus battling powerful evil. Friedkin increased these ambiguities wherever he found them, usually against the positivist stance of Blatty.Interesting in this context are two tricks, one conscious, the other I suspect not.The conscious one is the self-referential wrapper. This is film about a film star, making a film. What triggers the possession are the visits by the director who probably had some deviant intent or action. He is the first victim. Thus, Friedkin places himself in the action and himself openly exploits Linda Blair. Meanwhile the actor playing the director dies in real life.The unconscious one is the Persian reference. Best scholarship has Judaism coming from Zoroastrianism flavored by Egyptian superficialities. A lower form of Zoroastrianism devolved into the much more widely adopted Mithraism, characterized by the warring of good and evil. This is sort of the professional wrestling of religious belief, both in style and substance, and continues today to be the root of `fundamentalism.' So in a very real way, Satan was invented in northern Iran, and any student of religion will end up `digging' around there.How sad and strange that this film seems to have bolstered the Catholic church.",deep archetypical contrasts,documentary dvd von sydow says that if you are open it this film will scare you perhaps affect you spiritually certainly true why this not many other similar films keep mind that essentially all rest friedkins work is mundane worthless large part question i think is that creators film have stumbled into rich field archetypal conflicts stuff deeper than just sweet kid cursing masturbating film is set jesuit university even today if you go there you find very strange vibe notion authoritarian faith being crammed down above certainly has place society but such brotherhood running academy open inquiry is puzzling disturbing mix thats underscored mirrored by similar though less militant conflict around psychiatry here we have priests medicine torturing this little girl confirm their theories priest is center film embodies all this arcane faith versus modern inquiry taking direction blindly rather than acting knowledge understanding mind versus understanding soul serving weak his mother versus battling powerful evil friedkin increased these ambiguities wherever he found them usually against positivist stance blatty interesting this context are two tricks one conscious other i suspect not conscious one is self referential wrapper this is film about film star making film what triggers possession are visits by director who probably had some deviant intent or action he is first victim thus friedkin places himself action himself openly exploits linda blair meanwhile actor playing director dies real life unconscious one is persian reference best scholarship has judaism coming zoroastrianism flavored by egyptian superficialities lower form zoroastrianism devolved into much more widely adopted mithraism characterized by warring good evil this is sort professional wrestling religious belief both style substance continues today be root fundamentalism so very real way satan was invented northern iran any student religion will end up digging around there how sad strange that this film seems have bolstered catholic church,0.42177350427350435,-0.013996489621489621,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Classic horror,"A classic among horror movies. Clever, well-planned plot. Solid direction by William Friedkin. Friedkin builds the tension masterfully. Incredible suspense and a very sinister and eerie feeling. Great shock value tooThe result is a very scary movie, and one which reminds you that horror movies don't have to be b-grade schlock, they can be works of art.Good performances all round. Three of the cast got Oscar nominations: Ellen Bustyn (leading actress), Linda Blair (supporting actress) and Jason Miller (supporting actor). No nomination for Max von Sydow but his performance is spot-on and the movie made his career.",classic horror,classic among horror movies clever well planned plot solid direction by william friedkin friedkin builds tension masterfully incredible suspense very sinister eerie feeling great shock value toothe result is very scary movie one which reminds you that horror movies dont have be b grade schlock they can be works art good performances all round three cast got oscar nominations ellen bustyn leading actress linda blair supporting actress jason miller supporting actor no nomination max von sydow but his performance is spot movie made his career,0.5705128205128206,0.10769230769230767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,The Exorcist stands firmly among the greatest films ever made.,"The Exorcist is widely regarded to be the scariest movie of all time. Personally, I would put it a little differently. Instead of calling it the scariest movie of all time, I think that it would be more accurate to say that it's the best horror movie of all time. These may be just two different ways of saying the same thing, but I think that there is a notable difference. I just watched The Exorcist again, and I experienced the nervousness and tension and fear that it was meant to cause and I jumped a few times, but I've watched several other horror movies that have caused those same feelings  The Shining, Pet Sematary, The Sixth Sense to a certain extent, even the remake of The House on Haunted Hill had a few quality scares. But I think that the thing that sets The Exorcist apart is that everything was just done right. The acting was great, the story was unique and well presented, the gruesome special effects were skillfully crafted, even the gore and the sickening profanity were put into the film with good reason and with good results. It's so rare to see a horror movie come along (and it gets rarer and rarer as time goes on) that is actually worth watching, and when one comes along that is absolutely ground-breaking, like The Exorcist, then it's a huge cinematic event. The Exorcist is just as timeless as horror films get, and it should be noted for its style and its effectiveness. There have been so many imitations of this film that have popped up over the years (which is to be expected, because it created so many possibilities), but none of them, not even any of the sequels, even come close to the greatness of the original. Not only is it original and unique, but it also contained some stunning performances, particularly on the part of Linda Blair as Regan, the 12-year-old girl who was the subject of the exorcism. There were some frankly shocking things that she did for the film, and the brilliant special effects and make-up added to that to make Regan's possession amazingly realistic, which is probably the most remarkable thing about the film. Another thing that was done especially well in The Exorcist was the sound effects. Probably one of the main reasons that the movie is so scary is because it is so unexpected and therefore so unsettling to hear some of those noises come from a little girl. William Friedkin's skillful but relentless directing style clearly played a large part in the convincingness of the final outcome, which stands as one of the definitive films in cinematic history.",exorcist stands firmly among greatest films ever made,exorcist is widely regarded be scariest movie all time personally i would put it little differently instead calling it scariest movie all time i think that it would be more accurate say that its best horror movie all time these may be just two different ways saying same thing but i think that there is notable difference i just watched exorcist again i experienced nervousness tension fear that it was meant cause i jumped few times but ive watched several other horror movies that have caused those same feelings shining pet sematary sixth sense certain extent even remake house haunted hill had few quality scares but i think that thing that sets exorcist apart is that everything was just done right acting was great story was unique well presented gruesome special effects were skillfully crafted even gore sickening profanity were put into film with good reason with good results its so rare see horror movie come along it gets rarer rarer as time goes that is actually worth watching when one comes along that is absolutely ground breaking like exorcist then its huge cinematic event exorcist is just as timeless as horror films get it should be noted its style its effectiveness there have been so many imitations this film that have popped up over years which is be expected because it created so many possibilities but none them not even any sequels even come close greatness original not only is it original unique but it also contained some stunning performances particularly part linda blair as regan 12 year old girl who was subject exorcism there were some frankly shocking things that she did film brilliant special effects make up added that make regans possession amazingly realistic which is probably most remarkable thing about film another thing that was done especially well exorcist was sound effects probably one main reasons that movie is so scary is because it is so unexpected therefore so unsettling hear some those noises come little girl william friedkins skillful but relentless directing style clearly played large part convincingness final outcome which stands as one definitive films cinematic history,0.5730093676814987,0.16412958626073376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"
