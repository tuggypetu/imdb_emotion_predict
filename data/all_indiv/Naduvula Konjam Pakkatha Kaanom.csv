9,New to Kollywood and foundation for future of Tamil cinema,"'The Vow' meets 'The Hangover'Actually it was based on a true incident which happened back in the 90s. Brilliant movie, never thought a Tamil movie can have a market for theme elements like it, I mean the movie had no songs especially duets in foreign locations, no known actors or a director and missing usual commercial masalas that we usually see in a Tamil movie. It all starts with a single sequence of comedy theme and takes to a couple of situations.I had an awesome time with this non-stop fun, especially expressions were simply great, everyone was good, Vijay Sethupathi had a great last year (20012) with back to back hits, just like 'Pizza' he excelled in his part, hope he continues his good work. I had lots of 'Laughing Out Loud's during a marriage reception scene.Hope many movies like it make on his way in the future. It is one of a top Tamil movie from the year 2012. Recommended, don't miss it especially if you know the language you will have wonderful time just like I had.9/10",new kollywood foundation future tamil cinema,vow meets hangoveractually it was based true incident which happened back 90s brilliant movie never thought tamil movie can have market theme elements like it i mean movie had no songs especially duets foreign locations no known actors or director missing usual commercial masalas that we usually see tamil movie it all starts with single sequence comedy theme takes couple situations i had awesome time with this non stop fun especially expressions were simply great everyone was good vijay sethupathi had great last year 20012 with back back hits just like pizza he excelled his part hope he continues his good work i had lots laughing out louds during marriage reception scene hope many movies like it make his way future it is one top tamil movie year 2012 recommended dont miss it especially if you know language you will have wonderful time just like i had 9 10,0.46064277983920837,0.23133696660482375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.19}"

8,One of the best in Tamil,"I watch films of all genres. I watch films in many languages, with the aid of subtitles for those in tongues that I am not fluent in. And so it's really not easy for a film to satisfy me. Though I can thoroughly enjoy a mindless commercial potboiler, when it comes to serious/art house films, they should be of really good quality to satisfy me. Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom (NKPK) is one such film that had me hooked till the end and I had no major complaints at the end of it. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a Tamil film to this extent.The movie has a thin premise, but a thrilling one. The film has a time line of 2-3 days and hence the locales and costumes are few. The story revolves around a certain 'Incident' and its aftermath that affects the lives of a group of friends. How the friends manage to manage through the crisis is the crux of the film. This could have been made as a serious film or a full length comedy, but the film makers tread the middle path with excellent results. There are no mindless jokes and forced situations to evoke laughter. The characters are genuine and the comedy too is subtle and stays with the film. I do not want to divulge more and spoil the experience for the readers who are yet to watch this film.The whole crew of Actors, Director, and Writers has done a commendable job. The film is said to be inspired by the incident that occurred in the life of the film's Cinematographer (Premkumar) and one of the friend's depicted on screen is actually the film's Director (Balaji Tharaneetharan). One of the real-life friends, Bhagavathi, plays himself on the screen and is a treat to watch. There are no conventional songs in the film and the background music is sufficient and apt. I felt the film could have done better with some crisp editing in the last 30 minutes. Though the production values appeared to be not so high, I think it was in line with the films context and atmosphere.I would urge all those who like to watch good cinema to watch Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom. It's a comedy thriller and will leave you with the satisfaction of having watched a good film",one best tamil,i watch films all genres i watch films many languages with aid subtitles those tongues that i am not fluent so its really not easy film satisfy me though i can thoroughly enjoy mindless commercial potboiler when it comes serious art house films they should be really good quality satisfy me naduvula konjam pakkatha kaanom nkpk is one such film that had me hooked till end i had no major complaints at end it it has been long time since i have enjoyed tamil film this extent movie has thin premise but thrilling one film has time line 2 3 days hence locales costumes are few story revolves around certain incident its aftermath that affects lives group friends how friends manage manage through crisis is crux film this could have been made as serious film or full length comedy but film makers tread middle path with excellent results there are no mindless jokes forced situations evoke laughter characters are genuine comedy too is subtle stays with film i do not want divulge more spoil experience readers who are yet watch this film whole crew actors director writers has done commendable job film is said be inspired by incident that occurred life films cinematographer premkumar one friends depicted screen is actually films director balaji tharaneetharan one real life friends bhagavathi plays himself screen is treat watch there are no conventional songs film background music is sufficient apt i felt film could have done better with some crisp editing last 30 minutes though production values appeared be not so high i think it was line with films context atmosphere i would urge all those who like watch good cinema watch naduvula konjam pakkatha kaanom its comedy thriller will leave you with satisfaction having watched good film,0.5171825396825398,0.19160548941798944,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,An Exceptional Movie From Tamil,"I have watched many Tamil movies. But this one just surprised me with its simplicity and charisma. There is no artificiality in the characters or in their makeup or in their acting. In many Tamil films, I had seen the comedy scenes just bulge out and doesn't fit well with the overall tone of the movie. But NKPK was an exception to it. Everything jells perfectly well into it and it made me laugh a lot. It was a surprise to me that this film was made out on a real event. This film was made with just 80 lacs and it grossed over 6 crores, which shows how good is this movie. Just watch and enjoy the fun.",exceptional movie tamil,i have watched many tamil movies but this one just surprised me with its simplicity charisma there is no artificiality characters or their makeup or their acting many tamil films i had seen comedy scenes just bulge out doesnt fit well with overall tone movie but nkpk was exception it everything jells perfectly well into it it made me laugh lot it was surprise me that this film was made out real event this film was made with just 80 lacs it grossed over 6 crores which shows how good is this movie just watch enjoy fun,0.46153846153846145,0.38974358974358975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.12}"
9,wow,"crisp, clear and making a thin story watchable and entertaining.... that's the movie all about. the casting has been done in such a way to suit the character and play it. the story being part of a original person's life story is amazing. moreover few comedy scenes stand out. the hero character's depiction of memory loss and repeating the same dialogues is highlight in the movie. it is a good entertainer.. there could have been more depth in the background music but i think the director wanted to keep it simple. watch it with family, friend and relatives, again and again and again.

7,A fantastic Tamil comedy-thriller based on disaster situations. A true story which is hard to believe but you have to believe.,"Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom (2012) : Brief Review -A fantastic Tamil comedy-thriller based on disaster situations. A true story which is hard to believe but you have to believe. A young man forgets a few years of his life just before evening even of marriage and then his 3 friends try everything to make the marriage happen. That's it, that's the storyline and there is nothing more to it. But wait, we have got plenty of gags and thrilling elements in the screenplay which even makes this ordinary story look extraordinary. Comedy is a difficult game you know, especially the situational comedy. The slapstick comedy is still easy, one can easily make a good watchable slapstick flick by using Whatsapp, Facebook jokes and Twitter memes. And the safe thing is, people don't expect logic in slapstick genre so it becomes even easier to use intentional and forceful comedy. Here, in this film, i don't say it has too much logic and all, rather i say don't expect any logic and just enjoy it until you find the proper logic in the end. The logic is not intellectual or something like that, it's just that the film is based on a true story therefore you have to believe the story, no matter how illogical it sounds. That's why it is a Fantastic of Distaster Situations. Vijay Sethupathi, Bagavathi Perumal, Vigneshwaran and Balaji are very good in their roles. They create such a natural bond with the Audience from the first scene that people just start finding themselves connected to it. That entire cricket scene and that entire wedding scene were so hilarious, I was laughing out loudly and screaming while watching it. The dialogues are damn funny. Balaji Tharaneetharan's direction is superb. Despite long runtime the film never looks boring or streched and that's his grasp over the narrative. Overall, a Fantastic Comedy with rich content and substantial evidences.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",fantastic tamil comedy thriller based disaster situations true story which is hard believe but you have believe,naduvula konjam pakkatha kaanom 2012 brief review fantastic tamil comedy thriller based disaster situations true story which is hard believe but you have believe young man forgets few years his life just before evening even marriage then his 3 friends try everything make marriage happen thats it thats storyline there is nothing more it but wait we have got plenty gags thrilling elements screenplay which even makes this ordinary story look extraordinary comedy is difficult game you know especially situational comedy slapstick comedy is still easy one can easily make good watchable slapstick flick by using whatsapp facebook jokes twitter memes safe thing is people dont expect logic slapstick genre so it becomes even easier use intentional forceful comedy here this film i dont say it has too much logic all rather i say dont expect any logic just enjoy it until you find proper logic end logic is not intellectual or something like that its just that film is based true story therefore you have believe story no matter how illogical it sounds thats why it is fantastic distaster situations vijay sethupathi bagavathi perumal vigneshwaran balaji are very good their roles they create such natural bond with audience first scene that people just start finding themselves connected it that entire cricket scene that entire wedding scene were so hilarious i was laughing out loudly screaming while watching it dialogues are damn funny balaji tharaneetharans direction is superb despite long runtime film never looks boring or streched thats his grasp over narrative overall fantastic comedy with rich content substantial evidences rating 7 10 by,0.6352845528455284,0.1671138211382114,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"

8,What a movie!! Wish all movies take a CUE from this one.....,"Clean comedy.....No unnecessary stuff throughout the whole movie. 5+ points for that alone!! I'm even willing to give the movie a 20 on 10.....The story, the cast, the performance, direction, screenplay etc. - a class apart. I thought the friend who played Vijay Sethupathi's friend (Bugs) was an actor!! The actual SHOCK came in the very end when I came to know that the movie was based on a real life story & the character Bugs played himself!!!!! Hats off!! Vijay Sethupathi, as usual, shines in histrionics, so do the rest. His character, being repetitive-dialogue-prone, still did not make me feel bored. Both his friends'(SARAS & Bhaji) facial expressions are what other ""stars"" should try to imbibe.After a VERY LONG time, I had a VERY HEARTY laughter a lot of times through the movie (after ANBE SIVAM, I guess). I could not even press the PAUSE button for a moment. I watched on TV via paid subscription service. Very gripping right through the end. How the ""story"" spans an entire 2+ hours on a thin thread of temporary memory loss of just a few days, without making the viewers batting an eyelid is a revelation. How the story was handled without deviating over to any unnecessary / unwarranted stunts should be applauded. Actually, I was in a dilemma in some of the scenes whether to feel sympathetic about the character PREM or laugh at the rollicking fun that is a part & parcel of the situations that unfurl when one loses memory temporarily.
