8,A very rare Malayalam cinema.,"AKV5.25 is a sci-fi comedy movie. A sci-fi genre is a rare case in Mollywood and we should note that the films under this genre are not remembered in Mollywood. But this movie will be remembered and cherished for a long time. The film is very funny and at the same time thoughtful. All the technical departments like direction, cinematography, editing, music etc. has done a very good job. They have done a pretty decent job in scenes in Russia too. All the performances were very good and Suraj Venjarammodu was another level. He was in his top form and he proves again that he is one of the best actors in Malayalam. Soubin Shahir have also done a good job. The performances of Saiju Kurippu, Kendy Zirdo and Maala Parvathi also deserves to be noted. One of the main character in this movie is the robot and they have done a very good job in making it realistic. The first half was very entertaining but the second half was very slow at some parts. The ending was also good and it will make us wonder for sometime.

7,"Funny, relevant, and occasionally thought-provoking! [+71%]","Sci-fi has never been Malayalam cinema's forte and previous efforts in the genre have largely been half-baked. Android Kunjappan is probably one of the most hard-hitting sci-fi entries in Indian cinema, and for that effort, writer-director Ratheesh Poduval deserves applause. The all-too-ghastly opening scene gives hints of a sci-fi spectacle. But in a jiffy, it cuts away to a by-now-familiar village setting in Kerala. The scene introducing Bhaskaran (played by a nuanced Suraj Venjaramoodu) and his notoriously grumpy attitude is terrific. It's a post-death-ritual scene laced with plenty of humour and it showcases Bhaskaran's shades sufficiently well.Subramanian is the son of Bhaskaran who hasn't made it big in life largely because he was forced to be around his ageing, needy dad. When the opportunity to take up a job in Russia pops up, he tries to pull off every trick in the book to ensure that he gets out of the small-town life and from the clutches of his dad. But his miseries don't end even while he's away in a different continent. Home-nurses leave as quickly as they arrive, citing Bhaskaran's tough-to-deal-with attitude. This is where the adorable Android (a prototype-project that Subramanian's employer is working on) superficially enters the life of Bhaskaran as a helping hand.While the intentions of the writer/director are genuine, how the way-too-old-fashioned Bhaskaran takes to the robot's growing presence in his life isn't portrayed properly. It feels more like a storyline contrivance that the writer does not want to address. The film asks its viewers to conveniently accept this because the scenes revolving around the idea are supremely entertaining and at times laugh-out-loud funny. It also helps that the humour is always situational and the lead characters are handled by actors such as Suraj and Soubin.The film is tonally all over the place. While it poses contemporary and relevant ideas, it also appears slightly regressive in its approach on very few occasions. That said, the bigger theme that the writer is trying to convey is of the sense of belonging that human nature comes packaged with and that every human being (however their outlook towards life maybe) long for care, affection, and attention. The point is not completely driven home through that detached finale though. This may also be the reason why the scenes in Payyanur can connect better with the audience than the ones that play out in Russia.The Russia sequences also feature a romantic development between Subramani and Hitomi (a half Malayali, half Japanese engineer and Subramanian's colleague) which aren't the film's most convincing stretches. But Kendy Zirdo does amp up the cuteness quotient of the already-cute flick (thanks to the appearance and mannerisms of the actual robot). Android Kunjappan's strong points also include the humour-filled dialogues/one-liners that writer/director Ratheesh Poduval offers to the supporting (fellow-villager) characters played by Saiju Kurup, Rajesh Madhavan, Unni Raja, Sivadas Kannur, Maala Parvathi, and many more.The film is very E.T-like in its approach. An unfamiliar entity landing in a regular neighbourhood and the impact it has on certain people - that's the core of Android Kunjappan as well. It does go the route of Joaquin Phoenix's Her for a bit, but thanks to the more-humour-and-less-depressing-philosophy treatment of the script, the film stays afloat. It's the little things that work in favour of Android Kunjappan and that's a fair reason to give it your time!",funny relevant occasionally thought provoking,sci fi has never been malayalam cinemas forte previous efforts genre have largely been half baked android kunjappan is probably one most hard hitting sci fi entries indian cinema that effort writer director ratheesh poduval deserves applause all too ghastly opening scene gives hints sci fi spectacle but jiffy it cuts away by now familiar village setting kerala scene introducing bhaskaran played by nuanced suraj venjaramoodu his notoriously grumpy attitude is terrific its post death ritual scene laced with plenty humour it showcases bhaskarans shades sufficiently well subramanian is son bhaskaran who hasnt made it big life largely because he was forced be around his ageing needy dad when opportunity take up job russia pops up he tries pull off every trick book ensure that he gets out small town life clutches his dad but his miseries dont end even while hes away different continent home nurses leave as quickly as they arrive citing bhaskarans tough deal with attitude this is where adorable android prototype project that subramanians employer is working superficially enters life bhaskaran as helping hand while intentions writer director are genuine how way too old fashioned bhaskaran takes robots growing presence his life isnt portrayed properly it feels more like storyline contrivance that writer does not want address film asks its viewers conveniently accept this because scenes revolving around idea are supremely entertaining at times laugh out loud funny it also helps that humour is always situational lead characters are handled by actors such as suraj soubin film is tonally all over place while it poses contemporary relevant ideas it also appears slightly regressive its approach very few occasions that said bigger theme that writer is trying convey is sense belonging that human nature comes packaged with that every human being however their outlook towards life maybe long care affection attention point is not completely driven home through that detached finale though this may also be reason why scenes payyanur can connect better with audience than ones that play out russia russia sequences also feature romantic development between subramani hitomi half malayali half japanese engineer subramanians colleague which arent films most convincing stretches but kendy zirdo does amp up cuteness quotient already cute flick thanks appearance mannerisms actual robot android kunjappans strong points also include humour filled dialogues one liners that writer director ratheesh poduval offers supporting fellow villager characters played by saiju kurup rajesh madhavan unni raja sivadas kannur maala parvathi many more film is very e t like its approach unfamiliar entity landing regular neighbourhood impact it has certain people thats core android kunjappan as well it does go route joaquin phoenixs her bit but thanks more humour less depressing philosophy treatment script film stays afloat its little things that work favour android kunjappan thats fair reason give it your time,0.44738880167451595,0.13052595112118925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9,A big salute to Malayalam Cinema for giving a lesson to Hollywood and World Cinema on how to make a Masterpiece Human Drama with Sci Fi touch.,"Android Kunjappan Version 5.25 (2019) : Brief Review -A big salute to Malayalam Cinema for giving a lesson to Hollywood and World Cinema on how to make a Masterpiece Human Drama with Sci Fi touch. What are those Cult sci-fi flicks you remember from world cinema? Let me help you, ok so the first Masterpiece in this genre was German Flick 'Metropolis' (1927) then there was a big gap untill we met Spielberg's 'ET The Extra Terrestrial' and Cameron's 'Terminator'. Then there were animated flicks like 'Big Hero 6' and 'Wall-E' and Shankar's action oriented 'Endhiran'. So, this is my list of those sci-fi flicks which had human characters as well as Machine character, of course that doesn't apply to ET but see, even in that film we had Alien's character which is sort of sci-fi, if not a machine. The point is these films tried to create a bond between Human and Inhuman character (that's perfect word i guess, better than Sci-Fi or Machines) and the cumulative efforts were highly moving. Here's something new with the same old storyline Android Kunjappan Version 5.25. It's highly innovative, very intelligent, smartly crafted story with heart at right place. It's just not that, it is something more that cannot be explained here in brief summary. It must be watched to feel it and understand and believe me, just like me you will also find it difficult to explain it to someone. What even Spielberg's ET couldn't achieve, that intellectual and thoughtful material is achieved by this film. This is not an overstatement, i mean it fully. It is much more emotional, clever and heart touching than ET, Period. I don't give 9/10* to even many Cult films, but I'm gonna give it to this film and the reason is, it has sent a message to world cinema that, ""yes, if we try then can do better than you."" The climax is so powerful and effective that it easily makes it one of the greatest film of the decade. Strongly recommended and i just wish that you really understand the subtle meaning of it.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest.",big salute malayalam cinema giving lesson hollywood world cinema how make masterpiece human drama with sci fi touch,android kunjappan version 5 25 2019 brief review big salute malayalam cinema giving lesson hollywood world cinema how make masterpiece human drama with sci fi touch what are those cult sci fi flicks you remember world cinema let me help you ok so first masterpiece this genre was german flick metropolis 1927 then there was big gap untill we met spielbergs et extra terrestrial camerons terminator then there were animated flicks like big hero 6 wall e shankars action oriented endhiran so this is my list those sci fi flicks which had human characters as well as machine character course that doesnt apply et but see even that film we had aliens character which is sort sci fi if not machine point is these films tried create bond between human inhuman character thats perfect word i guess better than sci fi or machines cumulative efforts were highly moving heres something new with same old storyline android kunjappan version 5 25 its highly innovative very intelligent smartly crafted story with heart at right place its just not that it is something more that cannot be explained here brief summary it must be watched feel it understand believe me just like me you will also find it difficult explain it someone what even spielbergs et couldnt achieve that intellectual thoughtful material is achieved by this film this is not overstatement i mean it fully it is much more emotional clever heart touching than et period i dont give 9 10 even many cult films but im gonna give it this film reason is it has sent message world cinema that yes if we try then can do better than you climax is so powerful effective that it easily makes it one greatest film decade strongly recommended i just wish that you really understand subtle meaning it rating 9 10 by,0.459900383707202,0.22576962809917356,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.4}"

9,A near-futuristic tale told in the most appropriate native background,"Android Kunjappan sets a precedent that any story/tale can be effectively communicated if told with all the native ingredients in it.The film attempts to introduce a near-future possibility i.e. a robot, into every household and how that would impact every Keralite in both good and bad ways. The focus is not on the impact, it's the bonding, yes it shows how humans especially old souls in helpless situations are so vulnerable to anything that obeys them, gives them due respect, listens to them patiently. This is the point where the film stands out as a clear winner.The movie is based on two pivotal characters, an ailing old man and the other one is a programmed robot. As expected the second half portrays combat between human & robot, in a rather unique style within the native boundary and subtly concludes on who makes it to another side.Suraj Venjaramoodu, the old man, yet again, delivers a spectacular performance. No doubt, he is getting into a top league of national talents when it comes to performing various roles with such ease and flexibility. I strongly feel, after Jagathy Sreekumar, we can rest assured for Suraj Venjaramoodu to carry this legacy, and this is strictly my opinion. Soubin Shahir, playing the son, does justice to his character, nothing extraordinary, this role is not meaty as the old man. The other ensemble cast especially the Arunachal girl Kendy Zirdo, who played the Chinese character so well. Off late, I'm seeing actors not from Kerala origin, playing their part aptly, not hampering/distracting the mood of the audience and kudos to the filmmakers for that.Another thing that struck me is the retention of simplicity throughout the movie, rather the filmmaker attempting to flaunt his intelligence by imparting technical gyaan, Visual effects, glorifying the science. Nothing of all that, this film drives on emotions, and it works big time.The film is not completely flawless, the second half goes haywire for a while, the character transformation of the son (played by Shoubin) in the second half looked forced, and the production design of the lab looked staged. These flaws stand nowhere when we experience the overall journey the film makes, its Supreme.Android Kunjappan- a film to be experienced for the old man especially, Must watch!",near futuristic tale told most appropriate native background,android kunjappan sets precedent that any story tale can be effectively communicated if told with all native ingredients it film attempts introduce near future possibility i e robot into every household how that would impact every keralite both good bad ways focus is not impact its bonding yes it shows how humans especially old souls helpless situations are so vulnerable anything that obeys them gives them due respect listens them patiently this is point where film stands out as clear winner movie is based two pivotal characters ailing old man other one is programmed robot as expected second half portrays combat between human robot rather unique style within native boundary subtly concludes who makes it another side suraj venjaramoodu old man yet again delivers spectacular performance no doubt he is getting into top league national talents when it comes performing various roles with such ease flexibility i strongly feel after jagathy sreekumar we can rest assured suraj venjaramoodu carry this legacy this is strictly my opinion soubin shahir playing son does justice his character nothing extraordinary this role is not meaty as old man other ensemble cast especially arunachal girl kendy zirdo who played chinese character so well off late im seeing actors not kerala origin playing their part aptly not hampering distracting mood audience kudos filmmakers that another thing that struck me is retention simplicity throughout movie rather filmmaker attempting flaunt his intelligence by imparting technical gyaan visual effects glorifying science nothing all that this film drives emotions it works big time film is not completely flawless second half goes haywire while character transformation son played by shoubin second half looked forced production design lab looked staged these flaws stand nowhere when we experience overall journey film makes its supreme android kunjappan film be experienced old man especially must watch,0.43687943262411344,0.060283687943262436,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.48}"
8,Capsule Review: Android Kunjappan 5.25 (8 Stars),"While asking all the difficult questions associated with man's attempt at using artificial intelligence to simplify life, Android Kunjappan version 5.25, a superbly made entertainer that keeps on giving despite its long running time, takes a friendly, chill approach and drives a much more important point home. About human connections, their dynamics, and the possibility of technology replacing them. I was literally gobsmacked a few times watching this humorous, socially relevant film that could not have been released at a more proper time, often wondering what length the makers might have gone to craft it. Whether it is the electric performances (it is not fair to focus only Suraj Venjaramoodu as each one of the cast strike gold here), the characterisation of a whole village, and the dialog writing, this debut feature Ratheesh Poduval is bound to receive cult status sooner than its contemporaries will have it, especially at this juncture in Malayalam cinema where great, groundbreaking films are coming out every other Friday with no stop in sight.

8,Light Sci-fi drama in a down-to-earth setting,"Very novel for malayalam cinema.There is plenty of good humor all through the movie. Rustic humor mostly.There were some digs at other movies too.Soubin has performed very convincingly and has become the son. Performance reminiscent of ""Sudani from Nigeria"". No really challenging scenes otherwise for Soubin, but has totally become the son.Suraj Venjaramoodu had much more scope for performance. While in general, Soubin seemed to have blended in to the character better than Suraj, there was a very challenging scene towards the end where Suraj proved his mettle. A scene that could fall into pieces without Suraj's mastery.It was not a perfect movie. There were portions that were not convincing, inexperience was telling here and there. However, this is the kind of attempt that needs to be encouraged.Bijibal's music did not blow my mind.The emotional connect of technology reminded me of the movie ""Her"". The movie has attempted to bring technology close to the people who would typically shy away from technology, and has done a pretty good job at it. Also reminded me of ""Oridathu"" which spoke about how a village responds to electricity, while ""Android Kunjappan"" is about how a village responds to robotics.As the movie was presenting unconvincing portions in between, I was a bit worried about how the climax would turn out. It was better than anticipated.Slow-paced, easy watch. Very unique presentation.

8,A fresh perspective.,"Suraj Venjaramoodu gives us another great performance after Finals and Vikruthi. Android Kunjappan is a fresh take on relationships and technology. Only problem with the movie was few dialogues were difficult to hear and we can't understand what they are saying. Some dialogues were not funny enough. That was me nitpicking. Now, I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. Can't exactly call this a Sci-Fi movie. Because it's not about any scientific things. Yes there's an advanced robot with a certain level of intelligence. But still, can't call it Sci-Fi. That robot walking is one of the cutest things I've seen in recent times. 😍 Watch it.",fresh perspective,suraj venjaramoodu gives us another great performance after finals vikruthi android kunjappan is fresh take relationships technology only problem with movie was few dialogues were difficult hear we cant understand what they are saying some dialogues were not funny enough that was me nitpicking now i definitely recommend this movie everyone cant exactly call this sci fi movie because its not about any scientific things yes theres advanced robot with certain level intelligence but still cant call it sci fi that robot walking is one cutest things ive seen recent times watch it,0.5785714285714285,0.11071428571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.5}"

8,With an emotion less creatures.,"I can't find any sci-fi sort of thing in this movie but instead I watched a human being who is emotion less in context. A nice concept which talk about the new approaches of technology that along with usage of computer, mobile phones and other daily life home appliances.
