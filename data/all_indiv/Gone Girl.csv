9.0,"Mixed feelings, hear me out.","There's no denying that this is a great film and from what I've heard a great book as well, you can see that I gave it a 9/10 rating, but there's a catch especially for me personally with this movie. The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind.

10.0,"A Cynical, Masterful Caricature of Modern Relationships","Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous fa√ßade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?""Gone Girl"", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""Gone Girl"" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: ""This case is about what people think of you.""Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where ""Gone Girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.""Gone Girl"" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier.

8.0,"Gone, but definitely not forgotten","Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride.'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening.If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.",gone but definitely not forgotten,wow actually thriller thats pretty good yes its fair say that gone girl is really engrossing film as with almost every film its based book as with most films based book i havent read book so i havent got clue how well film relates source material but then i dont care i just enjoyed ride gone girl is one those films where you dont want say too much about fear giving things away spoiling it people who havent seen it ben affleck plays reasonably decent husband whose well do wife disappears media circus that follows then starts reveal that truth is far more complicated that it first seems not mention obligatory police investigation its fair say that what follows is film that twists turns so you only really get one chance watch it not know whats coming many people dont really like affleck when it comes acting even less now hes due don batsuit but i think most people will relate him as he gets pursued hounded unfairly youll have wait see by media rosamund pike plays his gone wife with flawless american accent again youll have see whether shes found alive or dead story bounces around back forth time making sure youre just confused enough never put too much together before films ready reveal whats happening if i had one complaint its that film is little too long perhaps ten fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around three quarters mark just speed it up but thats minor gripe basically if you like your thrillers twisty turny have couple hours spare film that you really have concentrate give this one go,0.5007452574525745,0.15579268292682927,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6.0,Great Hype for a Too Long Movie with Plot Holes and a Deceptive Conclusion,"In Missouri, the unemployed writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) goes to the bar The Bar that he owns with his twin sister Margo Dunne (Carrie Coon) on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary and they talk and play a board game. Then he goes home and finds that his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) is missing. He calls the police and Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) is in charge of the investigation with Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). As long as the investigation proceeds, the evidences show Nick as the prime suspect of murder while the media fiercely attacks him. But is Amy really dead?Spoilers ahead: ""Gone Girl"" is a movie with great hype, but actually it is a too long movie with plot holes and a deceptive conclusion. In addition, the lead characters are non-charismatic. The good thing is the criticism to the hypocrite behavior of the media. Amy leaves her house but no neighbor sees her. The diary in the stove is partially burned and the detective does not suspect that something is wrong. Amy travels but she does not change her face, lodges in a low-budget hotel and nobody recognizes her. Internet shopping is delivered by courier; wouldn't the postman keep a record of who received the expensive delivery? The house by the lake of Neil Harris has surveillance cameras everywhere. The police and the FBI do not check the footages along the almost thirty days she claimed to be kidnapped. The police officers do not investigate how she could have a stiletto to kill Neil. She leaves the hospital covered in blood. Last but not the least, who would live with a psychopath and assume someone else's baby?

8.0,Interesting end,This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.,interesting end,this is 2 5 hour movie sometimes these days its difficult me stick with longer movies but this never felt long you were always curious what was going lets just say it didnt quite go way i expected but i was intrigued whole time acting was great this could sure be considered slow burn im actually currently watching tv show sharp objects by same author this is paced much better than that theres couple things i didnt particularly thing got solved or like how they went at end but overall great movie,0.505718954248366,0.13480392156862747,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Shock and Awe,"How on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it ""utter tripe"", ""an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense"", ""wish I had missed it"". Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?!Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this. You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year. And it only gets better from there.Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over. It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more. The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right.This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso. And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film. All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much.A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all.",shock awe,how earth is this film attracting so much criticism this is one best films 2014 people are labelling it utter tripe enormous heap illogic nonsense wish i had missed it are these people serious can we no longer appreciate or even identify great film gone girl is peerless plot driven story about wife who goes missing seems pretty ordinary right well its not it doesnt take very long at all any sane viewer recognise this you start watching as you do with any mystery you start collecting clues piecing together explanation events which have taken place but no sooner than you have formed perfect explanation your mind is it immediately swept away most overwhelming twist year it only gets better there gone girl is roller coaster only youre riding it dark you dont know where next turn is you cant see where youre headed you have no idea how many more ups downs youre going experience before its all over its film that keeps you guessing just as youre beginning once again think youve got it all figured out game changes its all up air once more diary exposition format is also very clever was executed perfectly many films fall victim losing viewer when jumping back forth between past present yet gone girl you guessed it does it just right this film ranks high mystery thriller genre it is just as compelling perplexing as shutter island if not then moreso lets not forget acting ben affleck rosamund pike do phenomenal job their roles as husband wife not line feels out place both seem as though they were born play nick amy dunne by end film i felt so immersed their story that i found it hard believe it was just film all all i one am thoroughly pleased with gone girl i knew watching trailer it would be something i would like i just never imagined it could thrill me this much very underrated overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all,0.5446092796092796,0.20982295482295482,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!","I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator."" The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic.

9.0,Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best,"David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",another david fincher winner one years best,david fincher me is one most talented directors around today while se7en personal opinion is his best film gone girl is up there with his best fincher directs with his usual superb class giving film great style keeping story alive gone girl is easily one years best directed films whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes creepy atmosphere brilliantly gone girl is also film that makes good use digital after seeing many directors over using or cheapening it it was refreshing see technique done with taste trent rezner atticus rosss music score gives film haunting vibe adds much unsettling intensity that lot film at least two thirds worth managing not do it your face manner use sound mixing was interesting came off cleverly almost like distant thought process gone girl also has brilliantly written adapted script that does great job balancing dark humour thats not overused is often hilarious suspense mystery cool girl monologue particular is masterpiece script writing one my favourite film monologues ever while story apart taking bit time get starting is absorbing start finish rich detail characterisation is filled with shocks unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed leave you reeling that it is adapted superb source material one best books ive read recent memory actually helps it that it is faithful it is commendable case being faithful source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful not what they seem characters are incredibly interesting richly developed especially amy who is one most chilling female characters year acting is one high points film as good as finchers direction score are its rosamund pikes knockout turn as amy restrained she only has raise eyebrow or something like that it says lot but quite terrifying mode especially third act that makes film it will be great surprise if she isnt at least nominated because it is easily her best performance ben affleck has other not what they seem role plays it with oozing charm brooding intensity while neil patrick harris surprisingly excels very against type role who knew he could be sinister tyler perry oozes charisma is very funny carrie coon is standout support its tricky role moral compass film but coon is touchingly likable it ending does my liking end too suddenly storytelling got implausible lazy at this point but apart that gone girl was winner one best year 9 10 bethany cox,0.5465817901234566,0.27656635802469137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1.0,If you are blonde and beautiful the police will believe everything you say,"Gone Girl is based on convoluted premise: a psychotic plot to frame somebody for your murder. This deranged idea is not popular for movie plots and could have been worth exploring. It was developed much better in the great film noir ""Leave her to heaven"", where the framing was done in a subtler way. But we do not live in subtle times, so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence.For the few who still do not know the plot, the story is about unhappy couple Amy and Nick. Ben Affleck, woody and expressionless as usual, is creepy Nick the unfaithful husband. During the first half hour he is - quite convincingly - the main suspect for the disappearance of Amy.Beautiful Rosamund Pike is psycho crazy wife Amy, a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws. She manipulates every man she meets. At the end of the movie, even FBI detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes, just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said.Amy's plotting is given away much too soon in the movie, so we spend two very long hours just following around the demented blonde while Nick gets in big trouble, only for Amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed.Does it make much sense?

7.0,"Good movie, reflecting witch hunt mentality in social media/TV","I never wrote a review before in my life so please excuse my poor attempt, but after reading some of the reviews I just felt I had to give it a try.I really thought this movie was very good. It's starts as the typical ""missing wife, husband main suspect, no body yet found"" tale we all have seen once in our lives. But after the first act it really gets extremely unsettling and special. I felt sick in between because of the horrible, frightening character of Amy. I can't describe it any further and think you should simply give it a try.SPOILERS!!!!I now would like to address certain plot holes many people have been pointing out. First of all, every movie has plot holes. I'm usually the first to notice, and even though there were some things that bothered me I got over them quite quickly since the movie had a tight grip on me.Many are mentioning to different cameras in Desis house. First of all I know that many surveillance cameras overwrite their data after some time, so it is very likely that only the last few days (where she never left or entered the house) would be available to the police. Second of all, as far as I could see, the cameras only showed the outside of the house not what was happening IN the house. That's why she went near the window, which was within the perimeter of one of the cameras, to do her screaming attack. If you pay attention, you never see Amy appearing on any of the cameras when she checks them, only when she actually wants to be seen.I could address many other so called ""plot holes"". I don't think they actually were plot holes per se, but made intentionally in order for us watchers to go...""But wait, how does she get away with this??"". Think of the police officer who is in doubt of Amy's statements or even the lawyer.What Fincher in my opinion wanted to demonstrate is the exemplary control Amy had over the public, were no questions were asked, nobody ever doubted her. It is kind of symbolic for witch hunts we ourselves have witnessed on TV or social media, were no second opinion is sought, nobody looks at the story from a second angle. Amy is the personification of the American Sweetheart, and is treated as such. It just shows us how blind and angry the crowd gets when you push certain buttons, Amy herself actually talks about that in the car scene. The pregnant intelligent wife, who was cheated by her husband. Or the poor girl next door who was always nice to the strange kid. Or the rich guy who thought he could have everything. That is basically the story and that's why this film is so intriguing in my opinion. It's a mirror of how our society in the age of internet, social media, TV etc. functions. How we can be tricked into anger or sadness, and how little people actually question certain statements.",good movie reflecting witch hunt mentality social media tv,i never wrote review before my life so please excuse my poor attempt but after reading some reviews i just felt i had give it try i really thought this movie was very good its starts as typical missing wife husband main suspect no body yet found tale we all have seen once our lives but after first act it really gets extremely unsettling special i felt sick between because horrible frightening character amy i cant describe it any further think you should simply give it try spoilers i now would like address certain plot holes many people have been pointing out first all every movie has plot holes im usually first notice even though there were some things that bothered me i got over them quite quickly since movie had tight grip me many are mentioning different cameras desis house first all i know that many surveillance cameras overwrite their data after some time so it is very likely that only last few days where she never left or entered house would be available police second all as far as i could see cameras only showed outside house not what was happening house thats why she went near window which was within perimeter one cameras do her screaming attack if you pay attention you never see amy appearing any cameras when she checks them only when she actually wants be seen i could address many other so called plot holes i dont think they actually were plot holes per se but made intentionally order us watchers go but wait how does she get away with this think police officer who is doubt amys statements or even lawyer what fincher my opinion wanted demonstrate is exemplary control amy had over public were no questions were asked nobody ever doubted her it is kind symbolic witch hunts we ourselves have witnessed tv or social media were no second opinion is sought nobody looks at story second angle amy is personification american sweetheart is treated as such it just shows us how blind angry crowd gets when you push certain buttons amy herself actually talks about that car scene pregnant intelligent wife who was cheated by her husband or poor girl next door who was always nice strange kid or rich guy who thought he could have everything that is basically story thats why this film is so intriguing my opinion its mirror how our society age internet social media tv etc functions how we can be tricked into anger or sadness how little people actually question certain statements,0.43907913165266116,0.0595045518207283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.,"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",if fincher was looking out do himself he has succeeded,gone girl marks finchers tenth feature film his most mature work since fight club centering nick dunne husband desperately trying find his wife all while having police media accuse him murder story sounds straight out scott peterson case film looks unlike any film ive seen recent years lead by all star cast featuring ben affleck rosamund pike tyler perry neil patrick harris gone girl rises above pack with smart storytelling phenomenal pacing perfect performances what gone girl does so brilliantly is taps into audiences psyche regarding marriage ideology behind sanctioned union that is corrupt it is really heavy stuff when story really gets meat bones it all with plenty twists turns gone girl keeps you not only second guessing whole idea marriage but intentions every character film it is truly one most twisted films adapted even sicker twisted book thats out there right now gillian flynn does wonders with her adaption her own novel dialog is crisp characters are multi layered it truly is pitch perfect script that doesnt have one false moment it ben affleck rosamund pike are excellent this film this is different affleck very human realized affleck nick dunne is wonderful role him captivates just how good he can be with terrific director harris perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared affleck pike david fincher his long time collaborator cinematographer jeff cronenweth create dreary horrific tone gone girl that makes every twist turn that much more gut wrenching every shot is meticulously planned showing each shot as if it were still frame that spoke thousand words it is truly gorgeous filmmaking now score trent reznor atticus finch deliver perfect score besting their social network girl with dragon tattoo score if reznor won social network i fully expect not only nomination but win this film overall this is mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings truly get full experience it is impeccably made beautifully acted all around near perfect film,0.6126785714285713,0.2378472222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.,"The first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing, the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers. To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not the case with Gone Girl.Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn into thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock movie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's narrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is a lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy to overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish really well. This may be the very reason why he is completely overlooked.And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a contemporary piece of work!

10.0,Fincher has done it again! A brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns,"As if it wasn't safe to say already, but after Gone Girl there is little doubt or argument to be made against the fact that David Fincher is one of the most consistently great directors working in the industry today, for Fincher's latest efforts behind the camera with this meticulously made, perfectly paced and often thrilling story is movie-making of the highest order. Gone Girl (exactly like it's source text) is a mystery/thriller that steadily morphs into what can equally be described as a darkest of dark comedy, a searing account of married life and an edge of your seat police procedural, all elements that combine to create one of the year's best films. Fincher from day one has shown an uncanny ability for visual atheistic, haunting and atmospheric surrounds and with the help of his composers (this time once more teaming up perfectly with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) finely moulded musical accompaniments and Gone Girl shows off all these skills once more. The suburban surrounds of the world of Gone Girl shun the safety in numbers feel that they provide these residents; it's not dissimilar to a world akin to Blue Velvet where beneath the grassy exteriors lies deep seeded secrets that threaten to tear at the seams of idealistic marriages and those double lives we people lead. Fincher relishes every element of Gone Girl from the mysteries through to the reveals and like only a handful of movies each year this project feels like the perfect meeting of subject and maker who meet in synch to create such a finally tuned product. Fincher really has become the master of the thriller genre, much like Scorsese with his mob pictures and after Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and now Gone Girl, there is a legacy to his directional work that will forever be hard to match much like Fincher's continued fine work with his actors. Much noise was made initially by rabid fans of Gillian Flynn's source novel about the casting of leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy Dunne but after witnessing first hand one of the year's best double acts by the two on form actors there will be little doubt that the casting choices were staggeringly spot on. Affleck is at his polarising best at Nick Dunne a man we as an audience are unsure of, do we like this man or do we loathe him? It's refreshing to see Affleck put in such an assured turn, from inappropriate smiling through to outright rage, Affleck's turn is an award worthy one that in a less standout year for the male acting category would be a turn featuring strongly come February. While Affleck once more showcases a talent we all know he has, the breakout turn from Rosamund Pike is the films largest revelation. Finally given a chance to chew through not only a high profile but layered role, Pike excels as the ""amazing"" Amy at the centre of this twisted and depraved tale. Pike truly creates one of not only the years but modern day cinemas most memorable and unique leading ladies, a creation who at any given time can be compelling, outrageous, disgusting and calculated, it really is a stunning turn to witness and it would be unwise to suggest that Pike isn't now head and tails ahead in the female acting awards circuit. Surrounded by quite amazing supports from Kim Dickin's dogged detective Rhonda Boney, Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister Margo, Tyler Perry (proving there's more to the man than Magdea's fat suit) as high profile lawyer Tanner Bolt and Barney Stinson himself Neil Patrick Harris in a box cutter sharp turn as creepy rich man Desi Collings, Pike and her on screen hubby Affleck are encompassed around by one of the years strongest ensembles. Without spoiling any of Gone Girl's many varied and unexpected twists and turns (this is the type of movie best seen with as little knowledge as possible), this is a movie thriller of the highest order that shouldn't be watched by those expecting an everyday murder/kidnapping mystery, for what transpires throughout this tale is anything but your run of the mill narrative. One of the most involving movies of recent memories, Gone Girl is bitingly funny, white knuckle tense, starkly violent and as we've come to expect from Fincher, quite brilliant. Gone Girl is without question one of the year's best films, one of the year's most unique films and one of the films of this year that you can't dare to miss. 5 Gummy Bears out of 5",fincher has done it again brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns,as if it wasnt safe say already but after gone girl there is little doubt or argument be made against fact that david fincher is one most consistently great directors working industry today finchers latest efforts behind camera with this meticulously made perfectly paced often thrilling story is movie making highest order gone girl exactly like its source text is mystery thriller that steadily morphs into what can equally be described as darkest dark comedy searing account married life edge your seat police procedural all elements that combine create one years best films fincher day one has shown uncanny ability visual atheistic haunting atmospheric surrounds with help his composers this time once more teaming up perfectly with trent reznor atticus ross finely moulded musical accompaniments gone girl shows off all these skills once more suburban surrounds world gone girl shun safety numbers feel that they provide these residents its not dissimilar world akin blue velvet where beneath grassy exteriors lies deep seeded secrets that threaten tear at seams idealistic marriages those double lives we people lead fincher relishes every element gone girl mysteries through reveals like only handful movies each year this project feels like perfect meeting subject maker who meet synch create such finally tuned product fincher really has become master thriller genre much like scorsese with his mob pictures after seven fight club zodiac girl with dragon tattoo now gone girl there is legacy his directional work that will forever be hard match much like finchers continued fine work with his actors much noise was made initially by rabid fans gillian flynns source novel about casting leads ben affleck rosamund pike as nick amy dunne but after witnessing first hand one years best double acts by two form actors there will be little doubt that casting choices were staggeringly spot affleck is at his polarising best at nick dunne man we as audience are unsure do we like this man or do we loathe him its refreshing see affleck put such assured turn inappropriate smiling through outright rage afflecks turn is award worthy one that less standout year male acting category would be turn featuring strongly come february while affleck once more showcases talent we all know he has breakout turn rosamund pike is films largest revelation finally given chance chew through not only high profile but layered role pike excels as amazing amy at centre this twisted depraved tale pike truly creates one not only years but modern day cinemas most memorable unique leading ladies creation who at any given time can be compelling outrageous disgusting calculated it really is stunning turn witness it would be unwise suggest that pike isnt now head tails ahead female acting awards circuit surrounded by quite amazing supports kim dickins dogged detective rhonda boney carrie coon as nicks twin sister margo tyler perry proving theres more man than magdeas fat suit as high profile lawyer tanner bolt barney stinson himself neil patrick harris box cutter sharp turn as creepy rich man desi collings pike her screen hubby affleck are encompassed around by one years strongest ensembles without spoiling any gone girls many varied unexpected twists turns this is type movie best seen with as little knowledge as possible this is movie thriller highest order that shouldnt be watched by those expecting everyday murder kidnapping mystery what transpires throughout this tale is anything but your run mill narrative one most involving movies recent memories gone girl is bitingly funny white knuckle tense starkly violent as weve come expect fincher quite brilliant gone girl is without question one years best films one years most unique films one films this year that you cant dare miss 5 gummy bears out 5,0.5467222222222222,0.20517592592592593,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
2.0,"Cheap, Contrived, Exploitative","""Gone Girl"" is a contrived, exploitative, pretentious film that aims for the middlebrow audience and hits its mark. The filmmakers insert ‚Äì no pun intended ‚Äì a sex scene every ten minutes or so, and alternate those with buckets-of-blood scenes of violence, and utterly predictable flashlight searches for clues of a Nancy Drew level of sophistication. If you want to see someone stabbed to death while climaxing during sex and bleed out like an upside down pig, this is the film for you. The dialogue is pseudo-clever. Example: a man compliments a woman seated at a table full of strangers by informing her that she has a ""world-class vagina."" She smiles girlishly. The film is capped up with a plot twist so implausible it blasted me right out of the movie onto the moons of Jupiter by the author's straining, sweating, thuddingly manipulative hand. And then the movie piles on the single most unbelievable ending I have ever seen. There are movie surprises that rearrange the furniture inside your head and make you shout, ""Oh! Of course! How could I not have seen that? Now everything makes so much more sense!"" The best such surprise is in the film ""Sixth Sense."" ""Gone Girl"" surprises you by showing how desperate a writer can get.Warning: The rest of this review will reveal the ending of ""Gone Girl."" If you don't want to know the ending of ""Gone Girl,"" stop reading now. Nick (Ben Affleck) is married to Amy (Rosamund Pike). They live in Missouri, the show me state. Amy disappears and Nick is under suspicion. Did he kill her? So, now, you are thinking that ""Gone Girl"" will explore the interesting question we all ask when beautiful young women disappear and their husbands are suspected of murder. Those questions are: How could a loving marriage go so wrong? How could a marriage look perfect on the outside and be rotten on the inside? How could a loving husband murder his own wife? Does our 24/7 media coverage encourage us to form lynch mobs? Forget it. ""Gone Girl"" explores none of this. Nick had cheated on Amy with one of his students. Hurt, Amy faked her own disappearance. Amy is incredibly beautiful, the star of a series of children's books, a sexual Tantric master, a psychopath, and a criminal mastermind. Heck, the filmmakers may as well just added invisibility, flight, and the ability to conjugate Polish verbs at will to Amy's list of superpowers. She is that unbelievable. Amy just wants to hurt Nick, because he hurt her. So she flawlessly fakes her own murder. Amy seeks shelter from Desi, an old boyfriend, Neal Patrick Harris, whom she had accused of stalking her. Desi makes Amy his virtual prisoner in his lake house. He, too, is a criminal mastermind, psychopath, and Tantric sex master, and his lake house is carefully designed to prevent Amy from escaping from their hot sex, good food, and discussions of opera and philosophy. You had no idea Missouri was this interesting, did you? You'll never call it ""flyover country"" again, will you? Amy stabs Desi when he is climaxing during their hot sex. Buckets of blood gush out of him. The director wants you to see all this ‚Äì this is what you bought your ticket for, is it not? Certainly not for intelligence or heart. Amy returns to Nick. No one bothers to indict Amy for Desi's murder, because she is incredibly beautiful, famous, and a criminal mastermind. And because the plot of this movie holds together like a wet Kleenex. Nick knows that Amy is a murderer and that she attempted to frame him for her murder and only returned after that went wrong. Nick hates and fears Amy. And Nick stays with Amy, as her husband. The End. I think the author of ""Gone Girl"" was trying to use flamboyantly exaggerated premises to comment on a few themes: none of us can fully understand what keeps marriages together, women are terribly hurt by infidelity, beautiful women can use manipulation and sex to get what they want in life. All of these themes are genuinely interesting, and good art inspired by them is compelling. I kept thinking of ""The Country Girl,"" a brilliant treatment of a complex marriage that outsiders don't understand. TV coverage of the Laci Peterson murder was ten times more watchable, interesting, and educational than the idiotic ""Gone Girl"" could ever hope to be. ""Body Heat"" was a hundred times better as a depiction of a hot blond wrapping a big, dumb, handsome guy around her finger. And ""Body Heat""'s plot twist leaves ""Gone Girl"" in the dust. Ben Affleck's broad shoulders and chest look really good here. His acting is vapid, absent, and clueless, appropriate to the part of a man manipulated by a woman. Rosamund Pike's performance as a human who could never actually exist is good. Basically, she's playing a Star Trek space alien, and she does it well. The excellent Tyler Perry is wasted.",cheap contrived exploitative,gone girl is contrived exploitative pretentious film that aims middlebrow audience hits its mark filmmakers insert no pun intended sex scene every ten minutes or so alternate those with buckets blood scenes violence utterly predictable flashlight searches clues nancy drew level sophistication if you want see someone stabbed death while climaxing during sex bleed out like upside down pig this is film you dialogue is pseudo clever example man compliments woman seated at table full strangers by informing her that she has world class vagina she smiles girlishly film is capped up with plot twist so implausible it blasted me right out movie onto moons jupiter by authors straining sweating thuddingly manipulative hand then movie piles single most unbelievable ending i have ever seen there are movie surprises that rearrange furniture inside your head make you shout oh course how could i not have seen that now everything makes so much more sense best such surprise is film sixth sense gone girl surprises you by showing how desperate writer can get warning rest this review will reveal ending gone girl if you dont want know ending gone girl stop reading now nick ben affleck is married amy rosamund pike they live missouri show me state amy disappears nick is under suspicion did he kill her so now you are thinking that gone girl will explore interesting question we all ask when beautiful young women disappear their husbands are suspected murder those questions are how could loving marriage go so wrong how could marriage look perfect outside be rotten inside how could loving husband murder his own wife does our 24 7 media coverage encourage us form lynch mobs forget it gone girl explores none this nick had cheated amy with one his students hurt amy faked her own disappearance amy is incredibly beautiful star series childrens books sexual tantric master psychopath criminal mastermind heck filmmakers may as well just added invisibility flight ability conjugate polish verbs at will amys list superpowers she is that unbelievable amy just wants hurt nick because he hurt her so she flawlessly fakes her own murder amy seeks shelter desi old boyfriend neal patrick harris whom she had accused stalking her desi makes amy his virtual prisoner his lake house he too is criminal mastermind psychopath tantric sex master his lake house is carefully designed prevent amy escaping their hot sex good food discussions opera philosophy you had no idea missouri was this interesting did you youll never call it flyover country again will you amy stabs desi when he is climaxing during their hot sex buckets blood gush out him director wants you see all this this is what you bought your ticket is it not certainly not intelligence or heart amy returns nick no one bothers indict amy desis murder because she is incredibly beautiful famous criminal mastermind because plot this movie holds together like wet kleenex nick knows that amy is murderer that she attempted frame him her murder only returned after that went wrong nick hates fears amy nick stays with amy as her husband end i think author gone girl was trying use flamboyantly exaggerated premises comment few themes none us can fully understand what keeps marriages together women are terribly hurt by infidelity beautiful women can use manipulation sex get what they want life all these themes are genuinely interesting good art inspired by them is compelling i kept thinking country girl brilliant treatment complex marriage that outsiders dont understand tv coverage laci peterson murder was ten times more watchable interesting educational than idiotic gone girl could ever hope be body heat was hundred times better as depiction hot blond wrapping big dumb handsome guy around her finger body heat s plot twist leaves gone girl dust ben afflecks broad shoulders chest look really good here his acting is vapid absent clueless appropriate part man manipulated by woman rosamund pikes performance as human who could never actually exist is good basically shes playing star trek space alien she does it well excellent tyler perry is wasted,0.5961507936507938,0.15677001103471686,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

I'm a prolific author and so did I.A woman (Rosamund Pike) frames her husband (Ben Affleck) for her own murder, even though she's simply disappeared.The first part of the film is the investigation and finding out what really happened from the wife, Amy, herself; the rest of the film covers what happens as a result.Most people hated the ending, which felt ambiguous to some. I thought it was okay.The cast is excellent, with Ben Affleck doing a good job in the lead. Talk about turning your career around.

On hand is also Tyler Perry as an attorney, Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-beau Desi, Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit as the police investigating the case, and Sela Ward as Sharon Scheiber.This is another winner for David Fincher, who proves again that his casting is as skillful as his directing.I'm not familiar with the book.

8.0,The Horrors of Domesticity,"The basic premise is as old as the movies.An abduction leads to a media-circus.Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one day to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing search and all the subsequent events, which shall not be revealed here, draw the viewer closer and closer into a complex world of everyday suburban reality and everyday suburban horror.As if it needed to be pointed out, this balance of reality and horror, or horrendous reality, is the domain of Mr. Fincher. In his clear-cut no-nonsense style he has fashioned a powerful mystery-thriller that lands somewhere between Hitchcock, Lynch, Bergman and Chabrol. Although vastly different directors, they have shared an interest in dissecting reality and human nature.Profiting from two exceptional lead actors (doubts about Mr. Affleck's acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled), it is Ms. Pike, who reveals herself as an immensely versatile and unpredictable force in this movie. Over more than ten years Ms. Pike has played big parts in small movies, or small parts in big movies (such as Pride & Prejudice"", Wrath of the Titans"" or Jack Reacher""). Under the guise of Mr. Fincher she excels in every aspect and if any contenders for awards are to be named so early in the season, hers would be one of the first names (next to the outstanding cast of Richard Linklaters Boyhood"") to be written down.Visually stunning as one would expect from Fincher, with an immersive soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross and an editing rhythm that cuts like a knife through the tissue of the story and its characters, Gone Girl"" leaves no doubt about its craft and the deceptive nature of its source novel by Gillian Flynn. The author adapted her book into a tightly wound screenplay, that adds fuel to an already burning analysis of modern marriage and human frailty.The themes are familiar to Fincher, but he assembles them in an expertly fashion. And we are left wondering, amidst the suspense, about many of the so called estimable American values of the 20th century, that have now come crashing down under the weight of an economic, political and spiritual crisis.",horrors domesticity,basic premise is as old as movies abduction leads media circus nick dunne ben affleck comes home one day find his wife amy rosamund pike missing ensuing search all subsequent events which shall not be revealed here draw viewer closer closer into complex world everyday suburban reality everyday suburban horror as if it needed be pointed out this balance reality horror or horrendous reality is domain mr fincher his clear cut no nonsense style he has fashioned powerful mystery thriller that lands somewhere between hitchcock lynch bergman chabrol although vastly different directors they have shared interest dissecting reality human nature profiting two exceptional lead actors doubts about mr afflecks acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled it is ms pike who reveals herself as immensely versatile unpredictable force this movie over more than ten years ms pike has played big parts small movies or small parts big movies such as pride prejudice wrath titans or jack reacher under guise mr fincher she excels every aspect if any contenders awards are be named so early season hers would be one first names next outstanding cast richard linklaters boyhood be written down visually stunning as one would expect fincher with immersive soundtrack by trent reznor atticus ross editing rhythm that cuts like knife through tissue story its characters gone girl leaves no doubt about its craft deceptive nature its source novel by gillian flynn author adapted her book into tightly wound screenplay that adds fuel already burning analysis modern marriage human frailty themes are familiar fincher but he assembles them expertly fashion we are left wondering amidst suspense about many so called estimable american values 20th century that have now come crashing down under weight economic political spiritual crisis,0.3407974300831444,0.05322184429327287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.47}"
1.0,Astonishingly bad plot,"If this had been written and played as a straight-out dark comedy - and if it had been at least half an hour shorter - perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie. But since it has been presented as a serious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - that of disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience. For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said - and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there's no record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does she keep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of the shed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. The shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman. They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are bought online. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated, whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi is supposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnapped her. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes it to her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace. Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds up at Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner. Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13. Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - which causes her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme money belt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all her money. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to be made of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, but isn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds - supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amy winds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash the blood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amy tried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possible death sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) in order to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have been criminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live in the same county as this woman, let alone in the same house? I could go on, but I realized before the movie was halfway over that I had already wasted too much of my life on it.",astonishingly bad plot,if this had been written played as straight out dark comedy if it had been at least half hour shorter perhaps it would have passed as run mill movie but since it has been presented as serious mystery it has committed cardinal sin filmmaking that disrespecting intelligence or perspicacity audience us film represents significant achievement that it contains more larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen weve seen many this was even worse than babel that said warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory following is by no means comprehensive list major holes plot so ladies gentlemen start your engines drive your semis straight through impressive array plot stupidity 1 amy buys car listed craigslist cash so theres no record purchase how about title license where does she keep car until she needs it how does she get it when she needs it without being seen 2 amy buys lots tech toys crams her sister laws shed with them how does she get into out shed without her sister law who doesnt like her noticing 3 shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman they dont notice accumulating gadgets 4 gadgets are bought online who is signing them 5 when gadgets are investigated whose fingerprints will be all over them if there are any 6 desi is supposed have broken into house beat her bloody kidnapped her theres blood all over kitchen but none where she would have been dragged out house 7 as he supposedly leaves house with at best barely conscious amy desi picks up her diary takes it her father laws place attempts burn it furnace why 8 how does desi know where amys father law lives 9 several days elapse time supposed kidnapping until amy winds up at desis lake house can nobody attest desis being at home during time he was supposed be kidnapping amy 10 what will be made video cameras at lake house not showing anyone there first several days 11 desi was supposed be holding her prisoner did nobody at casino notice them there including man who thought she looked familiar 12 where does amys car wind up 13 phone records i amy makes anonymous phone call tipping police off contents shed no record that 14 amy scores hole one at miniature golf jumps up down joy which causes her money belt fall off this apparently was acme money belt loan wile e coyote 15 couple robs amy all her money being psycho she is are we believe that she is going let them get away with it 16 phone records ii what is going be made amys phone call desi sure it was pay phone but isnt it going raise any flags 17 amy self inflicts wounds supposedly bathroom out sight cameras make it seem as though she has been bound raped yet wouldnt cameras show her entering bathroom without wounds emerging with wounds 18 amy winds up hospital upon her return they put wristbands her one guesses they examine her but they dont bother wash blood off her 19 do they also fail notice that there is no evidence injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts blood at initial kidnapping 20 nick knows that amy tried set him up her murder thus opening him up possible death sentence he also knows that when her plan blows up she elects murder someone who has never wronged her other than being male order cover up her actions which until that point may have been criminal but not capital offenses why does nick elect live same county as this woman let alone same house i could go but i realized before movie was halfway over that i had already wasted too much my life it,0.4368863049095607,0.03937925769321119,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.47}"
5.0,Gone girl is actually good???,"That's pretty much what 99% of movie buffs will wonder when they see the meta score on imdb for this thriller. It's actually decent, maybe even good?Well, it really depends on where you're coming from - if you're a finsher fan, and you were expecting something on par with the amazing, genre-busting fight club, I have bad news: this is a well constructed thriller but nothing special. A particularly long VO exposition sequence mid-movie seriously ruins this film chances at greatness.On the plus side, if you need something to keep yourself distracted on a rainy saturday, this isn't bad at all.The problem really is that the characters are paper thin, especially the wife, and I'm told that this is a major shift away from the complexity and subtlety of the book it's adapted from. Everything that happens in the movie is telegraphed 15 minutes ahead. Everything.Some have said the movie is a critique of feminism - nonsense. The movie is a critique of media circuses and mob mentality. But while it maintains a nice balance in the form of Afflek's character flaws, it doesn't offer the same when it comes to his wife.Performances are fairly subpar by the way - at some point one character jokes they feel like in a 'law and order' episode and well, not sure if it was intended to be so meta , but it hits the nail right on the head.",gone girl is actually good,thats pretty much what 99 movie buffs will wonder when they see meta score imdb this thriller its actually decent maybe even good well it really depends where youre coming if youre finsher fan you were expecting something par with amazing genre busting fight club i have bad news this is well constructed thriller but nothing special particularly long vo exposition sequence mid movie seriously ruins this film chances at greatness plus side if you need something keep yourself distracted rainy saturday this isnt bad at all problem really is that characters are paper thin especially wife im told that this is major shift away complexity subtlety book its adapted everything that happens movie is telegraphed 15 minutes ahead everything some have said movie is critique feminism nonsense movie is critique media circuses mob mentality but while it maintains nice balance form affleks character flaws it doesnt offer same when it comes his wife performances are fairly subpar by way at some point one character jokes they feel like law order episode well not sure if it was intended be so meta but it hits nail right head,0.5759559884559886,0.1260010822510823,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,Fincher makes this worthwhile,"GONE GIRL is another epic-length feature from director David Fincher, in which he gets into the nitty gritty of the material like few other directors can. This one's based on a bestselling novel about a wife's disappearance in which the finger of suspicion falls on her own husband. It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments. But at the same time I didn't really feel anything about what I was watching, and some of the moments feel very artificial and contrived, as if they could only come from a writer's mind rather than happen in real life.",fincher makes this worthwhile,gone girl is another epic length feature director david fincher which he gets into nitty gritty material like few other directors can this ones based bestselling novel about wifes disappearance which finger suspicion falls her own husband its good whodunit style mystery which twists turns throughout keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments but i did find it rather long winded suffering lack likeable characters finchers hands its enjoyable film its certain that both ben affleck rosamund pike rise occasion deliver lots intense character moments but at same time i didnt really feel anything about what i was watching some moments feel very artificial contrived as if they could only come writers mind rather than happen real life,0.6090225563909775,0.07855889724310777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.48}"
2.0,A Half Decent Cast Offer Bad Performances In An Awful Movie,"The cast of ""Gone Girl"" is half decent. The leads are relatively big names - Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy (not the biggest, but certainly known.) The supporting cast wouldn't cause me to swoon, but they're decent enough (people like Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris are in this.) But regardless of the so-called ""critical consensus"" (which seems to be very positive) you don't have to get very far into this to discover that you have a half decent cast in what's at best a third-rate movie.I thought the performances by and large (from everyone) were awful. It's as if this half decent cast realized from the start that they were starring in one dog of a movie. The story had some potential. As it starts Amy and Nick are a seemingly happy young couple on top of the world, with money and in love. But things don't work out well for them, they lose their jobs and they have to move from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's elderly parents and everything about their life unravels. Ultimately - and here's where the whole thing (which wasn't that good to start) falls apart - Amy fakes her own death, and manages to frame Nick for her murder. Nick isn't a good guy - in fact there's not a single character in this movie who's really likeable or sympathetic, except possibly Det. Boney (Dickens) - and once his wife is ""killed"" he becomes the immediate prime suspect (more by the tabloid media than by Boney, who's never entirely convinced about what's happening.) He gets portrayed as a sociopath, but it's really Amy who's the crazy sociopath. The first hour or so of the movie deals with Nick being hounded by the police and media. Then comes the twist - Amy is alive and hiding out, and we get flashbacks now to see how she set the whole thing up. Then another plot twist as Amy's hiding out crashes and burns; then another plot twist with the ex-boyfriend she seeks refuge from; then another plot twist as she returns home. It's not interesting - it's more mind-numbing. It goes on way, way, way too long. Once you get to the third or fourth plot twist you're wondering ""good God - how long can this go on?"" And it goes on far too long. Actually once we're into the story that follows the last plot twist I actually found myself chuckling at times (especially at discovering that the police and hospital have sent Amy back home after she resurfaces, still covered in blood - they could't clean her up?) I wasn't chuckling because it was funny - but because it was just so bad. To me, it seems as if to really like this movie you have to be one of those pathetic ""professional victim"" men, who think women and the world are all out to get them. This will certainly feed their paranoia.
