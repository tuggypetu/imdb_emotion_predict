9.0,For all I know you are the rat; and this might be the best heist homage movie ever?,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.It feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.Tarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.Yet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of ""ultra-violence,"" it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.And that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10",all i know you are rat this might be best heist homage movie ever,reservoir dogs is debut director writer quentin tarantino it stars harvey keitel steve buscemi tim roth michael madsen chris penn lawrence tierney tarantino has minor role as does criminal turned author eddie bunker it feels bit silly write it now but there was time when reservoir dogs barely made ripple cinema loving world america that is upon its release states it was moderately successful comfortably made back its 1 2 million budget however upon hitting british shores it was big hit grossed nearly 6 5 million then pulp fiction exploded world 94 reservoir dogs got reappraised its home country rest as they say is history tarantino most enthusiastic film fans was once video store clerk redondo beach there he dreamed making his own movies planned make reservoir dogs with his friends relatively small budget as luck would have it keitel got hold script wanted with his name attached using his contacts serious budget was raised so dogs were set loose at time its popularity tarantino had guardedly fend off accusations plagiarism charge just hacking older classic heist movies his argument was that he was making his own homage heist caper but even so fact remains that reservoir dogs is spliced killing kansas city confidential big combo taking pelham one two three we can definitely throw asphalt jungle as well yet reservoir dogs is still extraordinarily fresh vibrant raising bar crime movies modern era tarantino course has since gone prove his worth with other projects so truth his homage movie was merely foot door talented son knoxville tennessee terms its dialogue tho its gleeful use ultra violence it has few peers any decade it also helps considerably that tarantino has assembled quality cast make his non linear classic shine keitel is given but roth is exceptional as too is buscemi while madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho hire mr blonde then theres 70s soundtrack vital part narrative as we hear dulcet tones steven wright djing k billys super sounds seventies if you have not seen film yet then i promise you will remember stealers wheel stuck middle rest your cinema loving days thats thing with reservoir dogs its crammed packed full memorable things quip bang song or wtf ending as homages go its one very best 9 10,0.4965014245014245,0.19958689458689455,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,"Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed, disturbingly violent, and incredibly powerful films.","Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that ""less is more."" This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there's no make-up to make them look pretty, there's little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film. Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.",quentin tarantino begins his directing career with first several chronologically mixed disturbingly violent incredibly powerful films,reservoir dogs is testament idea that less is more this doesnt apply violence film is extremely violent beginning end but details botched diamond heist which entire film is based are conveyed only dialogue except one scene where mr pink steve buscemi recalls his escape whole film takes place after failed robbery is over mystery that unfolds among criminal participants is amazing watch this is not normal crime film thing that really sets reservoir dogs apart all others is that it is pure when you look at screen youre looking at reality there are no hollywood actors theres no make up make them look pretty theres little no comic relief most important all theres no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown detrimental trademark so many action films as well as virtually all jerry bruckheimer films instead all that garbage tarantino decided just present film as simply straightforwardly as possible by doing that he makes it seem that youre really looking at bunch criminals trying figure out what do after suspiciously failed robbery even though most actors were known at time this film was made film was delivered such way that you dont see actors at all you only see brutal characters that they portray it is genuinely frightening imagine being same room with any them this is quality that is rarely achieved any kind film make no mistake reservoir dogs is among most violent films ever made some scenes are really painful watch but way that reality is captured is something that justifies violent excesses this film violence is never glorified nor is criminal lifestyle when films are overly violent they usually get branded as such but despite extreme violence reservoir dogs still manages deliver important overall message about consequences your actions it remains high growing list tarantinos classic films it will not be soon forgotten,0.5925786163522012,-0.04930592991913746,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"These 'Dogs' bark a lot, but they bite, too ...","Bloodily violent, irreverently shocking, politically incorrect, inventively funny and so on and so forth I'm trying to find the right expression to describe ""Reservoir Dogs"" and I finally got it, it stands in three letters: N-E-W. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema, so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience, a deliverance with a quite original and cool-sounding name: Quentin Tarantino, the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is more than a debut; it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation, and THE reference in independent film-making.Tarantino invented a new style that would never desert his films, and would make each of his creation, the epitome of coolness. It's so fresh to watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" now and to realize how new it was at that time. I remember the first time I watched the film, I was 17, and the movie literally blew me away in every single aspect, and I guess the fact that I wasn't familiar with the Internet or IMDb was a good thing since it didn't intercede with my approach of the film. I didn't want to know what's so cool about Tarantino, I just discovered him with his film, shortly after watching ""Pulp Fiction"", and for some reason, I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"" a little more. Tarantino quickly became my favorite director as a teenager, and in my early 20's because of this level of creativity in the writing, the directing, and the editing.The writing is Tarantino's trademark and his greatest quality, the movie starts with a whole discussion about the meaning of ""Like a Virgin"" told by a fast-speaking Tarantino, himself as Mr. Brown, then a whole debate starts about tipping and non tipping. That's the question raised by the first minutes of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the least we could say is that the talk is so trivial it sounds real and authentic in its rawness and makes the characters more human, if not sympathetic. More generally, the whole characterization is driven by dialogs so delicately vulgar you never miss the action, or wait for something 'to happen'. Script 'happens' in Tarantino's films, like meals you've already eaten but with a new special taste, something juicy, creamy, and spicy. It's almost an indigestion of creativity  I don't need to tell you the lines, if I start them, you know the rest : ""You shoot me in a dream "", ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?"" etc. etc. And these dogs not only bark, but they do bite a lot.Indeed, if the movie was all dialogs, it wouldn't have had the same impact. It's like Tarantino already knew his lesson, and wanted to make something big, from the beginning. From the iconic slo-mo walking scene down the alley with the opening credits, you get the idea that this ""Little Green Bag"" song will be the 'hallelujah' glorifying the birth of a new style of film-making, and instinctively, you know something special will happen after these credits, and you're not disappointed by what follows. Blood, blood all over the car seat, and probably one of the most convincing painful screams ever. You really can feel for Tim Roth in that scene, it's like the real actor got one real bullet, and the rest is the touching expression of a growing friendship between Roth as Mr. Orange, and Mr. White, his mentor played by Harvey Keitel. He combs his hear, whispers something that provoke Orange's cute but heartbreaking smile: the chemistry is so believable, you understand that the movie is not just about cool dialogs. Then, comes Mr Pink as Steve Buscemi, asking who the rat is! Because this is the first serious element we have. It's the story of a botched jewel robbery, with a traitor among these gangsters. This question will be the starting point of the narrative with three specific back stories told in flashback.The three characters depicted in flashback are Mr. White, Mr. Orange, and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde. And in the memorable-action department, the winner is undoubtedly Mr. Blonde: the one who provided the most iconic and recognizable moment of the film. The iconic ear-cutting scene with the ""Stuck In the Middle With You"" music, like a reminiscence of ""A Clockwork Orange"" rape scene with 'Singin' in the Rain' as a musical background, the scene is disturbing, violent, bloody, but also  iconic. The violence is not meant to be cool, but just to show how psychotic Mr. Blonde, one of the most twisted gangster villains, is. And his torture is also crucial because it will unmask Mr. Orange as the snitch, and will make his relationship with White, even more complex. In one minute, the movie raises a new dimension, deeper and more tragic.Forget the cool and raunchy dialogs, the creative editing, where flashbacks interfere with parallel stories, as when we witness a great scene where Orange tells a story within another story. Too many insertions as to create a confusing feeling until the last iconic scene : after the slo-mo opening, the ear-cutting, the Mexican stand-off, as the last memorable scene that would lurch this movie into Pop Culture. Forget the wonderful ensemble cast with so many colorful characters (literally) and such believable actions and reactions like childishly arguing about nicknames instead of preparing a serious job. All these elements are great, but it would have been nothing without the tragedy  The beauty of the film relies on this profound relationship between Mr. Orange and Mr White, made of respect and honor, and the last minute of the film was something that reminded of Peckinpah's films, a moment of honesty and loyalty, incarnated by Orange's last confession, and White's heartbreaking gesture as to redeem the act of a man he still loved as friend  Keitel's last look before the movie ends will haunt me forever.",these dogs bark lot but they bite too,bloodily violent irreverently shocking

8.0,A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling.,"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10",stylish excellent example expert story telling,after watching this half dozen times with biased anti tarantino what heck is so great about this guy anyway view which as most anyone watching any film with that view fair bit self knowledge will tell you is rather fruitless practice pointlessness if youve decided youre not going like it theres very little reason think that you will no matter how good it is you need open mind i finally decided give it fair hearing i saw it what it is unusual film at least its time stylish film full cool dialog cinematography editing music whole thing comes together perfectly is very short creating sublime film experience plot is excellently written told pace is perfect i wasnt bored second nor did i ever really want it move faster or slower cinematography is magnificent incredibly well integrated pans dolly trips lest we forget stationary shots all perfectly used very stylized acting is top notch all round with most cast being name actors this is no surprise but they really do shine madsen buscemi keitel roth all incredible one role that had less than good well lets be honest it had rather awful acting im speaking course tarantinos character now dont get me wrong dusk till dawn this man did great but just about any other time ive seen him act he just doesnt seem have first clue being film maker myself albeit somewhat smaller scale than quentin i can relate wanting cast yourself role but sometimes you just need face up facts admit it if you cant act still that is minor complaint another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely entirely expendable they had no real role action could very very easily have been cut with no real loss overall product i wont name them here but anyone whos seen film will know who im talking about all characters however are well written their actions credible tarantino knows his stuff when it comes writing something that also shows dialog which although somewhat drawn out at times is exceptional well delivered too when it comes direction he shows how talented he is as well film is very well put together editing is great with non linear time line telling story far better than regular film ever could one many tarantino fans fact very person who originally talked me into watching this film once told me that he had heard someone editing films with such time lines this pulp fiction memento etc so that their time lines were perfectly linear im sorry i entirely respect their right do such thing i wont claim that their doing so has less artistic value than original films any way but i refuse watch that big part this being so well told lies time line also im firm believer watching something way makers intended it dont edit dont censor dont make your own version pass it off as anything but just that your own version not original sorry rant over finally i just need comment music soundtrack this is just great tarantino collected so many amazing 70s tunes this film used them great all all just really really good film very little keeps this being perfect ten most which ive covered here i recommend this anyone who can stomach violence who likes their films with side style 8 10,0.6018086595052886,0.2651578384162654,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,"Simply brilliant; short, tight and taut","Crime boss Joe Cabot brings together a group of criminals to perform a big one-off job. To protect each other, they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job, the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway. As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover. The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.When this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it's violence, even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while. I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves. Looking at the media's adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can't help but marvel at how things have changed. Looking at Reservoir Dogs now (or even then!) it simply isn't THAT violent. However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.Tarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit. The dialogue is both witty at points but, more importantly, very tough and loaded with testosterone. It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath. The entire job happens off camera, and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence - usually we get the aftermath. It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout, I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film - it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best `job gone wrong' films of my generation. It may not be original (there's a thin line between a homage and a rip off) but it is certainly effectively done.The cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes. Keitel is wonderful. His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others. Likewise Buscemi is wide-eyed and freaking out for much of the film, but he does it well. Roth is more balanced but is still good for it; it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well, despite a wandering American accent at times. Madsen is great, maybe not the best character but wildly out of control. Tierney was a great piece of casting, as was Bunker. Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do, but it is his film as writer and director. The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well - mixing stories with flashbacks and so on. No matter what the time of the scene, it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what - it is tight and tense, macho, violent, funny and very enjoyable.",simply brilliant short tight taut,crime boss joe cabot brings together group criminals perform big one off job protect each other they all use colour coded names however day job police ambush gang each makes their own getaway as gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within gang must have tipped police or be undercover accusations suspicions escalate into violence confines warehouse when this film came out uk it caused absolute firestorm controversy over its violence even point that it was banned uk while i still find this absurd am very glad we have moved more tolerant society where generally bbfc protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide themselves looking at medias adoring welcome ultra violent kill bill one cant help but marvel at how things have changed looking at reservoir dogs now or even then it simply isnt that violent however what it is is very sudden all more powerful it tarantino directs film writes film such way that it was impossible ignore him even if film was only cult hit dialogue is both witty at points but more importantly very tough loaded with testosterone it is writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into backseat bloodbath entire job happens off camera only occasionally do we actually see immediate effect violence usually we get aftermath it is incredibly tight very tense throughout i was about 16 when my father took me see this film it has stayed with me since i still considered it be one best job gone wrong films my generation it may not be original theres thin line between homage rip off but it is certainly effectively done cast are excellent turn hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes keitel is wonderful his character is father figure sorts he is wildly out control at times balanced at others likewise buscemi is wide eyed freaking out much film but he does it well roth is more balanced but is still good it it is his job carry emotional weight film he does it well despite wandering american accent at times madsen is great maybe not best character but wildly out control tierney was great piece casting as was bunker penn is good but not best cast tarantino mercifully has little acting do but it is his film as writer director flashbacks during film was brave way do it but it really works well mixing stories with flashbacks so no matter what time scene it all keeps moving tensely towards climax it may be homage not as original as some films but so what it is tight tense macho violent funny very enjoyable,0.6385497835497835,0.09969035594035594,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,"It's not the pieces, it's the drive","A great creative insight is to take things that we think of as separate and contained (like 'art', 'genius', or 'ideas') and realize how they are fluid and inter-dependent, conditioned by factors. This is not to expose anything as little, deconstruction for its sake; it's to show them to be doable, that a road leads up to them. (It's also one of the three main areas of Buddhist practice)One obvious way to do this would be to take this and note the many influences. This has been done to death already, every bit that Tarantino hoped to keep packed or wanted us to find out has been laid out in the open. But this just gives us someone, genius or not, who stole from the right places.Another way would be to see that it doesn't work the same way as it did when new because it has all been made ordinary by slavish followers, gobbled up by familiarity. The moments of simple banter away from plot, the fooling round with edges of story without showing the main center-piece, bleeding on a floor, following Mr. Blonde outside to pick up a can of gasoline; Tarantino was probably proud that he was being ""real"", making a radical break from Bruckheimer's Hollywood. It's bits and pieces of Godard, Cassavetes, Altman, and others. To see it now shows how theatric it is, not ""real"" at all. (The least theatric acting is by the bound cop. Roth is just woeful.) It's The Killers, with the violence and gum pop visuals as typical to see as The Killers was typical without them in its own time.Me, I'd like to settle for something else that brings us to real influence of a more elusive kind.Everything you see here is coming from a young guy who was at the best possible time in his life, lifted from obscurity and everything was beginning to click into place beyond expectation. Can you imagine how giddy he must have been to hear yes from Keitel and here's a check?It's Tarantino coming in from the outside as someone young and eager to make a dream come true; it's bursting with energy but disciplined, kept in check by not having everything at your disposal, being the new kid on set. It would be nothing without this energy.And it's Tarantino being rooted in his own world as he brings the dream alive, suburban LA. None of the story has any outlet into real lives, it's all bounced around movie cutouts. Gangsters showing up before a heist for breakfast in tuxedos? But it's the video clerk's imagination cruising through his own world. He has guys exchange banter about a stripper from Palos Verdes, Roth improvise a story about buying weed the summer of '86.

9.0,Warning: This film is NOT for everyone...even though it is brilliant.,"It's hard to imagine that anyone has NOT heard that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an ultra-violent film, but just in case you haven't, please understand that this is a super-duper ultra-violent film--and a film that many, many out there will find too difficult to watch or will traumatize you. I am not kidding...think twice before you decide to watch it and for heaven's sake, DON'T LET KIDS SEE THIS FILM.Now, despite this intense warning, I greatly respect the film--especially since it was made for next to nothing and without the big studio money. Despite its violence, the film is very smartly written, directed and acted. Quentin Tarantino was able to assemble a rather amazing cast of bad-boy actors--and in many, many ways is a modern version of film noir. And, to give the film that cache, he managed to get a great noir character actor, Lawrence Tierney (in real life a total nut) to give the film an air of menace and class.Because so much on IMDb has already been written about this film and because it's in the IMDb Top 250, there just isn't a great need to discuss the film at length. Suffice to say that it is bloody, full of obscenities and extreme violence (though, to his credit, Tarantino did on many occasions make the actual violence occur off-camera). And, it's brilliant--with a great ending (full of vagueness and a noir-like downbeat ending) and is sure to please the right audience.",warning this film is not everyone even though it is brilliant,its hard imagine that anyone has not heard that reservoir dogs is ultra violent film but just case you havent please understand that this is super duper ultra violent film film that many many out there will find too difficult watch or will traumatize you i am not kidding think twice before you decide watch it heavens sake dont let kids see this film now despite this intense warning i greatly respect film especially since it was made next nothing without big studio money despite its violence film is very smartly written directed acted quentin tarantino was able assemble rather amazing cast bad boy actors many many ways is modern version film noir give film that cache he managed get great noir character actor lawrence tierney real life total nut give film air menace class because so much imdb has already been written about this film because its imdb top 250 there just isnt great need discuss film at length suffice say that it is bloody full obscenities extreme violence though his credit tarantino did many occasions make actual violence occur off camera its brilliant with great ending full vagueness noir like downbeat ending is sure please right audience,0.6502865961199294,0.2216931216931217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Ten years on - still brilliant!,"It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!",ten years still brilliant,its hard get your head around fact that reservoir dogs has been around ten years its almost difficult remember time before tarantino made such enormous impact good bad movies but i saw this movie first time round before hype all i knew was that like another dog movie same era that i saw man bites dog that it was supposed be violent funny disturbing that it starred long time favourite mine harvey keitel tim roth who i mainly knew greenaways cook thief his wife her lover okay i hope its good i thought as i waited cinema listening some half remembered 70s m pop strange conversation about madonnas sex life cinema was playing soundtrack album before main feature but what did we know then movie itself electrifying fascinating word go its impossible describe impact seeing this first time without knowing what expect still one my greatest movie memories ten years later ive seen it countless times so surprise has obviously worn off but it is still brilliant movie because beneath violence wise cracks mr pink steve buscemi soup mr blonde michael madsen thelma louise nice guy eddie chris penn at close range there is lot depth that being very human relationship between mr white keitel mr orange roth me that is one things that elevates this above many lame unoriginal tarantinoesque movies weve had endure since pulp fiction his imitators just simply dont have clue simply brilliant cinema modern classic this is absolutely essential viewing,0.48776397515527964,0.10489130434782609,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,A timeless classic...seriously,"The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying ""Wheres all the violence"", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: ""Are you gonna bark all day..."", ""I'll make you my dog's bitch"". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don't know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the ""Kill Bill"" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.",timeless classic seriously,first time i saw reservoir dogs i was about 15 it had been banned my country i heard it was extremely voilent naturally i did everything my power get my paws copy when i finally did see it i was disappointed i was just sitting there saying wheres all violence anyway i watched it till end then i watched it again since then it has just grew me this is one movies i dont get bored watching time time again i still watch it at least once year because its not kind movie you watch unwind or pass time you simply watch it sheer quality originality movie one liners are classic are you gonna bark all day ill make you my dogs bitch mr blonde is totally believable as psycho i mean who stops get fries soda just after committing robbery fact that everything is ludicrous but you dont know this because these guys way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it this movie is all about dialog violence is used sparingly better effect way film is edited is genius its almost like you forget whole movie after you watch it next time you watch it theres whole scene that you forgot was there storyline is unpredictable thrilling this is better that pulp fiction my opinion definitely tarintinos best movie i didnt care much kill bill movies but who cares im not reviewing them if you havent seen reservoir dogs just rent it buy it or steal it right now,0.5498937074829933,0.061245748299319724,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,Pardon Me While I Bleed!,"I've been trying to see a lot of seminal films when possible. This is one that had me turning my head from time to time because of all the gore and disregard for human life. It starts with this great restaurant scene, Diner on steroids, where Steve Buscemi proves to be the selfish, cheap SOB that he plays throughout the film. I could watch this guy and his neurotic tics forever. I love films that put us at a point in time and then reconstruct the events leading up to it. Add to this, career criminals, some of whom are totally lacking in conscience. We have Harvey Keitel who is one of our greatest actors playing character with a little moral sense. He wants to find a little good. The characters all go by colors so they won't be able to identify each other if they are captured. Again, Buscemi gets into one of his gratuitous discussions when it is decided that he will be Mr. Pink. There is so much violence here, but the movie is at times funny and outrageous in a really insane way. Each guy is a powder keg and they maneuver for position. And, of course, there is ""the scene."" I really like the taut nature of this film, a mere 100 minutes. It moves neatly to its conclusion (well, perhaps, ""neatly"" isn't the best word), and things are tied up well in the end.

8.0,Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie,A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie by concentrating on the in-between scenes. He peppers the scenes with sharp extraneous dialog. It makes for some really memorable scenes. The diner scene and the torture scene are unforgettable. The whole movie does drag as we wait for the actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different.,quentin tarantino deconstructs crime movie,group men are having benign banter diner they have color code names mr white harvey keitel brings horribly wounded mr orange tim roth back hideout mr pink steve buscemi is ranting about quick police response as setup joe cabot hired crew diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret each other calm disturbed mr blonde michael madsen shows up with captured cop quentin tarantino deconstructs crime movie by concentrating between scenes he peppers scenes with sharp extraneous dialog it makes some really memorable scenes diner scene torture scene are unforgettable whole movie does drag as we wait actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different,0.44975490196078427,0.022549019607843123,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,Are you gonna bark all day.....,"A couple of weeks ago, I was blessed with a rare opportunity. one of the movie theaters in town did a midnight showing of this. Naturally, being a ""Dogs"" freak, I went down and saw it.To say I was blown away would be an understatement. I have only seen two of Mr. Tarantino's films in the theater. This being one, and ""Kill Bill"" being the other. I only became a fan of his a year ago and have subsequently seen all of his films and own them all.It really was a treat to be able to sit in the movie theater and watch this while eating grossly overpriced popcorn and drinking a grossly overpriced soda.For those who don't know, the film involves a jewelry heist. Six strangers including Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and Tim Roth are recruited by a crime boss named Joe Cabot, (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Eddie, whom everybody calls ""Nice Guy"" (Chris Penn). The six are almost all friends or associates of Cabot, particularly Keitel and Madsen. Cabot gives them colors for names (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, etc.) And expressly forbids them to reveal anything about themselves to each other, so if anyone is caught, no one can inform on anybody. But the heist goes wrong, the cops seem to show up way to fast, some members of the group are killed, and the rest start returning to the rendesvous point to try to sort out what went wrong. After the arrival of Mr. Pink, They realize that one of the number is a police informer. The arrival of Mr. Blonde, and the present he has in his trunk, complicates things even more. Things are also complicated by the fact that since no one knows each other, discovering who the informer is is given added difficulty, since no one trusts each other.This film, Tarantino's first, is one of the best, if not the best one he has ever done. but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast. Keitel is an old pro at this type of thing, he has the distinction of being the first older actor who's career seemed to be going into a slump and who has recovered thanks to Tarantino's casting. But Tarantino can't claim sole credit for that, because Keitel really got the ball rolling on the project and help him score his budget and the prominence to gain his cast. Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. Tarantino wrote the role for himself, and he would have been good, but Buscemi brings a type of weasly professionalism to the role that no one else could. Penn and Tierney are ideally cast as the father and son who are left to sort out the mess of the robbery, Bunker is only in a few scenes but livens up the proceedings. Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his character (Like a Virgin is a metaphor for big d*cks), and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange, who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie. His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particulary outstanding. But then, of course, I have to throw out a special nod to my favorite character in the piece, Mr. Blonde, as portrayed by Michael Madsen. Blonde is the definition of ""Bad*ss"", and Madsen fits him like a glove. His first scene back at the warehouse is particularly memorable, as is the ""Ear torture sequence"". Without Madsen's portraying of Mr. Blonde, I don't think the ""Ear"" scene would have worked, Madsen just does something with it that nobody else can. Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines, he's fun to watch on screen, especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White. Madsen rocks!""Dogs"" Is one of the few movies where I don't think thae casting could have been any better. Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the the way the cast works with each other. No one seems to think that they are better than anyone else, and no one seemed to approach the project with the stuck up feeling of how bad it was that they were doing an indie film on a low budget and with an unknown director. Every single member of the cast gives everything he (or, to a much lesser extent, she) has. It's this mindset that, I think, has made ""Dogs"" the classic it is today. Little could be improved upon.As a side note, This came out a year after ""Thelma and Louise"" which also stars Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen. However, in ""Dogs"" They play ruthless characters. In ""T&L"" they play the only sympathetic Male characters in the entire movie. An ideal would be to watch ""T&L"" then ""RD"" and really see the difference. They are two great actors, and they deliver. And for those who enjoyed Madsen in this, I also recommend ""Kill Me Again"", made a few years earlier, and which also features a scene where he tortures someone.""Dogs"" is a great film to watch. Not a date flick, but for a cops and robbers movie, it's perfect. Seeing it for the first time in a theater, it hasn't lost it's touch, and the ""Stuck in the Middle with You""/Ear sequence has never been more intense or memorable.*****/***** !0/10",are you gonna bark all day,couple weeks ago i was blessed with rare opportunity one movie theaters town did midnight showing this naturally being dogs freak i went down saw it say i was blown away would be understatement i have only seen two mr tarantinos films theater this being one kill bill being other i only became fan his year ago have subsequently seen all his films own them all it really was treat be able sit movie theater watch this while eating grossly overpriced popcorn drinking grossly overpriced soda those who dont know film involves jewelry heist six strangers including harvey keitel michael madsen steve buscemi eddie bunker tarantino himself tim roth are recruited by crime boss named joe cabot lawrence tierney his son eddie whom everybody calls nice guy chris penn six are almost all friends or associates cabot particularly keitel madsen cabot gives them colors names mr white mr blonde mr pink mr blue etc expressly forbids them reveal anything about themselves each other so if anyone is caught no one can inform anybody but heist goes wrong cops seem show up way fast some members group are killed rest start returning rendesvous point try sort out what went wrong after arrival mr pink they realize that one number is police informer arrival mr blonde present he has his trunk complicates things even more things are also complicated by fact that since no one knows each other discovering who informer is is given added difficulty since no one trusts each other this film tarantinos first is one best if not best one he has ever done but part this credit has go his outstanding cast keitel is old pro at this type thing he has distinction being first older actor whos career seemed be going into slump who has recovered thanks tarantinos casting but tarantino cant claim sole credit that because keitel really got ball rolling project help him score his budget prominence gain his cast buscemi is mr pink tarantino wrote role himself he would have been good but buscemi brings type weasly professionalism role that no one else could penn tierney are ideally cast as father son who are left sort out mess robbery bunker is only few scenes but livens up proceedings tarantino gives himself perfect monologue his character like virgin is metaphor big d cks tim roth gives spectacular performance as mr orange who is relegated bleeding floor large chunk movie his scene car when he has just been shot is particulary outstanding but then course i have throw out special nod my favorite character piece mr blonde as portrayed by michael madsen blonde is definition bad ss madsen fits him like glove his first scene back at warehouse is particularly memorable as is ear torture sequence without madsens portraying mr blonde i dont think ear scene would have worked madsen just does something with it that nobody else can not only does blonde have most coolest lines hes fun watch screen especially his reaction gun pointed his face by mr white madsen rocks dogs is one few movies where i dont think thae casting could have been any better part reason it works as well as it does has go way cast works with each other no one seems think that they are better than anyone else no one seemed approach project with stuck up feeling how bad it was that they were doing indie film low budget with unknown director every single member cast gives everything he or much lesser extent she has its this mindset that i think has made dogs classic it is today little could be improved upon as side note this came out year after thelma louise which also stars harvey keitel michael madsen however dogs they play ruthless characters t l they play only sympathetic male characters entire movie ideal would be watch t l then rd really see difference they are two great actors they deliver those who enjoyed madsen this i also recommend kill me again made few years earlier which also features scene where he tortures someone dogs is great film watch not date flick but cops robbers movie its perfect seeing it first time theater it hasnt lost its touch stuck middle with you ear sequence has never been more intense or memorable 0 10,0.4634347897234497,0.1304839633447881,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,criminals with style,"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama. The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.

It's absolutely nothing like that.Although an original way to make this film, this film is mostly boring, with an exception on the prologue of the film which I found entertaining for some reason. This film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. That's about it with the film.There's nothing interesting with the ""boring"" characters and ""bad"" story. The actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever, although many people said it was, which lead me to buy the film on DVD, which I found a complete waste of money. One good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes, which in real life would be just the opposite.This film is decent but not a very good film.

6.0,Don't Believe The Hype - It's Not That Good,"RESERVOIR DOGS exploded onto cinema screens in 1992 and I can still remember the shock waves it caused due to the excessive violence . If memory serves me right Glasgow Council came very close to banning it from cinema chains in the city and they weren't alone in trying to do this either as newspaper headlines and word of mouth screamed how violent the movie was as Quentin Tarantino became the most infamous and influential movie director of the mid 1990s . RESERVOIR DOGS was finally allowed a British network TV transmission in the Summer of 1997 on channel 4 . I was rubbing my hands in anticipation at seeing this movie . After seeing the movie I felt disgusted . Not because it was a movie whose violent content had sickened me but because I'd fallen for the hype like a total shmuck . This must be the most overrated movie of the 1990s!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! First of all the characters meet in a diner . If you're carrying out a heist is it a good idea to gather in a public place where potential witnesses can identify you ? And would a bunch of robbers be interested in discussing the lyrics of Madonna or the films of John Holmes ? It might be cool and trendy to discuss pop culture but in the context of this movie it's illogical . Soon the narrative switches to a warehouse where the robbers have arrived after their disastrous heist and we're treated to some very obvious exposition : "" F***in' sick f*** . Why'd he do that ? Did you see what he did to that girl ? How old was she ? Nineteen ? F***in' sick motherf***er "" After the movie finished this is what bothered me - I had expected the movie to end by showing us the massacre at the bank BUT THIS NEVER HAPPENS ! and I can't describe how cheated I felt . Okay we're shown the various robbers making their getaways but not once are we shown the much referred to robbery itself which made me feel very disappointed , not because I wanted to see teenage girls get murdered but because it instinctively felt like it should have been the centrepiece scene / climax scene of the movieAs for the rest of the movie's reputation for violence it's ill deserved . There's buckets of blood but many , many movies also feature buckets of blood and gore and don't receive half as much attention as RESERVOIR DOGS . Remember the much criticised scene of the cop getting his ear cut off ? Didn't anyone notice that this actually happens off camera ? Ironically enough the only murder that did disturb me - "" What this cop ? "" BANG - is chilling because it's committed so coldly not because it's graphic in any way . Is there anything I like about RESERVOIR DOGS ? Harvey Keitel is the type of actor I'd watch even if it involved him reading out his shopping list , and the scene where it's revealed who the undercover cop is memorable along with the compelling "" How's he going to explain that to the bad guys when they return ? "" storyline . But at the end of the day I can't help thinking RESERVOIR DOGS is ruined by its much hyped reputation . WHITE HEAT is a very similar movie and a much better one RESERVOIR DOGS gets six bones out of a possible ten",dont believe hype its not that good,reservoir dogs exploded onto cinema screens 1992 i can still remember shock waves it caused due excessive violence if memory serves me right glasgow council came very close banning it cinema chains city they werent alone trying do this either as newspaper headlines word mouth screamed how violent movie was as quentin tarantino became most infamous influential movie director mid 1990s reservoir dogs was finally allowed british network tv transmission summer 1997 channel 4 i was rubbing my hands anticipation at seeing this movie after seeing movie i felt disgusted not because it was movie whose violent content had sickened me but because id fallen hype like total shmuck this must be most overrated movie 1990s slight spoilers first all characters meet diner if youre carrying out heist is it good idea gather public place where potential witnesses can identify you would bunch robbers be interested discussing lyrics madonna or films john holmes it might be cool trendy discuss pop culture but context this movie its illogical soon narrative switches warehouse where robbers have arrived after their disastrous heist were treated some very obvious exposition f sick f whyd he do that did you see what he did that girl how old was she nineteen f sick motherf er after movie finished this is what bothered me i had expected movie end by showing us massacre at bank but this never happens i cant describe how cheated i felt okay were shown various robbers making their getaways but not once are we shown much referred robbery itself which made me feel very disappointed not because i wanted see teenage girls get murdered but because it instinctively felt like it should have been centrepiece scene climax scene movieas rest movies reputation violence its ill deserved theres buckets blood but many many movies also feature buckets blood gore dont receive half as much attention as reservoir dogs remember much criticised scene cop getting his ear cut off didnt anyone notice that this actually happens off camera ironically enough only murder that did disturb me what this cop bang is chilling because its committed so coldly not because its graphic any way is there anything i like about reservoir dogs harvey keitel is type actor id watch even if it involved him reading out his shopping list scene where its revealed who undercover cop is memorable along with compelling hows he going explain that bad guys when they return storyline but at end day i cant help thinking reservoir dogs is ruined by its much hyped reputation white heat is very similar movie much better one reservoir dogs gets six bones out possible ten,0.5576363636363636,-0.006839826839826844,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,A must see,"Definitely up there with Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best. Reservoir Dogs is simply brilliant in all aspects. It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",must see,definitely up there with pulp fiction as tarantinos best reservoir dogs is simply brilliant all aspects it is very brash abrasive unrelenting but works tremendously with that sort tone cinematography is very good i think soundtrack is very appropriate fitting story is wonderfully compelling while dialogue is very hard boiled attitude laced with plenty pop culture references references tv shows hip movies tarantinos direction is excellent so is acting both harvey keitel tim roth give performances that are among their best while michael madson steve buschemi are outstanding overall i think it is must maybe not all but i loved it consider it one tarantinos best 10 10 bethany cox,0.6064215686274511,0.47965686274509794,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,really a great movie!,"I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the movie was about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I saw people wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had never seen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without ever watching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is a classic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie without watching it first. An instant classic.

9.0,The epitome of style and coolness,"Quentin Tarantino's powerfully compelling heist movie is one that is both shockingly violence and compulsively funny. Suddenly appearing out of nowhere, this low-budget masterpiece caused an uproar in Britain with the moral guardians who were determined that the bloodshed should not be seen by weak-willed individuals living in this country. Thankfully they failed, which is why this video is now available in the UK in an uncut, uncensored film.Tarantino elicits funny, likable performances from his seasoned and fresh-faced actors. By setting the movie in one location for the entire film and playing the thing in real time, he ups the tension and suspense in the same way TWELVE ANGRY MEN utilised the idea. Harvey Keitel lends his weighty presence to the film as a tough, loyal gangster who believes in ""honour among thieves"". Keitel evokes sympathy and remains likable, even when he needlessly blasts two cops to death. The turnaround at the climax where he realises he has been betrayed is wonderful, Keitel sobbing and moaning uncontrollably as cops surround him and he realises he's finished. Tim Roth makes it to the mainstream with his wounded gangster who lies bleeding to death on a ramp for the entire film, a funny yet depressing performance.However, these two aren't alone; new actors Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi are the guys who would perhaps make the biggest impressions. Madsen's coldly sadistic psychopath is not totally irredeemable, making his character a difficult one to get a grasp on. He's definitely frightening during a hard-to-watch torture sequence where he cuts off a cop's ear, yet he makes this scene funny too. Madsen never repeated the brilliance he showed here, instead wasting his talent in schlock like SPECIES and EXECUTIVE TARGET. Steve Buscemi plays a whinging creep which would later become his stock trade (check out FARGO, for instance). Buscemi is probably the most likable character of them all, and his off screen death is hilarious.The violence level is high but not as high as you might imagine, from the hype. Aside from the aforementioned torture, we just get lots of people being shot up a lot and bleeding a lot too. Tarantino throws in some choice '70s music and lots of black comedy. This was a film which inspired many similar heist movies but which was never beaten. Definitely the director's best so far, and perhaps one of the slyest, wittiest low-budget films ever made. The epitome of style and coolness.",epitome style coolness,quentin tarantinos powerfully compelling heist movie is one that is both shockingly violence compulsively funny suddenly appearing out nowhere this low budget masterpiece caused uproar britain with moral guardians who were determined that bloodshed should not be seen by weak willed individuals living this country thankfully they failed which is why this video is now available uk uncut uncensored film tarantino elicits funny likable performances his seasoned fresh faced actors by setting movie one location entire film playing thing real time he ups tension suspense same way twelve angry men utilised idea harvey keitel lends his weighty presence film as tough loyal gangster who believes honour among thieves keitel evokes sympathy remains likable even when he needlessly blasts two cops death turnaround at climax where he realises he has been betrayed is wonderful keitel sobbing moaning uncontrollably as cops surround him he realises hes finished tim roth makes it mainstream with his wounded gangster who lies bleeding death ramp entire film funny yet depressing performance however these two arent alone new actors michael madsen steve buscemi are guys who would perhaps make biggest impressions madsens coldly sadistic psychopath is not totally irredeemable making his character difficult one get grasp hes definitely frightening during hard watch torture sequence where he cuts off cops ear yet he makes this scene funny too madsen never repeated brilliance he showed here instead wasting his talent schlock like species executive target steve buscemi plays whinging creep which would later become his stock trade check out fargo instance buscemi is probably most likable character them all his off screen death is hilarious violence level is high but not as high as you might imagine hype aside aforementioned torture we just get lots people being shot up lot bleeding lot too tarantino throws some choice 70s music lots black comedy this was film which inspired many similar heist movies but which was never beaten definitely directors best so far perhaps one slyest wittiest low budget films ever made epitome style coolness,0.6175789813023855,0.04079733505265421,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.32}"
2.0,I still don't get it,"People sure love this movie. I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming. Well yeah, ""Reservoir Dogs"" does push the envelope - but towards what? Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy. If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate ""Reservior Dogs"" to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall. So, that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece. But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered. Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale. There are shades of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" here, and there's also a dash of ""The Omen"" at the end. Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better. No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don't think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth.",i still dont get it,people sure love this movie i have friend who says that its good because ear slicing scene most directors would cut away such violence entirely but here we get see aftermath maiming well yeah reservoir dogs does push envelope but towards what should we really praise movie just because it wallows violence more willingly than its predecessors my ex girlfriend says this is greek tragedy if that were true violence would be entirely justified because it would help elevate reservior dogs level enlightening commentary human nature alas none characters is particularly noble they start off as low lifes have nowhere fall so that defense doesnt seem work either short people have long tried convince me that this is really masterpiece but even best parts such as opening dialogue restaurant seem artificial engineered tarantino is ripping off older better films directors wholesale there are shades taking pelham 123 here theres also dash omen at end hitchcock frankenheimer even john carpenter did this kind stuff before they did it better no doubt tarantino was breath fresh air after shallow era 1980s action movies but he was not much innovator i dont think that his super cool style has stood even shortest test time he has after all practically dropped off face earth,0.5140572390572391,0.22323232323232325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,Cruel intentions...,"((((SPOILERS))))) I can think of nothing kind or good or positive to say about this truly repulsive motion picture. It is, quite simply, cruel. Quentin Tarantino's badly written script focuses on the events leading up to and the aftermath of a botched jewelry store heist. The heist itself is largely inconsequential to the story, as Tarantino's intent was apparently to create a character study of the participants. Yet, he has failed to give any of his characters anything resembling human personalities beyond phony macho posturing. The cast does little to add depth to the characters beyond the routine tough guy gambit of shouting their obscenity-laden dialogue at the top of their lungs. As such, they never raise their one-note performances above the level of brain dead savagery. But good, bad or indifferent, the actors have little to work with in the first place. Tarantino's much deified dialogue is insultingly dull-witted -- banal pop references peppered generously with tiresome profanity. The kindest thing to be said for Tarantino's ability to direct action is that it, at least, distracts from the emptiness of his written words. But, it is the violence that pushes the film into the realm of the utterly contemptible. There have been films with more violence and with more explicit violence, but few revel in its violence to the extent of RESERVOIR DOGS. The film doesn't use violence to show cause and effect, or to make a social statement, or to reflect reality, or even for cheap shock effect. It is violence for the sake of violence. The violence in DOGS is purely sadistic; a sleazy, pornographic celebration of inhuman cruelty. Here and in his other violence-obsessed films, Tarantino embraces the infliction of pain as not just an act of power, but of an almost orgasmic display of gratification. Add to this the fact that the victims of the violence are usually bound, helpless, terrified, tortured, randomly selected and undeserving of such cruelty and the violence clearly becomes symbolic of rape. Worse, such savagery encourages the audience to identify with the perpetrator, not the victim, and Tarantino (all too effectively, I'm afraid) tries to make the viewer complicit in his sadism. Okay, if Tarantino wants to indulge in his little S&M fantasies, that is his business. What is disheartening is the way people -- filmgoers and professional critics alike -- have been seduced into not just tolerating Tarantino's sadism, but to applaud it as well? DOGS centerpiece is the totally unnecessary and illogical kidnapping of a young policeman who is subsequently beaten, tortured and mutilated, for no apparent reason other than because it amuses one of the psychotic characters -- and, one can presume, Tarantino himself. The director stages the torture sequence like a comic musical number, complete with rock background music and choreography; casually topping it all off with the young officer's murder being the punchline of a joke. ""That's entertainment!"" seems to be Tarantino's pathetically cruel message. This killing should inspire anger or, at the very least, pity for the innocent man. Instead, it elicited raves by film viewers who see the scene as stylish, or worse, cool. What does it say about our society that not only do we condone the glorification of senseless violence as entertainment, but applaud it as art? Why have we become so obsessed with the matter of ""style"" that we can't see that beneath Tarantino's superficial technique there is sadism? RESERVOIR DOGS represents some sort of low point in the history of cinema. That it helped propel Tarantino to be considered one of the most influential directors of our time represents some sort of low point for society.",cruel intentions,spoilers i can think nothing kind or good or positive say about this truly repulsive motion picture it is quite simply cruel quentin tarantinos badly written script focuses events leading up aftermath botched jewelry store heist heist itself is largely inconsequential story as tarantinos intent was apparently create character study participants yet he has failed give any his characters anything resembling human personalities beyond phony macho posturing cast does little add depth characters beyond routine tough guy gambit shouting their obscenity laden dialogue at top their lungs as such they never raise their one note performances above level brain dead savagery but good bad or indifferent actors have little work with first place tarantinos much deified dialogue is insultingly dull witted banal pop references peppered generously with tiresome profanity kindest thing be said tarantinos ability direct action is that it at least distracts emptiness his written words but it is violence that pushes film into realm utterly contemptible there have been films with more violence with more explicit violence but few revel its violence extent reservoir dogs film doesnt use violence show cause effect or make social statement or reflect reality or even cheap shock effect it is violence sake violence violence dogs is purely sadistic sleazy pornographic celebration inhuman cruelty here his other violence obsessed films tarantino embraces infliction pain as not just act power but almost orgasmic display gratification add this fact that victims violence are usually bound helpless terrified tortured randomly selected undeserving such cruelty violence clearly becomes symbolic rape worse such savagery encourages audience identify with perpetrator not victim tarantino all too effectively im afraid tries make viewer complicit his sadism okay if tarantino wants indulge his little s m fantasies that is his business what is disheartening is way people filmgoers professional critics alike have been seduced into not just tolerating tarantinos sadism but applaud it as well dogs centerpiece is totally unnecessary illogical kidnapping young policeman who is subsequently beaten tortured mutilated no apparent reason other than because it amuses one psychotic characters one can presume tarantino himself director stages torture sequence like comic musical number complete with rock background music choreography casually topping it all off with young officers murder being punchline joke thats entertainment seems be tarantinos pathetically cruel message this killing should inspire anger or at very least pity innocent man instead it elicited raves by film viewers who see scene as stylish or worse cool what does it say about our society that not only do we condone glorification senseless violence as entertainment but applaud it as art why have we become so obsessed with matter style that we cant see that beneath tarantinos superficial technique there is sadism reservoir dogs represents some sort low point history cinema that it helped propel tarantino be considered one most influential directors our time represents some sort low point society,0.4889564821143767,-0.06949181666286927,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Puppies,"Spoilers herein.Yet another film about acting, this time the undercover cop. But `Donnie Brasco' was sharper.The tone is of a play, with artificially snappy dialog. But almost anything from Mamet does this better. The camera moves about to keep the central set from being dull. But dePalma is first among many are who is being copied here.There's some cruelty, but it is fakey compared to, say Greenaway; and less cogent to the story.Keitel does some teapot acting here, because the scenes are too static for his style. `Holy Smoke' is the sort of thing where he really shines. Penn was much better in `Short Cuts,' Roth was way better in `Vincent and Theo' and more self-referential in `Rosencrantz.' (I'll admit that this is Tierney's best role.) The folded time bit is Tarantino's strength and it is done well here. But it is hardly original and has been done better by others. Of recent Hollywood films, `Out of Sight' and `Snake Eyes' are more artful and more integrated respectively.My point is that Tarantino doesn't walk on water. This film is not original but a bunch of ideas from others cleverly bonded. It does not deserve the IMDB ranking in the top 250. Dogs DID change Hollywood -- not because of its art but its economics. Think `Blair Witch,' or `Easy Rider' if you prefer a film from a wunderkind.",puppies,spoilers herein yet another film about acting this time undercover cop but donnie brasco was sharper tone is play with artificially snappy dialog but almost anything mamet does this better camera moves about keep central set being dull but depalma is first among many are who is being copied here theres some cruelty but it is fakey compared say greenaway less cogent story keitel does some teapot acting here because scenes are too static his style holy smoke is sort thing where he really shines penn was much better short cuts roth was way better vincent theo more self referential rosencrantz ill admit that this is tierneys best role folded time bit is tarantinos strength it is done well here but it is hardly original has been done better by others recent hollywood films out sight snake eyes are more artful more integrated respectively my point is that tarantino doesnt walk water this film is not original but bunch ideas others cleverly bonded it does not deserve imdb ranking top 250 dogs did change hollywood not because its art but its economics think blair witch or easy rider if you prefer film wunderkind,0.4765432098765433,0.21033950617283953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8.0,Almost perfect,"As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you'd expect from him. It's funny, it's gory, it's brutal and above all else, it's absolutely ridiculous. This movie could've been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.What I loved about this movie is, no doubt, what everyone else loved as well. Those scenes in the warehouse are spectacular. The fact that you can make conversations between people so intense and thrilling is remarkable. And this movie nails that. Every scene in the warehouse is perfect. You never know what is going to happen and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Had this movie been entirely in the warehouse, I'm sure I would've liked it way more.As is though, the movie doesn't do that. It almost feels like Tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were and decided that the viewer needed a break. As such, the film goes on to give introductions to some of the characters. These introductions, however, felt completely unnecessary to me. Not only did they break the pace and intensity of the film, but they also broke the mystery and intrigue of the characters. I would've been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but the made-up names that each character had. Especially the introduction of Mr. Orange felt unnecessarily long and added very little to the overall story.This movie could've been near perfect had it kept true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moments. Using that confined location and nothing else and pitting these characters against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would've truly been a sight to behold. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat the whole time, especially considering the relatively short runtime. Alas, I was forced to take breaks and breathe for a moment just be brought back into the excellence of the warehouse.With all that being said, it's still a great movie. It has all the characteristics you'd want from a Tarantino film and it is immensely entertaining even in the slower moments. It probably isn't a classic yet, but it undoubtedly will be one in the future. As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't as good as it could've been, but that's just my opinion. And based on most reviews that I've read many consider it to be as good as it could've ever been.",almost perfect,as tarantino as it gets reservoir dogs is exactly what youd expect him its funny its gory its brutal above all else its absolutely ridiculous this movie couldve been so incredible but unfortunately it slightly misses mark what i loved about this movie is no doubt what everyone else loved as well those scenes warehouse are spectacular fact that you can make conversations between people so intense thrilling is remarkable this movie nails that every scene warehouse is perfect you never know what is going happen you are constantly edge your seat had this movie been entirely warehouse im sure i wouldve liked it way more as is though movie doesnt do that it almost feels like tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were decided that viewer needed break as such film goes give introductions some characters these introductions however felt completely unnecessary me not only did they break pace intensity film but they also broke mystery intrigue characters i wouldve been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but made up names that each character had especially introduction mr orange felt unnecessarily long added very little overall story this movie couldve been near perfect had it kept true its intensity thrill post heist moments using that confined location nothing else pitting these characters against each other endless barrage doubt accusation wouldve truly been sight behold i wanted be edge my seat whole time especially considering relatively short runtime alas i was forced take breaks breathe moment just be brought back into excellence warehouse with all that being said its still great movie it has all characteristics youd want tarantino film it is immensely entertaining even slower moments it probably isnt classic yet but it undoubtedly will be one future as far as im concerned it wasnt as good as it couldve been but thats just my opinion based most reviews that ive read many consider it be as good as it couldve ever been,0.655611111111111,0.21829166666666658,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.37}"
