10.0,Slavery is an evil that should befall none,"12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime â€“ film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time.",slavery is evil that should befall none,12 years slave tells true story solomon northup educated free black man living new

9.0,Roll Jordan Roll,"A random and encounter has led Solomon Northup from living freely in New York to being kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, getting handed over to various slave owners. There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.As I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Butler"". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.Steve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.Central to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.A fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.I was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.",roll jordan roll,random encounter has led solomon northup living freely new york being kidnapped sold into slavery louisiana getting handed over various slave owners there solomon witnesses numerous acts cruelty that no man should ever face as i stared at movie screen with full dread i was reeling back at certain scenes i had just witnessed there were good films television shows about slavery before they had various nuances at how tackle slavery this film is part said resurgence sub genre hot heels django unchained butler but while former relinquishes spaghetti western entertainment more than attempting address issue political light as latter steve mcqueens 12 years slave shuts those two up perhaps entire sub genre good i doubt any future slavery themed film will be as harrowing as this one was steve mcqueen is fearless filmmaker continuing his streak unfiltered brutality within human depths he frames his actors faces extreme close up eyes staring into despair nostrils fuming aggression naked flesh are shown not because erotic content but rather because desperation futility long takes wide shots are not uncommon his films here they showcase plethora fantastic scenes performances that work discomfort viewer as much as possible mcqueen doesnt just allow audience tackle slavery he guts audience leaves them consequences this is extremely uncomfortable film watch beautifully shot locations are placeholders unsettling sequences before after contemplated by hans zimmers poignant at times horrifying score this all works create nightmarish time place where hell walks earth central all this is performance chiwetel ejiofor as solomon ejiofor showcases that he is natural force be reckoned with this film after decade mostly supporting characters he spaces out despair as camera lingers onto him solid minutes not word spoken another sequence shows him mourning death fellow worker which singing surrounding group compels him shakes him down tears these scenes follow earlier ones where he is classy free man upper states mingling happily with crowd partaking fanciful music sessions it is tour de force performance fine ensemble established up coming actors surround ejiofor his limelight paul dano paul giammati alfre woodard sarah paulson even brad pitt benedict cumberbatch but none so ferociously as mcqueen regular michael fassbender as despicable sadistic plantation owner edwin epps so excellent terrifying is fassbenders portrayal such merciless barbaric person that mere sight him will either cause audience members unfamiliar him flinch i was left speechless as credits rolled lesser film would have added tacked sentimentality exaggeration politically influenced claptrap not this one this is movie watch as reminder how powerful human spirit can endeavor how lucky all us have grown past that dreadful time history full effect it has not been felt movies before until now,0.5317816834765988,0.04356091178125078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,12 minutes of heartbreak (plus an extra 140),"Steve Mcqueen is proving himself to be a director to look out for. I wasn't a huge fan of his debut, Hunger, as I found it too pro-IRA and slow. However, I thought that the directing was pretty outstanding and it had a distinct style. Shame is a film I've yet to see, but I've heard plenty of rave reviews. 12 Years a Slave looks to be Mcqueen's masterpiece. It's film-making at it's most effective and powerful. I cam away from the film feeling incredibly moved as I sat there in silence along with the rest of the crowd as the credits came up. 12 Years a Slave dares to bare all in a way that most mainstream films would be afraid of doing. Mcqueen shows all the unflinching brutality to create an overwhelming sense of power. I'm used to watching harrowing and depressing films, but these are normally little known like, Dancer in the Dark and The Seventh Continent. 12 Years a Slave is very much mainstream, yet I still found it incredibly harrowing and brutal. Mainstream audiences are go to in for a nasty shock.The film itself has the look of a classic. Like other modern masterpieces such as, There Will Be Blood and Black Swan, the film looks grainy and the cinematography is quite beautiful. You can almost feel the scorching sun dripping off the screen. The directing is near perfection. Mcqueen goes for an art house vibe without over doing it. He keeps the camera deathly still when filming most of the brutality, such as the unflinching whipping of Solomon near the beginning of the film. This distance adds an added emotional punch for the audience as we're forced to feel every lash on his back. Equally as uncomfortable is the scene where Solomon has been left to hang and we're forced to watch him trying to stand on his tip toes for what feels like an eternity.Another impressive aspect of the film is the stellar performances. Chiwetel is hugely convincing in the lead as the wrongly enslaved Solomon Northup. We feel his pain as he's able to draw such emotion without even saying a word. Michael Fassbender is astounding as the evil plantation owner who treats his slaves as the vermin of the Earth. Fassbender manages to pull off a convincing deep south accent, although his Irish twang is very much still trying to come out. Lupita is also distressing to watch as the slave who has lost all hope, she especially impresses in the greatest scene of the film (more on that later). The supporting cast are all brilliant also. Paul Dano is deliciously evil and Benedict Cumberbatch offers a rare glimpse of humanity among the rich slave owners.12 Years a Slave is a film not to enjoy, but to endure. Many people would fail to see the point in going to see a film which isn't entertaining in the slightest, but I'm not one of those people. I love films which are brave, powerful and deeply emotional. The story of Solomon is a grippingly harrowing one and Steve Mcqueen forces you to watch some disturbing, yet important scenes and directs with a shattering sense of realism. The stand-out moment in the film for me was the whipping of Patsey. This scene possesses so much power and it's enough to break your heart. Mcqueen directs the scene in one long take and the emotion of it all is almost too much to bear. The grisly effects make is all the more harrowing.Another thing I loved about the film was the fantastic music. It's unsettling at times, whether it be the strange drum music on the slave boat or the haunting lyrics to Paul Dano's solo song. However, the main score is the most shattering and only served to elevate the raw emotion it portrays on the screen. It came as no surprise to see Hans Zimmer's name appear on the end credits as he is one of the greatest cinematic composers of all time in my opinion.12 Years a Slave is not an easy film to watch, but it's an important one. If you don't feel deeply moved or depressed when it's finished, then you must be Edwin Epps. It's all the more tragic that this film is true and something like this happened for a long time. It could've very easily become sentimental in its last emotional scene, but Mcqueen made it feel real and removed all the Hollywood gloss to create much more of an impact. It won the best picture Oscar and deservedly so. I can't help but feel that it should've won more though and it's shocking to see that it wasn't even nominated for best cinematography. 12 Years a Slave is harrowing cinema at its very best. Even if you just see it once. Be sure to see it.",12 minutes heartbreak plus extra 140,steve mcqueen is proving himself be director look out i wasnt huge fan his debut hunger as i found it too pro ira slow however i thought that directing was pretty outstanding it had distinct style shame is film ive yet see but ive heard plenty rave reviews 12 years slave looks be mcqueens masterpiece its film making at its most effective powerful i cam away film feeling incredibly moved as i sat there silence along with rest crowd as credits came up 12 years slave dares bare all way that most mainstream films would be afraid doing mcqueen shows all unflinching brutality create overwhelming sense power im used watching harrowing depressing films but these are normally little known like dancer dark seventh continent 12 years slave is very much mainstream yet i still found it incredibly harrowing brutal mainstream audiences are go nasty shock film itself has look classic like other modern masterpieces such as there will be blood black swan film looks grainy cinematography is quite beautiful you can almost feel scorching sun dripping off screen directing is near perfection mcqueen goes art house vibe without over doing it he keeps camera deathly still when filming most brutality such as unflinching whipping solomon near beginning film this distance adds added emotional punch audience as were forced feel every lash his back equally as uncomfortable is scene where solomon has been left hang were forced watch him trying stand his tip toes what feels like eternity another impressive aspect film is stellar performances chiwetel is hugely convincing lead as wrongly enslaved solomon northup we feel his pain as hes able draw such emotion without even saying word michael fassbender is astounding as evil plantation owner who treats his slaves as vermin earth fassbender manages pull off convincing deep south accent although his irish twang is very much still trying come out lupita is also distressing watch as slave who has lost all hope she especially impresses greatest scene film more that later supporting cast are all brilliant also paul dano is deliciously evil benedict cumberbatch offers rare glimpse humanity among rich slave owners 12 years slave is film not enjoy but endure many people would fail see point going see film which isnt entertaining slightest but im not one those people i love films which are brave powerful deeply emotional story solomon is grippingly harrowing one steve mcqueen forces you watch some disturbing yet important scenes directs with shattering sense realism stand out moment film me was whipping patsey this scene possesses so much power its enough break your heart mcqueen directs scene one long take emotion it all is almost too much bear grisly effects make is all more harrowing another thing i loved about film was fantastic music its unsettling at times whether it be strange drum music slave boat or haunting lyrics paul danos solo song however main score is most shattering only served elevate raw emotion it portrays screen it came as no surprise see hans zimmers name appear end credits as he is one greatest cinematic composers all time my opinion 12 years slave is not easy film watch but its important one if you dont feel deeply moved or depressed when its finished then you must be edwin epps its all more tragic that this film is true something like this happened long time it couldve very easily become sentimental its last emotional scene but mcqueen made it feel real removed all hollywood gloss create much more impact it won best picture oscar deservedly so i cant help but feel that it shouldve won more though its shocking see that it wasnt even nominated best cinematography 12 years slave is harrowing cinema at its very best even if you just see it once be sure see it,0.6011419296515448,0.16048138560157785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,McQueen's epic is beautiful and tragic anchored by sensational performances...,"Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)One of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies won't respond to it because it's too ""difficult"" to sit through. Let's define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I'd argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of ""too difficult"" around.I've watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I've seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"", which is almost an emotional biopic of America's darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, ""it's too hard watch."" Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone's ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can't answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn't just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.Now when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.I have long admired the talent that's been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I've known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.As Edwin Epps, Solomon's last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the ""Amon Goeth"" of our tale, he is exactly what you'd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He's vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.Mark my words; Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful ""Patsey"" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You're watching the birth of a star.Hans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.Oscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this ""difficult"" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in ""12 Years a Slave?"" I remain hopeful.",mcqueens epic is beautiful tragic anchored by sensational performances,read more awards circuit things that have been thrown around months now is notion that awards season voting bodies wont respond it because its too difficult sit through lets define difficult shall we is it difficult see first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague is it difficult see reformed convict put death by our country his crimes is it difficult see mother choose which one her children dies during holocaust id argue that these answers add up resounding yes yet no one threw those phrases too difficult around ive watched hundreds films throughout my short 29 year history ive seen some difficult cinema steven spielbergs schindlers list can make anyone quiver shame as it shows despicable reality holocaust paul greengrass united 93 which is almost emotional biopic americas darkest hour makes me want crawl up into ball cry finally mel gibsons passion christ one highest grossing films all time shows labor our sins fleshed out into beaten skin honest man still no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying its too hard watch is it because this is american tragedy done by americans is it guilt someones ancestors manifesting it your tear ducts i cant answer that only person who says it can structure this country is built backs blood slaves but slavery didnt just exist america it was everywhere it was horrifying what occurred over 200 years believe it or not still exists some parts world today now when approaching powerful film by mcqueen distributed by fox searchlight pictures there is resounding honesty that mcqueen screenwriter john ridley inhabit there are no tricks or gimmicks no cheap takes side story or character that is put there time filling or life lesson solomon learn everything is genuine is film heartbreaking oh my god yes did i cry several minutes after screening embarrassingly so i was enamored entire time head toe moment moment i have long admired talent thats been evident works chiwetel ejiofor ive known he was capable what he has accomplished as solomon northup he hits it out park he has urgency worry drive get home his family executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems be lost where he shines incredibly are small nuances that he takes as story slows down you notice aspects solomon that make him even more believable as edwin epps solomons last owner michael fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory acts as amon goeth our tale he is exactly what youd expect person who believes this should be way life behave hes vile strikes fear into not only people he interacts with but with viewers who watch as mrs epps sarah paulson is just as wretched abusive conniving entitled i loved every second her mark my words lupita nyongo is emotional epicenter entire film heartache tears anger that will grow inside during feature will have our beautiful patsey at core she is great find our film year will surely go more dynamic passionate projects future youre watching birth star hans zimmer puts forth very pronounced score enriched with all subtle ticks that strike chords tone one thing that cannot be denied is exquisite camera work sean bobbit weaving through parts boat then through grassroots cotton field he puts himself leagues roger deakins seamus mcgarvey as one most innovative exciting dps business especially following his work place beyond pines earlier this year simply marvelous oscar chances since i know many you are wondering put oscars my hands you have dozen nominations reap taking best picture director lead actor supporting actor dual supporting actresses adapted screenplay production design cinematography costume design film editing makeup hairstyling original score theres also strong rich sound scope that is present sounds nature as slaves walk or as solomon approaches his masters house is noticed big question is can it win i havent seen everything yet so i cannot yet if it deserves it or not i can say if critics audiences can get off this difficult watch nonsense accept cinematic endeavor as look into our own history as told great auteur theres no reason it cant top night im very aware that seeing this film along with steve mcqueen crowned by oscar is nearly erasing 85 years history academy are they willing ready begin looking into new realms allowing someone not necessarily their inner circles make bold statement as mcqueen ridley take 12 years slave i remain hopeful,0.5786091249574393,0.14460333673816822,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"nothing can show us the full brutality of slavery, but this comes close","Solomon Northup's story of his kidnapping and sale into slavery got widely read upon its original publication but then disappeared as the Confederates built up an idealized image of the antebellum south (exemplified in ""Gone with the Wind""). Now that Northup's story has gotten brought to the screen, it's important for everyone to see it. ""12 Years a Slave"" not only takes an uncompromising look at the sheer brutality of slavery, but also shows how nothing could take away Northup's dignity and his hope that he would one day be a free man again. One of the ugliest scenes is the whipping of a slave for perceived disobedience.Most of the credit goes to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup, showing him to be a man who wouldn't let even the most vicious treatment break him. The rest of the cast deserves ample kudos, but Steve McQueen deserves credit for bringing to the screen a story that got suppressed for over a century.This movie should also motivate us all to take a serious look at the plantation system and the fact that the US economy got built on it.

10.0,12 Years a Slave is quite a compelling depiction of slavery at its most harrowing,"Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here.

8.0,"Live, not just Survive","Greetings again from the darkness. Should this be labeled a historical drama? Is it one man's extraordinary tale of strength and survival? Does this fall into the ""art film"" category that so divides the movie-going public? The answer to all is YES, and I would add that it's a masterfully crafted film with exquisite story telling, stunning photography and top notch acting throughout.The movie is based on the real life and writings of Solomon Northrup, a free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery from 1841-53. Northrup's story provides us a look inside the despicable institution of slavery. Needless to say, it's a painful and sad process made even more emotional by the work of director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). McQueen takes a very direct approach. Not much is left to the imagination. Torture, abuse, cruelty and misery take up the full screen. The only subtlety comes from the terrific work of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northrup. His facial expressions and eyes are more powerful and telling than any lines of dialogue could be.You will not find many details from the movie here. This is one to experience for yourself. It lacks the typical Hollywood agenda when it comes to American history. Instead this era is presented through the eyes of a single wronged man and his quest to return to his wife and kids, no matter the inhumane obstacles. We see Paul Giamatti as an emotionless, all-business slave trader. Benedict Cumberbatch is a plantation owner who has a heart, but lacks business savvy. And finally we enter the world of cotton farmer Michael Fassbender, who twists Bible scripture into threats directed at the slaves - his ""property"".Fassbender dives deep into evil to find his character, and along with Ejiofor, Sarah Paulsen (who plays Fassbender's icy wife), and Lupita Nyong'o (who plays slave Patsey, the center of the two most incredible scenes in the film), provide more Oscar worthy performances than any one movie can expect. You will also note Quvenzhane Wallis (as Northrup's daughter) and Dwight Henry (as a slave) in their first appearances since Beasts of the Southern Wild. Other strong support comes from Scoot McNairy, Taran Killam (SNL), Michael K Williams, Alfre Woodward, a nasty Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt and Adepero Oduye.Steven Spielberg gave us a taste of the holocaust with Schindler's List, but not since the TV mini-series ""Roots"" has any project come so close to examining the realities of slavery. Northrup's story seems to be from a different universe than the charming slaves of Gone with the Wind. I would argue that what makes this watchable (though very difficult) is the focus on Northrup's story. While tragic, his ending actually deflects from the ongoing plight of those not so fortunate. It's a story of a man who states he doesn't wish to merely survive, he wants to live a life worth living.McQueen's direction will certainly be front and center come awards season, as will many of the actors, John Ridley (the screenwriter), Sean Bobbitt (cinematographer) and Hans Zimmer (score). The only question is whether the subject matter is too tough for Oscar voters, who traditionally lean towards projects a bit more mainstream.",live not just survive,greetings again darkness should this be labeled historical drama is it one mans extraordinary tale strength survival does this fall into art film category that so divides movie going public answer all is yes i would add that its masterfully crafted film with exquisite story telling stunning photography top notch acting throughout movie is based real life writings solomon northrup free man who was kidnapped sold into slavery 1841 53 northrups story provides us look inside despicable institution slavery needless say its painful sad process made even more emotional by work director steve mcqueen hunger shame mcqueen takes very direct approach not much is left imagination torture abuse cruelty misery take up full screen only subtlety comes terrific work chiwetel ejiofor as northrup his facial expressions eyes are more powerful telling than any lines dialogue could be you will not find many details movie here this is one experience yourself it lacks typical hollywood agenda when it comes american history instead this era is presented through eyes single wronged man his quest return his wife kids no matter inhumane obstacles we see paul giamatti as emotionless all business slave trader benedict cumberbatch is plantation owner who has heart but lacks business savvy finally we enter world cotton farmer michael fassbender who twists bible scripture into threats directed at slaves his property fassbender dives deep into evil find his character along with ejiofor sarah paulsen who plays fassbenders icy wife lupita nyongo who plays slave patsey center two most incredible scenes film provide more oscar worthy performances than any one movie can expect you will also note quvenzhane wallis as northrups daughter dwight henry as slave their first appearances since beasts southern wild other strong support comes scoot mcnairy taran killam snl michael k williams alfre woodward nasty paul dano garret dillahunt adepero oduye steven spielberg gave us taste holocaust with schindlers list but not since tv mini series roots has any project come so close examining realities slavery northrups story seems be different universe than charming slaves gone with wind i would argue that what makes this watchable though very difficult is focus northrups story while tragic his ending actually deflects ongoing plight those not so fortunate its story man who states he doesnt wish merely survive he wants live life worth living mcqueens direction will certainly be front center come awards season as will many actors john ridley screenwriter sean bobbitt cinematographer hans zimmer score only question is whether subject matter is too tough oscar voters who traditionally lean towards projects bit more mainstream,0.5584240362811793,0.07219622529146338,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,"A direct telling of the horrors, but not quite the complexities, of a man kidnapped into slavery","12 Years a Slave (2013)Who can possibly argue against the power of this kind of movie, and the injustice that it waves as a welcome reminder? Superbly directed and acted (especially leading man Chiwetel Ejofor playing Solomon Northup), and set with high levels of realism in pre-Civil War America, there is little to separate what the filmmakers intended and what they achieved. A work of excellence.It is not, however, quite the masterpiece it might have been. I don't mean the story or the level of competence here at all. I mean the way the story is told, the choice to simply tell it like it was.That means that the presentation is quite linear (excepting a few gratuitous flashbacks that seem like a last minute editing decision). And uncomplicated. This is the biggest surprise. I mean, the basics might seem enoughâ€”a free black man in Saratoga goes to Washington and is kidnapped and made a slave, and he remains a slave until his recovery 12 years later. But that is actually the entire movie.Oh, I know, the details are missing in that sentence. But it is these details where the movie succeeds too well. We are shown the horrors of slavery and made to experience them. It isn't that this is ignoble or unimportant. On the contrary, this is an ""important"" film and should be seen. But in some weirdly surreal way, we already know everything that happens in these details. Do we need to see a woman, naked and tied to a post, whipped and whipped and whipped, with screaming in our ears? Many will say yes. We need to feel that horror even a little bit (through a movie) to understand how utterly unbelievably horrible slavery was. I would just argue back that I don't really want to be tortured directly to confirm what I already fully agree with. It's just a choice you want to make as a moviegoer. It's similar to watching a kidnapping movieâ€”do you want to experience the inner and outer torments of the kidnapped, or see some larger view of a kidnapping situation and the complexities of that kind of plot?For me, then the movie was excellent at being literal, but that's not enough. For example, there is absolutely no hint at what the family did when Solomon didn't return home after his trip to Washington. Did they search? Worry? How? Who helped, who ignored them? Etc. That's just one of many complexities the movie avoids for the sake of a direct experience of the protagonist. I hope that gives a sense of where this unpleasant, terrific movie leaves you, and whether to watch it.",direct telling horrors but not quite complexities man kidnapped into slavery,12 years slave 2013 who can possibly argue against power this kind movie injustice that it waves as welcome reminder superbly directed acted especially leading man chiwetel ejofor playing solomon northup set with high levels realism pre civil war america there is little separate what filmmakers intended what they achieved work excellence it is not however quite masterpiece it might have been i dont mean story or level competence here at all i mean way story is told choice simply tell it like it was that means that presentation is quite linear excepting few gratuitous flashbacks that seem like last minute editing decision uncomplicated this is biggest surprise i mean basics might seem enough free black man saratoga goes washington is kidnapped made slave he remains slave until his recovery 12 years later but that is actually entire movie oh i know details are missing that sentence but it is these details where movie succeeds too well we are shown horrors slavery made experience them it isnt that this is ignoble or unimportant contrary this is important film should be seen but some weirdly surreal way we already know everything that happens these details do we need see woman naked tied post whipped whipped whipped with screaming our ears many will say yes we need feel that horror even little bit through movie understand how utterly unbelievably horrible slavery was i would just argue back that i dont really want be tortured directly confirm what i already fully agree with its just choice you want make as moviegoer its similar watching kidnapping movie do you want experience inner outer torments kidnapped or see some larger view kidnapping situation complexities that kind plot me then movie was excellent at being literal but thats not enough example there is absolutely no hint at what family did when solomon didnt return home after his trip washington did they search worry how who helped who ignored them etc thats just one many complexities movie avoids sake direct experience protagonist i hope that gives sense where this unpleasant terrific movie leaves you whether watch it,0.5891777408637872,0.06699612403100776,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,12 Years A Slave earns the right to be called one of the best films of the year.,"If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it's Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity's primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I'm so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year's Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It's a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.Naturally, scenes were cut (whether in the editing room or pre-production I don't know) and that's a blessing and a curse. Now in the film, we rush to Solomon Northup's capture, opening with scenes we shall revisit later on. I understand the decision to enter the world as quickly as possible, but I do feel it hurts its first act. As much as I jump for joy every time Scoot McNairy hides himself in a film, the transition from ordinary life to becoming kidnapped feels jarring and contrived. Who is Solomon Northup as a free man? What does he want? Maybe we don't know because there is no source for the matter. Maybe McQueen isn't interested in telling that story. At the very least, we definitely know that Solomon is a compelling character during his capture. Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor I've always liked but he's never made an impression until now. His passion and commitment to his portrayal of Solomon is utterly captivating. While he can slink into the background of some scenes where he is not the focus, when it's time to shine he bursts a fuse.Unfortunately during this cluttered first act, it concerns itself too much with subplots that we know will not succeed. While they accomplish establishing the stakes at hand and rule out the 'why doesn't Solomon justÂ…' there's just too many abridged tales. Perhaps this is distracting just because I know the full stories from the script, but they should've went all or nothing with them. It results in editing that frustratingly refuses to let us into Solomon's headspace. We're along for the ride, but too frequently not Solomon's ride. During then we only get rare and rewarding glimpses into how he feels and his perspective on his past life stolen from him. Fortunately the film vastly improves once Solomon is free from the deliciously cruel Paul Giamatti to the spiteful live-wire Paul Dano. As the film focuses on his one-on-one conflicts and moral dilemmas, the film reaches intimate and truly challenging moments which is where the film's power lies. Fruitless subplots are dropped in favour of heartbreaking ones as we're introduced to the pitiful Patsey on the pathetic Edwin Epps' plantation.Michael Fassbender and Steve McQueen have been one of the most enthralling director/actor combination in recent years. They always bring out the best in each other. Here, it feels like they've reached their finest work yet, but still feels like their collaboration has just began. Fassbender's Edwin Epps is the film's most fascinating and complex character, a man who sincerely refuses to believe he is evil. He demonstrates the thesis of the film in that the authoritative caucasians didn't believe they were doing anything wrong. Many people have laid claim that he is pure evil, but I don't think that's the point, he belongs in a misguided world where he thinks his lust and affection is apt praise for Patsey's talent. While I may not have sympathy for him, he is a tortured soul, a regrettable and irreversible tragedy of mankind and this is thanks to Fassbender's incredible performance. His victim Patsey, played by talented newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, is an utter revelation. She may not have a fully developed character but in at least two powerful scenes, she makes the best out of what she can for a character that warrants the tears you will inevitably shed.One of the most consistent aspects of McQueen's films is the magnificent taste in cinematography and production design. Presumably from his art background, he's great at immersing you into his bleak visual worlds. Working with Sean Bobbit again, the cinematography is reliably enchanting. In true McQueen style, if a character must endure patiently, in this case Solomon hanging from a noose on the tips of his toes, we must endure with them. No shot this year, not even in the extraordinary Gravity, has been as stunning and unforgettable as the infamous long take of Patsey's lashes. It's a filmmaking masterclass in just a few short minutes. Despite the shaky first half hour, it's all redeemed in its harrowing final 15 minutes. It's the greatest sequence I've seen in a long time and I've never had a scene make me a blubbering mess quite like it. Yes, the jump to his kidnapping feels abrupt and there's no sense of relief to his inevitable freedom, but this is all calculated to mirror the struggle of his experience and we've felt every beat. 12 Years A Slave is a powerful testament to the endurance of the human spirit with its theme of injustice applicable to any point in history that earns the right to be one of the best of the year. After a string of lightweight Best Picture choices from the Academy, this will be a refreshing choice. 9/10",12 years slave earns right be called one best films year,if any contemporary director

9.0,Abducted to a Southern hell,"Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.The story begins with him living with wife and children in upstate New York as a free man and respected member of his community. After being lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work, he was subsequently drugged, locked in chains, viciously beaten, stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who treated him in contrasting ways. The first was a relatively civilized fellow, but the plantation's half-witted manager was threatened by Northup's superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a dangerously volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment, Northup's owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This unbalanced individual regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit, which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his capricious moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.It's noteworthy that a British director has become one of the few filmmakers to delve deeply into this subject, and the combination of John Ridley's powerful script and McQueen's directorial skills has inspired exceptional performances from the entire cast. Their dramatization of Northup's experiences is both riveting and uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a society that permitted such a barbaric system. Hopefully it will reach a large US audience, who will learn how a privileged Southern elite cruelly exploited their fellow humans in order to acquire greater wealth for themselves.",abducted southern hell,considering social economic importance slavery americas history scarcity serious films depicting daily life slaves confederate states is significant especially since after effects this shameful episode still echo through culture 12 years slave is based upon memoirs solomon northup who endured hellish period enslavement louisiana which is backed up by legal records story begins with him living with wife children upstate new york as free man respected member his community after being lured washington by couple con artists who promised him work he was subsequently drugged locked chains viciously beaten stripped his identity shipped new orleans be sold into slavery over next twelve years he was owned by two men who treated him contrasting ways first was relatively civilized fellow but plantations half witted manager was threatened by northups superior intelligence their mutual dislike produced dangerously volatile situation unwilling lose his investment northups owner re sold him neighbor this unbalanced individual regarded his slaves as property be used pleasure profit which caused them live perpetual fear that his capricious moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment its noteworthy that british director has become one few filmmakers delve deeply into this subject combination john ridleys powerful script mcqueens directorial skills has inspired exceptional performances entire cast their dramatization northups experiences is both riveting uncomfortable watch as film depicts perverse nature society that permitted such barbaric system hopefully it will reach large us audience who will learn how privileged southern elite cruelly exploited their fellow humans order acquire greater wealth themselves,0.5072665429808287,0.03376314162028447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
5.0,2 Hours of Feeling Bad,"There is so much badness in our modern world and, because of the non-stop flood of digital information, it's coming at us ALL the time. Therefore, if I'm going to see a film about a horrible subject (which I'm not opposed to), I want to feel like I'm being subjected to it for a reason. I want to feel that the filmmaker has something to add to the conversation about it, draws some conclusions, makes a point that hasn't already been made. Otherwise, I feel like that much more badness has been added to my life for little purpose.That is my problem with ""12 Years a Slave,"" a formally accomplished film but one which left me cold. It's two hours of watching the absolute worst humanity can inflict on itself, and beyond the fairly obvious point that slavery was a horrible dark stain on American history, there isn't much point to be made and certainly no sense of enlightenment on the subject. It's a film executed to make its audience feel bad, and it succeeds tremendously on those terms. But it fails in most other ways that make great movies truly great. I felt terrible for the slaves depicted in the film in the abstract, but the individual characters are never fully developed enough to feel bad about them as actual people. It's a hectoring film, one scene after another of hateful, brutal violence (physical, sexual, emotional) inflicted on one set of human beings by another, and the problem is that the people who will actually go to see this movie don't need to be told how terrible this kind of human evil is, while those who might serve to be enlightened on that subject wouldn't see a movie like this in a million years.Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a solid performance in the central role of a free black man who's kidnapped and sold into slavery for a dozen years. But his character never really came alive for me, and that limited the impact of Ejiofor's performance. Michael Fassbender is just asked to play crazy as a villainous plantation owner, while Brad Pitt shows up toward the film's conclusion and makes a speech about the evils of slavery right before our main character is rescued. This scene and Pitt's appearance as pretty much the only white person in the movie who's not either evil or indifferent seems a bit convenient given that he's a producer of the film.Sarah Paulson is memorable as Fassbender's equally villainous wife, while Alfre Woodard has a tiny role that teases us with the more complex issues about black and white relations in the slavery-era South that this film could have addressed had it been more interested in something other than the literalness of human suffering.Grade: C",2 hours feeling bad,there is so much badness our modern world because non stop flood digital information its coming at us all time therefore if im going see film about horrible subject which im not opposed i want feel like im being subjected it reason i want feel that filmmaker has something add conversation about it draws some conclusions makes point that hasnt already been made otherwise i feel like that much more badness has been added my life little purpose that is my problem with 12 years slave formally accomplished film but one which left me cold its two hours watching absolute worst humanity can inflict itself beyond fairly obvious point that slavery was horrible dark stain american history there isnt much point be made certainly no sense enlightenment subject its film executed make its audience feel bad it succeeds tremendously those terms but it fails most other ways that make great movies truly great i felt terrible slaves depicted film abstract but individual characters are never fully developed enough feel bad about them as actual people its hectoring film one scene after another hateful brutal violence physical sexual emotional inflicted one set human beings by another problem is that people who will actually go see this movie dont need be told how terrible this kind human evil is while those who might serve be enlightened that subject wouldnt see movie like this million years chiwetel ejiofor gives solid performance central role free black man whos kidnapped sold into slavery dozen years but his character never really came alive me that limited impact ejiofors performance michael fassbender is just asked play crazy as villainous plantation owner while brad pitt shows up toward films conclusion makes speech about evils slavery right before our main character is rescued this scene pitts appearance as pretty much only white person movie whos not either evil or indifferent seems bit convenient given that hes producer film sarah paulson is memorable as fassbenders equally villainous wife while alfre woodard has tiny role that teases us with more complex issues about black white relations slavery era south that this film could have addressed had it been more interested something other than literalness human suffering grade c,0.4975519785378939,-0.08012240107310531,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,Impressive and compelling,"Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black family man living in Saratoga, New York. In 1841, he is lured by two men who hire him to play his violin. When they arrive in Washington, he is abducted and given the false identity of a runaway slave. He is smuggled back into the deep south to be sold to the somewhat kind William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). However he runs afoul of the jealous chief carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and Ford sells him to the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is the best cotton picker and she's constantly raped by Epps. His wife (Sarah Paulson) knows it and targets her anger on the helpless slave. It's a dangerous life and Northup must hide his identity from everyone. It's only until Canadian Bass (Brad Pitt) that he can truly rely on somebody to help him.This is more than a slave movie. The fact that this is an educated man forced into slavery puts it closer to the audience. It's easier to see one's self in the Northup character in that he starts off as a regular family guy. His trials and tribulations are more compelling because of it. The performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor just reinforces that idea. He's not a superhero. He struggles. He's afraid. He's just a guy off the streets. The other performances are just as outstanding. Each one is as impressive as the next.

10.0,Another masterpiece from McQueen,"I attended the premiere of 12 Years a Slave at the Toronto International Film Festival. Having no tickets, we had to wait close to 4 hours hoping they might let us in. I have to say it was definitely worth the wait and it is hands down the best film I've seen at the festival. The film is based on the real story of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man living in New York, who is abducted and sold into slavery in Louisiana. As the film begins, we are exposed to his talent as a musician (he plays the violin) and get a glimpse of the life he leads with his wife and two children. All is well until he meets two men who seem taken by his music and want to bring him along with them so he can play at various events. When Solomon wakes up in chains, his dark journey starts and the film never lets you take a break.If you've seen McQueen's other works then you more or less know what kind of movie to expect (if you haven't then please stop reading and watch Hunger and Shame). 12 Years a Slave is dark and raw, it exposes everything, without sugarcoating it. It is definitely hard to watch; Several people walked out of the the theatre but in my opinion, it is not only worth watching but necessary. Films exploring themes of slavery are few and far in between and never has one been quite as exhaustive and effective as this one. Beautifully shot and edited, the film features moments of tension, heartbreak and a few laughs here and there. Steve McQueen has created another masterpiece.Most actors get very little screen time. Paul Giamatti and Sarah Paulson are seen for a few minutes but both are great as usual. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a plantation owner, who recognizes Solomon's talent and tries to help him to a certain extent. Despite being a slaver, he is presented in the film as being a good man. Cumberbatch was very good, though outshined by far by Michael Fassbender. He goes through every emotion and gives it his everything. In my opinion, this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano gets a few minutes of screen time as well but makes incredible use of it. As Benedict's worker, he despises slaves and the songs he sings to Solomon makes an incredibly powerful scene, one of the most disturbing in the film. Lupita Nyong'o's first appearance in a feature film is stunning, as she plays a heart breaking young slave. I hope she has a long career ahead of her, she certainly has the talent for it. The true star is definitely Chiwetel Ejiofor. His performance as Solomon is stunning and unforgettable, I truly hope he wins the Oscar for it this year.All in all, if you get a chance to see 12 Years a Slave, don't miss it. Not everyone will be able to stomach it but it's an outstanding film that deserves and needs to be seen.",another masterpiece mcqueen,i attended premiere 12 years slave at toronto international film festival having no tickets we had wait close 4 hours hoping they might let us i have say it was definitely worth wait it is hands down best film ive seen at festival film is based real story solomon northup played by chiwetel ejiofor free black man living new york who is abducted sold into slavery louisiana as film begins we are exposed his talent as musician he plays violin get glimpse life he leads with his wife two children all is well until he meets two men who seem taken by his music want bring him along with them so he can play at various events when solomon wakes up chains his dark journey starts film never lets you take break if youve seen mcqueens other works then you more or less know what kind movie expect if you havent then please stop reading watch hunger shame 12 years slave is dark raw it exposes everything without sugarcoating it it is definitely hard watch several people walked out theatre but my opinion it is not only worth watching but necessary films exploring themes slavery are few far between never has one been quite as exhaustive effective as this one beautifully shot edited film features moments tension heartbreak few laughs here there steve mcqueen has created another masterpiece most actors get very little screen time paul giamatti sarah paulson are seen few minutes but both are great as usual benedict cumberbatch plays plantation owner who recognizes solomons talent tries help him certain extent despite being slaver he is presented film as being good man cumberbatch was very good though outshined by far by michael fassbender he goes through every emotion gives it his everything my opinion this is his best performance date paul dano gets few minutes screen time as well but makes incredible use it as benedicts worker he despises slaves songs he sings solomon makes incredibly powerful scene one most disturbing film lupita nyongos first appearance feature film is stunning as she plays heart breaking young slave i hope she has long career ahead her she certainly has talent it true star is definitely chiwetel ejiofor his performance as solomon is stunning unforgettable i truly hope he wins oscar it this year all all if you get chance see 12 years slave dont miss it not everyone will be able stomach it but its outstanding film that deserves needs be seen,0.5310709249598138,0.2137937088631533,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,A Powerful film experience,"12 Years a Slave is a shocking and brutal look at slavery and the reality for many during those horrible times. It does shy away from the harsh realities of slave life and viewer does not get a veiled look of their lives. It is this journey and story of Solomon Northup that makes this a beautiful film. Without warning a respectable and free man is taken away from his family to the inhumane life of slavery. Harsh truths of life during those times are shown at a nonstop pace. It is also interesting to note the disparities that existed within a country from free states to slave states. On some level viewers might even relate to Solomon's plight. What if one of us was displaced from our comfy lives and put in an unknown and foreign place where people didn't care about laws and men? The performances are simply first class. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o give award worthy performances and belt it out to the back row. You feel their frustration, fear, anger and other emotions. This film is also beautifully directed and has a masterful soundtrack to accompany it. Steve McQueen manages to immerse his viewers in the lives of slaves and slave owners in those times. We are captivated by the beautiful storytelling, direction and cinematography. This film is not something you can watch over and over as it is a powerful dose. Despite being an incredible film it is not easy to re-watch just like it was not easy to re-watch Schindler's list. 12 Years a Slave has to be one of the greatest films ever made and is truly a cinematic experience. It definitely earned its best picture Oscar.

10.0,One of the year's very best; Ejiofor gives an Oscar-worthy performance in courage.,"12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) **** Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, Garrett Dillahunt, Michael K. Williams, Â Kelsey Scott, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Zeigler, Scoot McNairy, Christopher Berry, Bill Camp, Devyn A. Tyler, Willo Jean-Baptiste. Remarkable true- life account of slavery in America based on the biography of freeman African-American Solomon Northup (Ejiofor in an incredible performance that is truly Oscar-worthy), who is tricked and abducted while on a trip from New York to Washington and sold into slavery against his will where he burdens many hardships in his long journey into hell. John Ridley's powerful adaptation of Northup's book is a surprisingly clear-eyed, warts-and-all blinding depiction of how history can be a personal gauntlet in spite of the tremendous odds against surviving. Filmmaker Steve McQueen uses all the archetypes of the Southern 'hospitality' usually seen in the genre of a Civil War treatise but doesn't flinch at all in the underpinnings of what is a true blight of humanity. Equally powerful in their acting (and award noticing) are Fassbender as Solomon's cruelest master with nothing but pure hatred broiling at the surface and a heartbreaking stoic turn by newcomer Nyong'o as the 'personal' slave he terrorizes to no end.

9.0,Black northerner sold into slavery and survives,"Like the whipping scenes we uncomfortably witness, in 12 Years a Slave the sting comes in the tail. The end titles tell us neither the slave pen manager nor Solomon Northup's kidnappers were punished. Solomon is saved, but that individual justice does not redefine the terrible system. Racism, slavery and savage injustice persist at film's end. Of course, the point is that even after the Civil War, the freeing of the slaves, the Civil Rights Movement and its legal and societal successes, racism and injustice persist. Hardly a major daily newspaper passes without a reminder, whether it's a regressive change in the voters' rights laws or a Florida bully justified in ""standing his ground"" against the unarmed black kid he hunted. 12 Years a Slave reminds us what contemporary America grew out of and where too much of its roots remain. McQueen's film deploys an uncompromising visceral violence that rejects the sentimentality and softened focus of American treatments of that period. There is such violence in the air that steamboat paddles churn up a riot of raucous white water and the boat's furnaces roar infernal. The Southern swamps have an eerie other-worldliness that sets up the ghosts of slavery past as a still haunting presence. Apparently it takes an outsider to cast such an unflinching eye on the subject. To his credit, the physical world and the language seem perfectly realized. No trace of the outsider there, but the work of a director steeped in his subject's world. Perhaps the only false note is producer Brad Pitt appearing as the Canadian who brings Northup salvation. His performance is fine but he can't stop registering as Brad Pitt, who gets to make the film's wisest and most humane and modern speeches. Whether his casting was his or McQueen's idea, it shivers the film's verisimilitude and seems self-congratulatory. Pitt brings Northup's story to the North as outside the narrative he helps bring it to the screen. But that is a minor cavil about a film that's courageous, brilliantly written, scored, directed and performed, and as important a statement to America and the world as we have seen this year.

10.0,The movie we needed...,'12 Years a Slave' is a hard film to assess and watch. I think I like what it represents as a piece about Hollywood almost more than the film it's self (don't take me the wrong way. The film is excellent). I recall seeing 'Django Unchained' last year and sadly thinking that Tarantino's cartoony spaghetti western with all it's eccentricities still probably portrayed slavery more accurately than any Hollywood film had up until that point. Along comes '12 Years a Slave' less than a year later and as I watched the film I couldn't stop thinking that this was what was needed. I've come to find that the Academy Award for Best Picture has nothing to do with a film's worth but I will say that this film deserved a Best Picture award to find an even broader audience. Steve McQueen and Chiwetel Ejiofor in one feel swoop have made a film together that so brutally destroys the myth of American exceptionalism. '12 Years a Slave' is much like the much heralded 'Schindler's List' in it's blunt depiction of historical evil but McQueen has no time or respect for Spielbergian catharsis. '12 Years a Slave' is a brutal and honest.This is not a film for the faint of heart. It is above everything else a passion play about psychical and mental torture. Our star Chiwetel Eijofor is asked to give the bravest and deepest of performances. His ability to suffer so realistically on the camera is hard to watch. We empathize with Solomon because Eijofor instills within him a great deal of intelligence and dignity. I think this is why the character and performance resonate so well with the theme of the film. Eijofor 's body takes punishment in horrendously violent scenes but it is the scenes of mental torture which are almost more angering. To see Northup being talked down to and berated as a stupid animal is horrible. McQueen and Eijofor take time to show Northup before he comes to his tragic fate. There's a great scene in the middle of the film that delves into the idea of being a slave and being a free black man. Northup is horrified to see his fellow slaves being restricted in their mental growth. Northup wants to regain the dignity a slave can never have. Eijofor's intelligence and audacity are perfect for this characterization.McQueen is a brave storyteller. I love the fact that against this horrible backdrop is the constant use of the bible and Christianity as a justification for slavery. Michael Fassbender's Epps and even Benedict Cumberbatch's Ford both preach to their slaves as if to justify everything they do. I love this theme because it is completely against any depiction of slavery we have ever seen in a mainstream film. I don't think I've seen a film as anti-religious as '12 Years a Slave'. McQueen actually has the nerve to have a character hope that the Egyptian plaques pale in comparison to whatever happens to the plantation owners upon their judgement. This is brave. I think it's telling that this movie was made by a British director and a cast of English actors. I don't think '12 Years a Slave' could have been made in America by a major studio. The film believes mankind is inherently evil despite facades of being Christian or American. There is no justification for slavery other than a complete moral bankruptcy. If this film were made in America by a Spielberg I imagine there would be some sort of catharsis or hope for a better tomorrow by having Soloman survive. McQueen ends the film with Soloman broken and carrying scars that will never heal. This is the only way to honestly portray slavery everything else is a romantic view of this nation's Holocaust.,movie we needed,12 years slave is hard film assess watch i think i like what it represents as piece about hollywood almost more than film its self dont take me wrong way film is excellent i recall seeing django unchained last year sadly thinking that tarantinos cartoony spaghetti western with all its eccentricities still probably portrayed slavery more accurately than any hollywood film had up until that point along comes 12 years slave less than year later as i watched film i couldnt stop thinking that this was what was needed ive come find that academy award best picture has nothing do with films worth but i will say that this film deserved best picture award find even broader audience steve mcqueen chiwetel ejiofor one feel swoop have made film together that so brutally destroys myth american exceptionalism 12 years slave is much like much heralded schindlers list its blunt depiction historical evil but mcqueen has no time or respect spielbergian catharsis 12 years slave is brutal honest this is not film faint heart it is above everything else passion play about psychical mental torture our star chiwetel eijofor is asked give bravest deepest performances his ability suffer so realistically camera is hard watch we empathize with solomon because eijofor instills within him great deal intelligence dignity i think this is why character performance resonate so well with theme film eijofor s body takes punishment horrendously violent scenes but it is scenes mental torture which are almost more angering see northup being talked down berated as stupid animal is horrible mcqueen eijofor take time show northup before he comes his tragic fate theres great scene middle film that delves into idea being slave being free black man northup is horrified see his fellow slaves being restricted their mental growth northup wants regain dignity slave can never have eijofors intelligence audacity are perfect this characterization mcqueen is brave storyteller i love fact that against this horrible backdrop is constant use bible christianity as justification slavery michael fassbenders epps even benedict cumberbatchs ford both preach their slaves as if justify everything they do i love this theme because it is completely against any depiction slavery we have ever seen mainstream film i dont think ive seen film as anti religious as 12 years slave mcqueen actually has nerve have character hope that egyptian plaques pale comparison whatever happens plantation owners upon their judgement this is brave i think its telling that this movie was made by british director cast english actors i dont think 12 years slave could have been made america by major studio film believes mankind is inherently evil despite facades being christian or american there is no justification slavery other than complete moral bankruptcy if this film were made america by spielberg i imagine there would be some sort catharsis or hope better tomorrow by having soloman survive mcqueen ends film with soloman broken carrying scars that will never heal this is only way honestly portray slavery everything else is romantic view this nations holocaust,0.4940085470085469,0.025465811965811984,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Persistently avoiding cleansing,"Going into a film like this you somewhat know what to expect. You ready yourself for callous suffering without end for no other reason than a system was just set that way, hope snuffed by despair. You know the injustice and stupidity will revolt, because it is just so blatantly wrong it baffles that it would be allowed to go on for even a day in plain sight.We can't avoid the bluntness if we are to confront that world. Slaves are casually stabbed and thrown overboard on the journey south, a mother is separated by her kids in a slave sale, down at the bayous they are beaten, a girl flogged for wanting a piece of soap, treated at best as mischievous kids or at worst as animals. We see how our man is over the years beaten or numbly retreats to protect himself into a hollow shell. But what good does it do if it merely blunts you to cleanse? Serious question here. Most films work in this way, from the Greek model demanding catharsis, a cleansing from evil so that we can go on about our lives. But if we just go on about our lives merely relieved of a burden, has any actual change taken place? If I shed a few tears at a film like this and the next day take out my work stress on my kids, am I really cleansed of the same root ignorance that at one time supported slavery? Southerners were not in support of an apparent evil after all from their pov, but of what they saw as a right or a tradition or a natural necessity.So I'm glad the film does these two things right, it's the only way it can truly be an eye-opener on the subject. It runs the gamut of people who exist today with the same ignorance: among them the young overseer scorned because he was outsmarted, the jealous and neglected wife, the white worker who betrays the letter to jump ahead in his career, the plantation owner who is thoughtful yet won't buy the kid with his mother because of the cost.And offers no catharsis. The exasperation is sweated out with a stoic capacity for having to be in the world, sentimental music doesn't try to waste all the pent-up energy into simple spine-tingling, the world itself is full of texture and sound because past the imposed confines there was still a world that extended in the distance and went on.I would only have the first segment of normal life much longer so that we'd be more deeply torn from our safet. All that staring into a clump of sunset trees in the distance much more intense because somewhere beyond that is still home and a wife, and this is the greatest visual education I could wish for anyone: not giving up into suffering as not losing sight of the horizon where loved ones are. The notion of persistence solely visual in the arduous field work itself. And only a whole separate film could do justice to the richness of slave songs, their call and response, their hidden narrative and spontaneous order.But a film that already calls up these intuitions has worked more than most, and any future film on the subject will have to build on this.No cleansing because there's nothing to so easily pretend like we can cleanse ourselves of and leave behind in the theater, all the evil in the film does not arise from intrinsic evil itself (otherwise we'd never be able to become better persons) but conditional ego and ignorance and we live every day with these things. If you relieve us with catharsis all that energy goes away. If you don't, it becomes a ball of lead that we have swallowed and have to carry with us back home to our kids, so that maybe it can work its own answer in this life.",persistently avoiding cleansing,going into film like this you somewhat know what expect you ready yourself callous suffering without end no other reason than system was just set that way hope snuffed by despair you know injustice stupidity will revolt because it is just so blatantly wrong it baffles that it would be allowed go even day plain sight we cant avoid bluntness if we are confront that world slaves are casually stabbed thrown overboard journey south mother is separated by her kids slave sale down at bayous they are beaten girl flogged wanting piece soap treated at best as mischievous kids or at worst as animals we see how our man is over years beaten or numbly retreats protect himself into hollow shell but what good does it do if it merely blunts you cleanse serious question here most films work this way greek model demanding catharsis cleansing evil so that we can go about our lives but if we just go about our lives merely relieved burden has any actual change taken place if i shed few tears at film like this next day take out my work stress my kids am i really cleansed same root ignorance that at one time supported slavery southerners were not support apparent evil after all their pov but what they saw as right or tradition or natural necessity so im glad film does these two things right its only way it can truly be eye opener subject it runs gamut people who exist today with same ignorance among them young overseer scorned because he was outsmarted jealous neglected wife white worker who betrays letter jump ahead his career plantation owner who is thoughtful yet wont buy kid with his mother because cost offers no catharsis exasperation is sweated out with stoic capacity having be world sentimental music doesnt try waste all pent up energy into simple spine tingling world itself is full texture sound because past imposed confines there was still world that extended distance went i would only have first segment normal life much longer so that wed be more deeply torn our safet all that staring into clump sunset trees distance much more intense because somewhere beyond that is still home wife this is greatest visual education i could wish anyone not giving up into suffering as not losing sight horizon where loved ones are notion persistence solely visual arduous field work itself only whole separate film could do justice richness slave songs their call response their hidden narrative spontaneous order but film that already calls up these intuitions has worked more than most any future film subject will have build this no cleansing because theres nothing so easily pretend like we can cleanse ourselves leave behind theater all evil film does not arise intrinsic evil itself otherwise wed never be able become better persons but conditional ego ignorance we live every day with these things if you relieve us with catharsis all that energy goes away if you dont it becomes ball lead that we have swallowed have carry with us back home our kids so that maybe it can work its own answer this life,0.5109534681452488,0.0178143964102868,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,A candid depiction of a depraved institution.,"This movie provides a candid and dramatically powerful depiction of the institution of slavery in the United States. This movie touches on and in some ways dives into the many different themes associated with the institution. First, the movie shows how it corrupted everyone involved in it. No matter what their involvement, the institution brought everyone down. Second, the movie dramatizes the political consequences of slavery, how slavery exacerbated sectional conflicts and distorted political discourse. Third, the movie dramatizes the deleterious psychological effects of slavery. Unwilling to come to honestly come to terms with the nature of the institution, the movie shows how slave owner rationalized their own conduct toward the slaves, with devastatingly tragic consequences. Fourth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the United States to follow its own creed of liberty and justice by showing how free blacks were denied the full protection of the law. Fifth, this movie dramatizes the essential barbarism and degeneracy of slavery in the way it brought out and validated the worst in people. Sixth, the movie shows how slavery was a form of state-sponsored vigilantism in the way an entire class of people were subject to the full weight of the state with absolutely no protection. Seventh, the movie pulls no punches in showing the brutality of the institution, e.g., graphic depictions of beatings, whippings, fighting, psychological torture, humiliation, dehumanization, inadequate food, clothing, shelter, and terrorism - all happening under the color of law. Eighth, movie dramatized how by 1841 there was those who already realized that the United States was heading toward a civil war. Ninth, the movie shows how economic self-interest drove slavery, that slavery was profitable. Tenth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the religious community to take action to end slavery and instead used scripture to justify slavery's existence. This movie features many excellent performances, most notably by Michael Fassbinder and Brad Pitt, the latter giving one of his better performances. As for Fassbinder, his performance warrants an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His portrayal of the angry, troubled, vicious slave owner who is deteriorating physically, mentally and spiritually carries this movie. This movie is worth watching. Don't expect an upbeat story, because it isn't. But do expect a powerful dramatic treatment of an unpleasant yet historically important subject.",candid depiction depraved institution,this movie provides candid dramatically powerful depiction institution slavery united states this movie touches some ways dives into many different themes associated with institution first movie shows how it corrupted everyone involved it no matter what their involvement institution brought everyone down second movie dramatizes political consequences slavery how slavery exacerbated sectional conflicts distorted political discourse third movie dramatizes deleterious psychological effects slavery unwilling come honestly come terms with nature institution movie shows how slave owner rationalized their own conduct toward slaves with devastatingly tragic consequences fourth movie dramatizes failure united states follow its own creed liberty justice by showing how free blacks were denied full protection law fifth this movie dramatizes essential barbarism degeneracy slavery way it brought out validated worst people sixth movie shows how slavery was form state sponsored vigilantism way entire class people were subject full weight state with absolutely no protection seventh movie pulls no punches showing brutality institution e g graphic depictions beatings whippings fighting psychological torture humiliation dehumanization inadequate food clothing shelter terrorism all happening under color law eighth movie dramatized how by 1841 there was those who already realized that united states was heading toward civil war ninth movie shows how economic self interest drove slavery that slavery was profitable tenth movie dramatizes failure religious community take action end slavery instead used scripture justify slaverys existence this movie features many excellent performances most notably by michael fassbinder brad pitt latter giving one his better performances as fassbinder his performance warrants academy award nomination best actor his portrayal angry troubled vicious slave owner who is deteriorating physically mentally spiritually carries this movie this movie is worth watching dont expect upbeat story because it isnt but do expect powerful dramatic treatment unpleasant yet historically important subject,0.518310657596372,0.0896825396825397,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,A powerful movie that brings in new light to the dark topic of slavery.,"12 Years a Slave is indeed a very powerful movie. Directed by Steve McQueen, and written by John Ridley, the movie is an adaptation of the 1853 autobiography by Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a New York State-born free man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery in the South. Chiwetel Ejiofor did a great job, acting as Solomon Northup, and it wouldn't surprise me, if he wins a couple of awards for it. The supporting cast is just as amazing. I give mad props to both Benedict Cumberbatch, and Michael Fassbender for their performance as plantation owner, beloved William Ford and crude Edwin Epps. There are too many powerful performances scenes to count, but I had to choice some, it would be, the scene where Solomon is nearly lynch by John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and he is just hanging out there, while the other slaves couldn't do anything about it. Last is the trials and misfortune of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) with her being abuse by both Epps and his evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen. The movie doesn't have too much over the top moments, and seem very accurate. The movie puts a lot of insight, you wouldn't see in much modern movies today. First off, there is the good heart, slave owner William Ford. You would never see that in any other movie, as movies about slavery have all slave owners as a crude one-dimension evil human beings. Second off, you wouldn't see a white field hand (Garret Dillahunt) working besides the slaves in other films. To accurately depict the time period of the film, the filmmakers did a great job capturing the language, the look, and locations of the time. Still, the film did take artistic license, and create some new drama like the scene where a sailor kill a slave. One thing, I didn't like about the film is some of the music. Don't get me wrong, I found the songs, Roll Jordan Roll, and the classical American folk music great, but the soundtrack by Han Zimmer is kinda sound not new. Most of the emotional music being play in the background, remind me too much of 'Time' from Han Zimmer's 2010 soundtrack for the film, 'Inception'. It's seem recycled. Another thing that is bothering people is the flow of the film over the 12 years. It seems to go, really quick over the years. When he was kidnapped in the beginning, his children were kids and he looked about mid 30's. Throughout the movie he doesn't look any older at all or aged. The point is, they could have done was to add the age look for the characters because you can't tell that 12 years are going by or let us know that time is passing by. But it didn't feel like 12 years for me. It more felt like a matter of about 4 months. Maybe if they had showed seasons changing or done makeup on the actors to show them getting older it would have been better. About the brutality of the film, it was there, it wasn't too gruesome in my opinion. It was a lot harder to watch 1997's Amistad than this. I wouldn't say, this movie is for all audience, but I do agree, young mature adults should watch it. I don't find the movie, putting a white guilt to anybody, nor do I say, this is a movie trying to start hatred against whites for their ancestor mistakes. If anything, it is part of the healing process, for the most part, I found myself, not anger, but understanding what people went through back then. Most black audiences would agree with me. I have to say, all people of every race need to see this film, even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. The reason why people should see this film is indeed, while slavery seems like old practice, it still acts upon the modern world through sex trade, and the misused of illegal workers. Such modern sense of slavery need to quickly end. Indeed, if you like this movie, do check out, 1984's TV movie, Solomon Northup's Odyssey starting Avery Brooks. It's well done as well. Overall: While it did had a limited release, it is a must watch.",powerful movie that brings new light dark topic slavery,12 years slave is indeed very powerful movie directed by steve mcqueen written by john ridley movie is adaptation 1853 autobiography by solomon northup chiwetel ejiofor new york state born free man who was kidnapped washington d c 1841 sold into slavery south chiwetel ejiofor did great job acting as solomon northup it wouldnt surprise me if he wins couple awards it supporting cast is just as amazing i give mad props both benedict cumberbatch michael fassbender their performance as plantation owner beloved william ford crude edwin epps there are too many powerful performances scenes count but i had choice some it would be scene where solomon is nearly lynch by john tibeats paul dano he is just hanging out there while other slaves couldnt do anything about it last is trials misfortune patsey lupita nyongo with her being abuse by both epps his evil wife played by sarah paulsen movie doesnt have too much over top moments seem very accurate movie puts lot insight you wouldnt see much modern movies today first off there is good heart slave owner william ford you would never see that any other movie as movies about slavery have all slave owners as crude one dimension evil human beings second off you wouldnt see white field hand garret dillahunt working besides slaves other films accurately depict time period film filmmakers did great job capturing language look locations time still film did take artistic license create some new drama like scene where sailor kill slave one thing i didnt like about film is some music dont get me wrong i found songs roll jordan roll classical american folk music great but soundtrack by han zimmer is kinda sound not new most emotional music being play background remind me too much time han zimmers 2010 soundtrack film inception its seem recycled another thing that is bothering people is flow film over 12 years it seems go really quick over years when he was kidnapped beginning his children were kids he looked about mid 30s throughout movie he doesnt look any older at all or aged point is they could have done was add age look characters because you cant tell that 12 years are going by or let us know that time is passing by but it didnt feel like 12 years me it more felt like matter about 4 months maybe if they had showed seasons changing or done makeup actors show them getting older it would have been better about brutality film it was there it wasnt too gruesome my opinion it was lot harder watch 1997s amistad than this i wouldnt say this movie is all audience but i do agree young mature adults should watch it i dont find movie putting white guilt anybody nor do i say this is movie trying start hatred against whites their ancestor mistakes if anything it is part healing process most part i found myself not anger but understanding what people went through back then most black audiences would agree with me i have say all people every race need see this film even if its not teaching you anything new that you dont already know reason why people should see this film is indeed while slavery seems like old practice it still acts upon modern world through sex trade misused illegal workers such modern sense slavery need quickly end indeed if you like this movie do check out 1984s tv movie solomon northups odyssey starting avery brooks its well done as well overall while it did had limited release it is must watch,0.4628006903006902,0.11327717327717327,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,powerful story of man's inhumanity to man,"It's hard to express the emotional impact of this film, starring the Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Alfre Woodward, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, and Paul Giamatti.Eliofor plays Solomon Northrup, in the true story of a free black man living in the north who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. It's a brutal story. You see these people treated like merchandise, separated from their children, and the cruelty of the land managers.Northrup at first is pretty lucky -- he is sold to one of the more humane landowners, Ford (Cumberbatch), who takes advantage of the fact that Northrop is an excellent musician and reads the Bible to them on Sundays. As Cumberbatch points out, though, Ford isn't a nice guy -- he like the rest of them use slaves as their economy is dependent upon it. What's even worse about Ford is that he has no control over his horrid manager.In order to keep Northrop from being killed by said manager, Ford sells him to another owner, Edwin Epps (Fassbender), a complete nightmare who is taking sexual advantage of one of his slaves, Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) and enjoys being mean. His wife is jealous of Patsy and also makes her life a living hell.All of the performances are excellent, and this movie was filmed in Louisiana and is gorgeous to look at, belying the sadness and horror.Great movie.",powerful story mans inhumanity man,its hard express emotional impact this film starring chiwetel ejiofor michael fassbender lupita nyongo alfre woodward benedict cumberbatch brad pitt paul giamatti eliofor plays solomon northrup true story free black man living north who is kidnapped sold into slavery its brutal story you see these people treated like merchandise separated their children cruelty land managers northrup at first is pretty lucky he is sold one more humane landowners ford cumberbatch who takes advantage fact that northrop is excellent musician reads bible them sundays as cumberbatch points out though ford isnt nice guy he like rest them use slaves as their economy is dependent upon it whats even worse about ford is that he has no control over his horrid manager order keep northrop being killed by said manager ford sells him another owner edwin epps fassbender complete nightmare who is taking sexual advantage one his slaves patsy lupita nyongo enjoys being mean his wife is jealous patsy also makes her life living hell all performances are excellent this movie was filmed louisiana is gorgeous look at belying sadness horror great movie,0.7101190476190476,0.23035714285714284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8.0,Good film,"As a non-American, I find it really interesting that so many reviewers here are uncomfortable with the explicit violence and nastiness portrayed in this film. How could it possibly be true? They seem to say. Surely Americans have never been that vicious and uncaring? But for hundreds of years, some of them were, and this film depicts it well. It's not a pleasant film but it does hold your attention and would make an excellent film for history classes. The film's creators depict Edwin Epps, the main slave owner, as an unapologetic bigot, manipulator, rapist and sadist. Generations of slave traders lived their lives like this. The slave of the film's title, Samuel Northup, did, at least, live some of his life in the relative comfort of the North, but it's sobering to realise that generations of slaves lived in total misery, with no way out of their situation. I found Brad Pitt's small role -- as the saviour who contact Samuel's friends and family, who rescue Northup from slavery -- as a little patronising. I.e. the white guy who saves the day for the black guy. But my companion pointed out that often blacks' only hope would have been someone helping them.",good film,as non american i find it really interesting that so many reviewers here are uncomfortable with explicit violence nastiness portrayed this film how could it possibly be true they seem say surely americans have never been that vicious uncaring but hundreds years some them were this film depicts it well its not pleasant film but it does hold your attention would make excellent film history classes films creators depict edwin epps main slave owner as unapologetic bigot manipulator rapist sadist generations slave traders lived their lives like this slave films title samuel northup did at least live some his life relative comfort north but its sobering realise that generations slaves lived total misery with no way out their situation i found brad pitts small role as saviour who contact samuels friends family who rescue northup slavery as little patronising i e white guy who saves day black guy but my companion pointed out that often blacks only hope would have been someone helping them,0.5711111111111111,0.05410984848484847,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
2.0,2 hours of sadism,"I was hoping to really enjoy ""12 Years a Slave"" but wasn't expecting a 2 hr long movie of very long, ponderous slow camera shots of nature and hardly any compelling dialog or character development. This was then broken up seemingly every 10 minutes by a savage flogging or a vicious rape or some other sadistic cruelty being inflicted on the movie's hero, the hapless Solomon a freeman sold into slavery, and the other slaves. Except for Brad Pitt's Canadian abolitionist and a gentleman from Solomon's home town, virtually every white character in this movie is portrayed as the very embodiment of evil. No nuance, nothing but unremitting sadism.A lot of people seem to be comparing this movie to ""Schindler's List"" although I can't understand why. In ""List"" you had the compelling story of Schindler who, for reasons known only to himself, risks his life to save as many Jews as he can. The Jewish prisoners are depicted as full characters, people you know and care about. Even the Nazi played by Ralph Finnes is given some depth, a man whose cruelty has been unleashed and sanctioned by his Nazi bosses but, you suspect but for the war would be a man who might be interesting to be around---a lover of fine food, good wine and a roving eye for the women. But the slave masters in ""12 Years a Slave"" don't have the slightest hint of anything human about them, just treating people with cruelty for cruelty's sake.If filmmakers really wanted to make a powerful movie about slavery, they might consider boldly making a new version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and hew closely to the story that Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote. It's a powerful book and it gets far deeper into the immorality of slavery than anything like ""12 Years a Slave"" does. The memoirs that ""12"" was based on came out soon after the huge success of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". The opening scene of the slave-traders benignly discussing their ""wares"" in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was so chilling to read that I couldn't even bear to read it through in one sitting. ""12"" had a similar scene with the excellent Paul Giamatti as a slave-trader, but the movie never got any deeper.",2 hours sadism,i was hoping really enjoy 12 years slave but wasnt expecting 2 hr long movie very long ponderous slow camera shots nature hardly any compelling dialog or character development this was then broken up seemingly every 10 minutes by savage flogging or vicious rape or some other sadistic cruelty being inflicted movies hero hapless solomon freeman sold into slavery other slaves except brad pitts canadian abolitionist gentleman solomons home town virtually every white character this movie is portrayed as very embodiment evil no nuance nothing but unremitting sadism lot people seem be comparing this movie schindlers list although i cant understand why list you had compelling story schindler who reasons known only himself risks his life save as many jews as he can jewish prisoners are depicted as full characters people you know care about even nazi played by ralph finnes is given some depth man whose cruelty has been unleashed sanctioned by his nazi bosses but you suspect but war would be man who might be interesting be around lover fine food good wine roving eye women but slave masters 12 years slave dont have slightest hint anything human about them just treating people with cruelty crueltys sake if filmmakers really wanted make powerful movie about slavery they might consider boldly making new version uncle toms cabin hew closely story that harriet beecher stowe wrote its powerful book it gets far deeper into immorality slavery than anything like 12 years slave does memoirs that 12 was based came out soon after huge success uncle toms cabin opening scene slave traders benignly discussing their wares uncle toms cabin was so chilling read that i couldnt even bear read it through one sitting 12 had similar scene with excellent paul giamatti as slave trader but movie never got any deeper,0.5356355218855218,0.06054713804713806,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.31}"
