10.0,Still Stirring Wartime Adventure and Compelling Psychological Drama Exhibit David Lean at His Peak,"After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's ""Summertime"", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of ""Colonel Bogey March"" is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two story lines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to ""Summertime"", Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, ""The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai"", produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short.",still stirring wartime adventure compelling psychological drama exhibit david lean at his peak,after years more intimate british films just discovering joys location shooting with 1955s summertime master director david lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957s bridge river kwai acknowledged classic that deserves attention new generation viewers another visit rest us who love perfectly executed films by unparalleled craftsman recently this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow up epic comparatively more elaborate lawrence arabia but this richly textured wwii set adventure is special enough its own terms while it has its share action suspense presented exacting detail film is even more resonant as psychological drama about test wills between mission driven officers amid perils wartime survival plot takes place 1943 when after surrendering singapore col nicholson marches his ragged british company into japanese prisoner work camp burmese jungle this is where famous whistling colonel bogey march is first heard erudite col saito runs camp demands that new prisoners build massive railway bridge critical juncture between rangoon malaysia classic stand off nicholson finally forces saito respect geneva convention not allow his officers do manual labor construction upon his ironic pyrrhic victory nicholson slowly descends into madness seeing completed bridge as potential morale booster his battle weary men meanwhile shortly after nicholsons arrival u s navy cmdr shears escapes camp only be later blackmailed into joining british commando mission led by do or die maj warden hesitant lt joyce with sole goal blowing up bridge through peter taylors thoughtful film editing movie breathlessly alternates between parallel story lines bridge construction jungle commando mission until exciting climax leans accomplishments are many with this memorable film authenticity burmese jungle locations filmed sri lanka seamless integration two story lines masterful handing final scenes particular gradual metamorphosis nicholson by book british officer saitos willing collaborator frequent participant leans films alec guinness gives his career best performance as nicholson providing all sorts unexpected shades his complex characterization as shears william holden does what he did best 1950s concurrently exude natural bravado conflicted soul then added layer cynicism that dares challenge viewer support him 68 year old sessue hayakawa came out retirement play saito delivers subtle performance unbending discipline pained humiliation jack hawkins geoffrey horne lend sturdy support as warden joyce respectively with same expert eye he lent summertime jack hildyard provides superbly expressive composed cinematography michael wilson carl foreman both blacklisted at time wrote brilliantly developed screenplay this is essential viewing two disc 2000 limited edition dvd set has pristine print transfer with great sound making entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing there is nearly hour long documentary disc two making bridge river kwai produced dvd full intriguing insight into production logistics there are couple shorter featurettes produced around time films original release first is black white teaser film itself second rather pedestrian lesson film 101 produced by usc grad students introduced by holden director john milius provides respectful tribute film another short,0.45329369425754956,0.1928727898607417,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.56}"
,Nothing less than a masterpiece...,"About as Oscar-worthy as any film made in the '50s is David Lean's gripping BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean's direction.The jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.Some of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the '50s. He brings as much conviction to his role as Alec Guinness does and deserved a Best Actor nomination that he did not get.",nothing less than masterpiece,about as oscar worthy as any film made 50s is david leans gripping bridge river kwai based loosely real life incident it tells story imprisoned british officer alec guinness who loses sight his mission when forced build bridge japanese that will enable enemy carry supplies by train through jungle during world war ii guinness plays crisp british officer perfection brilliant all his scenes but especially his confrontations with sessue hayakawa william holden has pivotal role as one prisoners who escapes enjoys his freedom awhile before being asked return with small squadron destroy bridge jack hawkins geoffrey horne have colorful roles too all are superb under david leans direction jungle settings filmed ceylon add necessary realism project there is never suspension interest although story runs well over two half hours film builds tense magnificent climax with ending that seems be deliberately ambiguous thought provoking well worth watching especially if shown restored letterbox version now being shown tcm some best lines go william holden he makes most complex role mixture cynicism heroism character that ranks with his best anti hero roles films 50s he brings as much conviction his role as alec guinness does deserved best actor nomination that he did not get,0.4637931034482759,0.24022988505747128,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,"""This is not a game of cricket""","The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean's first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean's easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the ""intimate"" epic of the late 50s and early 60s.We are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.The problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman's multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before – 1952's The Sound Barrier for example – and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.Lean's use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean's crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle – a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director's work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.Lean's handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That's a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn't get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor – check him out in De Mille's The Cheat (1915) – and it's great to see him at the top of his game again here.Bombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean's assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since.",this is not game cricket,bridge river kwai david leans first epic genre he would later be associated with more than any other previously having made his mark as director deep often psychological dramas leans easy transition into bigger pictures reflects change that was taking place genre itself moving grandiose spectacle de mille et al towards intimate epic late 50s early 60s we are also here seeing development war or rather anti war picture prior this most anti war or anti military pictures were small scale dramas whereas all big war films were rousing flag wavers bridge river kwai ticks both boxes is all more effective it it is anti war film which prevents itself becoming static or preachy action film with humanist edge problem presented david lean aside fact that he had never done anything this scale before is that michael wilson carl foremans multi layered screenplay contains many different strands with stories told multiple points view lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before 1952s sound barrier example here he actually uses trappings epic keep narrative focused this was first time he had used cinemascope aspect ratio but rather than employing it purely show off stunning landscapes although he does do fair bit that too why not he also uses width screen cram varying elements into frame example scene where nicholson alec guinness surveys railway construction with his fellow officers figure saito sessue hayakawa can be seen hill background this reminds us his presence subtly keeps his story arc going leans use colour is also remarkable course when your film is set pow camp middle jungle you have fairly limited colour palette anyway but leans crafty choice camera angle positioning is calculated show off different tones at different times opening moments highly reminiscent african queen which like kwai was produced by sam spiegel he begins with greens jungle fairly cold colour as we descend through trees lean gradually turns up heat with those dusty yellows browns middle section film he cools things off again with more lush greens even some vibrant shades before returning stark hot tones tense finale again this is all very subtle directors work but these touches do create little shifts mood influence way we view each scene leans handling larger canvas was however not yet quite up best showing off his actors upon it thats shame with such good cast although alec guinness one his earliest non comedic roles shone through enough garner oscar william holden was also deserving at least nomination but didnt get one my mind though best performance picture was that sessue hayakawa hayakawa was incredibly powerful silent film actor check him out de milles cheat 1915 its great see him at top his game again here bombarded with awards bridge river kwai is typical oscar winning fare particularly conflicted political climate 1950s it can be read as damning critique war but also enjoyed as gripping action film this broad appeal depth screenplay leans assured direction made it hit its day allowed its popularity endure generations since,0.4640973477998796,0.1509644364074744,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,The Definitive Guinness Performance,"Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable. In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,' director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men: British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home. 	As an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment. This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date. And time is short. Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor. When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention. And it's the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost. To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it's an obligation, and failure is not an option. If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code. Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito's demands.	Meanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon. And he's home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he'll be on his way back to the states. Or so he thinks. But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it. And Shears has something they need: First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape. Subsequently, the Navy agrees to `loan' Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission. So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable. 	From the beginning of the film to it's spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture. Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly. Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal. And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.	Alec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead. It's a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times. Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself. Holden's work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance. And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.	Other notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.	The supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green). Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, `The Bridge On the River Kwai' is one of David Lean's masterpieces. It's an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit. This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.",definitive guinness performance,within conflict that was world war ii there were many more smaller more personal conflicts which when added up made significant impact outcome war though trying explain them or war general is like attempting decipher indecipherable bridge river kwai director david lean takes you deep into burmese jungle examine some these deeper conflicts effects extraordinary circumstances some ordinary men british colonel nicholson alec guinness is man rigid principles ideals whom acquiescence any quarter is not option japanese colonel saito sessue hayakawa lives by inflexible code conduct is adamant his adherence it through which he maintains his dignity honor american navy commander shears william holden just wants make it through war alive get back home as integral part their war effort japanese have ordered strategic bridge be built across kwai river facilitate transport troops equipment this monumental task has been given saito commandant allied prisoners war camp not only must he build it it must be completed by specific date time is short toward that end saito has pressed into service every prisoner including officers whom according geneva convention 1864 which established rules humane treatment prisoners war are be excluded any manual labor when fresh contingent british prisoners arrives bolster his complement workers saito finds himself up against formidable opponent nicholson who immediately informs saito that his officers will not work accordance with rules geneva convention its beginning another war war wills between two men determined win at any cost saito this is more than just another assignment its obligation failure is not option if he does not succeed having bridge built time he will be forced take his own life accordance with his own moral code nicholson other hand is unyielding point madness will die before he accedes saitos demands meanwhile shears has managed by some miracle escape has made his way back ceylon hes home free after some recuperation time at mount lavinia hospital hell be his way back states or so he thinks but unbeknownst him british are aware bridge being built kwai are planning commando raid destroy it shears has something they need first hand knowledge precise location jungle through which he made his miraculous escape subsequently navy agrees loan shears british aid them with their mission so instead ticket home shears is faced with another arduous trek through uncompromising jungle all mission which odds against success are nearly incalculable beginning film its spectacular climax lean builds maintains subtle tension that underscores drama which makes this compelling unforgettable motion picture lean is master epic films such as this filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with emotional involvement his characters perfectly lean knows what he wants how get it he takes terrific story this definitely is one tells it by using every bit space visually audibly at this disposal most importantly he knows how get kind performances his actors put it all across so convincingly believably alec guinness deservedly received oscar best actor his role nicholson whom he embodies inside out disappearing so utterly into character that actor is forgotten leaving nothing but real man his stead its superlative piece acting one truly great actors all times holden as well delivers outstanding performance as shears capturing that somewhat embittered off handed sarcasm resignation man trapped by circumstances beyond his control who nevertheless does what he can make most it while awaiting first opportunity escape that affords itself holdens work here is award worthy as well but was destined forever remain shadows what is probably definitive guinness performance what rare treat having two performances this caliber single film other notable performances include hayakawa entirely convincing as tormented saito jack hawkins as demolition expert major warden absolute personification undaunted british stiff upper lip supporting cast includes james donald clipton geoffrey horne joyce percy herbert grogan ann sears nurse andre morell green beautifully filmed expertly crafted delivered bridge river kwai is one david leans masterpieces its emotionally involving dramatic action adventure that offers some real insight into determination tenacity human spirit this film especially ending is one you will never forget classic every sense word it exemplifies magic movies i rate this one 10 10,0.46234335839598995,0.1600187969924812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,They don't make movies like this anymore.,"I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular. Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography. Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson. The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito's hut is remarkable. Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men. Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy. The film's plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined. Shears' return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge. In the film's final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean.

8.0,A movie about madness,"I have watched this movie several times and it is just getting better and better all the time. Why? Because this movie actually has a message built-in, this isn't a violent story, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" - also a good movie with a message - but it is still not a slow story.When I last saw it, I realised that there was something in the movie that I had never understood, this isn't a movie about war, torture or how it was to be a prisoner of war; this is a movie about madness and pride. The pride shows both in Saiko and Colonel Nicholson, they are so full of it that it is almost impossible for them to come to a civil-conclusion with the problems they have with each other. The madness is shown in Colonel Nicholson and Holden's character - here they are, two prisoners of war and they don't want to help each other out, instead they try to reach separate goals, and they are both willing to die for it.After you have watched this movie one is amazed by the performances made by Alec Guinness and William Holden and I must say that this is therefore one of the best War/Drama movies ever made My vote? 9 out of 10 naturally.",movie about madness,i have watched this movie several times it is just getting better better all time why because this movie actually has message built this isnt violent story like saving private ryan also good movie with message but it is still not slow story when i last saw it i realised that there was something movie that i had never understood this isnt movie about war torture or how it was be prisoner war this is movie about madness pride pride shows both saiko colonel nicholson they are so full it that it is almost impossible them come civil conclusion with problems they have with each other madness is shown colonel nicholson holdens character here they are two prisoners war they dont want help each other out instead they try reach separate goals they are both willing die it after you have watched this movie one is amazed by performances made by alec guinness william holden i must say that this is therefore one best war drama movies ever made my vote 9 out 10 naturally,0.4557291666666667,0.11458333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,"""Madness, Madness""","Let's face it - war is organized madness, and although the stakes in World War II were tremendous for whichever side lost, the individual effects of the war on the men and nations involved caused madness on several levels.Pierre Boule's short novel brilliantly discusses the madness in the crazy situation that sweeps up Colonels Nicholson and Saito. Under normal circumstances, the two men might never had been friends but they might have had a degree of respect for each other. Both come from nations that have long histories and traditions, and whose officer corps prided themselves on leadership and withstanding privations. The Japanese formalized these traditions in the code of Bushido (which was twisted, unfortunately, in World War II). It included sharing privation with one's men and was similar to the concept of noblesse oblige that the aristocratic officers of Britain's army tried to maintain. Nicholson's stoicism when put into the isolation box was as much in his tradition as Saito's tradition would have included willingly reducing his own share of his rations for the benefit of his men in a siege.The situation that develops is a racial rivalry. The Japanese, in 1943, have won so many of the campaigns, and witnessed the surrender of Allied (i.e. Western - American, British, French, Dutch troops) that they really have a contempt for them. As we now know was true, the Japanese soldiers frequently fought to the last man (think of Saipan and Okinawa in the last stages of the war, where flame throwers were frequently used to force Japanese soldiers and civilians out into the open). Westerners could do this too, but traditionally the western states saw no shame in surrendering after putting up a hard fight. Not so the Japanese military.Saito is identifying with this tradition. In the novel, he is also disappointed that he is in charge of a prisoner of war camp - he'd prefer to be back in the fighting. But they need the prisoners to build the railroads throughout the new Japanese empire (as mentioned on another comment, the ""Greater East Asiatic Co-Prosperity Sphere"") that can have men and material race from one end of the empire to the other.In reality this frequently ended up more like slave labor than what Boule arranges (or what Saito probably had in mind). Nicholson insists on treatment under the Geneva convention for P.O.W.s, but Saito thinks it's typically Western and wimpish. As punishment for his presumption he puts Nicholson in a hellish underground cell in solitary. But Nicholson's men refuse to cooperate until he's released, and when he is he sneers at the Japanese engineers and their mistakes, and insists on the English army engineers taking control of the building - and this works well for the Japanese Army but not for Saito, who seriously feels like he has lost face and should commit suicide.Director David Lean wisely shot the film on location, capturing the heat and disorientation of a humid jungle war front. His wide screen film manages to make the locale of the prison camp and the Kwai River (and the bridge) look like it is the entire world, and that escape is impossible from it (indeed the one man who escapes - Holden - has to return eventually). The novel does not include the character played by William Holden, one of his typically laconic Americans who retain a clear sightedness when compared to the British. Holden's ""Shears"" sees the prison camp as a massive graveyard (he's on the burial detail) and hates it to the point of escaping. He reaches safety in a recovery hospital in Ceylon, but he's forced by Jack Hawkins to return to the campsite to destroy the bridge.Hawkins' too seems a realist - he is trying to destroy an enemy target that is nearly completed, and will make the enemy's war effort far easier. But his resolve to do this involves blackmailing Holden into assisting him, and forcing himself to continue on his mission after being seriously injured. At the end the mission kills hundreds of men. Hawkins has succeeded, but the local natives who assisted him look at him like he is a mass murderer.Guinness' Nicholson is one of the most myopic soldiers in film (or fiction for that matter) totally forgetting the purpose of himself and his soldiers even in a P.O.W. situation but thinking solely in terms of oneupmanship and morale. It was a splendid performance. One might make a case that he behaved like a man who was hallucinating after an illness, and indeed he does (accidentally) get back to reality at the eleventh hour - too late to save himself, but in time to save his military honor.Sessue Hayakawa had a film career in Hollywood that went back to the silent period (even appearing opposite Gloria Swanson in a Cecil B. DeMille movie), but the coming of sound and the deterioration of Japanese-American relations caused him to leave American movies. Like Swanson's sound comeback in Wilder's SUNSET BLVD., Hayakawa's appearance as Saito, a harsh foe but ultimately sympathetic given his code of behavior and how he is humiliated, brought him belated recognition and an Oscar nomination.Finally there is James Douglas, a highly useful, plain looking British actor who frequently brought dollops of common sense to his films. His P.O.W. Major Clipton tries to rouse Nicholson's sense of reality, but fails (in fact he soon sees that Nicholson's unreality is far more catching with the rest of the British P.O.W.s than he imagined). He sees natural foes, British and Japanese, joining together building a bridge of friendship in a time of war. And the final result is just destruction, confusion and death from that war. Is it any wonder that at the end, he mutters the two words in the ""Summary Line"" as the story's conclusion.",madness madness,lets face it war is organized madness although stakes world war ii were

7.0,"A clash of wills, principles, and egos amidst the madness of war...","British Army Colonel, captured along with his regimen by the Japanese on the island of Burma in 1943, refuses to abandon the rules of his government and build a railroad bridge across the Kwai river according to the plans of his mercurial Japanese counterpart, Colonel Saito. Saito, under orders from his superiors to have the bridge completed by a certain date, eventually yields to the Britisher's demands and construction gets under way, but a POW escapee from the American Navy has been recruited by British officials in nearby Ceylon to return to Burma and blow the bridge up. Complex clash of personalities, with Best Actor Oscar Winner Alec Guinness nimbly helping us to understand his character's motivations (he not only engineers the building of the bridge to aid the enemy, but helps construct a masterpiece--while underlings wonder if perhaps a temporary structure might have sufficed). To be engrossed by this Best Picture Academy Award winner is to eventually sympathize with Guinness' Colonel Nicholson, who figures it's better to build something worthwhile and long-lasting (even as a prisoner) than to do a sloppy job. David Lean (winner for Best Director) does some of his liveliest work behind the camera; opening the film carefully, like a good novel, he lays all these difficult, stubborn warriors on the table and allows us to get close to each one. That said, the big climactic finish--while suspenseful--is ultimately a let-down. Lean's staging is sufficient...perhaps the editing is at fault? Throwing out the people we've come to know so intimately for the sake of rousing visual action leaves a sour taste behind. Yes, it is the madness of war to finish with no winners, only losers; however, the way it plays out here feels half-hearted, and a line of dialogue from Jack Hawkins' Major Warden adds a curious layer of dissatisfaction and confusion. Pierre Boulle was also awarded an Oscar for adapting his own novel (he was fronting for blacklisted screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson); Jack Hildyard won for his cinematography, Malcolm Arnold for his commanding music, and Peter Taylor for his (rather spotty) editing. *** from ****",clash wills principles egos amidst madness war,british army colonel captured along with his regimen by japanese island burma 1943 refuses abandon rules his government build railroad bridge across kwai river according plans his mercurial japanese counterpart colonel saito saito under orders his superiors have bridge completed by certain date eventually yields britishers demands construction gets under way but pow escapee american navy has been recruited by british officials nearby ceylon return burma blow bridge up complex clash personalities with best actor oscar winner alec guinness nimbly helping us understand his characters motivations he not only engineers building bridge aid enemy but helps construct masterpiece while underlings wonder if perhaps temporary structure might have sufficed be engrossed by this best picture academy award winner is eventually sympathize with guinness colonel nicholson who figures its better build something worthwhile long lasting even as prisoner than do sloppy job david lean winner best director does some his liveliest work behind camera opening film carefully like good novel he lays all these difficult stubborn warriors table allows us get close each one that said big climactic finish while suspenseful is ultimately let down leans staging is sufficient perhaps editing is at fault throwing out people weve come know so intimately sake rousing visual action leaves sour taste behind yes it is madness war finish with no winners only losers however way it plays out here feels half hearted line dialogue jack hawkins major warden adds curious layer dissatisfaction confusion pierre boulle was also awarded oscar adapting his own novel he was fronting blacklisted screenwriters carl foreman michael wilson jack hildyard won his cinematography malcolm arnold his commanding music peter taylor his rather spotty editing,0.4593424036281178,0.08393990929705218,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,Ageless and all but perfect,"Of all war movies this is the one with the best idea behind it. Think how easy it is to make a bad war movie. A group of people must blow up a bridge, and this is the story of their quest ... Actually, that DID serve as the premise for a film: it was called `Force Ten from Navarone', and it was dire. Or how about this one: we see close up the brutalities of war. (Then we see them again. Then we see some more of the brutalities of war. Then we see the credits.) Or how about this: a humble American soldier, with the pragmatism native to his breed, rejects his superiors' highfalutin talk of honour and glory and asserts his basic humanity in trying to stay alive. Or this one: we see English prisoners of war maintain their dignity in the face of Japanese brutality.They're all present, in a sort of a way: but ALSO present is a magnificent, long, suspenseful, tight story, around which these apparent clichés wrap naturally. If the clichés don't wrap naturally then they, not the story, are bent out of shape. Just when we think that the American pragmatist will turn out to be the hero, we see him cut a rather shabby figure, and it seems that there really WAS something to that highfalutin talk of honour and glory, after all. But then we discover that he has standards of his own, and they appear to be better ones. But THEN it seems that ... I could go on indefinitely, since there are many people here with something to be said for them, and it requires some thought to see who has the most to be said for him in the end.There's almost no need to mention the excellent performances, photography and music. The only thing one might have qualms about is historical accuracy. Nothing like this ever happened. Still, that makes the movie much less dishonest than those that base themselves on historical events, and then proceed to get them all wrong. You can only be misled by `The Bridge on the River Kwai' if you don't know that it's pure fiction.

10.0,The Perks of Being An Officer,"The Bridge on the River Kwai is about a culture clash of two different races going to war and how they view each other. It's also about a British colonel's concern for the morale of his men and observation of the rules of war that it blinds him to the situation he's in.I like to compare The Bridge on the River Kwai with The Great Escape. Though the prisoners in the former are in a far worse predicament than those in that 'escape proof' stalag in the latter, note the differences in how they view their captivity. No one in The Great Escape ever forgets that they are at war and who the enemy. Their morale is kept very high with the diabolical escape plan they devise.Alec Guinness who is a stickler for protocol reminds us that escape might not be justified under the rules because they were ordered to surrender. But as prisoners he will not be denied the rank and privileges of being an officer. So he gets the sweat box until the commandant, Sessue Hayakawa, gives in for his own reasons.His reasons involve the building of a bridge on a railway the Japanese are constructing from Bangkok to Rangoon, part of their Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity scheme. Hayakawa reminds us that his code of honor is Bushido, the Samurai code which does not entertain surrender. The British to him are an inferior people for doing that and not fighting until the last man.That's not going to sit well with Guinness who's going to show the Japanese who's inferior. He notes that the bridge being built is not sound structurally and he determines that to combat the idleness of the men and the bad effect on morale, he'll build a bridge that will show Hayakawa who's inferior. And Hayakawa loses control of his own bridge construction to the enemy and breaks down because of it.The Bridge on the River Kwai as a film wouldn't work at all if it were not for Alec Guinness. He's clearly not kept his eye on the ball to use an American baseball term, forgotten that two countries are at war, that it's not a private spat between him and Hayakawa. Yet his concern for his men is genuine and he must have been a pretty good commander in a combat situation to retain the affection his men have for him. Executing the complexity of Colonel Nicholson won him the Academy Award and it carries the film.Taking a different view of the perks of being an officer is William Holden. His role is not in the original novel by Pierre Boule, but was created to justify a big American box office name for the USA market. But it was a good thing because Holden as an American does bring a different perspective to the events. Holden having won his Oscar in Stalag 17 as a prisoner of war brings his former role of Sefton to this film. That's not as flip as it sounds because Sefton in Stalag 17 did remark about escaping and then being sent to the Pacific and getting captured and doing time in a Japanese prison. Of course he'd have had to have changed branches of the service. And we never do learn Holden's real name.Seems as though when his ship went down, Holden the survivor exchanges uniform and dog tags with a Navy commander named Shears. It doesn't get him quite the perks he thought he'd get, but he's resourceful enough.It took me several viewings of The Bridge on the River Kwai to figure out why Holden didn't go back to his real name and rank after he escaped and after he arrived in the British hospital in Sri Lanka. It's the reason why Ann Sears has a small, but critical role as the WREN that Holden enjoys a little romantic idyll with. She might not have given him the time of day if he was a seaman first class instead of a Lieutenant Commander. But the British get on to Holden's charade and Jack Hawkins blackjacks him into going on a mission to destroy the bridge that British Intelligence has found out the Japanese are building. If Guinness has forgotten what side he's on, Hawkins sure hasn't. Jack Hawkins's role tends to get overshadowed by Guinness and he never gets the credit due him for this film, but he does well as the determined man on a mission.One other part worthy mentioning is James Donald as the medical officer of Guinness's battalion. He has great affection for Guinness, but apparently he's the only one in the POW camp that sees the implication of what the British prisoners are being ordered to do by their commander and also who'll tell Guinness ever so gently.And Donald puts the final coda on The Bridge on the River Kwai with his words that end this great film achievement.",perks being officer,bridge river kwai is about culture clash two different races going war how they view each other its also about british colonels concern morale his men observation rules war that it blinds him situation hes i like compare bridge river kwai with great escape though prisoners former are far worse predicament than those that escape proof stalag latter note differences how they view their captivity no one great escape ever forgets that they are at war who enemy their morale is kept very high with diabolical escape plan they devise alec guinness who is stickler protocol reminds us that escape might not be justified under rules because they were ordered surrender but as prisoners he will not be denied rank privileges being officer so he gets sweat box until commandant sessue hayakawa gives his own reasons his reasons involve building bridge railway japanese are constructing bangkok rangoon part their greater east asia co prosperity scheme hayakawa reminds us that his code honor is bushido samurai code which does not entertain surrender british him are inferior people doing that not fighting until last man thats not going sit well with guinness whos going show japanese whos inferior he notes that bridge being built is not sound structurally he determines that combat idleness men bad effect morale hell build bridge that will show hayakawa whos inferior hayakawa loses control his own bridge construction enemy breaks down because it bridge river kwai as film wouldnt work at all if it were not alec guinness hes clearly not kept his eye ball use american baseball term forgotten that two countries are at war that its not private spat between him hayakawa yet his concern his men is genuine he must have been pretty good commander combat situation retain affection his men have him executing complexity colonel nicholson won him academy award it carries film taking different view perks being officer is william holden his role is not original novel by pierre boule but was created justify big american box office name usa market but it was good thing because holden as american does bring different perspective events holden having won his oscar stalag 17 as prisoner war brings his former role sefton this film thats not as flip as it sounds because sefton stalag 17 did remark about escaping then being sent pacific getting captured doing time japanese prison course hed have had have changed branches service we never do learn holdens real name seems as though when his ship went down holden survivor exchanges uniform dog tags with navy commander named shears it doesnt get him quite perks he thought hed get but hes resourceful enough it took me several viewings bridge river kwai figure out why holden didnt go back his real name rank after he escaped after he arrived british hospital sri lanka its reason why ann sears has small but critical role as wren that holden enjoys little romantic idyll with she might not have given him time day if he was seaman first class instead lieutenant commander but british get holdens charade jack hawkins blackjacks him into going mission destroy bridge that british intelligence has found out japanese are building if guinness has forgotten what side hes hawkins sure hasnt jack hawkinss role tends get overshadowed by guinness he never gets credit due him this film but he does well as determined man mission one other part worthy mentioning is james donald as medical officer guinnesss battalion he has great affection guinness but apparently hes only one pow camp that sees implication what british prisoners are being ordered do by their commander also wholl tell guinness ever so gently donald puts final coda bridge river kwai with his words that end this great film achievement,0.4282156862745098,0.07691503267973857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.52}"
10.0,A powerful film experience,"I heard a film critic once say that there really aren't ""war movies""; there are only ""anti-war"" movies. I'm still not sure what I think of that claim, but having seen - The Bridge on the River Kwai- enough times in the past several years, I think I'm persuaded that it's at least half right. -Kwai-, I believe, is both a ""war"" and ""anti-war"" movie, and, in my view, it succeeds admirably at both.There is almost no element of -Kwai- that is not praise-worthy. David Lean's direction is tight and evocative. The cinematography is great (even though the color seems increasingly drained in film versions that I have seen). The acting is top-notch. I honestly believe that this is Alec Guiness's best performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is also highly sympathetic and believable. William Holden and Jack Hawkins round out the cast nicely.The musical score is also right on. Simply put, -Kwai- is an excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared a great deal about it. As a result, the viewer comes to care a great deal about it as well.Clearly -Kwai- is an anti-war film. There is no glorification here. War is brutal, period. It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles. Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly. Yet, -Kwai- also shows the resilience of the human spirit as well as its complexity. One is left wondering if participation in World War II not only psychologically brutalized the characters played by Guiness, Hayakawa, and Holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them. The paradox is striking to me each time I view this film. War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.So, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie? I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.Regardless, -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed. It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none.",powerful film experience,i heard film critic once say that there really arent war movies there are only anti war movies im still not sure what i think that claim but having seen bridge river kwai enough times past several years i think im persuaded that its at least half right kwai i believe is both war anti war movie my view it succeeds admirably at both there is almost no element kwai that is not praise worthy david leans direction is tight evocative cinematography is great even though color seems increasingly drained film versions that i have seen acting is top notch i honestly believe that this is alec guinesss best performance sessue hayakawa is also highly sympathetic believable william holden jack hawkins round out cast nicely musical score is also right simply put kwai is excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared great deal about it as result viewer comes care great deal about it as well clearly kwai is anti war film there is no glorification here war is brutal period its brutality is not captured here terms gory carnage or senseless battles instead psychological dimension brutality comes across clearly yet kwai also shows resilience human spirit as well as its complexity one is left wondering if participation world war ii not only psychologically brutalized characters played by guiness hayakawa holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them paradox is striking me each time i view this film war can act both as positive negative catalyst it can do both these things at same instant so is bridge river kwai war movie or anti war movie i think lean clearly preferred latter but subject matter his approach it may have landed somewhere between regardless kwai is fantastic film experience is not be missed it is simply put my very favorite film bar none,0.5072383056758057,0.15614853896103895,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,A Classic Story and Brilliant Acting,"""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is, as others have said, an anti-war film. It concerns the struggle between a British officer, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), who is confined with his men in a Japanese POW camp, and the Japanese commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), who has orders to finish a section of railroad using prisoner labor.The conditions in the camp are brutal. The tropical sun makes for punishing working conditions, especially for men whose health has been compromised by injuries, punishment and jungle diseases. Despite the hardships, Nicholson is dedicated to proving the superiority of the British will. He is an admirable figure, but he has one fatal flaw.The other major character is Shears, an American naval officer whose knack for self-preservation helped him survive Saito and the sun before Nicholson's men ever marched into the prison camp. Shears is a cynic who is dedicated not to military rules and regulations but to his own welfare. He views Saito and Nicholson from the sidelines. Like Puck, he seems to say ""Lord what fools these mortals be.""Shears is the most complex character in the film. He makes decisions that might appear contrary to his basic nature. As such, the role of Shears can be viewed as a companion to William Holden's performance as Sefton in ""Stalag 17"". Sefton is a prisoner in a German POW camp. Like Shears, he is cynical and pragmatic.Viewers might find elements of heroism in the behaviors of Nicholson, Shears or Saito, depending upon their points of view.

9.0,Among the Best.,"This may be the best war movie -- if that's what it is -- that was ever put together. I don't think it would be made today. It was expensive and there were no women in it to speak of, and any committee member with an MBA reading the script would wonder why there wasn't more action. Further, the movie hasn't got any magnificent computerized graphics going for it. And we hardly see any blood. And nobody's head gets blown apart. And there's not a foul word in it.David Lean has pulled off a neat stunt, making a superb film with a good script, great performances, effective location shooting, a subtext that provokes thought, a marvelously believable set of characterizations -- and no gimmicks.It begins traditionally enough, with red mud and brilliant green foliage, and an authentic prisoner of war camp into which Nicholson's captured battalion marches proudly. The first real hint we get of the film's originality is when the men are marching in place to Colonel Bogey's march and we get one or two shots of feet stomping up and down on the wet gravel. One pair of feet wears only half shoes. The toes are pointing out of the right shoe. On the left shoe, the upper has separated from the sole, and it flaps up and down as the foot inside it drives into the earth. Not only is the shot THERE but it's lingered over, just long enough.William Holden is running through the bushes, trying to escape from the camp, disturbing flocks of bird that chirp madly at him. One of his Japanese pursuers shoots him and he tumbles into a turbulent river. In any Hollywood movie, the drop would be done by a stunt man in the usual manner -- head over heels, arms flailing, off the cliff. Not here. Holden falls feet first, hands and palms held out at his sides, as if expecting to land on a trampoline. He simply doesn't FALL like a professional.The film is loaded with grace notes like this. It's difficult to imagine a director willing to take the time to fine tune his film like this today because both the people making films and the viewers themselves are impatient to get on with the story and reach the next scene that has sex, blood, or comedy in it. I wonder if it's coincidental that people now categorize themselves as fans of one or another basketball team instead of a baseball team. Watching a baseball game calls for patience while the batter digs his cleated shoes into the dirt around the plate. Basketball is all momentum and no patience is required.I won't go on about the movie except to say that it's masterly in almost every respect. But I guess I will mention one more thing of the sort that impressed me, dealing with characterization. Throughout the movie, we've been told and shown that Nicholson cares for nothing so much as the bridge itself. He began by thinking of it as a way to keep up the men's morale and a reason for keeping discipline, but it has come to have functional autonomy, eclipsing everything else in importance. Note the way Guiness's eyes light up in the day-for-night scene when he's told that similar bridges built of English elms have lasted for three hundred years. ""Three hundred years!"", he marvels.Likewise, the supporting character of Joyce, on the commandos, is shown as being uncertain of whether he could use his knife in hand to hand combat or not. When an armed Japanese soldier appears at arm's length, Joyce freezes and Jack Hawkins dashes in to kill the man. These two traits -- Nicholson's obsession with the bridge and Joyce's inability to use a knife -- are set up so that the final (and only) confrontation between Nicholson and Joyce can take place the way it does. Nicholson screams, ""Blow up the BRIDGE?"", grabs Joyce's legs and pulls him down to the sand, preventing Joyce from reaching the detonator. Commandoes be damned, nobody is going to destroy his bridge. Hawkins and Holden shout from the opposite bank of the river, urging Joyce to ""kill him!"" But Joyce can't kill him without using a knife, which we know he will be unable to do.It's a perfect payoff for what we've learned about the two men.Did Nicholson deliberately throw himself on the detonator as he was dying or did he fall on it by accident? Who cares. If he did it deliberately it would be a heroic act since he finally ""came to his senses."" But an accident would be more in keeping with the ironic tone of the rest of the film. At the end, everyone and everything of importance is dead except Clipton the humanitarian doctor who tells us unnecessarily that this is ""madness"" -- and those floating vultures with their Olympian view of these goings-on.It's a gripping movie from beginning to end, a magnificent job by everyone involved.",among best,this may be best war movie if thats what it is that was ever put together i dont think it would be made today it was expensive there were no women it speak any committee member with mba reading script would wonder why there wasnt more action further movie hasnt got any magnificent computerized graphics going it we hardly see any blood nobodys head gets blown apart theres not foul word it david lean has pulled off neat stunt making superb film with good script great performances effective location shooting subtext that provokes thought marvelously believable set characterizations no gimmicks it begins traditionally enough with red mud brilliant green foliage authentic prisoner war camp into which nicholsons captured battalion marches proudly first real hint we get films originality is when men are marching place colonel bogeys march we get one or two shots feet stomping up down wet gravel one pair feet wears only half shoes toes are pointing out right shoe left shoe upper has separated sole it flaps up down as foot inside it drives into earth not only is shot there but its lingered over just long enough william holden is running through bushes trying escape camp disturbing flocks bird that chirp madly at him one his japanese pursuers shoots him he tumbles into turbulent river any hollywood movie drop would be done by stunt man usual manner head over heels arms flailing off cliff not here holden falls feet first hands palms held out at his sides as if expecting land trampoline he simply doesnt fall like professional film is loaded with grace notes like this its difficult imagine director willing take time fine tune his film like this today because both people making films viewers themselves are impatient get with story reach next scene that has sex blood or comedy it i wonder if its coincidental that people now categorize themselves as fans one or another basketball team instead baseball team watching baseball game calls patience while batter digs his cleated shoes into dirt around plate basketball is all momentum no patience is required i wont go about movie except say that its masterly almost every respect but i guess i will mention one more thing sort that impressed me dealing with characterization throughout movie weve been told shown that nicholson cares nothing so much as bridge itself he began by thinking it as way keep up mens morale reason keeping discipline but it has come have functional autonomy eclipsing everything else importance note way guinesss eyes light up day night scene when hes told that similar bridges built english elms have lasted three hundred years three hundred years he marvels likewise supporting character joyce commandos is shown as being uncertain whether he could use his knife hand hand combat or not when armed japanese soldier appears at arms length joyce freezes jack hawkins dashes kill man these two traits nicholsons obsession with bridge joyces inability use knife are set up so that final only confrontation between nicholson joyce can take place way it does nicholson screams blow up bridge grabs joyces legs pulls him down sand preventing joyce reaching detonator commandoes be damned nobody is going destroy his bridge hawkins holden shout opposite bank river urging joyce kill him but joyce cant kill him without using knife which we know he will be unable do its perfect payoff what weve learned about two men did nicholson deliberately throw himself detonator as he was dying or did he fall it by accident who cares if he did it deliberately it would be heroic act since he finally came his senses but accident would be more keeping with ironic tone rest film at end everyone everything importance is dead except clipton humanitarian doctor who tells us unnecessarily that this is madness those floating vultures with their olympian view these goings its gripping movie beginning end magnificent job by everyone involved,0.5210959383753501,0.16253501400560225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,an exceptional war film with only one minor flaw,"I saw this film as a kid and wasn't particularly impressed. Considering just how long it had been, I decided to give it another chance. And, fortunately, I was rewarded by finding the film far better than I remembered.The movie is apparently based on real-life characters, though exactly how close to the real ones I am real uncertain. And this brings me to a problem with the film. Sessue Hayakawa played an incredibly reasonable Japanese prison commandant. Apparently the real Colonel he played was indeed an atypical man--most Japanese officers in a similar situation would have most likely just killed Alec Guinness and the other officers who refused his orders. I could, begrudgingly, accept this. But, when this tough Japanese soldier is seen CRYING in his hut, this just seemed ridiculous and almost impossible to believe.Okay, now apart from that, the movie was great. William Holden was essentially the same character he played in Stalag 17--almost like a close in fact of the same opportunistic ""hero"". I liked this as a counter-point to the usual tough-guy hero in movies.As for Guinness, he plays an excellent, but very odd British officer who is a great example of an Obsessive-Compulsive nut! He is so bent on maintaining self-control and a ""stiff upper lip"" that he completely loses sight of the war and the fact that the Japanese are the enemy! He and Holden both are amazing psychological portraits.Other than the acting, the cinematography and music were excellent.

9.0,Far Ahead of Its Time,"First off, what is so amazing about this film is that, for the time that it was made, how modern it looks. David Lean certainly had the eye of any modern director and managed to direct a visual masterpiece at a time when many films were still being shot in black and white.  William Holden gives one of his finest performances as a cynic of warfare , citing for us the insanity and absurdity that the combatants often convey. And he hates the war, but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again and again. We wish he could stay on the beach with his nurse lover, but he is a man destined for a tragic doom for his country, whether he wants to or not.  Alec Guiness also delivers a fine performance as a bold general whose own pride is, at the same time, his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault. He is uncompromising, yet when the Japanese submit to his demands, he begins overseeing the construction of the bridge with great esteem. Eventually, for him, the bridge becomes a manifestation of his belief of the superiority of the British Army, which he follows like a religion. And in putting all his pride into this bridge, he loses sight of even the British's own true agenda. Truly, his sense of overwhelming honor is, at the same time, his downfall in a descent to a loss of morality, and a sense of good and evil.  And yes, by the end of this film, we learn a great lesson of the horrors of war. Not only does it take the lives of many good men, but the utter failure and despair that accompany it make it an unbearable existence. And this message has only recently been re-evaluated with the also-brilliant masterpiece ""Saving Private Ryan."" But, keep in mind that it took forty years to regain the power that this film inspired so long ago.",far ahead its time,first off what is so amazing about this film is that time that it was made how modern it looks david lean certainly had eye any modern director managed direct visual masterpiece at time when many films were still being shot black white william holden gives one his finest performances as cynic warfare citing us insanity absurdity that combatants often convey he hates war but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again again we wish he could stay beach with his nurse lover but he is man destined tragic doom his country whether he wants or not alec guiness also delivers fine performance as bold general whose own pride is at same time his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault he is uncompromising yet when japanese submit his demands he begins overseeing construction bridge with great esteem eventually him bridge becomes manifestation his belief superiority british army which he follows like religion putting all his pride into this bridge he loses sight even britishs own true agenda truly his sense overwhelming honor is at same time his downfall descent loss morality sense good evil yes by end this film we learn great lesson horrors war not only does it take lives many good men but utter failure despair that accompany it make it unbearable existence this message has only recently been re evaluated with also brilliant masterpiece saving private ryan but keep mind that it took forty years regain power that this film inspired so long ago,0.5390642303433001,0.2123477297895902,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Great film from a year of great movies.,"Man, 1957! What a year of great films: 12 ANGRY MEN, PATHS OF GLORY, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Sometimes, I think that 1957 gets forgotten as being one of the great years of films and that's a shame. BRIDGE won Best Picture in this year, one of the very few in film history that I think is at least deserving. That said, PATHS OF GLORY is amongst the top 10 films of all time as far as I'm concerned, but I don't think it was released immediately in the U.S. in 1957, so I can forgive the Academy that one!This film is about a band of British POWs at a Japanese internment camp in the Burmese jungle during mid-WWII. They are led by career military man Colonel Nicholson (Best Actor Oscar winner Sir Alec Guiness) and the camp's Commander Saito forces Nicholson and his men to build a railroad bridge which trains will be able to cross to transport enemy troops and dignitaries, and to get supplies to enemy forces. Nicholson, ever the 'loyal' British officer, agrees to build a quality bridge in exchange for Saito treating his men in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Some of his officers question Nicholson's collusion with Saito and wonder about his patriotism. Also questioning Nicholson's motives are an American POW Shears (William Holden, who actually has top billing in this film and gives a terrific performance in his own right). Shears escapes the camp, only to be drafted by Major Warden (2nd billed Jack Hawkins) to be part of a team of Allied soldiers to return to the camp to destroy the bridge. Shears is necessary to lead the expedition since he was at the camp and could lead them the quickest route to get there.The film speaks a lot about the duality of man: on the one hand as 'prisoners' of war, Nicholson wanted he and his men to be treated accordingly to the Geneva convention, but he knew that to get this treatment, he had to make compromises with Saito; on the other hand, they were prisoners of 'war' and Saito is the enemy and it is unspoken rule that you should never collude with the enemy, even if it means mistreatment and taking uncalled for punishment. Nicholson is very prideful, prim, and proper and let these properties shine through. In his mind, he was doing his duty as a 'British' soldier, but in the end realized that what he was really doing was betraying the core values of what it really meant to be a British 'soldier'.The film is also very watchable, even today. You get completely enthralled by the story and characters. It never seems dated. The climactic bridge-destroying scene at the end always blows me away (no pun intended). And the last line in the film is one I've never forgotten and sums up the point of the whole film. A true classic.",great film year great movies,man 1957 what year great films 12 angry men paths glory sweet smell success gunfight at ok corral this film bridge river kwai sometimes i think that 1957 gets forgotten as being one great years films thats shame bridge won best picture this year one very few film history that i think is at least deserving that said paths glory is amongst top 10 films all time as far as im concerned but i dont think it was released immediately u s 1957 so i can forgive academy that one this film is about band british pows at japanese internment camp burmese jungle during mid wwii they are led by career military man colonel nicholson best actor oscar winner sir alec guiness camps commander saito forces nicholson his men build railroad bridge which trains will be able cross transport enemy troops dignitaries get supplies enemy forces nicholson ever loyal british officer agrees build quality bridge exchange saito treating his men accordance with geneva convention some his officers question nicholsons collusion with saito wonder about his patriotism also questioning nicholsons motives are american pow shears william holden who actually has top billing this film gives terrific performance his own right shears escapes camp only be drafted by major warden 2nd billed jack hawkins be part team allied soldiers return camp destroy bridge shears is necessary lead expedition since he was at camp could lead them quickest route get there film speaks lot about duality man one hand as prisoners war nicholson wanted he his men be treated accordingly geneva convention but he knew that get this treatment he had make compromises with saito other hand they were prisoners war saito is enemy it is unspoken rule that you should never collude with enemy even if it means mistreatment taking uncalled punishment nicholson is very prideful prim proper let these properties shine through his mind he was doing his duty as british soldier but end realized that what he was really doing was betraying core values what it really meant be british soldier film is also very watchable even today you get completely enthralled by story characters it never seems dated climactic bridge destroying scene at end always blows me away no pun intended last line film is one ive never forgotten sums up point whole film true classic,0.3944246031746032,0.20340029761904757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,It Doesn't Have to Be Historically Accurate,"To criticize movies for historical inaccuracy is to damn almost every work of historical fiction. First of all, the people who were there were not involved in the production. Secondly, if movies were truly historically accurate, they would be so dull, you couldn't watch them. To start with, this is based on a work of fiction. It is an idealized version of an event that took place some time in the past. It's characters are fictionalized. We don't know what they said or really did. Some were probably combinations of two or three different characters. Also, the criticism that people wouldn't make deals with the enemy is pretty naive. Sometime the deal making is what keeps you alive and gives you a chance to fight another day. It's easy to say that one would do or not do something, sitting on a couch in a living room. It doesn't reflect badly on soldiers in war time to be afraid, and, yes, seemingly traitorous. The story is a wonderful one about courage and drive and sacrifice and pain. This is how we as human beings keep going. A man once told me that the one consistent trait that Holocaust survivors had was that they had determined a goal in their lives. The building of the bridge becomes something to live for, even if it is for the gratification of the enemy. Of course, the leader cracked and almost destroyed the mission. This does happen. It doesn't diminish the movie or the character. This is a wonderful, exciting film with great performances, even if history may not totally accept it.",it doesnt have be historically accurate,criticize movies historical inaccuracy is damn almost every work historical fiction first all people who were there were not involved production secondly if movies were truly historically accurate they would be so dull you couldnt watch them start with this is based work fiction it is idealized version event that took place some time past its characters are fictionalized we dont know what they said or really did some were probably combinations two or three different characters also criticism that people wouldnt make deals with enemy is pretty naive sometime deal making is what keeps you alive gives you chance fight another day its easy say that one would do or not do something sitting couch living room it doesnt reflect badly soldiers war time be afraid yes seemingly traitorous story is wonderful one about courage drive sacrifice pain this is how we as human beings keep going man once told me that one consistent trait that holocaust survivors had was that they had determined goal their lives building bridge becomes something live even if it is gratification enemy course leader cracked almost destroyed mission this does happen it doesnt diminish movie or character this is wonderful exciting film with great performances even if history may not totally accept it,0.5458333333333334,0.1407512626262626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.51}"
8.0,One Serious Flaw,"Rightly BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is considered a classic of cinema , it`s well made , well directed and most of all well acted by the cast , but this doesn`t stop a major problem with the script from nearly wrecking the whole film and it`s this : The imperial Japanese committed the worst crimes against humanity in the whole 20th century . Of course they weren`t alone Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot et al murdered millions upon millions of innocents and for that their can be no excuse , they have the blood of countless people on their hands , but these unreasonable murders were committed for the reason of utopian idealogy . Imperial Japanese barbarity had little if any idealogy behind it . Defeated armies and civilian prisoners were treated as cowardly "" Untermenschen "" to be treated with the utmost inhuman contempt and without mercy . As many as ten million Chinese died at the hands of the Japanese and millions of more Asians died across Asia during the Nipponese occupation . And it`s this rewriting of history in order to bring about a dramatic story that comes close to destroying the film . Nicholson stands up to his captors and refuses to be broken by them . Very dramatic ( Helped no end by Sir Alec`s performance . Perhaps the greatest actor of all time ) but in reality Nicholson would have been tied to a stake and left to starve to death . In fact Nicholson wouldn`t have had to show any defiance it was very common for Japanese guards to use prisoners for live bayonet practice just for the sheer hell of it . I take it because it was made during the cold war that Hollywood tried to rehabilitate both Germany and Japan by showing them in a less cruel light , but whatever the reason it is rather annoying to see prisoners holding concert parties in a Japanese POW camp . So treat this film as a drama not as a history lesson . For the record the real bridge was bombed by the American airforce",one serious flaw,rightly bridge river kwai is considered classic cinema it s well made well directed most all well acted by cast but this doesn t stop major problem with script nearly wrecking whole film it s this imperial japanese committed worst crimes against humanity whole 20th century course they weren t alone hitler stalin mao pol pot et al murdered millions upon millions innocents that their can be no excuse they have blood countless people their hands but these unreasonable murders were committed reason utopian idealogy imperial japanese barbarity had little if any idealogy behind it defeated armies civilian prisoners were treated as cowardly untermenschen be treated with utmost inhuman contempt without mercy as many as ten million chinese died at hands japanese millions more asians died across asia during nipponese occupation it s this rewriting history order bring about dramatic story that comes close destroying film nicholson stands up his captors refuses be broken by them very dramatic helped no end by sir alec s performance perhaps greatest actor all time but reality nicholson would have been tied stake left starve death fact nicholson wouldn t have had show any defiance it was very common japanese guards use prisoners live bayonet practice just sheer hell it i take it because it was made during cold war that hollywood tried rehabilitate both germany japan by showing them less cruel light but whatever reason it is rather annoying see prisoners holding concert parties japanese pow camp so treat this film as drama not as history lesson record real bridge was bombed by american airforce,0.4093772893772894,-0.056356976356976354,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,"Jolly good show, chaps","""We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency that will put them to shame! We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing!"" - Colonel Nicholson ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" stars Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson, a British officer who has been captured by the Japanese Army and placed in a prison camp somewhere in western Thailand. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito, orders Nicholson and his men to build a bridge across the river Kwai (in order for a rail-link connecting Bangkok and Burma to be completed) but Nicholson refuses.What follows is a battle of wills. The Japanese camp commander seeks to break Nicholson, turning him into a slave labourer. Nicholson, however, remains steadfast in his pride and dignity. A caricature of stiff-upper-lipped Brits, he's proud of the Empire, proud of British engineering, dutiful, cultured, and a stickler for rules, regulations and the Geneva Convention. If he is to be made a slave, then by God, he will do it with dignity! He will do it on his own terms! ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" was, of course, directed by David Lean, that master of location photography and beautiful compositions. In our CGI age, its refreshing to see a director who went to such extreme lengths to find great scenery. Lean, from this point onwards, would paint on an increasingly grand canvas.Though ""Bridge"" works on an archetypal level, there are some nagging problems. Following WW2, the British and Americans suddenly needed to portray the Japanese as ""our allies"". After years of portraying them as screaming savages, Japan was now our new ""friend"" in the ""war against communism"". They were needed as a bulwark to prevent the Russians from moving further southward and so efforts were made to paint them in a more ""friendly"" manner. As a result, all Asians in ""Bridge"" are portrayed in a ridiculously cartoonish light. They are all teary base commanders, resourceful peasants or big breasted sexy women who fall head over heels for American boys. The film's titular bridge itself eventually becomes a hokey symbol for uneasy cultures working together to bridge their differences because, ""someday, after this war, what we build here might help somebody."" Compare this to ""Hei Tai Yang 731"", a Chinese film which documented the atrocities that the Japense army regiment of Camp 731 carried out on innocent Chinese and Russian families. Of course that film is merely propaganda from another perspective, but in its extremities it nevertheless highlights how absurd ""Bridge's"" portrayals of camp life are; Lean's prison camps are far too homey.Strange too is Nicholson's comment that he ""refuses to work like a coolie"". ""Coolie"" is a derogatory slang term used to describe Asian and Indian slaves or indentured workers. Today the term is still used in some Caribbean islands to describe West Indians brought over during the slave trade. The irony that Nicholson is condemning the Japanese for using the very same practises used by the British Empire is completely lost on Lean. Nicholson isn't a hero for ""retaining his humanity"" and ""refusing to work like a coolie"", he's a hypocrite.But still, the film works on a primal level. Why does everyone love a good prison break movie (""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Shawshank"", ""Papillon"", ""Birdman of Alcatraz"", ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Great Escape"" etc"")? Probably because they're all thinly disguised existential tales centring on captured heroes who must break free, emancipating themselves from some phantom Order. Having escaped the constrictions of this immoral system, they achieve a kind of Nietzschean freedom or spiritual transcendence. It's all quite silly, but hits people on an archetypal, almost primal level.What's unique about ""The Bridge Over The River Kwai"" is that there is no ""literal"" freedom. Nicholson and his men don't escape the constrictions of the camp, rather, they change the camp to adhere to their own standards, their own ""British"" way of life.At the end of ""Bridge"", Nicholson and Saito stand on their bridge, and Nicholson remarks ""isn't this beautiful?"" Saito nods, the duo sharing their only moment of agreement, though Lean subtly implies that Saito is really referring to the rising sun in the distance. One man sees beauty in British engineering, pride, duty, strength and solidarity, whilst the other quite literally sees beauty in the ""rising sun"" of the Japanese Empire. With the bridge blowing up at the end of the film and Saito eventually dying, the film ends on what Lean has insisted is an ""anti-war note"", suggesting that it is the ""madness of war"" that keeps cultures apart. For Brit audiences, though, the film tends to fan the passions of patriotism.8/10 – An attempt to rewrite history, yes, but the film is nevertheless iconic, its characters have gravity and Lean in many ways invented huge chunks of cinematic grammar. We take his influence for granted now, but there are numerous little shots, compositions and trends in this film that Lean is responsible for starting.

8.0,Award-winning rendition about famed novel with extraordinary performances and atmospheric scenarios,"In the lush jungle of Thailand , WWII British prisoners (Alec Guinnes, James Donald , Percy Herbert , among others) captured in the fall of Singapur are taken by Japanese wardens for building a railway bridge on the trail from Bangkok to Rangun . There takes place a stirring appearance when the prisoners arrive in the POW war camp whistling the title song : the Colonel Bogey March . Central plot is the troublesome relationship between the obstinate Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinnes) and a cruel ruler , camp commandant Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and parallel efforts by escaped convict (William Holden) , officer (Jack Hawkins) and soldier (Geoffrey Horne) to destroy the bridge .This excellent film , deservedly winner of several Oscars was magnificently directed by David Lean . However , firstly was slated Alexander Korda , but he withdrew due to he deemed wrong the main roles . Also was originally considered Howard Hawks , but he abandoned , especially concerned , that's why all male lead characters and because his previous film, ¨Land of the pharaohs¨, failed at the Box office . Gary Grant was firstly hired , but declined due to other offers and was substituted by William Holden . Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson were uncredited , they were formerly blacklisted as suspect communists and only appears credited Pierre Boulle who won Academy Award to best adapted script , though he didn't know English language . In 1984 when the movie was restored , they retrospectively won the prize , but sadly they had dead , however their names were justly added to writing credits . The famous march whistle by prisoners , is original from 1916 titled ¨Bollocks and the same for you¨ by Mayor Ricketts , a chief of musical band and the actual words were obscene , later being re-titled Colonel Bogey March . Equally , it won Oscar to best musical score by composer Malcolm Arnold . The authentic bridge was built by prisoners in two months and constructed for film was four months with help elephants and hundreds of workers and length 425 feet long and 50 foot above the water , in Ceylon location . But was demolished in a matter of seconds , as it is splendidly reflected in the movie.",award winning rendition about famed novel with extraordinary performances atmospheric scenarios,lush jungle thailand wwii british prisoners alec guinnes james donald percy herbert among others captured fall singapur are taken by japanese wardens building railway bridge trail bangkok rangun there takes place stirring appearance when prisoners arrive pow war camp whistling title song colonel bogey march central plot is troublesome relationship between obstinate colonel nicholson alec guinnes cruel ruler camp commandant colonel saito sessue hayakawa parallel efforts by escaped convict william holden officer jack hawkins soldier geoffrey horne destroy bridge this excellent film deservedly winner several oscars was magnificently directed by david lean however firstly was slated alexander korda but he withdrew due he deemed wrong main roles also was originally considered howard hawks but he abandoned especially concerned thats why all male lead characters because his previous film land pharaohs failed at box office gary grant was firstly hired but declined due other offers was substituted by william holden carl foreman michael wilson were uncredited they were formerly blacklisted as suspect communists only appears credited pierre boulle who won academy award best adapted script though he didnt know english language 1984 when movie was restored they retrospectively won prize but sadly they had dead however their names were justly added writing credits famous march whistle by prisoners is original 1916 titled bollocks same you by mayor ricketts chief musical band actual words were obscene later being re titled colonel bogey march equally it won oscar best musical score by composer malcolm arnold authentic bridge was built by prisoners two months constructed film was four months with help elephants hundreds workers length 425 feet long 50 foot above water ceylon location but was demolished matter seconds as it is splendidly reflected movie,0.4025925925925926,0.10648148148148147,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.56}"
8.0,Another WW2 classic,"Another WW2 classic, this one refreshingly showing the action in a fresher Eastern theatre compared to the usual pictures. It's a lengthy and slow-paced affair that plays out as a character piece for the much of time, which makes it quite engrossing; Alec Guinness in particular plays a really interesting and morally complex character, although Holden's is easier (and easier to like). The authenticity is spot on and the second half's commando raid brings in plenty of suspense, while the ending is fantastically tense.",another ww2 classic,another ww2 classic this one refreshingly showing action fresher eastern theatre compared usual pictures its lengthy slow paced affair that plays out as character piece much time which makes it quite engrossing alec guinness particular plays really interesting morally complex character although holdens is easier easier like authenticity is spot second halfs commando raid brings plenty suspense while ending is fantastically tense,0.3628205128205128,0.09358974358974358,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.47}"
6.0,"Good film, but a travesty of history","I am normally an admirer of David Lean. But it is difficult to understand why he chose to base this film on a real event at the River Kwai, as it grossly misrepresents the real ""Colonel Nicholson"" and caused considerable distress to both him and the River Kwai veterans.The Colonel Nicholson character is based on the allied camp commander, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey, who was a remarkable officer by any standards.Awarded the DSO for heroism during the defence of Singapore, he refused an order to join the evacuation so he could remain with his men during captivity. In the hellish conditions of the camp, he worked courageously to ensure that as many of his men as possible would survive. He endured regular beatings when he complained of ill-treatment of prisoners, but as a skilled negotiator he was able to win many concessions from the Japanese by convincing them that this would speed the completion of the work. Behind their backs, however, he did everything possible to delay and sabotage the construction without endangering his men, and also helped organise a daring escape, at considerable cost to himself. For his conduct in the camp, he won the undying respect of his men.After the war, he showed great generosity of spirit by saving the life of Colonel Saito, second in command at the camp and a relatively decent officer, when he spoke up for him at the war crimes tribunal. He worked for the veterans all his life, and became President of the National Federation of Far Eastern Prisoners of War.He refused repeated requests by the veterans to speak out against the film, being much too modest to seek any glory or recognition for himself. However you will find his achievements documented in a book by Professor Peter Davies entitled ""The Man Behind the Bridge"".Toosey hoped that no one watching the film would believe a British Army officer could be so stupid in real life. But with the film being rated on this site as one of the top 50 movies of all time, this hope may have been misplaced. Enjoy the film by all means as a work of fiction, but it is surely important to set the record straight and recognise the heroism of the real man involved.",good film but travesty history,i am normally admirer david lean but it is difficult understand why he chose base this film real event at river kwai as it grossly misrepresents real colonel nicholson caused considerable distress both him river kwai veterans colonel nicholson character is based allied camp commander lieutenant colonel philip toosey who was remarkable officer by any standards awarded dso heroism during defence singapore he refused order join evacuation so he could remain with his men during captivity hellish conditions camp he worked courageously ensure that as many his men as possible would survive he endured regular beatings when he complained ill treatment prisoners but as skilled negotiator he was able win many concessions japanese by convincing them that this would speed completion work behind their backs however he did everything possible delay sabotage construction without endangering his men also helped organise daring escape at considerable cost himself his conduct camp he won undying respect his men after war he showed great generosity spirit by saving life colonel saito second command at camp relatively decent officer when he spoke up him at war crimes tribunal he worked veterans all his life became president national federation far eastern prisoners war he refused repeated requests by veterans speak out against film being much too modest seek any glory or recognition himself however you will find his achievements documented book by professor peter davies entitled man behind bridge toosey hoped that no one watching film would believe british army officer could be so stupid real life but with film being rated this site as one top 50 movies all time this hope may have been misplaced enjoy film by all means as work fiction but it is surely important set record straight recognise heroism real man involved,0.5491946088099933,0.1247863247863248,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.48}"
