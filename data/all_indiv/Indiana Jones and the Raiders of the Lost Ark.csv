9.0,When Harrison Ford was crapping gold,"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids. I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg.

10.0,There will never be another film like Raiders,"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME",there will never be another film like raiders,it is hot sunny day south america we see bunch men shot mostly back they are walking deep into forest we see tall dark figure he is wearing old leather jacket he has 5 oclock shadow looking like its closer midnight he wears fedora he carries bull whip yes bull whip finally two men enter cave we hear about some guy named forstall who was good very very good but he never came out place alive but they enter anyway they are confronted with tarantulas spears that are triggered by blocking out light pit that they must swing over then more tiny poisonous darts that come out wall all this protect ancient gold statue they recover it one guy dies other barely makes it out room before it all falls him then he has get out cave giant boulder chases him finally he makes it out cave only be surrounded by hovitos his arch enemy named belloq he takes gold statue that this guy worked so hard then guy runs makes it plane where he is passenger seat there is big snake plane he hates snakes this mans name indiana jones whhhoooooo im left breathless just describing that opening but is there better beginning movie ever absolutely not does beginning have anything do with rest film no it is all decoration what movie is going put you through 90 minutes come indiana jones is best character ever hit screens he better be he is created by george steven played by harrison ford that may seem normal now that we have lived with him 20 years but can you imagine what that must have been like back 1981 that would be like tom hanks or will smith joining forces with james cameron steven spielberg completely original idea todays terms raiders took simple idea maybe idea that guys had watching saturday afternoon movies made it larger than life this film never stops you take your breath it is filled with rich characters indy himself marion belloq even marcus brody each has their own personality that shines through certain scenes some my faves were when we first meet marion having shot contest her bar nepal then there is her scene with belloq they get drunk together she tries leave using only butter knife course who can forget indys battle with swordsman his unrivaled determination get ark indy there is not time if you still want truck it is being loaded truck cairo battered bloody indy truck what truck then later get some transport back england boat plane anything meet me at omars im going after that truck sola how indy i dont know im making this up as i go raiders has more energy than three action films that is what makes it classic that it is if you like movies then raiders is movie that will not let you down it is pure entertainment that is indisputable it finds youngster all us bombards us with this silly whip cracking average incredibly determined archaeologist only asks us have fun that we do me only reason that chariots fire won best picture that year is because it is serious film raiders was heads shoulders above chariots it should have cleaned up at oscars 81 but more politics with academy raiders lost ark is epitome entertainment what more can be said about it if you havent seen this movie while or if you havent seen it at all gasp then do yourself favour rent it tonight it is awesome trust me,0.5395753272069062,0.16402951824004455,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time.",excellent movie brilliantly crafted entertainment with superb casting,i remember seeing this movie when i was young it may well have been cinema with my father i cant quite remember if he does then please post answer anyway i do remember seeing it being thoroughly entertained that feeling excitement total fun staying with me this very day as that is feeling that movie conjures up whenever i think it i think part that is down fact its complete retake old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style that is just perfect kids appeals them no end or rather it did then so it was with excitement that i opened my presents my birthday found boxset indiana jones trilogy with even more excitement when i finally watched first trilogy raiders lost ark it was just as i remembered fun excitement wise cracks tiny splattering romance but with manliness that kids would allow lots stunts action its superb movie captures that style serials adventure stories comic books perfectly how i know that sure is only through repeats since i wasnt alive during those times set pieces are fantastic although some wilder end sequences are slightly dated now it hasnt lost excitement factor its perfectly crafted movie as well moving location location without any distraction or superfluous scenes it just feels like its all there reason that it belongs there harrison ford is excellent role im inclined think he was more indy than he was solo but thats personal opinion he has many more facial movements voice inclinations this early movie than he does nowadays now he belongs moody quiet school acting then he was dynamic adventurous strong as wisecracking as best them there are some excellent movie making moments this with george lucas steven spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out every pore where did all that go star wars i iii mr lucas they end up making excellently entertaining movie some could argue that there could be bit more depth or seriousness story but come its ripping adventure yarn you dont need depth saving ark nazis surely thats enough excellent movie great fun too without doubt one my favourite all time,0.5725490196078432,0.38747276688453164,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.34, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Will stand the test of time forever.,"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?",will stand test time forever,ive seen raiders lost ark numerous times tv dvd big screen my local theatre had special showing last night 400 seat screen completely sold out as indy films always do luckily me my pal we got last 2 tickets available i cant think many films that still sell out 25 years after their original release theres just something about indy movies iconic hero affection epic spectacle that brings you back again again only trouble with that is there are zillions reviews critiques dissections this movie already out there so what i have offer will probably not be anything new i will however not go way clich mention 1930s serials tom selleck or sword gun fight i will however ask you one question did you know that some more iconic memorable sequences raiders owe quite lot duck tales what surely its other way around well no globe trotting adventures scrooge mcduck huey duey luey donald carl banks disney comic books 50s came first if you can find some these then youll surely notice similarities hunt ark covenant is more than just excuse action so many movies these days seem come up with action first string them together with some lame plot movies like this are quickly forgotten one reasons raiders holds up so well is because it works covenant story so well into plot action comes succession set pieces i do enjoy films that have increasingly better themselves every scene raiders introduced this as standard that sequels had live up my fave scene has be massive truck chase through egypt which is made up many its own smaller sequences one little idiosyncrasy i like about indy is that even though hes college professor doctor he has no beef killing people so very far ubiquitous pc heroes todays movies you might think that its rather geeky hype up editing sound design but they do stand out recent action movies gunfire punching seem have sort indy signature sound them that ive not heard any other films obviously john williams classic score is one those themes that just everybody world knows though i prefer his score temple doom truly one best movie themes ever better than star wars im not sure if spielberg planned raiders starting indy franchise but theres already enough here establish whole universe potential stories character arcs theres talk fourth movie at moment but i personally dont think it will happen i dont want it its perfect existing as trilogy sequel that comes traipsing 18 years after last is just not going feel right even if you are hungry more indy then there are loads books video games out there then theres young indiana jones tv show where are dvds which are official indy canon even starred ford once they bounced around time i am giving raiders 9 10 because i just have soft spot temple doom which is obviously 10 10 movie even 25 years after it first came out it still has power captivate audience provoke sheer excitement every time 25 years it will still be far superior almost everything now theres something you cannot say about fast furious sigh where did all special movies go,0.47054498013402124,0.20374740556247403,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10.0,A blockbuster how it was meant to be,"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend.

If not, see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well.

8.0,Magnificent action-packed adventure film that spawned two sequels and numerous copies,"It's the first part of adventures trilogy , going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comics-Books language. The picture blends comedy,adventures action,rip roaring,cliff hunger,tongue-in-cheek and is extremely entertaining and fun . The archaeologist Indiana Jones with his bull whip-wielding and hat will confront dastard Nazis (Ronald Lacey) in Peru, Nepal and Egypt to the obtaining the Moiseh ark with the Covenant's tables . He's only helped by two feisty adventurers (Karen Allen and John Rhys Davies) . Indy fights nasty Arabs , decodes hieroglyphics and faces off hundreds of snakes . The movie attempts to go on the path from great classics during the 30-40s and the comic-books narrative along with the special characteristics of the terror cinema of 80 decade.Dr.Indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotics countries. The action highlights include the opening sequence in a Peruvian jungle temple and the creepy and spooky final, but some scenes aren't for squeamish kids . It's realized in James Bond style and high-adventure and it is driven with enormous , formidable fair-play . This breathtaking movie has a number of scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, but the action never lets up . The enjoyable screenplay was wonderfully written by George Lucas (film's producer) , Philip Kauffman and Lawrence Kasdan . In the picture there're several exotic locations , cliff-hangers, tongue-in-cheek , daring escapes , rip-roaring , derring-do , it is a very bemusing cinematic roller-coaster ride . It's a throw-back to old-fashioned Technicolor amusement with hints of serial with thousands of dollars in budget .Harrison Ford interprets masterfully the daredevil and brave archaeologist transformed into an action man . Karen Allen plays his untameable and impulsive couple who'll have a little romance with Indy . The movie has great loads of action , special effects galore and the habitual and excellent , as always , John Williams musical core . Dazzling action set-pieces are stunningly mounted by Steven Spielberg . The film has entered the lists of ten most popular of all time .

7.0,"A good film, but nothing more","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable.

,"A wonderful movie, but I still prefer The Last Crusade.","Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style ""thrill rides."" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest ""excavation,"" he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list.",wonderful movie but i still prefer last crusade,rating out there is no doubt my mind that indiana jones is best movie series history cinema one start it all was raiders lost ark fast paced adventure packed with one death defying cliff hanger situation after another this day raiders remains one best action movies holding up better than most todays rapid cut mtv style thrill rides raiders relied no cgi no flashy editing just pure exhilarating film making storytelling combo its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel indiana jones last crusade harrison ford stars as jones archaeologist who dresses brown coat fedora armed with revolver lion taming whip delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us hes used these adventures especially his even closer brushes with death temple doom which was prequel when he returns states his latest excavation hes informed by military that nazis are after ark covenant artifact that could possess power make nazis invincible army so jones sets out retrieve ark first what will prove be one his greatest adventures theres probably little doubt that raiders is fan critical favorite trilogy but there are few things that i actually have gripe about blasphemous as it may be one even though story is excellent its not without its holes most perplexing is films opening scenes when we wonder why jones bothered bring along potentially traitorous porters when its such short distance river cave temple also spoilers one needs only see film once realize that if indy had never tried intercept ark nazis would have never found it or b still would have suffered same horrible fate regardless action sequences are superb though early bar shootout isnt quite as adrenaline pumping as it could be looks quite bland compared films other action scenes thankfully following street chase is playful exciting keeps joyous momentum flowing overall id still argue that both temple doom last crusade boast more inventive action but theres no questioning that action scenes raiders are fantastic likely superior any film you may have seen last few years as bitchy as i may sound im not trying harp raiders at least not too much movie does feature famous deservedly so truck chase one most unbelievably thrilling exhilarating action setpieces ive ever seen given extra boost by john williams beautifully rousing score this day even with recent chase scenes matrix reloaded terminator 3 this sequence has yet be surpassed other standout sequences include sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes imposing statues well preserved mummies jones mano mano battle with seemingly impervious nazi mechanic finale takes film dangerously close horror genre climaxing things with truly memorable quite frightening light show ages every indiana jones film has scene that scarred me as kid i think every one whos seen raiders knows what im referring as well as its sequels ive said it before harrison ford is wonderful as jones embodying hero thats cool beyond words yet still entirely human believable supporting cast isnt as up par paul freeman makes decent but not particularly menacing villain as belloq karen allen is somewhat annoying as indys love interest but there are equal share gems particularly denholm elliot as marcus brody john rhys davies as sallah last crusade wisely gave these actors characters more screen time raiders lost ark was revolutionary cinema paving way summer blockbusters that would attempt same winning mix thrills humor only its sequels matched or surpassed it but some have actually come close mummy if you havent seen raiders yet put it top your list,0.5497222222222224,0.23270502645502644,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10.0,"To me, this will always be the best of the Indianna Jones series","For me it is not only the best of the series but one of the greatest adventure films ever made. It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well.

7.0,Conception of a Series.,"Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn't have had ""Romancing the Stone"", ""The Jewel of the Nile,"" ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire"", and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn't get far.The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, ""What do I do NOW, Ma?"" What you do is produce sequels: ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,"" and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that's in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here's the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don't waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming!

A charismatic professor of archaeology who swings his whip in remote places of the third world, overcomes all obstacles with ease of a comic-book hero, a charmer who seduces women and audiences and who has marked childhood for many generations. Technically excellent, visually impressive (except for the quite silly special effects towards the end), atmospheric, with perfectly balanced elements of adventure, action, humor, and romance.

5.0,The mother of countless silly action movies,"Since everybody knows what this movie is about, mine will be a review of the strongest and weakest points. At the time of release, this seemed a brand new approach to storytelling. I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies: the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber man the thin plot. The search for the Ark is just an excuse to create one action scene after the other. They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the movie the last ""action scene"". The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles. Anyway, it is unbelievable to imagine that Nazi troops would indulge the request of the French archaeologist the ""super hero"" nature of Indy. Despite the premise that he is a ""normal"" guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatings all the sequels. None managed to reach even half-way the level of ""Raiders"" and considering this one already had its flaws.On the plus side: there are some moments of humour, unfortunately not enough. The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market. For one precious scene like this, we have the long and pointless fight with the German guarding the plane, back to conventional narrative an attractive hero with some intellectual pretense. Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)the ironic endingConclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema.",mother countless silly action movies,since everybody knows what this movie is about mine will be review strongest weakest points at time release this seemed brand new approach storytelling i am not surprised it was big success harrison ford was smoldering hot supporting cast was great with special mention john rhys davies with passing time repeated views i find following weaknesses common many spielberg action movies overbearing soundtrack i know many love it i cannot stand it anymore during truck chase scene there is nothing but loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly while indy gets beaten but bounces back like rubber man thin plot search ark is just excuse create one action scene after other they increase violence implausibility until last one possibly silliest movie last action scene ritual proposed by belloq serves no purpose apart providing bombastic ending indys troubles anyway it is unbelievable imagine that nazi troops would indulge request french archaeologist super hero nature indy despite premise that he is normal guy indy is shown suffer only slightly inhuman beatings all sequels none managed reach even half way level raiders considering this one already had its flaws plus side there are some moments humour unfortunately not enough best is famous scene indy shooting huge menacing black clad guy market one precious scene like this we have long pointless fight with german guarding plane back conventional narrative attractive hero with some intellectual pretense indy is supposed be beauty with brain contrary way too many superheroes who are infesting silver screen even more so nowadays ironic endingconclusion what seemed innocuous narrative that looked back old serial movies past turned into monster that spawned endless sequels imitators creating action without soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema,0.4536686477364442,0.10255337882456528,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"When you're hungry, everyone believes you","There are only so many films in history that I can watch again and again, gaining new appreciation for, one of them is this film. I went from the movies to VHS, and finally to DVD. The availability and quality of this film keep raising the bar of what I can get from it.I read someone posted that this is the king of B movies or something of that sort, while I honestly think in some scenes like when Indy is running from the Hovitos and he rises over the hill, the film had a really strange documentary feeling, like if a comic actually came to life and like in the Twilight Zone, you were stuck in it. It is great to see this film, now that I edit and produce small independent films, and have worked in post production in Los Angeles. I honestly think almost every scene in this film is better than what's coming out today in sci-fi/adventure. I might pull back that comment in regards to some nice visuals in Riddick, and maybe the new Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, but I'm not certain.The amount of time and effort put into the comedy, adventure, and depth of each character dazzles me because I really can't tell it was filmed the same year Fame was. It really has a unique look to it. The key lighting in the piece is amazing, almost everything looks like it was perfectly worked out.My only complaint is the attempt to visualize the opening of the Ark, as most of the other scenes don't deal with the supernatural except maybe a burning crate with a nazi symbol on it. George should redo that last scene in my opinion, and tighten it up, because I really think it wasn't coming together, however when I was a child it was so amazing and scary realistic. It's all perspective, but my point it that now in this modern filming era, the acting and film production is holding tight to this day.I forward you to just enjoy this film and look for things like formulas on chalkboards, skeletons in classrooms, proper patches on Nazi gear, gun accuracy.

9.0,Unmissable Slam-Bang-Wallop Globetrotting Action Adventure,"In 1936, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and adventurer, is hired by the US government to find the lost Ark of the Covenant, rumoured to be buried in a hidden vault somewhere in Egypt. His quest takes him first to Nepal to recover a key artefact, and then to Cairo in a desperate race against time to find the Ark before Nazi agents also hunting it.For me, this is simply the best action film ever made. This film just roars along at an incredible speed, and it has everything in it - secret temples, tarantulas, Injuns, bar brawls, romance, Egyptology, Nazis, pompous Frenchmen, street fights, monkeys, buried treasure, snakes, car chases, pirates, submarines, the wrath of God and government coverups. I mean, what more could anybody honestly want ? The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, from an original (well, sort-of) idea by George Lucas, is just terrific but it's the sheer frenetic pace of the film that just sweeps you along - the story never stops for anything. It's a textbook model of how to cut all the flab out of a movie until there's just the good stuff left. The genius of the film is of course the genius of the great Steven Spielberg, with his unique combination of absolute technical mastery of the medium and his amazing capacity to entertain, but the sheer talent of the people behind him are what make this arguably his best film. John Williams' score is perhaps his best, with the most memorable of any of his great themes and entire sequences (the map room, the truck chase, the final ceremony) just awash in marvellously atmospheric music. The stuntwork (Glenn Randall, Peter Diamond, Terry Leonard, Vic Armstrong) is the best I've seen in any movie, and Deborah Nadoolman's wonderful costumes, Ben Burtt's sound effects and the special effects by Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson and Chris Walas are simply fabulous. You can't have a great movie without great performances, and the entire cast bring such a sense of fun and enthusiasm to their characters that they are impossible to resist. This is Ford's classic hero performance - he fits into Indiana Jones seamlessly and somehow manages to be lovable, heroic, scruffy and noble all at the same time. Allen punches and kicks her way through the film with terrific aplomb and still manages to also be a classical romantic heroine. Freeman, Davies and Elliott all devour their roles with gusto and Lacey is indisputably the best, and I mean the best, Sinister Nazi ever to grace the screen. Despite what any critics might say, movies always have and always will be about one main thing - telling a story in pictures. This movie is a deliriously brilliant piece of visual storytelling with an unbeatable capacity to entertain.

5.0,Overrated,"With all due respect for the fans of this movie or any other Indiana Jones movie, but this wasn't what I expected. I found this to be a rather weak adventure film (and I like adventure films) and I personally don't consider this a classic.The reason why this film didn't live up to my expectations is because I was hoping this to be a movie with great adventures and lots of fun, amusement and classic humor - you know, something like ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"". Instead, this is much more an action film with too much tedious moments, too much action, too much characters and many annoying ones, too much military patrols and many violence. The soundtrack is cool but there is much better, none of the actors amaze and the story itself isn't all that appealing. There are some good action scenes, but other than that it's not much of a movie.",overrated,with all due respect fans this movie or any other indiana jones movie but this wasnt what i expected i found this be rather weak adventure film i like adventure films i personally dont consider this classic reason why this film didnt live up my expectations is because i was hoping this be movie with great adventures lots fun amusement classic humor you know something like romancing stone jewel nile instead this is much more action film with too much tedious moments too much action too much characters many annoying ones too much military patrols many violence soundtrack is cool but there is much better none actors amaze story itself isnt all that appealing there are some good action scenes but other than that its not much movie,0.41089743589743577,0.12575757575757576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
4.0,Warning: Eye Rolling May Cause Dizziness,"It starts with a scene that would have us believe that an ancient civilization implemented a high-tech security system to safeguard an idol. Yes, the movie is exciting but the action is so utterly ridiculous that it makes James Bond films and ""The Road Runner"" cartoons look realistic. While it's understandable that one has to suspend disbelief when watching a film, the level of stupidity suggests that Spielberg has no respect for the viewer's intelligence. Scenes such as Jones's stunt under the moving vehicle and the revelation of the contents of the ark are sure to have any adult viewer rolling his eyes so often that there's danger of collapsing from dizziness.",warning eye rolling may cause dizziness,it starts with scene that would have us believe that ancient civilization implemented high tech security system safeguard idol yes movie is exciting but action is so utterly ridiculous that it makes james bond films road runner cartoons look realistic while its understandable that one has suspend disbelief when watching film level stupidity suggests that spielberg has no respect viewers intelligence scenes such as joness stunt under moving vehicle revelation contents ark are sure have any adult viewer rolling his eyes so often that theres danger collapsing dizziness,0.6069135802469137,0.0437037037037037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.65}"
