10.0,A mirror to good cinema...,"Simple movies are the hardest to make in India. Being a traditionally colorful culture that subdues to the varying degrees of pomp and glitz, it is rare that something so simple yet powerful comes across.'Dor' comes from the able hands of my personal favorite Nagesh Kukunoor. The man who revolutionized the so called 'parallel cinema' by giving it a relatable look with the classic- 'Hyderabad Blues'. With time his understanding of the cinematic life cycle has only matured and this is quite evident in his recent works.I was on the flight from Frankfurt to Bangalore when I happened to see his brush with India's real religion  Cricket. 'Iqbal' brought to light more than just a story. It brought to me glimpses of an India we all can relate with. An ounce of style with the right amount of emotion made me appreciate this creative genius flying on an unknown land that evening. It was then I realized Nagesh was more than just a movie maker. He was indeed a 'mirror maker' who showed us visions of various parts of our own society. Parts we rarely get to see. Parts that are easily forgotten in the razzmatazz of everything else that surrounds us.At the risk of trying to avoid this write up from becoming another review, I am attempting to capture the mood of the feature rather than the semantics of it. 'Dor' goes across the nation towards the Northern part of the country. Two stories running parallel to each other but united by one tragic cause. We have a story of a couple from the foothills of a valley in Himachal Pradesh. We have another story of another couple from the dune hills of Rajasthan. People from two completely varying faiths and cultural limitations find each other in the face of a tragedy. Simple people with not so simple challenges. People like you and me.But then 'Dor' is so much more than just that. It is about the ignored woman section in India. It is about their eternal struggle in a male-dominant world. It is about the anguish a young widow faces in her close minded and medieval society. It is about a friendship that is born out of grief and put to test. A test that can easily make or break it. It is about mending broken hearts and ailing relationships. It is about hope that is so easily lost in the chaotic lives we are part of.'Dor' is about the delicate threads that bind us as human beings.Indians have always been fed on a rich diet of fiction and endless melodrama. To escape from reality is the easy way out but to own up to it and reflect takes a bigger individual. 'Dor' attempts at encouraging us starry-eyed scapegoats to pause and look into the mirror we live in.As I said, simple yet powerful representations like 'Dor' are easy to ignore. But it only adds up to the injustice such genuine pieces of work meet with. I sincerely hope this is not the case with 'Dor'. Do yourself a favor and be a part of this qualitative journey for once.As for me, I have found my mirror and I acknowledge what I see. I hope you can do the same.",mirror good cinema,simple movies are hardest make india being traditionally colorful culture that subdues varying degrees pomp glitz it is rare that something so simple yet powerful comes across dor comes able hands my personal favorite nagesh kukunoor man who revolutionized so called parallel cinema by giving it relatable look with classic hyderabad blues with time his understanding cinematic life cycle has only matured this is quite evident his recent works i was flight frankfurt bangalore when i happened see his brush with indias real religion cricket iqbal brought light more than just story it brought me glimpses india we all can relate with ounce style with right amount emotion made me appreciate this creative genius flying unknown land that evening it was then i realized nagesh was more than just movie maker he was indeed mirror maker who showed us visions various parts our own society parts we rarely get see parts that are easily forgotten razzmatazz everything else that surrounds us at risk trying avoid this write up becoming another review i am attempting capture mood feature rather than semantics it dor goes across nation towards northern part country two stories running parallel each other but united by one tragic cause we have story couple foothills valley himachal pradesh we have another story another couple dune hills rajasthan people two completely varying faiths cultural limitations find each other face tragedy simple people with not so simple challenges people like you me but then dor is so much more than just that it is about ignored woman section india it is about their eternal struggle male dominant world it is about anguish young widow faces her close minded medieval society it is about friendship that is born out grief put test test that can easily make or break it it is about mending broken hearts ailing relationships it is about hope that is so easily lost chaotic lives we are part dor is about delicate threads that bind us as human beings indians have always been fed rich diet fiction endless melodrama escape reality is easy way out but own up it reflect takes bigger individual dor attempts at encouraging us starry eyed scapegoats pause look into mirror we live as i said simple yet powerful representations like dor are easy ignore but it only adds up injustice such genuine pieces work meet with i sincerely hope this is not case with dor do yourself favor be part this qualitative journey once as me i have found my mirror i acknowledge what i see i hope you can do same,0.5304059328649492,0.14762969271165993,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,The ties that bind...,"I was finally able to get my hands on what was being hyped as possibly the best film of 2006. When there is so much hype I immediately become a skeptic - on the lookout for any flaws. So I watched this film in no complacent frame of mind - no way was I simply gonna like it because others did. Three hours later, here I am compelled to write a few lines about this film.The story is simplistic - Zeenat (Gul Panag) and Aamir (Rushad Rana) marry in remote Himachal Pradesh against his parents wishes and then he goes off to Dubai. In the meantime, far away in Rajasthan, Meera (Ayesha Takia) and Shankar (Anirudh Jayakar) are married and he is getting ready to go off to Dubai. The thread is being spun.. Meera and Zeenat go through many months of separation from their spouses, living for the monthly phone call, the letters. Then one day the unthinkable happens - Meera is told Shankar is dead, Zeenat told that her husband stands accused of the murder and must die unless the widow of the deceased signs a form saying she forgives him. Zeenat does not know who the wife is but is of indomitable will and sets off on a long journey to find her and convince her to sign the piece of paper. The thread is now being pulled together.. With the help of a Behroopiya (Shreyas Talpade) Zeenat eventually finds Meera, and slowly begins to get close to her. The thread is now being woven into a fabric of friendship.. Eventually Meera finds out that Zeenat was using the friendship to get her to sign that piece of paper and rejects the friendship. The fabric is now about to be rent apart... Meera's life is in turmoil as her husband;s family feels acute need for the money he would send home each month. Will Meera realize exactly what gift Zeenat has bestowed on her? Will Zeenat be able to save her wrongly accused husband? The movie has no clichés, no pat answers, no hackneyed situations, and in the end we are left with an overwhelming sense of the triumph of humanity.Nagesh Kukunoor wrote and directed a masterpiece in Dor. The film never drags, never leaves you incredulous, and is sometimes saddening, but in the end extremely heartwarming. It is extremely feminist in its views, but not in a shrill way - it never preaches, just points the way. The characters of Zeenat and Meera are drawn in a masterly way, you feel for both, understand both, sympathize with both, want to be like both - yet they are as different as chalk and cheese. The performances are outstanding - I am hard-pressed to pick favorites between Gul and Ayesha. Where Ayesha charms with her childlike simplicity, her quiet fortitude, and her occasional bouts of mischief, Gul sneaks into your heart with her strong but gentle nature, her quite strength of will, her single-minded belief that her husband cannot be a killer. Shreyas Talpade is charming as the thief/mime/mimic/man of many talents! He takes on every filmi hero known to us, changes costumes at the drop of a hat and is charming, cunning and vulnerable.Outstanding moments in the film include Ayesha's finding out her husband is dead, Gul's telling Ayesha who she is and why she is really there, the grandmother telling the mother that one day she too will be on this side of the door, Ayesha's dancing to You are My Sonia in widows's garb, the dance in the desert, too many others to name. The music is excellent, the songs filled my heart and pleased my mind. I am drunk on the feel of this film.This is a keeper and the film to watch when you are feeling blue. It will take away your sorrows and make you believe in the joy of being human.",ties that bind,i was finally able get my hands what was being hyped as possibly best film 2006 when there is so much hype i immediately become skeptic lookout any flaws so i watched this film no complacent frame mind no way was i simply gonna like it because others did three hours later here i am compelled write few lines about this film story is simplistic zeenat gul panag aamir rushad rana marry remote himachal pradesh against his parents wishes then he goes off dubai meantime far away rajasthan meera ayesha takia shankar anirudh jayakar are married he is getting ready go off dubai thread is being spun meera zeenat go through many months separation their spouses living monthly phone call letters then one day unthinkable happens meera is told shankar is dead zeenat told that her husband stands accused murder must die unless widow deceased signs form saying she forgives him zeenat does not know who wife is but is indomitable will sets off long journey find her convince her sign piece paper thread is now being pulled together with help behroopiya shreyas talpade zeenat eventually finds meera slowly begins get close her thread is now being woven into fabric friendship eventually meera finds out that zeenat was using friendship get her sign that piece paper rejects friendship fabric is now about be rent apart meeras life is turmoil as her husband s family feels acute need money he would send home each month will meera realize exactly what gift zeenat has bestowed her will zeenat be able save her wrongly accused husband movie has no clich s no pat answers no hackneyed situations end we are left with overwhelming sense triumph humanity nagesh kukunoor wrote directed masterpiece dor film never drags never leaves you incredulous is sometimes saddening but end extremely heartwarming it is extremely feminist its views but not shrill way it never preaches just points way characters zeenat meera are drawn masterly way you feel both understand both sympathize with both want be like both yet they are as different as chalk cheese performances are outstanding i am hard pressed pick favorites between gul ayesha where ayesha charms with her childlike simplicity her quiet fortitude her occasional bouts mischief gul sneaks into your heart with her strong but gentle nature her quite strength will her single minded belief that her husband cannot be killer shreyas talpade is charming as thief mime mimic man many talents he takes every filmi hero known us changes costumes at drop hat is charming cunning vulnerable outstanding moments film include ayeshas finding out her husband is dead guls telling ayesha who she is why she is really there grandmother telling mother that one day she too will be this side door ayeshas dancing you are my sonia widowss garb dance desert too many others name music is excellent songs filled my heart pleased my mind i am drunk feel this film this is keeper film watch when you are feeling blue it will take away your sorrows make you believe joy being human,0.5580952380952381,0.1604047619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,A sublime and powerful story,"Nagesh Kukunoor narrates a sublime and powerful tale of two women, intertwined by destiny. It is a story of quest- quest of love and the extent to which the protagonist is prepared to go for it. It is a subtle documentary on women subjugation and emancipation- a story of sisterhood. It is a narration of humanity and human relationships. The story moves us, it stirs us. None of the earlier works of Kukunoor prepares us for this marvelous fête of aesthetics and emotions.It provides a landscape hidden to the eyes of the modern India. It paints a picture of an all together different world. The canvas is unfamiliar, but the characters are so easy to relate to- so easy to empathize with. Their pain is our pain; their jubilations are ours. We laugh for them and cry for them at the same time. They become for once us, and we become them.The depiction of fiercely independent woman, Zeenat, by Gul Panag is by far her best performance on the celluloid. She essays a very powerful character which would go to any extreme to save her love- her background, religion, and limited resources not withstanding. She inspires respect for the character in the hearts of the audience. She tells us of the revolution which is silently happening in the hinterlands of India, where women are slowly but surely coming out of their traditional roles and becoming more empowered. She conveys this is a subtle way through her convincing and yet underplayed performance.Meera is played by Ayesha Takia. And what a performance this is. Those who have seen Takia in her earlier roles would never be able to guess the sheer genius this actor is. One is forced to wonder what took her so long to express her real acting talent. Watch out especially for the scene where Meera's husband's battered suitcase is delivered in the veranda and she approaches it. Very few actors have been able to achieve the brilliance in their delivery to the extent she does in this scene.Through his characterization of funny ""behrupiya"" Shreyas Talpade introduces an element of spontaneous fun with out disturbing the underlying emotional depth of the movie. He goes one step further from his earlier performance in Iqbal- show-casing a previously huge untapped talent. His appearance in the movie adds an extra zing to this tale of sisterhood.Screenplay has done justice to all the characters. Secondary characters are also very well formed. Cinematography is awe-inspiring. The parched landscape of Rajasthan adds a kind of mysticism to the story. The juxtaposition of the story against this landscape adds an extra element of poignancy. Background music adds to the story without becoming overbearing. Technical departments have done a marvelous job. It shows in the movie that a lot of love and thought has gone into making of this movie.All in all this is the best movie that has come out of Bollywood in a long time. It is a definite 9 out of 10. (I hesitate to give it 10 out of 10 because of the character played by Kukunoor himself in the movie that creates disharmony in the storyline.)",sublime powerful story,nagesh kukunoor narrates sublime powerful tale two women intertwined by destiny it is story quest quest love extent which protagonist is prepared go it it is subtle documentary women subjugation emancipation story sisterhood it is narration humanity human relationships story moves us it stirs us none earlier works kukunoor prepares us this marvelous f te aesthetics emotions it provides landscape hidden eyes modern india it paints picture all together different world canvas is unfamiliar but characters are so easy relate so easy empathize with their pain is our pain their jubilations are ours we laugh them cry them at same time they become once us we become them depiction fiercely independent woman zeenat by gul panag is by far her best performance celluloid she essays very powerful character which would go any extreme save her love her background religion limited resources not withstanding she inspires respect character hearts audience she tells us revolution which is silently happening hinterlands india where women are slowly but surely coming out their traditional roles becoming more empowered she conveys this is subtle way through her convincing yet underplayed performance meera is played by ayesha takia what performance this is those who have seen takia her earlier roles would never be able guess sheer genius this actor is one is forced wonder what took her so long express her real acting talent watch out especially scene where meeras husbands battered suitcase is delivered veranda she approaches it very few actors have been able achieve brilliance their delivery extent she does this scene through his characterization funny behrupiya shreyas talpade introduces element spontaneous fun with out disturbing underlying emotional depth movie he goes one step further his earlier performance iqbal show casing previously huge untapped talent his appearance movie adds extra zing this tale sisterhood screenplay has done justice all characters secondary characters are also very well formed cinematography is awe inspiring parched landscape rajasthan adds kind mysticism story juxtaposition story against this landscape adds extra element poignancy background music adds story without becoming overbearing technical departments have done marvelous job it shows movie that lot love thought has gone into making this movie all all this is best movie that has come out bollywood long time it is definite 9 out 10 i hesitate give it 10 out 10 because character played by kukunoor himself movie that creates disharmony storyline,0.5518624338624338,0.19028174603174602,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Lage Raho Nagesh Bhai,Movie depicts the Dor of life. Its unusual from a maker like Nagesh to produce such an emotional flick but he was brilliant in it. Specially the role of Gul Panag was splendid.This role must have been made for some one like Smita Patil or Shabana Azmi and Gul did real justice with it. This story revolves around the pain and agony a young widow whose husband is accidentally (Not quite sure) killed by his roommate who happens to be husband of the liberated woman Gul. The movie circles around her journey to find the woman who can get her husband free. Shreyas played an excellent role in this movie and surely second best role wise. Ayesha also played a good role along with Nagesh and Girish Karnad. All in all this is a movie worth watching. A 9/10 from my side.-Vaibhav,lage raho nagesh bhai,movie depicts dor life its unusual maker like nagesh produce such emotional flick but he was brilliant it specially role gul panag was splendid this role must have been made some one like smita patil or shabana azmi gul did real justice with it this story revolves around pain agony young widow whose husband is accidentally not quite sure killed by his roommate who happens be husband liberated woman gul movie circles around her journey find woman who can get her husband free shreyas played excellent role this movie surely second best role wise ayesha also played good role along with nagesh girish karnad all all this is movie worth watching 9 10 my side vaibhav,0.5888422035480859,0.4112044817927171,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Far away where a new life begins...,"Nagesh Kukunoor's Dor is perhaps the best film of 2006. It is a moving, inspiring and very involving piece. Sadly, such films, despite being generally well appreciated, get little notice amongst the majority of cine-goers and fail to do well commercially. I can't get it, because this one like many others has what it takes to be famous and widely popular. This is the story of two women: Zeenat and Meera. They are very different but they share the same experience. Zeenat is an independent, strong-minded and worldly Muslim woman. Meera is a traditional and highly disciplined girl whose life outlook is fairly old-fashioned and innocent. Both women have lost their husbands, only that while Meera's husband is no more, having reportedly been killed by accident, Zeenat still has a chance to get him back. That's where we get the film's main conflict: Zeenat's husband is the one held responsible for Meera's husband's death. He is now awaiting his death penalty in Saudi Arabia (where both he and Meera's husband had been employed). As fate would have it, Meera is the only one who can save his life, as in accordance with Saudi law, if the widow of a deceased man signs a form of forgiveness, the murderer can be released from punishment. Convinced of her husband's innocence and determined to save him, Zeenat sets on a journey to Rajasthan to find Meera and plead for help. Their acquaintance and ensuing friendship is what brings the film's best moments, all that while Meera is still unaware of Zeenat's true identity and the purpose of her visit. Both women find solace in each other, particularly Meera, who, inspired by Zeenat's attitude, discovers her inner strength and starts looking at life in a whole new way. Dor is such a riveting movie experience. Movies of this sort, which are often labelled 'arty films', are generally known for their slow pace, but here there isn't a single dull moment. It is excellent in writing, direction and acting, and is consistently engaging. The script is stupendous and is effectively developed. Everything is kept simple and genuine, devoid of any possible redundancies or clichés. The movie is shot across breathtaking locales, and their exotic and cryptic beauty is perfectly captured by Kukunoor, who is of course aided by Sudeep Chatterjee's cinematography. The musical duo Salim-Sulaiman compose a winning soundtrack which efficiently fits the film's mood and cultural background and enhances the narrative. The film's instrumental theme song in particular is a true pleasure. The characters of Zeenat and Meera are excellently played by Gul Panag and Ayesha Takia, respectively. As Zeenat, Panag is thoroughly convincing in a strong yet subtle performance that is perhaps her best. Ayesha Takia is even more impressive in a performance that just keeps growing on you with every new scene right until the end. She looks cuter than ever and her raw simplicity is incredibly charming, while she brilliantly captures Meera's innocence, vulnerability, repression, and ultimately her inner growth and coming-of-age. The two ladies are supported by several actors who play their roles with utmost conviction, including Shreyas Talpade and Uttara Baokar. As opposed to what many others seem to think, I did not find Dor to be feminist or something of this sort. I see it as a culturally rich, fascinating and inspiring picture about humanity and friendship against the most impossible circumstances.",far away where new life begins,nagesh kukunoors dor is perhaps best film 2006 it is moving inspiring very involving piece sadly such films despite being generally well appreciated get little notice amongst majority cine goers fail do well commercially i cant get it because this one like many others has what it takes be famous widely popular this is story two women zeenat meera they are very different but they share same experience zeenat is independent strong minded worldly muslim woman meera is traditional highly disciplined girl whose life outlook is fairly old fashioned innocent both women have lost their husbands only that while meeras husband is no more having reportedly been killed by accident zeenat still has chance get him back thats where we get films main conflict zeenats husband is one held responsible meeras husbands death he is now awaiting his death penalty saudi arabia where both he meeras husband had been employed as fate would have it meera is only one who can save his life as accordance with saudi law if widow deceased man signs form forgiveness murderer can be released punishment convinced her husbands innocence determined save him zeenat sets journey rajasthan find meera plead help their acquaintance ensuing friendship is what brings films best moments all that while meera is still unaware zeenats true identity purpose her visit both women find solace each other particularly meera who inspired by zeenats attitude discovers her inner strength starts looking at life whole new way dor is such riveting movie experience movies this sort which are often labelled arty films are generally known their slow pace but here there isnt single dull moment it is excellent writing direction acting is consistently engaging script is stupendous is effectively developed everything is kept simple genuine devoid any possible redundancies or clich s movie is shot across breathtaking locales their exotic cryptic beauty is perfectly captured by kukunoor who is course aided by sudeep chatterjees cinematography musical duo salim sulaiman compose winning soundtrack which efficiently fits films mood cultural background enhances narrative films instrumental theme song particular is true pleasure characters zeenat meera are excellently played by gul panag ayesha takia respectively as zeenat panag is thoroughly convincing strong yet subtle performance that is perhaps her best ayesha takia is even more impressive performance that just keeps growing you with every new scene right until end she looks cuter than ever her raw simplicity is incredibly charming while she brilliantly captures meeras innocence vulnerability repression ultimately her inner growth coming age two ladies are supported by several actors who play their roles with utmost conviction including shreyas talpade uttara baokar as opposed what many others seem think i did not find dor be feminist or something this sort i see it as culturally rich fascinating inspiring picture about humanity friendship against most impossible circumstances,0.5460162676829342,0.2350630542297209,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Awesome,"One of the better movies of recent times.. you hardly get to see a more realistic reflection of the life in rural India. Kudos to cinematography to create such a holistic picture of Rajasthan... and what a breath taking view of the Opening Act.Nagesh Kukunoor has definitely done his homework before making this film. It touches so many real issues faced by India.. the fiercely independent Zeenat, the overtly coy Mira, the odd jobs a beherupiya has to do, the dependency a family has on a son who's abroad, the young girl who was dumped at birth, the state of mind of the elderly, the list is endless...Every actor of the film deserves kudos for giving justice to his / her role. Ayesha Takia needs to do some such similar role to repeat the phenomenon; a different take from what she has done so far... She is refreshingly different.

8.0,The loyalty of a wife to her husband triumphs over adversity.,"I very much enjoyed this movie and thought performances by both females leads were good. I especially liked Zeenat's (Gul Panag) courage, quiet dignity and fortitude in the face of an overwhelming and frightening situation for a young bride. I am of the opinion that she acted better than Ms. Takia, but both were very good. Mr. Talpade is also excellent as the comic foil and does a admirable job of plaing the jester. He is a con man with a heart of gold and proves this in his dedication to the cause at hand. I enjoyed his performance in Iqbal and here as well. It is really worth seeing this movie - the scenery is also breathtaking especially the scenes of Himachal Pradesh!

8.0,Dor-A refreshingly different film,"Before I set about describing the plot, it should be mentioned that an honest and sincere attempt at anything will always elicit applause and appreciation. By no means is this film a masterpiece; however you can easily see the attempt that it makes in being one and purely for this reason it deserves a viewing and when you do give it an audience, it will give you many more reasons to watch it again.The story is about two women who happen to be connected by a strange quirk of fate. Zeenat (Gul Panag) and Mira (Ayesha Takia) live in breathtaking geographies of their respective states. Zeenat in Himachal Pradesh has her home nestled in the lush green hills overlooking the undulating river as she cuts lovingly through the hills. Mira on the other hand lives in the barren state of Rajasthan which glows with its harsh painful beauty, ""havelis"" proclaiming the patriarchal society. Both these women have just begun their married life in absolute love with their spouses, however for economic reasons their better halves have to go to the gulf. In the far off land, Mira's husband is killed and Zeenat's husband (Amir) is held responsible for his death. The harsh law of the state doesn't allow him to be expedited and believes in an eye for an eye, so Amir will have to part with his life unless Mira decides to pardon him. Thus begins Zeenats journey to track down Mira armed with nothing but a photograph and her strong will power to save her loved one at any cost. She meets Shreyas Talpade on the way who is ""masquerade"" or a ""bahurupiya"". Shreyas helps shorten her search through ingenious ways and using his masquerading talent. Beyond this it is best watched on the large screen.The film has one of the best background soundtracks, haunting and apt with the look and feel of the film. The cinematography is amazing, the way the camera captures the beauty of both lands is awesome. Memorable scenes are the Himachal hills with the river and the blue houses of Bikaner among many great scenes. There is a tendency to start most scenes with a non descript object in focus and then shifting the gaze to the characters but before it becomes too noticeable, it is rectified. The acting is outstanding. Gul Panag is very convincing as the strong willed woman, however the anguish and the pain of knowing that she could loose her loved one is not depicted well. Ayesha Takia does a great job of a nubile young widow who has to confine herself to the life of a prisoner just because she has lost a husband. Her accent is not very convincing. Shreyas Talpade is the pick among all. His mimicry talent is beautifully showcased here and his accent is flawless. He leaves you with quite a few memorable scenes, especially the one in which he declares his affection for Zeenat. Nagesh brings out certain subtleties which declare his talent for serious cinema. How ever certain elements stop this film from being a great work. The character of Mira could have been made stronger if the decision making for her would have been complicated by lessening the complications in her life, this would have brought out her character in full. The pace of the film might not find favour with the majority of the audience. The climax of the film leaves a lot to be desired. In spite of all its shortcomings, Dor should not be missed. It is very rare that such serious cinema is attempted in commercial domain which seems to be obsessed with celebrating philandering on the streets of New York and forcefully pushing the media to discuss the same on prime time. The film doesn't for once become larger than life and sticks to the portrayal of human behaviour and relationships through trying times and decision making.

7.0,"A plain story which is spiced up with a good screenplay, cinematography, dialogues and Kukunoor's sensitivity as a filmmaker...","Film: DorCast: Gul Panag, Ayesha Takia, Shreyas Talpade, Nagesh Kukunoor, Girish KanadDirector: Nagesh Kukunoor.Zeenat and Mira are women from two different worlds. Be it geography, culture, religion attitude, lifestyle or their names. In other words, its either black or white, the difference is tremendously visible. In spite of all these differences, there is a connection ""a dor"" and Nagesh Kukknoor has effectively trailed on it.Mira played by Ayesha Takia, hails from Rajasthan. The mystic and forlorn beauty of the desert coupled with the orthodox ideas and views, reflects Mira's life, whereas, confidence and vigor is synonymous with Zeenat (played by Gul), the girl from lush and green Himachal.Their husbands went out to the foreign shores to make things better at their respective places. The emotions of a newly wedded woman and her pain when he leaves out for work, the once in a month phone call by her husband which would last for a few minutes only, the desires , the love and longing in case of Mira is well portrayed. And the way she would climb up a stone to get clarity or network of the call is very apt in village as in Jodhpur.While in case of Zeenat, she had to change the mind set of her in-laws about her. A very strong and determined lady. She takes everything to her stride.The story takes a turn when Mira's husband gets killed and Zeenat's husband is held responsible for it. They used to be roommates. The only way Zeenat's husband could get out of the situation is Mira's letter of consent saying she has forgiven him.So the journey begins for Zeenat. With nothing, but a photograph of her husband with Shankar ( Mira's husband), she begins the quest. The song, ""ye honsla"" is very fitting. On the way she meets up with a ""Behrupiya"", played by Shreyas Talpade. This character brings life to the entire story. He has done complete justice to the character. Very lively, the audience keeps asking for more.The way they track the Shankar family and how Zeenat becomes Mira's best friend and helps her to shed her inhibitions is very interesting. ""Imaan ki Udaan"", as Zeenat puts it.The best part of Kuknoor' film is his ability of not ignoring human emotions. The way the Behrupiya helped Zeenat and he eventually falling in love with her even after knowing that she is married is one example of it.All throughout their friendship, she never gets the courage to confront Mira the fact for which she takes up the journey. The final outbreak of the film is a typical Kukunoor touch which he specializes!!!!!In terms of performances, there is nothing great. Credit goes to the strength of the characters in the story itself and there is one scene where Kuknoor looks at Mira and the very look is so suggestive of his intentions. Kudus to the scene!!!

,A drowning man will catch at a straw,"A very different body of work from Kukunoor's factory probably because its inspired from a Malayalam movie. Nevertheless, an outstanding piece which places Kukunoor's on a very different league (age and maturity, probably?).The grey shades of every character are depicted convincingly. Be it Girish Karnad who wants to save his palace, Nagesh Kukunoor as the opportunist building contractor or Prateeksha Lonkar as the jealous woman. Having said that the main protagonist Gul Panag is no exception either. Nevertheless, all of them put up a spectacular feat. The deglam roles of both heroines will be remembered for a long time to come. Finally Shreyas Talpade get a role which showcases his ammunition in terms of acting. Its good to see Uttara Baokar after a long sabbatical.The palaces, grandeur and beauty of Rajasthan is captured aesthetically. The costumes, language and the background score compliment to the authentic feeling.

9.0,Amazing movie.,"Dor takes off with a shy young Meera(Ayesha Takia) in Rajasthan biding goodbye to her husband, Shankar, who is going overseas to work in parallel to the recently married,fiercely independent Zeenat(Gul Panag) parting from her husband -Aamir, who live in Himachal Pradesh, who's also going overseas for work. Life continues for them both. One day Meera finds out her husband has died. And by this not only does Meera lose her respect, but also her independence and love. At the same time, Zeenat gets a call that Aamir has been accused of murdering his roommate in UAE. And he is to be executed in 2 months. The only way to save Aamir is to get the deceased's wife's signature on an apology letter(mafinama). Zeenat then sets out to find Shankar's widow in Rajasthan only with a picture of Shankar. She arrives in Rajasthan and meets a Behrupiya(Shreyas Talpade) who after an initial spat decides to help Zeenat. When Zeenat finds Shankar's house, she talks to Shankars parents who throw her out. She still believes that once she talks to Meera, she'll be able to get her to sign the document. Finally she meets Meera at the local temple. But Zeenat is unable to tell Meera the real reason why she's there. They soon becomes thick friends, and Zeenat helps Meera to become more independent in her thoughts. She teaches Meera that it isn't wrong to feel happy. Will Zeenat be able to tell Meera her real problem? Will Meera agree to sign it? I believe the casting has been done amazingly. Both the girls fit in their roles with ease. Shreyas is amazing as the comical behroopiya. Its not the greatest entertainer, but its a simple drama.

9.0,The dor of life and death - truly entwined,"Dor is a true tribute paid by film maker Nagesh Kukunoor to the resilience and inner strength of women irrespective of their background. Story tells the rather poignant tale of commonplace people and their rather hide and seek with destiny. While lives of people who have infinite degrees of separation suddenly get intertwined, there is bound to be endless possibilities of change of course of events in the lives of the people concerned. Zeenat (played with enormous amount of maturity and grace by Gul Panag) heads on a mission impossible to find Meera (Ayesha Takia) who has been widowed when her husband dies of an accident in Saudi Arabia. However the dor or the link is that Zeenat's husband Amir was his roommate and had a hand in his death while it not being intentional. In Saudi, Amir has been sentenced to death and only the wife of the deceased by providing a pardon to the accused can allow amir to walk free. Zeeant comes to Rajasthan where in an oppressive haveli, meera has begun the live of a condemnation.Enroute Zeenat finds an unlikely good Samaritan in a trickster come mimic played once again adorably by Shreyas Talpade with consummate ease. He guides her to Jodhpur where they zero in on the haveli where meera resides.A beautiful friendship starts to build between the women who met at a desolate temple every evening. The moment of truth is however around the corner and cannot be escaped. With this haunting dilemma facing zeenat, we head into the last half hour of the movie simply feeling for these lives. That i feel is where Nagesh has also got the viewer into the dor. Kudos to Nagesh and some truly sincere performances by Ayesha Takia, Gul Panag (she deserves better projects) and Shreyas Talpade. Support roles are equally well cast. Akin to the movie paheli, rajasthan in the hands of a skilled cinematographer becomes a land of magical colours and breathes life as a canvass.

9.0,An interesting feminist film from India.,"This is yet another Indian film released by the infamous Eros Video. I say infamous because on the DVD, Eros forces the viewer to watch a long series of advertisements and promos--many of which you cannot fast-forward or skip through. And, to make it even worse, AFTER you push the play button on the menu, you are forced to watch even MORE ads!!! Additionally, there is a giant EROS pasted on every frame of the film!! It's enough to make me stop watching Bollywood films or at least try to find DVD from another distributor. These people are really, really getting on my nerves!""Dor"" is an unusual film in that it's only about two hours long--very short for an Indian picture. While it has a couple musical interludes, it does not have the usual massive production numbers--mostly because it's a 'smaller' sort of movie. And, it's unusual in that it has a strong feminist message--one that calls into question the traditional roles of Indian women.The film begins with two couples from completely different parts of India. Both marry at the same time and both husbands almost immediately set out for Saudi Arabia to work for several months to make their fortunes. Shankar's family is Hindu, Amir's is Muslim. While the families don't know each other, the two men end up becoming roommates and friends. You never see any of Amir's or Shankar's life in Arabia--the film is DEFINITELY much more focused on their wives. Soon, Zeenat learns that her husband, Amir, is now in prison--waiting execution for killing his friend!! Interestingly, you never really learn more about the incident--you just know that Zeenat is convinced it was an accident, as murder is not in her husband's character. In a last ditch effort to save him, she travels across India to Rajastán. Why? Well, because according to Sharia Law (Muslim law code in countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia), a condemned man MAY be pardoned IF the victim's family agrees to the pardon. So, Zeenat goes all alone and with little money to a big city with only a photograph to guide her to the victim's wife, Meera. Along the way, she meets up with a strange and colorful thief who inexplicably becomes her friend...along with Meera.The film is fascinating to an outsider like me, as you see some interesting parallels between modern and traditional roles for women and widows. Zeenat, though Muslim, is very modern--independent, strong and admirable in her tenacity. It was also touching how her in-laws (who initially hated her) take to her and see her as their own. Meera, on the other hand, is more traditional. As a widow, she is expected to remain unmarried and be obedient to her in-laws--though the in-laws turn out to be incredibly selfish folks. And, because of this, even if Meera wanted to forgive Amir, they certainly would not allow this. All in all, this and the dynamics of the relationship between Zeenat and Meera make this a fascinating and feminist film. Fortunately, it's not just a feminist film but a darned entertaining saga as well--well acted, directed and highly entertaining. My only complaints are very, very minor and only came at the melodramatic ending (it wasn't bad but wasn't exactly realistic--Meera kept looking for Zeenat and never thought to call her name?! Odd to say the least).By the way, if you interested in another Indian film about widows, try watching ""Water"" by Deepa Metha. It's heartbreaking and as good as ""Dor"", but a bit darker in tone.",interesting feminist film india,this is yet another indian film released by infamous eros video i say infamous because dvd eros forces viewer watch long series advertisements promos many which you cannot fast forward or skip through make it even worse after you push play button menu you are forced watch even more ads additionally there is giant eros pasted every frame film its enough make me stop watching bollywood films or at least try find dvd another distributor these people are really really getting my nerves dor is unusual film that its only about two hours long very short indian picture while it has couple musical interludes it does not have usual massive production numbers mostly because its smaller sort movie its unusual that it has strong feminist message one that calls into question traditional roles indian women film begins with two couples completely different parts india both marry at same time both husbands almost immediately set out saudi arabia work several months make their fortunes shankars family is hindu amirs is muslim while families dont know each other two men end up becoming roommates friends you never see any amirs or shankars life arabia film is definitely much more focused their wives soon zeenat learns that her husband amir is now prison waiting execution killing his friend interestingly you never really learn more about incident you just know that zeenat is convinced it was accident as murder is not her husbands character last ditch effort save him she travels across india rajast n why well because according sharia law muslim law code countries like iran saudi arabia condemned man may be pardoned if victims family agrees pardon so zeenat goes all alone with little money big city with only photograph guide her victims wife meera along way she meets up with strange colorful thief who inexplicably becomes her friend along with meera film is fascinating outsider like me as you see some interesting parallels between modern traditional roles women widows zeenat though muslim is very modern independent strong admirable her tenacity it was also touching how her laws who initially hated her take her see her as their own meera other hand is more traditional as widow she is expected remain unmarried be obedient her laws though laws turn out be incredibly selfish folks because this even if meera wanted forgive amir they certainly would not allow this all all this dynamics relationship between zeenat meera make this fascinating feminist film fortunately its not just feminist film but darned entertaining saga as well well acted directed highly entertaining my only complaints are very very minor only came at melodramatic ending it wasnt bad but wasnt exactly realistic meera kept looking zeenat never thought call her name odd say least by way if you interested another indian film about widows try watching water by deepa metha its heartbreaking as good as dor but bit darker tone,0.5633065057008719,0.09490778001341384,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"
7.0,Nagesh Kukunoor's Woman Oriented lesson with profound and detailed filmmaking,"Dor (2006) : Brief Review -Nagesh Kukunoor's Woman Oriented lesson with profound and detailed filmmaking. There is a particular group of movie buffs who understands and notices even small small nuances and details from a scene which looks very ordinary to any other kind of audience. Dor is like that exam where those movie buffs will top the exams but rest others will even fail to realise the questions. The opening scene of Dor when you see Gul Panag and Ayesha Takia doing thier regular stuff tells a lot about profound vision of Nagesh Kukunoor but unfortunately people didn't notice it because an opening scene is always overlooked by majority of audience. Anyways, i am.not here to tell about all those detailing and whoever didn't understand it before won't even understand after my explanation so better I won't do it. Dor is a story of two women with completely different lifestyle set in different conditions coming together to teach each other something that is missing. The overall theme is linked to thier husbands but like I said profound meaning is different and the attempt to elaborate something is also different than what you think. May be that's why the film looks little low in the climax because it never suggests to have such a typical climax when the entire narrative had been a deep diver. Ayesha Takia and Gul Panag carries the heavy script and dialogues easily hence there shouldn't be any doubt about the level of of thier performance. It's top class and perhaps best of them. Shreyas Talpade brings a smile and happiness innthe heavy theme. Music and Background Score by Salim Sulaiman is soulful and heart touching. Nagesh Kukunoor, the Writer does better job than Director. The writing is sublime but few directorial mistakes cannot be overlooked especially when you have witnessed such a high quality project.

8.0,Must Watch - Powerful Story and Amazing Acting,"I watched it very recently on YouTube. It is a 2006 drama by Nagesh Kukunoor - a tale of two ladies, far away from each other, unknown to each other's existence but yet connected by a tragedy. A must watch with a powerful story and amazing acting, especially by Aayesha Takia. Story (9/10): Dor is the story of two ladies - one, Meera (Aayesha Takia) is the wife of the deceased and another, Zeenat (Gul Panaag) is the wife of the convict. While one is trying to cope with the loss of her husband, another is on a mission to do everything possible under the sun to save her husband from execution under the Saudi law. While the government is in process of exploring all the diplomatic options, there is a ray of hope for Zeenat. However, that hope can't materialize without the help from Meera - wife of the very man, for the murder of which, her husband is convicted. While Zeenat has an agony of her own, Meera is fighting another battle in rural Rajasthan where the life of a widow is pretty much the same as dead and only her body has some material value. For someone who loves dancing and music, giving up all forms of entertainment, colorful clothes and any kind of interaction with the outside world is pretty much like a life sentence. As Zeenat tries to befriend her to convince her for help she discovers Meera's struggles and motivates her to break the shackles and claim what's rightfully hers.Acting (9/10): This is perhaps Aayesha Takia's best and the only serious performance in her career after Socha Na Tha. Her portrayal of a very young widow, who isn't able to understand the restrictions but somehow makes peace with it, is brilliant. Gul Panaag is good overall but lacked impact in intense scenes where Aayesha Takia was very comfortable. Girish Karnad, playing Aayesha's father in law who is far more worried about his ""haveli"" and so-called reputation than anything else in the world is impressive. He is one of the few actors who are equally effective in both, positive and negative, characters. Shreyas Talpade, playing a Rajasthani local who helps Gul Panaag reach Aayesha Takia, is good with his dialogues, comic timing and Rajasthani accent. Overall, the movie was well supported in terms of acting. Direction (7/10): Nagesh Kukunoor was impressive. His tendency to spend time on the background of Meera's marriage (relationship with her husband in a conservative society) and portrayal of her aspirations gave a much deeper understanding of the character. Unfortunately, he didn't work that deep on Zeenat's character. The movie is a little baffling in the beginning and few times goes off track. The climax was great and justified the length. Overall (8/10): Overall, the movie is a great watch, especially for a predictable but still a very well executed story.",must watch powerful story amazing acting,i watched it very recently youtube it is 2006 drama by nagesh kukunoor tale two ladies far away each other unknown each others existence but yet connected by tragedy must watch with powerful story amazing acting especially by aayesha takia story 9 10 dor is story two ladies one meera aayesha takia is wife deceased another zeenat gul panaag is wife convict while one is trying cope with loss her husband another is mission do everything possible under sun save her husband execution under saudi law while government is process exploring all diplomatic options there is ray hope zeenat however that hope cant materialize without help meera wife very man murder which her husband is convicted while zeenat has agony her own meera is fighting another battle rural rajasthan where life widow is pretty much same as dead only her body has some material value someone who loves dancing music giving up all forms entertainment colorful clothes any kind interaction with outside world is pretty much like life sentence as zeenat tries befriend her convince her help she discovers meeras struggles motivates her break shackles claim whats rightfully hers acting 9 10 this is perhaps aayesha takias best only serious performance her career after socha na tha her portrayal very young widow who isnt able understand restrictions but somehow makes peace with it is brilliant gul panaag is good overall but lacked impact intense scenes where aayesha takia was very comfortable girish karnad playing aayeshas father law who is far more worried about his haveli so called reputation than anything else world is impressive he is one few actors who are equally effective both positive negative characters shreyas talpade playing rajasthani local who helps gul panaag reach aayesha takia is good with his dialogues comic timing rajasthani accent overall movie was well supported terms acting direction 7 10 nagesh kukunoor was impressive his tendency spend time background meeras marriage relationship with her husband conservative society portrayal her aspirations gave much deeper understanding character unfortunately he didnt work that deep zeenats character movie is little baffling beginning few times goes off track climax was great justified length overall 8 10 overall movie is great watch especially predictable but still very well executed story,0.5562642821659216,0.2029744162940884,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.34}"

1.0,Rubbish,"This is one the worst movie I've seen and certainly worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor has made. I can't believe person who has created movie like Teen Deewarein can create utter crap like this. Plot of the film itself is really faulty that Zeenat has to search Meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in Soudi Arabia. Common logic says if Zeenat cannot search Meera easily so won't the Soudi Government, so Zeenat can safely forge Meera's signature or thumb-print and produce it before the Soudis. Another silliest thing is Shankar has given incorrect address in his passport, so Indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime Meera gets Shankar's suitcase through Soudi government. Wow! Doesn't it make Soudis well networked in India more than Indians?Nagya makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of Chopra, who is eyeing Meera and seeks Meera's Father-in-law, Girish Karnaad(this guy is just wasted)'s help to get her as a keep. Nagya cannot speak Hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the English dialogs he writes, in Hindi. This time, it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication, when writing dialogs like ""Imaan ki Chalaang"" (leap of honesty). Within minutes, to our worst nightmares, Meera not only takes this honest leap, she taps her feet to do ""Imaan ka Naach"" (dance of honesty).One of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues. But since Bollywood has learned the thing called Post-production, almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops, so no big deal.Conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and all are ready to get affected.",rubbish,this is one worst movie ive seen certainly worst movie nagesh kuknoor has made i cant believe person who has created movie like teen deewarein can create utter crap like this plot film itself is really faulty that zeenat has search meera get her clemency help her husband avoid death penalty soudi arabia common logic says if zeenat cannot search meera easily so wont soudi government so zeenat can safely forge meeras signature or thumb print produce it before soudis another silliest thing is shankar has given incorrect address his passport so indian government officials cannot get address but after sometime meera gets shankars suitcase through soudi government wow doesnt it make soudis well networked india more than indians nagya makes slightly more than cameo movie with role chopra who is eyeing meera seeks meeras father law girish karnaad this guy is just wasted s help get her as keep nagya cannot speak hindi he has been assisted by other guys translates english dialogs he writes hindi this time it seems that his aide was serious intoxication when writing dialogs like imaan ki chalaang leap honesty within minutes our worst nightmares meera not only takes this honest leap she taps her feet do imaan ka naach dance honesty one only bright spot movie has is its cinematography really nice hues but since bollywood has learned thing called post production almost all movies have vibrant colors nicely blended backdrops so no big deal conclusion is that making cheesy movie is not limited chopras or johars or barjatyas nagyas all are ready get affected,0.6303996598639455,-0.004379251700680231,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,A powerful and engaging film for Indians and non-Indians - don't miss it,"I read the review of those that hated this movie and I found their criticism petty to say the least. I am not Indian and do not speak Hindi or Urdu, so I am judging the film based on the sub-titles; nonetheless to attack the film because Chopra should be pronounced Chop-da is worse than petty, it is irrelevant. The story is about love, how tradition is both good and bad, personal courage, the position of women in the sub-continent, how one's sense of honor is easily twisted to serve one's more base needs and desires, etc. Even if the accents aren't always correct, the translations from English to Hindi are sometimes weak, the oddity that the Indian government did not know the home address of the dead husband, etc., I say ""Who cares?"" One reviewer attacks the love scenes in the beginning of the film. I found them much more real and much more full of emotion and love than the typical teasing but don't touch kissing of lighter Bollywood fare, or the humping, spit swapping of Western films.This film is wonderful, reminding me a little of the great Shyam Benegal films of 35 years ago, but not quite as dark. The acting is great - those attacking Gul must have seen a different film than the one I watched; I thought both female leads were terrific and very believable. Gul may not be Meryl Streep, but she is far better in this role than 99% of the typical Bollywood ""actresses."" The two woman develop their characters so well, that I, and I would assume most all others watching the film, cheer for them and pray for a happy ending.The themes are very nicely woven into the film. The anguish of Shankar's father losing his ""mansion"" is wonderfully portrayed. While some see the falling of the rich (or powerful) as tragic, others, myself included, see it as sweet justice. The fact that he sends his newly-wed son to Saudi Arabia to earn enough money to bail out his father and thereby allow his father to get back his mansion and then lamenting more the loss of his son's income than the loss of his son is believable. Moreover, he then is willing to sell his daughter-in-law to achieve the same end, is all part of the theme that true ""honor"" has nothing to do with material things and that his sense of honor is tragically shallow.I can go on and discuss other themes, but the main themes that revolve around the two young women are very powerful and most satisfying. The development of the themes of love, independence, commitment, position of women, compassion, etc., are wonderfully addressed and make this film well worth watching. It is better than Devdas and most all the other Bollywood blockbusters.",powerful engaging film indians non indians dont miss it,i read review those that hated this movie i found their criticism petty say least i am not indian do not speak hindi or urdu so i am judging film based sub titles nonetheless attack film because chopra should be pronounced chop da is worse than petty it is irrelevant story is about love how tradition is both good bad personal courage position women sub continent how ones sense honor is easily twisted serve ones more base needs desires etc even if accents arent always correct translations english hindi are sometimes weak oddity that indian government did not know home address dead husband etc i say who cares one reviewer attacks love scenes beginning film i found them much more real much more full emotion love than typical teasing but dont touch kissing lighter bollywood fare or humping spit swapping western films this film is wonderful reminding me little great shyam benegal films 35 years ago but not quite as dark acting is great those attacking gul must have seen different film than one i watched i thought both female leads were terrific very believable gul may not be meryl streep but she is far better this role than 99 typical bollywood actresses two woman develop their characters so well that i i would assume most all others watching film cheer them pray happy ending themes are very nicely woven into film anguish shankars father losing his mansion is wonderfully portrayed while some see falling rich or powerful as tragic others myself included see it as sweet justice fact that he sends his newly wed son saudi arabia earn enough money bail out his father thereby allow his father get back his mansion then lamenting more loss his sons income than loss his son is believable moreover he then is willing sell his daughter law achieve same end is all part theme that true honor has nothing do with material things that his sense honor is tragically shallow i can go discuss other themes but main themes that revolve around two young women are very powerful most satisfying development themes love independence commitment position women compassion etc are wonderfully addressed make this film well worth watching it is better than devdas most all other bollywood blockbusters,0.5918648018648018,0.18798251748251749,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6.0,Joyful subjugation to soaring emancipation,"Adapted from Malayalam film, Razzaq's,'Perumazhakalam' ( Monsoon season ), this beautifully shot movie is set with arid & beautiful Rajasthan as the backdrop .Zeenat ( Gul Panag ) , a self-reliant Muslim lady, travels from Himachal Pradesh to Rajasthan on a desperate mission to get Meera ( Ayesha Takia ) a cloistered Hindu-haveli-bahu , to sign a ' maafinaama ' that will stay her husband's execution in the Middle East .Zeenat is so tranquil that her composure belies her precarious situation while newly-widowed Meera flits around in the background of her in-laws' haveli like a fragile shadow . Apart from the major themes of forgiveness , friendship & other philosophies , the most riveting one was of the dark tentacles of exploitation creeping up around a financially dependant widow , illustrated by Meera's father-in-law, Raghubir ( Girish Karnad ) , a seemingly dignified , mustachioed patriarch, who , inspite of all his external appearances turns out to be a weak , sleazy man who secretly agrees to barter the lovely Meera to lascivious factory owner Chopra ( Nagesh Kuknoor ) for financial recompense .One of the most arresting scenes was of Raghubir seizing Meera by her elbow , who inspite of her vulnerability & powerlessness , calmly orders Raghubir to let go of her arm since she granted the right to touch , only to his son , ( her dead husband ) & not to Raghubir .Apart from Ayesha Takia's fragile-as-dried-rose-petals & yet hard-as-crystal, portrayal of Meera & Gul Panag's self - reliant yet vulnerable grace of Zeenat , other notable roles are rendered by Uttara Baokar ( the widowed Dadima ) & Shreyas Talpade, a charming, petty thief who accompanies Zeenat on her journey.A poetic & moving film.",joyful subjugation soaring emancipation,adapted malayalam film razzaqs perumazhakalam monsoon season this beautifully shot movie is set with arid beautiful rajasthan as backdrop zeenat gul panag self reliant muslim lady travels himachal pradesh rajasthan desperate mission get meera ayesha takia cloistered hindu haveli bahu sign maafinaama that will stay her husbands execution middle east zeenat is so tranquil that her composure belies her precarious situation while newly widowed meera flits around background her laws haveli like fragile shadow apart major themes forgiveness friendship other philosophies most riveting one was dark tentacles exploitation creeping up around financially dependant widow illustrated by meeras father law raghubir girish karnad seemingly dignified mustachioed patriarch who inspite all his external appearances turns out be weak sleazy man who secretly agrees barter lovely meera lascivious factory owner chopra nagesh kuknoor financial recompense one most arresting scenes was raghubir seizing meera by her elbow who inspite her vulnerability powerlessness calmly orders raghubir let go her arm since she granted right touch only his son her dead husband not raghubir apart ayesha takias fragile as dried rose petals yet hard as crystal portrayal meera gul panags self reliant yet vulnerable grace zeenat other notable roles are rendered by uttara baokar widowed dadima shreyas talpade charming petty thief who accompanies zeenat her journey poetic moving film,0.5744169808685938,0.11912616952939534,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.25}"
