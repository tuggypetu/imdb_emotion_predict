I'm sometimes hard to please with films, but this is definitely worth seeing. It's bonkers, it's crazy, but it's funny, and actually pretty moving at times, a more heart warming film then you'd think it would be.Some pretty amazing special effects, it is never boring at any stage.Ryan Reynolds is terrific, and fans if his will appreciate him being here, he's great, as is Comer.I didn't expect it to be this good, 8/10.",actually really good,i did not expect that this was chosen literally convenience id seen trailers didnt think id enjoy it it is so good im sometimes hard please with films but this is definitely worth seeing its bonkers its crazy but its funny actually pretty moving at times more heart warming film then youd think it would be some pretty amazing special effects it is never boring at any stage ryan reynolds is terrific fans if his will appreciate him being here hes great as is comer i didnt expect it be this good 8 10,0.7226934523809524,0.33846726190476195,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.2}"
9,The feel-good film for summer 2021 with a typically hilarious Ryan Reynolds,"One glance at FREE GUY, the newest big budget offering from Hollywood's favorite action-star/comedy master Ryan Reynolds, will cause most to approach with valid skepticism. The plot seems like a cheap knockoff of films like Ready Player One or even The Matrix, but made in a crude fashion to make more money at the box office. The actual movie, however, could not be further from the worst estimates. Not only is FREE GUY constantly hilarious due to Reynolds and an inventive screenplay, and not only is this possibly the feel-good event of the summer, but it also has a considerable amount of thought put into the meaning of its premise and places a mirror in front of modern-day video game culture.To put it simply, perhaps the main reason this movie comes together so well is because of Ryan Reynolds' constant charisma and hilarity. Most of his dialogue is clearly either written by him or created by him on the spot (I have no idea how he hasn't received a screenwriting credit for this and the Deadpool movies), and the film is that much better as a whole because of it. He also interacts with the other actors in the film very well, including Jodie Comer and Joe Keery, two underrated actors who prove here that they aren't just one-time stars from their respective television shows (Killing Eve and Stranger Things). The ensemble combines to create the most consistently funny movie of 2021 so far.However, this movie isn't just hilarity and crazy antics, although it could easily get by on those aspects alone. FREE GUY has tons of heart and authenticity despite its virtual reality-based plot, and is about very human emotions such as disillusionment, the feeling of being trapped, and, of course, love. There are times where the heartwarming aspects of this film resemble a charming romantic comedy and others where it gets so existential that it almost feels like The Truman Show. It never dives quite as deep as the latter film, but the fact that it even has the guts to include these themes made this easygoing big-budget movie a far better watch for me. Sure, the last thirty minutes are very cheesy and contain a lot of clich√©s, but the buildup is so solid that it earns some dumb rom-com moments near the end.FREE GUY is worth going to see because it is one of the few quality films right now that increases one's faith in human nature. Lately I feel as though I have lost my faith in humanity with all that is happening in the world, so it is refreshing to get a movie that feels confident in the human experience. Maybe I'm looking too deep into the message of FREE GUY and maybe it was conceived just so Ryan Reynolds could screw around for two hours, but either way the price of admission is well worth it for an amazing time at the theater.A-",feel good film summer 2021 with typically hilarious ryan reynolds,one glance at free guy newest big budget offering hollywoods favorite action star comedy master ryan reynolds will cause most approach with valid skepticism plot seems like cheap knockoff films like ready player one or even matrix but made crude fashion make more money at box office actual movie however could not be further worst estimates not only is free guy constantly hilarious due reynolds inventive screenplay not only is this possibly feel good event summer but it also has considerable amount thought put into meaning its premise places mirror front modern day video game culture put it simply perhaps main reason this movie comes together so well is because ryan reynolds constant charisma hilarity most his dialogue is clearly either written by him or created by him spot i have no idea how he hasnt received screenwriting credit this deadpool movies film is that much better as whole because it he also interacts with other actors film very well including jodie comer joe keery two underrated actors who prove here that they arent just one time stars their respective television shows killing eve stranger things ensemble combines create most consistently funny movie 2021 so far however this movie isnt just hilarity crazy antics although it could easily get by those aspects alone free guy has tons heart authenticity despite its virtual reality based plot is about very human emotions such as disillusionment feeling being trapped course love there are times where heartwarming aspects this film resemble charming romantic comedy others where it gets so existential that it almost feels like truman show it never dives quite as deep as latter film but fact that it even has guts include these themes made this easygoing big budget movie far better watch me sure last thirty minutes are very cheesy contain lot clich s but buildup is so solid that it earns some dumb rom com moments near end free guy is worth going see because it is one few quality films right now that increases ones faith human nature lately i feel as though i have lost my faith humanity with all that is happening world so it is refreshing get movie that feels confident human experience maybe im looking too deep into message free guy maybe it was conceived just so ryan reynolds could screw around two hours but either way price admission is well worth it amazing time at theater,0.5492264699306952,0.14874245472837025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,Free GTA,"I reckon the future may hold a game like this for us ... where the AI is so developed, that NPC (non playable characters) live their own life in games, make their own decisions and so forth. Having Ryan Reynolds starring in this ... well it is a genius move to say the least. I called it the Ryan Reynolds show and I'm quite certain no matter if you like this or not, in this regard you will agree with me.Having said that, there are other characters who give it their all, especially our female protagonist. Her counterpart in the real world is as overdrawn as he can be ... Taika does a really good job ... he is actually more comically and one sided that most of the characters in the game he developed ... well others did for him.And then you have the ally in the real world ... a good guy who has to be convinced and who has to come around ... and who you may never feel as much sympathy for as you did for Ryan Reynolds. Even when you figured the ""twist"" in his character and where the story leads ... apart from the revealing a scam thing.Having said all that, the movie boosts a lot of cameos ""in game"" and also real world ... has references galore (not just to GTA and apparently Fortnite, have not played the latter yet, but also to movies and persons/movie characters/franchises)! This can be so much fun if you spot them - not sure how some will play out in say a hundred years ... but you can never tell or guess the impact of something like that.The movie is insane and a lot of fun and has even a moral message in it of sorts.

7,A cute idea...though the first 20 or so minutes is by far the best.,"For the first 20 or so minutes of ""Free Guy"" I was enthralled. As I watched the film on HBO Max, I called my wife over the watch and we both laughed and enjoyed the film. However, as the film progressed the movie lost some of its momentum...and this slowed to a crawl later in the movie. Why? Well, the same problem with ""Free Guy"" is the same with ""Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu"" (incidentally, both starring the likable Ryan Reynolds)....plot. Or, more like it, too much plot. Both films did great jobs world building but after that, they both seemed to insist too much on a plot involving a baddie...which is very formulaic but also reduced the magic from the story. I would have rather seen more of the exciting world in both...and less baddies.The story is an odd one...one that is similar to combining ""The Truman Show"", ""Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu"", ""They Live"", and an online game that plays a bit like ""Grand Theft Auto""! And, the main character, Guy (Reynolds), is an NPC (a non-player character) in a massive world created for online gamers. However, something odd happens.... Guy begins to develop consciousness...and it is driven home when he dons a pair of sunglasses. Suddenly, he can see power ups, health power ups and more! What's next? Well, a baddie...and one whose motivations were vague.Overall, the film is still worth watching...it's good. But the momentum which is going so fast when the film begins just can't be maintained through the course of the film.By the way, there are no extra scenes. When the movie ends and the end titles begins, the story is over...just in case you're tempted to keep watching.",cute idea though first 20 or so minutes is by far best,first 20 or so minutes free guy i was enthralled as i watched film hbo max i called my wife over watch we both laughed enjoyed film however as film progressed movie lost some its momentum this slowed crawl later movie why well same problem with free guy is same with pok mon detective pikachu incidentally both starring likable ryan reynolds plot or more like it too much plot both films did great jobs world building but after that they both seemed insist too much plot involving baddie which is very formulaic but also reduced magic story i would have rather seen more exciting world both less baddies story is odd one one that is similar combining truman show pok mon detective pikachu they live online game that plays bit like grand theft auto main character guy reynolds is npc non player character massive world created online gamers however something odd happens guy begins develop consciousness it is driven home when he dons pair sunglasses suddenly he can see power ups health power ups more whats next well baddie one whose motivations were vague overall film is still worth watching its good but momentum which is going so fast when film begins just cant be maintained through course film by way there are no extra scenes when movie ends end titles begins story is over just case youre tempted keep watching,0.4427350427350429,0.22315462315462314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6,Virtually a good movie,"Much like the virtual world in which the people of Free City live, the movie Free Guy is virtually a good movie.

4,"That's not how video-games work, my guy.","'Free Guy (2021)' feels as though it's been made by people who have never actually played a video-game. It's the cinematic equivalent of those pre-rendered mobile game adverts that pretend to present gameplay but don't actually represent the game they're trying to sell at all. Though there are a couple of interesting ideas centred around the A. I. that makes Reynold's Guy able to go against his code, the piece just doesn't do anything with them. It doesn't really make sense and there's no semblance of cohesion or believability to the game that makes up most of its runtime. I mean, who is 'Free City' for and what do you do in it? It's not PvP from the looks of it, but everyone freaks out when an NPC actually presents a challenge to a player. God forbid a player gets killed by an enemy in a game, right? However, the fact that it lacks a proper sense of logic isn't its biggest issue, although it is undeniably irritating that a movie which is supposed to celebrate video-games clearly doesn't understand them and also partakes in the kind of banal 'gamer' stereotyping that perforates pretty much every piece of traditional media about the subject. No, the biggest issue is that, for me, it simply isn't fun. It's quite the opposite, usually. The amount of cringeworthy moments are nearly innumerable and its message is incredibly hypocritical considering that it lambasts big-budget games which are fuelled by mindless chaos and exist only to make money from a target audience that their developers clearly don't respect but it's a big-budget movie which is fuelled by mindless chaos and exists only to make money from a target audience that its creators clearly don't respect. Ryan Reynold's on-screen persona, which is essentially the same in every comedic film in which he appears, is also incredibly annoying and does the opposite of elicit laughter. There are some relatively impressive visual effects - even though nothing feels tangible and one or two are actually rather disturbing - and there are a couple of action sequences which are relatively well put together. However, the overall experience is just dull, despite all of its in-your-face noise. It's just such a corporate attempt, a movie designed by committee. It also has some incredibly disconcerting fan service, the sort that seems to be replacing actual content more and more these days. Sadly, a lot of people seem to be lapping it up. Of course, if you enjoy this film, then good for you; I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm simply saying I don't. Despite the occasional highlight, it's an uninteresting and uninspired affair overall. 4/10.",thats not how video games work my guy,free guy 2021 feels as though its been made by people who have never actually played video game its cinematic equivalent those pre rendered mobile game adverts that pretend present gameplay but dont actually represent game theyre trying sell at all though there are couple interesting ideas centred around i that makes reynolds guy able go against his code piece just doesnt do anything with them it doesnt really make sense theres no semblance cohesion or believability game that makes up most its runtime i mean who is free city what do you do it its not pvp looks it but everyone freaks out when npc actually presents challenge player god forbid player gets killed by enemy game right however fact that it lacks proper sense logic isnt its biggest issue although it is undeniably irritating that movie which is supposed celebrate video games clearly doesnt understand them also partakes kind banal gamer stereotyping that perforates pretty much every piece traditional media about subject no biggest issue is that me it simply isnt fun its quite opposite usually amount cringeworthy moments are nearly innumerable its message is incredibly hypocritical considering that it lambasts big budget games which are fuelled by mindless chaos exist only make money target audience that their developers clearly dont respect but its big budget movie which is fuelled by mindless chaos exists only make money target audience that its creators clearly dont respect ryan reynolds screen persona which is essentially same every comedic film which he appears is also incredibly annoying does opposite elicit laughter there are some relatively impressive visual effects even though nothing feels tangible one or two are actually rather disturbing there are couple action sequences which are relatively well put together however overall experience is just dull despite all its your face noise its just such corporate attempt movie designed by committee it also has some incredibly disconcerting fan service sort that seems be replacing actual content more more these days sadly lot people seem be lapping it up course if you enjoy this film then good you im not saying you shouldnt im simply saying i dont despite occasional highlight its uninteresting uninspired affair overall 4 10,0.4332702020202021,0.04416486291486291,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"

He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game.

8,Really good movie,"This video is ridiculous but in a good way. There isn't a single thing that makes sense and that's why it's perfect.

The problems of understanding between the two start immediately but Guy quickly adapts becoming a crazy splinter for the company that manages the servers.

6,When the Truman Show Meets the Lego Movie,"One of the biggest problems with movies these days are trailers. I say that because, well, it sort of kills some of the massive twists that could make the film much better. For instance, having a twists that Guy happens to be an NPC in a online shootem-up would have been pretty good. Then again, I'm not entirely sure if it would have worked out all that well anyway considering that the plot ended up being pretty predictable, and that we were accused of spoilers when in reality we have just pretty much figured out what was going on.As the trailer points out, Guy happens to be this NPC in an online shootem-up, and he meets this character that he falls in love with. It turns out that the character is actually a PC, and in fact there is more to this character than meets the eye. The thing is that the world is going to be shut down because the company that is running the game wants to upgrade it to a new release, however, as I suggested, something has happened in this version which means they have to fight against having the game shut down.It was suggested that this film was a cross between The Truman Show, and The Lego Movie, with a number of other things thrown in as well. Actually, this whole idea of living within a world oblivious to the fact that people are watching you is very much like the Truman Show, except that since Guy happens to be an NPC, nobody really pays all that much attention to him, that is until he decides to start leveling up.This is the catch, because apparently NPCs aren't supposed to do that, only players, however he manages to get his hands on a pair of glasses that reveals the reality of the world around him. However, as I suggested, he actually isn't supposed to do that, so how is it that an NPC is not only able to kill a PC, but also steal the PC's glasses. Well, that comes out eventually, but the thing is that it is pretty easy to actually work out once you know what is going on.Still, I did rather like this film, even though it wasn't anything that was necessarily original. One thing that it does is that it explores the nature of reality, and also the nature of consciousness (which has probably given a little bit too much away). Then again, this film doesn't dig too much into many of these issues, namely because it is a fairly light hearted film. On the other hand, especially with regards to the nature of reality, there is a lot of Trumanesque in this film.I thought it was fun, and enjoyable, but then again it is Ryan Reynolds, and I don't mind the odd Ryan Reynolds film, though he can be a little dry at times. Mind you, the innocence of Guy, and also the fact that he goes around doing good in a game that is a less raunchy version of GTA, is rather interesting. Of course, watching all of the violence going on behind the scenes while the NPCs simply wander around isn't too bad, which does sort of sets it apart from the other movies that I have mentioned, however, I can't really say that it is all that original.Hey, at least the Lego Movie left the big reveal until right at the end.",when truman show meets lego movie,one biggest problems with movies these days are trailers i say that because well it sort kills some massive twists that could make film much better instance having twists that guy happens be npc online shootem up would have been pretty good then again im not entirely sure if it would have worked out all that well anyway considering that plot ended up being pretty predictable that we were accused spoilers when reality we have just pretty much figured out what was going as trailer points out guy happens be this npc online shootem up he meets this character that he falls love with it turns out that character is actually pc fact there is more this character than meets eye thing is that world is going be shut down because company that is running game wants upgrade it new release however as i suggested something has happened this version which means they have fight against having game shut down it was suggested that this film was cross between truman show lego movie with number other things thrown as well actually this whole idea living within world oblivious fact that people are watching you is very much like truman show except that since guy happens be npc nobody really pays all that much attention him that is until he decides start leveling up this is catch because apparently npcs arent supposed do that only players however he manages get his hands pair glasses that reveals reality world around him however as i suggested he actually isnt supposed do that so how is it that npc is not only able kill pc but also steal pcs glasses well that comes out eventually but thing is that it is pretty easy actually work out once you know what is going still i did rather like this film even though it wasnt anything that was necessarily original one thing that it does is that it explores nature reality also nature consciousness which has probably given little bit too much away then again this film doesnt dig too much into many these issues namely because it is fairly light hearted film other hand especially with regards nature reality there is lot trumanesque this film i thought it was fun enjoyable but then again it is ryan reynolds i dont mind odd ryan reynolds film though he can be little dry at times mind you innocence guy also fact that he goes around doing good game that is less raunchy version gta is rather interesting course watching all violence going behind scenes while npcs simply wander around isnt too bad which does sort sets it apart other movies that i have mentioned however i cant really say that it is all that original hey at least lego movie left big reveal until right at end,0.4818153431268185,0.083677051545904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7,Free Guy,"I did play GTA III on the PS2 many years ago. So the free wheeling world of Free Guy had some familiarity.From the initial scenes where it is noticeable mainly due to lack of product placement and branding.

4,Alright. But Overrated.,"Thought this looked alright, but was in 2 minds as to whether I should go see it or not as it did look some what weird & wacky.The film follows Guy, an NPC (Non Playable Character) living a controlled life in Free City (A Game Universe) in a Video Game under the same name. It is then that Guy starts to break free from the programmed life he's been living & starts to develop his own actions, feelings etc. However, he, the people & the whole city are under threat from permanent deletion as the game's sequel is going to take over & eradicate the original game, Guy must then fight to escape before he's pixels.I found the film, story wise & graphics wise pretty good, not to mention unique & different, well it mean it did after watching suddenly occur to me that it was a modern version of The Truman Show, the concept was the same & similar. There's plenty of action scenes, eye candy & some interesting rom-com stuff going on.However, the treatment of men in this film was bad, not to mention the snide dialogue added in for good measure from Hollywood as with films of this day & age typically do, it was highly unnecessary & uncalled for. Not to mention the stereotypes & cliches regarding gamers & of course, the runtime at 108 minutes & the pacing being too long.Aside from that it was alright, but nothing amazing. I'd say it's pretty overrated for what it is & not exactly a great film.4/10.",alright but overrated,thought this looked alright but was 2 minds as whether i should go see it or not as it did look some what weird wacky film follows guy npc non playable character living controlled life free city game universe video game under same name it is then that guy starts break free programmed life hes been living starts develop his own actions feelings etc however he people whole city are under threat permanent deletion as games sequel is going take over eradicate original game guy must then fight escape before hes pixels i found film story wise graphics wise pretty good not mention unique different well it mean it did after watching suddenly occur me that it was modern version truman show concept was same similar theres plenty action scenes eye candy some interesting rom com stuff going however treatment men this film was bad not mention snide dialogue added good measure hollywood as with films this day age typically do it was highly unnecessary uncalled not mention stereotypes cliches regarding gamers course runtime at 108 minutes pacing being too long aside that it was alright but nothing amazing id say its pretty overrated what it is not exactly great film 4 10,0.6376302083333332,0.11940104166666672,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.37}"

5,Some brilliant video game moments get lost in a trite story,"There's been a long and storied history of bad video game movies, movies that tried to recapture the magic of pixelated form into something that was going to keep fans and newbies alike happy but for one reason or another failed in their mission to turn gaming greatness into a film of quality.In what is a major win for the film, Shawn Levy's Free Guy thankfully does an amazing job of capturing the video game magic that many gamers feel when they log into their game/system of choice and enter into a world that provides endless hours of entertainment and there's no denying that when Free Guy is focused more around its video game origins this is one of the most enjoyable Hollywood films of the season but sadly the film is lumped with a trite plot line that feels like a poor man's Truman Show, one that takes away from all the chaotic fun it had at its disposal.Creating yet another chance for its star Ryan Reynolds to bring out his Deadpool act for a more wider ranging audience, Free Guy see's the content to coast along actor bring NPC (non playable character) Guy to life as his happy go lucky bank teller finds out his idyllic yet repetitive life is in fact nothing but a program for a game he is only just made aware of and is very much a part of, its a familiar set up in a colorful and chaotic world yet while it roars along for the first act, Free Guy sadly becomes a lame and tiresome love/life affirming journey that in many instances is too preachy where it should have been pure sugar coated silliness.There's moments within the film that are exactly what the doctor ordered, Guy waltzing the streets for the first time with the game around him made alive or a hilarious fight with a quickly programed muscle clad opponent (""catchphrase"") are brilliantly staged and inventive but Guy's awkward romance with Jodie Comer's Molotov Girl/Millie is not what the film needed, especially when billed alongside the films insistence on providing life lessons or by somehow making Taika Waititi utterly unfunny and annoying as he gets little too do as the films shoehorned in villain Antwan.Never the most original of directors, you wish a director with more willingness to stray from the usual had perhaps brought Free Guy to life other than Levy, while the action and spectacle is all on point, there's something wrong with what Free Guy wants to be and what it ends up becoming, a mix of brilliant video game to life moments lost in a terrible story with a bunch of characters and happenings that are instantly forgettable.Final Say -A frustrating experience that does a lot right bringing the video game culture to cinema but also a lot poorly when it comes to story and characters, Free Guy has some fantastic components caught up in a generic ride that isn't worth a second thought.2 1/2 boiled turkeys out of 5.",some brilliant video game moments get lost trite story,theres been long
