7.0,Sanjay Dutt's reality show.,"The talented Mahesh Manjrekar directs his second feature which centres around the character of a simple guy whose attempts to lead a normal life fail and as a result he becomes a merciless underworld don. Manjrekar's direction is excellent and he successfully depicts the dark tone of the crime world. He offers a grim look at the underworld and not even once does he try to glorify it or show it in a positive light. On the contrary, through the main character he shows how restless those who get involved in it are. The film, though a bit unevenly executed at places, generally remains steadily focused, and the proceedings are raw and serious, without useless attempts at comedy and unnecessary subplots one gets to see so much in Hindi films. Many of the film's scenes are extremely moving.For the demanding role of Raghunath, Manjrekar casts Sanjay Dutt, one of the industry's most respected and loved stars, yet one of its most underrated actors. Dutt is simply exceptional, portraying every shade of his character with sheer conviction. He actually becomes Raghunath and manages to create a real new screen persona with his line delivery, body language and his often frighteningly serene attitude. This is one of his absolute best. Other cast members do a very good job, with Reema Lagoo delivering the most memorable performance of the lot as Raghu's tormented yet loving mother. Sanjay Narvekar is quite effective as his best friend, while Namrata Shirodkar does a fine job as Sonu, a young prostitute with whom he falls in love.Vaastav is not without its flaws. I, for one, found Raghunath's transformation far too quick to be completely believable. The film, though generally gritty, intense and matter-of-fact, gets at times a bit too emotional and consequently the level of its authenticity is thus reduced by a iota. Nonetheless, the film's final scenes are powerful and riveting and the very last scene is fantastic. Do watch Vaastav, mainly to see Sanjay Dutt's performance.",sanjay dutts reality show,talented mahesh manjrekar directs his second feature which centres around character simple guy whose attempts lead normal life fail as result he becomes merciless underworld don manjrekars direction is excellent he successfully depicts dark tone crime world he offers grim look at underworld not even once does he try glorify it or show it positive light contrary through main character he shows how restless those who get involved it are film though bit unevenly executed at places generally remains steadily focused proceedings are raw serious without useless attempts at comedy unnecessary subplots one gets see so much hindi films many films scenes are extremely moving demanding role raghunath manjrekar casts sanjay dutt one industrys most respected loved stars yet one its most underrated actors dutt is simply exceptional portraying every shade his character with sheer conviction he actually becomes raghunath manages create real new screen persona with his line delivery body language his often frighteningly serene attitude this is one his absolute best other cast members do very good job with reema lagoo delivering most memorable performance lot as raghus tormented yet loving mother sanjay narvekar is quite effective as his best friend while namrata shirodkar does fine job as sonu young prostitute with whom he falls love vaastav is not without its flaws i one found raghunaths transformation far too quick be completely believable film though generally gritty intense matter fact gets at times bit too emotional consequently level its authenticity is thus reduced by iota nonetheless films final scenes are powerful riveting very last scene is fantastic do watch vaastav mainly see sanjay dutts performance,0.6200170365348938,0.19722111222111222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,The Best Sanjay Dutt Film ever..,"This is in my Top 10 Bollywood Best Movies of all time. It is no doubt the Best Sanjay Dutt movie ever. Sanjay Dutt received BEST Actor award from Filfare, Zee and International Indian Awards. I remember when this movie first came out. I was told its a new Gangster movie and is a Big Hit in India. I did not expect much since Bollywood hasn't really made any realistic Gangster Movies (apart from Parinda) in the likes of Hollywood Classics (Scarface, Goodfellas, Godfather). Vaastav is easily among the best Hindi Gangster Movie, others include (Company, Hathyar). There have been Hindi Gangster Movies before, but all copy of Hollywood movies such as Aatish (A better tomorrow), Aatank hi aatank + Sarkar (Godfather), footpath (State of Grace) etc. Vaastav has its own storyline that suits with India life, Serious and Entertainment. Sanjay dutt gives a powerhouse performance of his career. Namrata Shirodkar looks quite sexy as the prostitute and wife of Raghu. I managed to get a few people into Bollywood because of this film. If you ain't seen it, then See it.",best sanjay dutt film ever,this is my top 10 bollywood best movies all time it is no doubt best sanjay dutt movie ever sanjay dutt received best actor award filfare zee international indian awards i remember when this movie first came out i was told its new gangster movie is big hit india i did not expect much since bollywood hasnt really made any realistic gangster movies apart parinda likes hollywood classics scarface goodfellas godfather vaastav is easily among best hindi gangster movie others include company hathyar there have been hindi gangster movies before but all copy hollywood movies such as aatish better tomorrow aatank hi aatank sarkar godfather footpath state grace etc vaastav has its own storyline that suits with india life serious entertainment sanjay dutt gives powerhouse performance his career namrata shirodkar looks quite sexy as prostitute wife raghu i managed get few people into bollywood because this film if you aint seen it then see it,0.411060606060606,0.3976515151515152,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.61, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.18}"
9.0,"Vaastav:The Reality,Watch it for Sanjay Dutt ,he's simply superb in this one..","Vaastav is about Ragunath Namdev Shivalkhar aka Raghu Bhai(Sanjay Dutt),he lives in a lower middle class family in a Chawl of Mumbai,he's a brat and has no interest in studies whatsoever,and is always having fun with his best friend Dedhfutiya(Sanjay Narvekar)and other friends,because of his nature his parents(Father:Namdev Shivalkhar(Shivaji Satam) and Mother:Shanta(Reema Lagoo)) and brother Vijay Namdev Shivalkhar(Mohnish Behl) are always angry with him ,so on Raghu's insistence his father withdraws 40,000 from his provident fund and with that money Raghu opens a Pav Bhaaji stall, they run their shop smoothly,until one day 2 local goons mess with Dedhfutiya and beat him up,hence a fight starts and Raghu accidentally kills a goon who is the brother of a local Don Fracture Bandya(Jack Gaud).Afraid and terrified Raghu and Dedhfutiya go absconding,Fracture Bandya goes crazy searching them and even takes the help of police to find them but it's of no use as Raghu and Dedhfutiya go hiding in the place of another Don 'Vitthal Kaanya'(Ashish Vidyarthi) with a help of an Sub Inspector friend Kishore Kadam(Deepak Tijori),Vitthal Kaanya was once the boss of 'Fracture Bandya',but is now losing his hold over the city due to increasing power of Fracture Baandya.Fracture Bandya comes to know that Raghu is hiding with Vitthal Kaanya,and meets Middle Man Mandvaali Baadshah 'Suleiman Bhai'(Paresh Rawal) asking Vithal Kaanya to pay a huge ransom amount to save Raghu's life, so a meeting is arranged in a restaurant with a promise that no guns will be bought,but Suleiman does not trusts Fracture Bandya and get's a gun attached under one of the restaurant's table.In the restaurant Raghu and Dedhfutiya meet Francture Bandya and his brother'Chota Fracture'(Ganesh Yadav), Fracture Bandya arranges for a gun from one of the waiters and is about to kill Raghuand Dedhfutiya when Raghu takes out the gun attached below the table and kills Fracture Bandya, however his brother escapes...Raghu becomes the most powerful and feared and the richest don of Mumbai Underworld and starts working for Maharshtra Home Minister Babban Rao Kadam(Mohan Joshi),Raghu arranges for a job for his brother Vijay and also gets him married to Puja(Ekta Sohini)using his fear antics.Raghu becomes a smoker, an alcohol and cocaine addict and falls in love and marries a prostitute Sonia(Namrata Shirodkar) at a brothel owned by Lakshmi Akka(Himani Shivpuri).Soon Chota Fracture gets Vitthal Kaanya killed so Raghu and his gang kill Chota Fracture with his entire gang.Raghu also kills a group of hoodlums who eve tease Puja(Vijay's wife). Babban Rao Kadam behaves as if Raghu is his own son and even sends Raghu on a honeymoon with Sonia to Switzerland on his cost,Raghu does many killings on Babban's including a Muslim preacher which leads to riots.Babban sends Raghu to threaten a Parsi person to empty a land,after Signing the required papers for emptying the land the Parsi starts abusing Raghu and Babban so Raghu loses his head and kills the Parsi, This incident gets a lot of media publicity ,so due to increasing pressure by media on his links with the underworld Babban shows his true color and gives an encounter order for Raghu, Dedhfutiya and all Raghu's gang members,which leads to encounter of Dedhfutiya and all the Raghu's gang members by the police..So Raghu asks Suleimaan to arrange a secret meeting with Babban where he will surrender to police but he comes and kills Babban but unfortunately Suleiman also gets killed in the meeting ,Raghu goes running to his secret house in Alibaug where he has hidden his family,fed up with his life and fear of police encounter he tells his mother to please kill him which she obliges to do..The biggest strength of the movie is Sanjay Dutt who gives a performance of his life ,to put in mild words he gives one of the best performances in Bollywood history and deservedly won Filmfare best actor for it,even making the legendary actor Dilip Kumar to say that if there is a performance in Bollywood he won't be able to do it would be Sanjay Dutt's in Vaastav,all other performances are good too and specially of Reema Lagoo as Raghu's mother and Sanjay Narvekar as Dedhfutiya.The direction is excellent by Mahesh Manjrekar(his debut as director),The dialogues are very powerful throughout the movie with'PACHCHAS TOLA' dialogue and climax dialogues being outright brilliant,the cinematography by Vijay Arora is very good adding to the intense, powerful and realistic feel of the movie,the background score by Sandeep Chowta is perfectly apt for the movie, the music by Jatin-Lalit is good too and suits the movie.At the box office the film was only a moderate success but surely deserved more,although the film won many awards and has very high critical acclaim, Vaastav was followed by Haathyar as a sequel in which Raghu's son grows up to be a don played by Sanjay Dutt again,but was not as good.VAASTAV IS A MATERPIECE AND STRONGLY RECOMMENDED,AMONG

10.0,"Sanjay Dutt steals the show with one of the best performances of his career, better than Naam, Kabzaa and Hathyaar.","Vaastav has the Mumbai underworld as its backdrop. This subject has been dealt with before many times in Hindi films. But rarely is it handled properly. Satya is probably the best underworld film to come out Bollywood in recent years. Vaastav is not flawless like Satya, but it has a gripping storyline, good direction and characterizations, and most importantly - Sanjay Dutt.This is probably the best role Sanjay Dutt has got his hands on since Khal-Nayak, and he takes full adavantage of it. Sanjay Dutt does an excellent job as the guy gone astray. He is as superb as the good-for-nothing lad in the initial reels as the dreaded man of the underworld in the latter ones. Namrata Shirodkar gets very limited scope and gives a fair performance. Shivaji Satam shines as Sanjay Dutt's father. Reema, as Sanjay's mother, also delivers a praiseworthy performance. Mohnish Bahl is wonderfully natural. Sanjay Narvekar , as Dedh-Phutiya, is mind-blowing. Here's a guy who is talent personified! Mohan Joshi is able. Paresh Rawal is likeably restrained. Ashish Vidyarthi gets less scope but does well. Depak Tijori leaves a mark. Usha Nadkarni is excellent. Ektaa, Himani Shivpuri, Jack Gaud, Achyut Potdar, Sunil Shencle, Ganesh Yadav, and Kashmira Shah (in a special appearance) lend average support.The film is very well directed by the debutant Mahesh Manjrekar. Being his first film, he is excellent. Production values are not very high; anyway the film does not require pomp & showbiz, as it's so close to the ultimate truth. The film belongs to Sanjay Dutt all the way. Sanjay justifies the faith of his director and carries the film on his shoulders, ably supported by others. The only drawback of the film can be the songs, which are not so catchy. To sum it up Mahesh Manjrekar has a winner on his hand and Sanjay Dutt will get lots of accolades for this film.A Silver Jubilee (25 weeks run) HIT. One of the Top Ten Hits of 1999.",sanjay dutt steals show with one best performances his career better than naam kabzaa hathyaar,vaastav has mumbai underworld as its backdrop this subject has been dealt with before many times hindi films but rarely is it handled properly satya is probably best underworld film come out bollywood recent years vaastav is not flawless like satya but it has gripping storyline good direction characterizations most importantly sanjay dutt this is probably best role sanjay dutt has got his hands since khal nayak he takes full adavantage it sanjay dutt does excellent job as guy gone astray he is as superb as good nothing lad initial reels as dreaded man underworld latter ones namrata shirodkar gets very limited scope gives fair performance shivaji satam shines as sanjay dutts father reema as sanjays mother also delivers praiseworthy performance mohnish bahl is wonderfully natural sanjay narvekar as dedh phutiya is mind blowing heres guy who is talent personified mohan joshi is able paresh rawal is likeably restrained ashish vidyarthi gets less scope but does well depak tijori leaves mark usha nadkarni is excellent ektaa himani shivpuri jack gaud achyut potdar sunil shencle ganesh yadav kashmira shah special appearance lend average support film is very well directed by debutant mahesh manjrekar being his first film he is excellent production values are not very high anyway film does not require pomp showbiz as its so close ultimate truth film belongs sanjay dutt all way sanjay justifies faith his director carries film his shoulders ably supported by others only drawback film can be songs which are not so catchy sum it up mahesh manjrekar has winner his hand sanjay dutt will get lots accolades this film silver jubilee 25 weeks run hit one top ten hits 1999,0.5420502920502921,0.3626868626868626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,one of my all time bollywood faves,Vaastav is in my top 10 Hindi film list of all time and in my opinion in the Indian gangster genre only GOW2 and Satya are ahead of this. Vaastav isn't as violent as the previous two mentioned as it is a drama that centres around the Gangsters family life and relationships. Vaastav tells the story of a lower-middle class family whose eldest son has no choice but to accept and embrace the Indian crime world of Mumbai after he and his friends accidentally kill a local gangster's brother. Why do I rate this film so highly is essentially the performance of Sanjay Dutt as Raghu Bhai a character we slowly see transform to a manic and terrifying Gangster whose rage we see slowly burning and building leading to the explosive climax absolutely superb. Mahesh Manjrekar deserves credit as director as do the entire cast not one performance is out of place in this classic.

9.0,"Sanjay Dutt in the role that was created for him, by far one of the best written, directed, and performed films ever to come out of Indian cinema","Im not your average bollywood fan, in fact quite the opposite, i despise most productions that come out of the Indian film industry. However, this movie is compelling from the first scene to the last, and although it has elements of the stereotypical bollywood film, the film itself illustrates a story that is gripping and intriguing. Sanjay Dutt takes the lead role of Raghunat Namdev Shivalkar, and fulfills it to a frighteningly captivating effect. Dutt who has had a life of controversy and turbulence himself, was perhaps best equipped to play this role like nobody else could. The film traces the life of a young, exuberant man, who is struggling to find direction in his life. The transformation from this depiction, to the character of 'Raghu Bhai' is achieved with pure brilliance, by both the script and performers. Essentially Vaastav is an intelligent movie, revealing the infamously corrupt nature of the Indian political system, as well as the functioning of society itself. These factors are shown to work simultaneously to create a character that is forever embedded in the history of Indian cinema. This is bollywood at its rare finest, and it will not fail in living up to the trademark of the movie itself 'The Reality'.

9.0,Performances galore,"One thing is often said of reruns. These actually tell you whether a movie is truly good. A great one will leave you falling in love all over again, and a not-so-great one will show its true colors in the second run, sometimes even after grossing highly in its first run.And the pleasure of seeing a real good movie, all over again, is one of those still unparalleled in life. True for 'Vaastav' too. This is the film that rewrote the futures of both Sanjay Dutt and Mahesh Manjrekar.This masterpiece from Manjrekar starts off on a light note highlighting the simplicity of a family of four. Raghu (Dutt) and his elder brother (Mohnish Behl) are struggling to find a proper job. Raghu finds peace and success in a pav-bhaji stall put up by him with the help of a few friends.Depicting the true nature of life in the Mumbai chawls, we see how the course of events can so easily lead the average youngster astray. Compelled by circumstances, our hero, along with his best friend, takes to crime, and soon they become underworld kingpins.Here the director is at his best, with acute and heartfelt rendering of the Mumbai underworld. So lifelike are these scenes that it was assumed by many that Manjarekar had connections with the underworld!Especially wonderful is the way that the romance between the leads is handled. Namrata excels in a small but sensitive role of a prostitute. And the role played by 'ded-phutia', the best friend of Raghu, is absolutely breathtaking, albeit a little melodramatic.But what was hugely touted as the major reason of the film's success was its ending, where we have a very sensitive portrayal of the futility of violence, as Raghu is killed by a bullet fired from his own gun and by his own mother.The screenplay and editing is crisp and goes lengths in establishing the high quality of the film. An item number by Kashmira Shah went down very well with the audience, as did the rest of the music by Anu Malik.But what is definitely the very essence and character of the movie is the unparalleled rendering of the cocaine-addicted underworld don, played by Sanjay Dutt as only he can. It brought back memories of the hugely successful 'Khalnayak', where Dutt had given a whole new meaning to the role of an underworld goon.Overall, a must watch for those who had missed it earlier, and for those who had liked it the first time itself, this is as good a time as any for a flashback.",performances galore,one thing is often said reruns these actually tell you whether movie is truly good great one will leave you falling love all over again not so great one will show its true colors second run sometimes even after grossing highly its first run pleasure seeing real good movie all over again is one those still unparalleled life true vaastav too this is film that rewrote futures both sanjay dutt mahesh manjrekar this masterpiece manjrekar starts off light note highlighting simplicity family four raghu dutt his elder brother mohnish behl are struggling find proper job raghu finds peace success pav bhaji stall put up by him with help few friends depicting true nature life mumbai chawls we see how course events can so easily lead average youngster astray compelled by circumstances our hero along with his best friend takes crime soon they become underworld kingpins here director is at his best with acute heartfelt rendering mumbai underworld so lifelike are these scenes that it was assumed by many that manjarekar had connections with underworld especially wonderful is way that romance between leads is handled namrata excels small but sensitive role prostitute role played by ded phutia best friend raghu is absolutely breathtaking albeit little melodramatic but what was hugely touted as major reason films success was its ending where we have very sensitive portrayal futility violence as raghu is killed by bullet fired his own gun by his own mother screenplay editing is crisp goes lengths establishing high quality film item number by kashmira shah went down very well with audience as did rest music by anu malik but what is definitely very essence character movie is unparalleled rendering cocaine addicted underworld don played by sanjay dutt as only he can it brought back memories hugely successful khalnayak where dutt had given whole new meaning role underworld goon overall must watch those who had missed it earlier those who had liked it first time itself this is as good time as any flashback,0.5328320945302077,0.318663045549838,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7.0,Sanjay Dutt's terrific comeback,"Post Jail return Sanju's career was going downhill, However VAASTAV resurrected it, The film was an acid test: It was Mahesh Manjerekar's debut though NIDAAN started before but released later. The film is another gangster film and allegedly based on life of Chota Rajan. The film has Sanju yet again play a similar role to NAAM where we becomes a gangster. The film has scenes lifted from GODFATHER and SCARFACE however yet the drama between Sanju and Reema is well handled, the love story between Sanju and Namrata is clichéd yet has good moments. Sanju's transformation is brilliantly handled, most notable is that Mohinish Behl is shown as a good character yet he has grey shades, he is shown as a practical man who leaves his chawl and settles with his wife in a flat as he doesn't want people to know he is Raghu's brother, though he goes later begging for help when his wife is stalked. There are several superb scenes like Shivaji Satham-Sanju's emotional breakdown, Sanjay Dutt breaking down in his house front of Namrata Shirodkar after killing the Parsi, Sanjay Dutt being in trouble due to Mohan Joshi and the scene at Paresh's house The climax too is superb which was shot using 2 cameras(one inside and 1 outside) Ironically Sanju too was a drug addict and here too he plays 1 Direction by Mahesh Manjerekar is good Music by Jatin Lalit is decentSanjay Dutt is splendid in his act which he did before but this film has an edge, He plays the role like only he can, his last few minutes are the best performance he ever gave till then. Sanjay Narvekar is good as Dedh Phutiya, Namrata Shirodkar is good too Reema Lagoo though just 1 year older to Sanju in real life is superb as his mother, Shivaji Satham is good too,Mohinish and Ekta Behl are good Ashish Vidyarthi is okay, Paresh Rawal is good, Mohan Joshi is as usual Mahesh Manjerekar has a cameo in the song Apni To Nikal Padi rest are okay",sanjay dutts terrific comeback,post jail return sanjus career was going downhill however vaastav resurrected it film was acid test it was mahesh manjerekars debut though nidaan started before but released later film is another gangster film allegedly based life chota rajan film has sanju yet again play similar role naam where we becomes gangster film has scenes lifted godfather scarface however yet drama between sanju reema is well handled love story between sanju namrata is clich d yet has good moments sanjus transformation is brilliantly handled most notable is that mohinish behl is shown as good character yet he has grey shades he is shown as practical man who leaves his chawl settles with his wife flat as he doesnt want people know he is raghus brother though he goes later begging help when his wife is stalked there are several superb scenes like shivaji satham sanjus emotional breakdown sanjay dutt breaking down his house front namrata shirodkar after killing parsi sanjay dutt being trouble due mohan joshi scene at pareshs house climax too is superb which was shot using 2 cameras one inside 1 outside ironically sanju too was drug addict here too he plays 1 direction by mahesh manjerekar is good music by jatin lalit is decentsanjay dutt is splendid his act which he did before but this film has edge he plays role like only he can his last few minutes are best performance he ever gave till then sanjay narvekar is good as dedh phutiya namrata shirodkar is good too reema lagoo though just 1 year older sanju real life is superb as his mother shivaji satham is good too mohinish ekta behl are good ashish vidyarthi is okay paresh rawal is good mohan joshi is as usual mahesh manjerekar has cameo song apni nikal padi rest are okay,0.4625356125356126,0.3331908831908831,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.22}"

,Poor Effort from Mahesh,"Some people (particularly sports journalists) say success is the difference measured between where you were and where you are. So Saurav Ganguly is a better success than Sachin Tendulkar, whereas Sachin might just be a better player overall. Some people might like to point this definition of success to 'achievement'. Similarly, if we take boxoffice success as the difference between what the movie (or the producer-director) intended to do and what it actually did - then Vaastav is a FLOP. Mujhe Kuch Whatever Hai is a HIT.Vaastav was indeed a good effort gone somewhat astray from Mahesh Manjrekar. Since then he has stopped thinking and just went on making movies. Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai and what not.BUT Vaastav has a good storyline. It revolves around Sanjay Dutt - the chawl guy- becoming Raghubhai the dreaded and much-utilized Don. Storyline is predictable and more is the ending. The positive side of making a movie out of a predictable storyline is you have got to be real good in presentation. Guys in the theater already know what's happening and they know who will kill whom at the end. They just want to see HOW!That is a place Vaastav tilted to be more of an usual movie. Even the presentation was predictable.There is one good experiment Mahesh did though. This is one of the very few movies where there is NO good guy. No moral hang-ups. If you discount 5 time a day namaazi Paresh Rawal that is. Raghu is the real don. Raghu kills anyone in front of his 5 year old kid. Smokes grass. Visits brothel. Declines to marry the pros at first. Even after marrying he treats her real bad and even calls her 'raand shali' at least once. In fact, it appears more than a few times that as if the film doesn't at all want anyone to sympathize with the main character anyway.Raghu's father Shivaji Satam is just a father. He never is shown to have said a single word against his son just because he is a mafia don. That is where the movie puts a big fallacy in front. We see Raghu's mother (played by Reema Laagu who actually looks of the same age as Sanjay) never really voicing anything against her son. At the end though she plays Mother India as if that was the thing she wanted from the day Raghu was born. Bad characterization Mahesh!This is the only movie where I am personally satisfied by the 'reason' the couple dashes off to Switzerland and sing a very thematic song. Home minister (who else but Mohan Joshi) gifts Raghu two tickets as his wedding present.Namrata Shirodgar was believable. But not extra-ordinary. It should be banned to brand any leading actress having great acting potential whenever she plays a prostitute. Too much of social engineering! Perhaps this was the first time a Miss India playing prostitute )after Zeenat Aman) made her acting so hyped.This movie was released during 1999. Somewhere around that time SAB (Shri Adhikari Brothers) was running a comedy show (Shriman Shrimati) with Reema Laagu as one of the main characters. Even apart from that Reema Lagu was so much involved with typical family dramas that no one took her seriously in this movie from beginning. Then perhaps just to prove everyone wrong or out of frustration she pulls off the trigger on her beta at the end.Did anyone notice Jatin Lalit songs picturised on higher elevation are always hit?For flesh lovers, there is a bar dance by Kashmira and troupe. Now she is really a good actress in spite of everything. Watch her face in close up when Raghu kills a guy in front of everyone and says 'Nacho item log nacho'. Long time after Jungle Ki Beta I've seen Jack Gaud saying more than 2 sentences in a movie. And in 'Jungle ki Beta' he played Tarzan!Overall, Vaastav was and will remain the landmark of Mahesh Manjrekar. Mahesh has off late become just as prolific as his namesake (Bhatt). He was working on 14 movies at same point of time. Somehow, you will feel Mahesh is a good director, his films are good - but perhaps his films will never be the ones you will pick up on a discussion with your friend over beer.",poor effort mahesh,some people particularly sports journalists say success is difference measured between where you were where you are so saurav ganguly is better success than sachin tendulkar whereas sachin might just be better player overall some people might like point this definition success achievement similarly if we take boxoffice success as difference between what movie or producer director intended do what it actually did then vaastav is flop mujhe kuch whatever hai is hit vaastav was indeed good effort gone somewhat astray mahesh manjrekar since then he has stopped thinking just went making movies jis desh mein ganga rehta hai what not but vaastav has good storyline it revolves around sanjay dutt chawl guy becoming raghubhai dreaded much utilized don storyline is predictable more is ending positive side making movie out predictable storyline is you have got be real good presentation guys theater already know whats happening they know who will kill whom at end they just want see how that is place vaastav tilted be more usual movie even presentation was predictable there is one good experiment mahesh did though this is one very few movies where there is no good guy no moral hang ups if you discount 5 time day namaazi paresh rawal that is raghu is real don raghu kills anyone front his 5 year old kid smokes grass visits brothel declines marry pros at first even after marrying he treats her real bad even calls her raand shali at least once fact it appears more than few times that as if film doesnt at all want anyone sympathize with main character anyway raghus father shivaji satam is just father he never is shown have said single word against his son just because he is mafia don that is where movie puts big fallacy front we see raghus mother played by reema laagu who actually looks same age as sanjay never really voicing anything against her son at end though she plays mother india as if that was thing she wanted day raghu was born bad characterization mahesh this is only movie where i am personally satisfied by reason couple dashes off switzerland sing very thematic song home minister who else but mohan joshi gifts raghu two tickets as his wedding present namrata shirodgar was believable but not extra ordinary it should be banned brand any leading actress having great acting potential whenever she plays prostitute too much social engineering perhaps this was first time miss india playing prostitute after zeenat aman made her acting so hyped this movie was released during 1999 somewhere around that time sab shri adhikari brothers was running comedy show shriman shrimati with reema laagu as one main characters even apart that reema lagu was so much involved with typical family dramas that no one took her seriously this movie beginning then perhaps just prove everyone wrong or out frustration she pulls off trigger her beta at end did anyone notice jatin lalit songs picturised higher elevation are always hit flesh lovers there is bar dance by kashmira troupe now she is really good actress spite everything watch her face close up when raghu kills guy front everyone says nacho item log nacho long time after jungle ki beta ive seen jack gaud saying more than 2 sentences movie jungle ki beta he played tarzan overall vaastav was will remain landmark mahesh manjrekar mahesh has off late become just as prolific as his namesake bhatt he was working 14 movies at same point time somehow you will feel mahesh is good director his films are good but perhaps his films will never be ones you will pick up discussion with your friend over beer,0.3942118665648078,0.11807613954672783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.28}"
