9,A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.,"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.**** (out of four)",wonderful conclusion wonderful trilogy,after eight years seclusion batman resurfaces face bane mastermind bent destroying gotham has ties bruce waynes past christopher nolans conclusion his dark knight trilogy should be treated as wrap up rather than third installment despite many new characters being introduced even their conflicts motives are derived events that occurred previous two films such approach could be seen as weakness since conflict could just end up being sort rematch rather than moving story forward however nolans approach works terrificly over hour is shot stunning imax but film is more touching than it is intense thats its best quality hardy steps as genius mercenary bane who is slightly bigger slightly stronger slightly smarter than batman thus making him challenge best suited grand finale joker works best as batmans arch nemesis since they are polar opposites with joker standing everything batman stands against two face works best as batmans most tragic enemy because harvey dent is very much like bruce wayne only difference is dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as wayne did bane works best as batmans most challenging villain because his physical mental superiority forget bane you saw batman robin nolan carefully chose all his villains series wisely executed them perfectly hardy had big shoes fill following ledgers posthumous oscar winning performance while bane is no joker hardy does satisfying job should not be compared ledgers performance as they are completely different roles it is michael caine however that delivers most memorable touching performance entire film wonderful conclusion wonderful trilogy out four,0.5592000552638852,0.33325596389426176,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10,Best comic movie trilogy ever,"The Dark Knight Rises capped off what is probably the best comic book related trilogy of movies of all time. Earlier in the series you had Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with this just being the perfect way to finish off the series.Since the last movie it's been 7 years and Batman has been in seclusion since then. Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A new villain has emerged that being the menacing Bane played by the great Tom Hardy.The supporting cast has returning members like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine in addition to new members like Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway.The movie has a running time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but it doesn't seem like it at all, the movie flows like a 2 hour movie.",best comic movie trilogy ever,dark knight rises capped off what is probably best comic book related trilogy movies all time earlier series you had batman begins dark knight with this just being perfect way finish off series since last movie its been 7 years batman has been seclusion since then christian bale returns as batman bruce wayne new villain has emerged that being menacing bane played by great tom hardy supporting cast has returning members like morgan freeman gary oldman michael caine addition new members like joseph gordon levitt marion cotillard anne hathaway movie has running time about 2 hours 45 minutes but it doesnt seem like it at all movie flows like 2 hour movie,0.4547348484848484,0.22017045454545456,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9,Epic,"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets.

10,My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough.

10,No one wraps up a trilogy like Nolan.,"Wow. That's all I can say. I was freaked out about this movie, because I loved the first two. Too often have I gotten into a series, then been horribly disappointed by the last entry (e.g. the hunger games. I hated the third book). That being said, even though I was nervous, I still had high expectations. And it exceeded those. The acting was excellent, consistently to the previous movies. The action was good. The story was great. The characters were diverse and interesting, and despite the longevity of this film, it wasn't too slow at all. This movie was a emotional roller coaster. The ending ( here's where the spoilers start) was extremely sad, but ironically, that was really good. One thing i was nervous about was that the ending would be a typical superhero movie ending: happy because the main bad guy dies or gets arrested or whatever. This wasn't that. Ask anyone who knows me well; I'm a very stoic guy, but this almost had me in tears. (Of course, it could have been the fact that this part came around at 3 AM and my mind wasn't working right.) Basically, an awesome film. My sole complaint was ( another spoiler here ) Bane's death. I'll give it this: it was realistic. I expected his death to be a long, drawn out sentimental thing, but in reality, his head got blown off in a flash. At first, I thought it was stupid, but it's sorta more realistic. Considering it's a superhero movie, anyway.If you're worried that this will ruin the series for you, don't be. I loved this movie. I don't know if it's as good as the Dark Knight, but if not, it's very, very close. Watch it. Do yourself a favor.",no one wraps up trilogy like nolan,wow thats all i can say i was freaked out about this movie because i loved first two too often have i gotten into series then been horribly disappointed by last entry e g hunger games i hated third book that being said even though i was nervous i still had high expectations it exceeded those acting was excellent consistently previous movies action was good story was great characters were diverse interesting despite longevity this film it wasnt too slow at all this movie was emotional roller coaster ending heres where spoilers start was extremely sad but ironically that was really good one thing i was nervous about was that ending would be typical superhero movie ending happy because main bad guy dies or gets arrested or whatever this wasnt that ask anyone who knows me well im very stoic guy but this almost had me tears course it could have been fact that this part came around at 3 am my mind wasnt working right basically awesome film my sole complaint was another spoiler here banes death ill give it this it was realistic i expected his death be long drawn out sentimental thing but reality his head got blown off flash at first i thought it was stupid but its sorta more realistic considering its superhero movie anyway if youre worried that this will ruin series you dont be i loved this movie i dont know if its as good as dark knight but if not its very very close watch it do yourself favor,0.542253193960511,0.11152148664343788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9,What a way to end the trilogy!,"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox",what way end trilogy,possibly my personal favourite nolan batman films i do like batman begins dark knight very much is it perfect me not quite there are so many plot strand long running time that film occasionally there is big emphasis that sags momentum some strands ending could have done with more development it is brilliant film all same one highlights so far year as expect christopher nolan it is visually audacious film with gorgeous cinematography beautifully realised gotham city great special effects hans zimmers score is not one his very best me but there is still epic haunting quality that is just perfect this film dialogue provokes thought makes emotional impact vast majority time dark knight rises is ambitious gripping i dont consider christopher nolan one my favourites this said he is hugely impressive director who shows great ambition willingness make his subject matters interesting he does really wonderful job here as set action pieces including plane hijack banes assault gotham are enough make jaw drop performances are just terrific all involved matthew modine fares weakest but he is far bad christian bale is still charismatic presence matthew caine appropriately loyal gary oldman morgan freeman subtly understated joseph gordon levitt captures his characters idealism wonderfully tom hardy is beefed up terrifying mode as bane worthy successor heath ledgers iconic joker anne hathaway was curious casting choice but as catwoman she is spot here is catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy which she still is she is very ruthless no nonsense here all all hugely impressive film best nolans batman trilogy though im prepared any flaming ill get this opinion one highlights so far 2012 9 10 bethany cox,0.650860805860806,0.26295787545787547,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,"The Best ""Batman"" Movie Ever!!!","I cannot imagine a ""Batman"" movie after ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (**** out of ****) without ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan at the helm. Warner Brothers and DC Comics got this legendary costume-clad crime fighter trilogy 'right.' Sure, you can nitpick, but Nolan's ""Batman"" movies differed in ambiance from those of both Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. Nolan's ""Batman"" movies trod a thin line turning a vigilante into a hero and scrutinizing the morality of his behavior. Essentially, Nolan rebooted the franchise, recreated Bruce Wayne and Batman as troubled alter-egos, and turned the good versus evil episodes of the earlier films into full-blown spectacles. While sticking slavishly to the basics, he relied on his fertile imagination to give the characters greater depth and examine the issue of vigilantism. Nolan's Caped Crusader movies don't rely on humor as much as slight, off-hand comments. The action unfolds swiftly, and the characters are clearly delineated before the end credits roll. You prepare yourself for the surprises. The films replicate the haunted quality that Burton forged with his Michael Keaton forays, while Schumacher embraced a bright, heavily saturated, slightly surreal comic book quality. Of course, the ""Batman"" graphic novels of Frank Miller have influenced Nolan. Christian Bale's part in the success of the trilogy is considerable. He is more of a Michael Keaton ""Batman"" than either a Val Kilmer or a George Clooney crime fighter. Bale is to Batman the same way that Sean Connery was to Bond. Long-time British actor Michael Caine makes a superb Alfred Pennyworth, but Michael Gough was no slouch himself in the four previous ""Batman"" incarnations. Unquestionably, Nolan steps back from Batman at the Caped Crime Buster's zenith. The ending to this trilogy capper is odd. Indeed, Warner Brothers conceivably could make another ""Batman"" movie based on Nolan's conclusion to ""The Dark Knight Rises.""Anybody who tries to top ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will have a lot to prove both artistically and financially. Christopher Nolan is to the ""Batman"" movies what James Cameron was to the ""Terminator"" movies. Stepping into Nolan's shoes will pose a supreme challenge for whoever dares. Nolan approached the ""Batman"" franchise with reverence, played the plots as close to straight as possible, and shunned clever one-liners. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" surpasses both the ""Batman Begins"" origin movie and ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" takes the franchise to the brink of annihilation with what amounts to a Gotham City Armageddon. Batman contends with two worthy opponents that played a part in his origins. The most obvious villain is Bane. A hulking brute of a man, he looks like a cross between of a wrestler and equivalent of a human pit bulldog. Bane wears a contraption over his face that enables him to handle the pain of life. Basically, we never see British actor Tom Hardy's face because he conceals it with a mask. Interestingly, this imbues Bane with a mystery. Furthermore, Bane speaks through this contraption and he sounds quite avuncular. In other words, he doesn't sound as menacing as Darth Vader, but he doesn't mince words. Finally, former Disney princess Anne Hathaway makes a willowy Cat Woman. Just as the Marvel people had trouble getting Hulk right, the DC people have experienced similar trouble getting Catwoman right. Anne Hathaway makes the perfect Catwoman.The sheer spectacle of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" dwarfs ""The Dark Knight."" Eight years has elapsed since the murder of Harvey Dent and the disappearance of the Caped Crusader. Guests at Wayne Manor make remarks about the tragic figure skulking about on the balcony in the distance. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale of ""Terminator Salvation"") has turned into a contemporary Howard Hughes. He is amazed when he catches a burglar in his side of the mansion. Moreover, she is a delectable burglar. She has cracked Wayne's safe and stolen his mother's pearls. Since Gotham City is largely safe now, the authorities are not prepared when a gang assaults Wall Street and tries to plunge the economy in chaos. Batman makes a triumphant return in top form with a new gadget that resembles a mini-helicopter. Initially, Batman has no trouble licking his adversaries. Against the Catwoman, he seems vulnerable. She likes to let him down. When he confronts Bane, Batman's gauntleted fists exert no more effect on him than they would on a bag of cement. Indeed, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman of ""The Fifth Element"") is back on the case. He knows the truth about Harvey Dent, even if he doesn't know the identity of the Batman. If you missed either or both ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" you may find yourself in an expositional purgatory. Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy fits snugly together, aside from the change of casting between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" when Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes in the District Attorney's Office. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" packs the Caped Crusader into exile. Bane batters him into submission. Nolan takes not only Gotham City to the limit, but also he takes audiences to the limit with an actioneer that clocks in at 164 minutes. Nevertheless, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" qualifies as the best ""Batman"" movie ever!",best batman movie ever,i cannot imagine batman movie after dark knight rises out without inception director christopher nolan at helm warner brothers dc comics got this legendary costume clad crime fighter trilogy right sure you can nitpick but nolans batman movies differed ambiance those both tim burton joel schumacher nolans batman movies trod thin line turning vigilante into hero scrutinizing morality his behavior essentially nolan rebooted franchise recreated bruce wayne batman as troubled alter egos turned good versus evil episodes earlier films into full blown spectacles while sticking slavishly basics he relied his fertile imagination give characters greater depth examine issue vigilantism nolans caped crusader movies dont rely humor as much as slight off hand comments action unfolds swiftly characters are clearly delineated before end credits roll you prepare yourself surprises films replicate haunted quality that burton forged with his michael keaton forays while schumacher embraced bright heavily saturated slightly surreal comic book quality course batman graphic novels frank miller have influenced nolan christian bales part success trilogy is considerable he is more michael keaton batman than either val kilmer or george clooney crime fighter bale is batman same way that sean connery was bond long time british actor michael caine makes superb alfred pennyworth but michael gough was no slouch himself four previous batman incarnations unquestionably nolan steps back batman at caped crime busters zenith ending this trilogy capper is odd indeed warner brothers conceivably could make another batman movie based nolans conclusion dark knight rises anybody who tries top dark knight rises will have lot prove both artistically financially christopher nolan is batman movies what james cameron was terminator movies stepping into nolans shoes will pose supreme challenge whoever dares nolan approached batman franchise with reverence played plots as close straight as possible shunned clever one liners dark knight rises surpasses both batman begins origin movie dark knight dark knight rises takes franchise brink annihilation with what amounts gotham city armageddon batman contends with two worthy opponents that played part his origins most obvious villain is bane hulking brute man he looks like cross between wrestler equivalent human pit bulldog bane wears contraption over his face that enables him handle pain life basically we never see british actor tom hardys face because he conceals it with mask interestingly this imbues bane with mystery furthermore bane speaks through this contraption he sounds quite avuncular other words he doesnt sound as menacing as darth vader but he doesnt mince words finally former disney princess anne hathaway makes willowy cat woman just as marvel people had trouble getting hulk right dc people have experienced similar trouble getting catwoman right anne hathaway makes perfect catwoman sheer spectacle dark knight rises dwarfs dark knight eight years has elapsed since murder harvey dent disappearance caped crusader guests at wayne manor make remarks about tragic figure skulking about balcony distance bruce wayne christian bale terminator salvation has turned into contemporary howard hughes he is amazed when he catches burglar his side mansion moreover she is delectable burglar she has cracked waynes safe stolen his mothers pearls since gotham city is largely safe now authorities are not prepared when gang assaults wall street tries plunge economy chaos batman makes triumphant return top form with new gadget that resembles mini helicopter initially batman has no trouble licking his adversaries against catwoman he seems vulnerable she likes let him down when he confronts bane batmans gauntleted fists exert no more effect him than they would bag cement indeed commissioner gordon gary oldman fifth element is back case he knows truth about harvey dent even if he doesnt know identity batman if you missed either or both batman begins dark knight you may find yourself expositional purgatory nolans batman trilogy fits snugly together aside change casting between batman begins dark knight when maggie gyllenhaal replaced katie holmes as rachel dawes district attorneys office dark knight rises packs caped crusader into exile bane batters him into submission nolan takes not only gotham city limit but also he takes audiences limit with actioneer that clocks at 164 minutes nevertheless dark knight rises qualifies as best batman movie ever,0.4465427383074439,0.0915249129955012,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,It was okay...,"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story.",it was okay,best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is it doesnt leave you frustrated or confused you cant really complain that it didnt explore certain ideas or follow through by deciding have official ending this trilogys story themes surrounding batman are very fresh we dont know where hell end up its not same old thing about whether he can continue be batman or not which was already getting repetitive spider man 2 conclusions are not as important as feelings they invoke as they come about nolan is especially good at capturing complete tension actually not knowing what will happen deeply questioning what you want happen why this movie is bigger than previous two far more ambitious there are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films general especially blockbuster action movies all nolans movies have deep psychological themes this takes those another new direction i thought inception was hugely original insightful about way people think that level abstraction depth is present this film bane bursts into it his reputation is quickly established nolan uses peoples expectations anticipation fullest we are left wonder about what has happened 8 years since events dark knight why have characters become way they are now latter half it does seem like movie is trying pull off so many different plot points connections but they all work cast is very large impressive you dont see good acting you see fascinating characters theyre just playing their part grand story thats being crafted there are many unfamiliar faces but they all have strange unique look them we often see persons flaws previous decisions coming back haunt them they find out hard way what mistakes they have made where their limits are where they lose control score is almost tribal very raw energetic you dont get much chance pay attention it but many parts movie are pounding with excitement there are countless quotable lines disturbing slices dialogue they cut deep joker was great character this is very different movie but themes are just as dark only perhaps indirectly underneath its very sinister writing efficiency appear be among nolans greatest strengths story has many layers that interweave apparently they came under budget perhaps most important thing about catwoman is that shes completely believable when she beats up men you dont roll your eyes shes feminine powerful her own way she fits into world we completely understand her motivations she doesnt have huge role but very important one i didnt find myself moved but maybe im too cynical i was more affected psychologically curious about humanity all different sides it you see this movie it goes many extremes i felt humbled by my complete lack life experience what do i know about anything how could i possibly understand half characters i havent been through anything or achieved anything compared most them michael caine gets bigger role this time he was always critical but this time hes very much emotional core i thought christian bale was overlooked dark knight especially movies hinge him bruce waynes just man but also incredibly inspirational bales famous completely committing his roles it pays off tom hardy is impressive as bane but i suppose thats no surprise rest leads are similarly awesome there are many references earlier films very few questions are left unanswered its always nice when film makers really think it through make actual decision get all details right so anyway ill miss batman since trilogy has ended but couldnt have hoped better more epic sincere finale his story,0.5468718935385601,0.1730549543049543,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10,"Best Film of 2012, so far!","I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing.

10,A Nutshell Review: The Dark Knight Rises,"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure. With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to.",nutshell review dark knight rises,there are plenty elements that made this film work so i suppose we can tick them off one by one starters continuation focus bruce waynes story which has made it all tick this version bruce wayne alfred become familiar characters were accustomed with since 2005 film invests heavily emotional bonding between two which deals back theme about fear that rears its ugly head again how father figure cannot stand idly by watch one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after long hiatus hoping life normalcy with mantle bat given up michael caine may have shorter screen time than before but no less powerful when sam raimi had put popular powerful venom into spider man 3 pretty much against his wishes we all knew how that turned out be effectively killing off franchise until decision reboot it there may be some similar fears with introduction fairly contemporary villain bane but story gave him more purpose meaning tom hardy was excellent par none this role as compete villain with plenty brawn merciless masterful with plan any terrorist would be proud if scarecrow meant induce fear joker create chaos bane is carnage incarnate tom hardy even being requisite mask is fearful while designs his plan may dwarf jokers complexity it sure rivaled his terms delivery execution anyone his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences anyone alive is only because there is further use no hesitation no compromise nolan continues with introduction lot more villains big small behind mask or otherwise his bat films than anyone would credit him especially when having those whose lines are blurred or corrupt core hiding behind social status fortune this turn provides another arc that boils underneath main narrative where rich powerful continue enjoy their successes at expense have nots occupy movement way being very real parallel proceedings screen while mobsters were clearly at top food chain earlier nolan films this one shifted focus politicians elite community with their fair share scandals corporate greed while bane was point selina kyle played by anne hathaway is both sensual force be reckoned with herself being like how shes best portrayed fence theres bit frank millers year one this one given presence juno temples holly back basics as jewel thief compared mousy secretary tim burtons batman returns with michelle pfeiffer defining role garbage that was halle berrys anne hathaway nailed this one with what would be truly memorable outing as if homage sorts burtons second batman film that repartee between bruce wayne selina kyle at party became one highlights here as does her thievery combat ability she may lack her whip but more than makes up it with her steel stiletto heels very sensual sleekly designed feline moves that youd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit not only is technology put screen fictionally impressive technical aspects behind scenes also worked wonders chalking up serious mileage having more than hours worth footage shot imax format wally pfisters cinematography continues impress with that staying consistent gritty look feel developed all bat films date before his departure into film directors role his next project hans zimmer also probably developed best score nolans bat films i dare say without which this film would be less stellar with score playing huge role adding plenty character emotion film lifting it up with excitement during many set action pieces with recognizable themes assigned major players heightening dangers providing boost many feelings this one heck action adventure with how things developed at end what i felt was initial horror sorts with batman out broad daylight secret identity being porous all this film ended what would be best way possible with possibilities twinkle eye inception style with did it or did it not twists turns surprises sleight hand making it clear favourite as one best this year do yourself favour watch it imax format just as it was intended because you have just got believe christopher nolan kind films he has so far delivered take bow bat crew trilogy that has now set bar any comic book film especially any other follow batman movie reboot or otherwise live up,0.5257221299372461,0.17276502567200236,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9,Really Good End to Nolan's Great Trilogy,"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.9/10",really good end nolans great trilogy,dark knight rises is third final instalment christopher nolans groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped superhero genre as we know it main cast return as well as some newcomers tom hardy as bane anne hathaway as selina joseph gordon levitt as blake marion cotillard as miranda new additions are fantastic especially tom hardy he brings menacing presence character finally incorporates main part his comic counterpart his brains sure bane is incredibly strong but he is also unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down batman whilst also using his strength defeat him hardy displays all this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face mask he wears makes him more frightening is used as interesting plot device later film lot people criticised voice that hardy uses this character but personally i love it i think adds mystery figure best acting comes michael caine as alfred pennyworth nolan really fleshes out alfred bruces relationship this film caine plays reluctant mentor figure perfectly one his final scenes really shows off his acting regret that alfred pours out its heartbreaking whilst all other actors are great caine excels this movie compared batman begins dark knight writing is brilliant so many twists turns sensational ending that really brings trilogy full circle has great ending bruces arc dialogue is excellent particular many bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character fight choreography improves massively is loads better than last two films hanz zimmers score is superb works all scenes that it features also cinematography is beautiful wally pfister who has worked with nolan throughout trilogy really peaks this picture however this movie isnt perfect banes final demise is very underwhelming especially character that makes as much impact as he does finally twist at end with blake feels tacked is inaccurate source material overall i love this movie sure it doesnt live up heights dark knight but it is still exceptional was stunning way end this unbelievable series films 9 10,0.609576231060606,0.29232559974747474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,Stunning Conclusion to an Epic Trilogy,"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10""",stunning conclusion epic trilogy,not being huge fan superhero movies i didnt have much expectations batman begins however viewing 2005 christopher nolan production i was pleasantly shocked then after my huge expectations dark knight christopher nolan blew my expectations dust will same happen with 3rd last film dark knight rises quite simply yes my big expectations were once again blown away what production this is true cinematic experience behold movie exceeded my expectations terms action entertainment editing sound score visuals direction action are all top notch film contains fine cast talented actors christian bale course still makes is great batman michael cain is fantastic as he always is he gives such powerful performance he really ought be considered oscar nomination tom hardy as bane is utterly terrifying at times completely ominous anne hathaway as catwoman selina kyle is scene stealer she is completely engrossing everyone is so great dynamic scenes between actors are so well done so well written so well directed dark knight rises is is emotionally riveting amazing view at running time almost 3 hours film never becomes dull which is pretty impressive movies action sequences are spectacularly well created very intense dialogue between characters are intelligent highly believable movies soundtrack is terrific really exemplifys many movies scenes extremely well editing sound use really develop many movies action scenes so its not just explosions visuals like many other movies nolan creates grand dirty engrossing world his action sequences just hum conclusion this film is gorgeous reminder that great writing direction can enhance any movie going experience even superhero movies which are usually thought as mindless entertainment i am wholly satisfied with christopher nolans vision thank all who worked this film bringing such intricate interpretation its very famous literary source i cannot recommend this film anymore than i have i just have say everyone anyone should see it 10 10,0.559084249084249,0.22438461538461538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,Head to head with Dark Knight,"After watching Dark Knight Rises I concluded that if there is anybody who can make kick-ass sequels its Nolan. The film contains everything, from brilliant acting, raw action, out of the world one-liners and amazing cinematography. It is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants ""Deshi Deshi Basura Basura"" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it.",head head with dark knight,after watching dark knight rises i concluded that if there is anybody who can make kick ass sequels its nolan film contains everything brilliant acting raw action out world one liners amazing cinematography it is already very hard make sequel film which was just good enough hit but make sequel film which will always be remembered as best you have do very impeccable job that is what is done this movie beginning end you have some very beautiful emotional scenes like mob fight between police thugs rise batman prison chants deshi deshi basura basura towards end where alfred bruce see each other probably last time both know that he has made it,0.5270232371794872,0.26500400641025645,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10,End of a Trilogy and legend,"The Dark Knight Rises was an outstanding end to what has been the best trilogy I have ever seen.The film to me sums up what the batman stands for, the belief that someone can turn their leaf and become better, the belief that the fear that posses a person can be be destroyed or even help that person rise. what Christopher Nolan has given us in The Dark Knight Rises is not a lazy movie, it's a movie that makes the audience think because for me i had to watch the film many times until i have fully understand what has happened, and isn't that what makes a good movie when we have to watch it again and again and again.lets move on to the acting and the star man Christian Bale who again amazes me with his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, because even though we don't see a lot of the dark knight i personally am okay with that because i like seeing the real Bruce Wayne dealing with problems without the batman costume. another star man was Tom Hardy as Bane, ""scary"" yes, ""intimidating"" yes, ""witty"" yes and this list can go on. the thing that tipped it was that we can only see his eyes, to me he was only acting with his menacing eyes that just captivates any audience. Anne Hathaway as catwomen was a perfect cast as she brings the zing to the film, she's elegant and yet sexy at the same time, which was perfect casting. perfect casting all round including obviously Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake (robin).The Dark Knight Rises give audiences nearly three hours of pure excitement, for me i wanted it to continue for another three hours, the film was so good i had to watch the next day because it had every element of what makes a good batman film, such as the villain (bane) because he was the physical match for batman not like the other phenomenal batman films which was more psychotic villains. a good love story that doesn't bore the audience and a great ending. overall this was the ultimate ending to an ultimate trilogy which is a must watch. once again Christopher Nolan has done something special.",end trilogy legend,dark knight rises was outstanding end what has been best trilogy i have ever seen film me sums up what batman stands belief that someone can turn their leaf become better belief that fear that posses person can be be destroyed or even help that person rise what christopher nolan has given us dark knight rises is not lazy movie its movie that makes audience think because me i had watch film many times until i have fully understand what has happened isnt that what makes good movie when we have watch it again again again lets move acting star man christian bale who again amazes me with his portrayal bruce wayne because even though we dont see lot dark knight i personally am okay with that because i like seeing real bruce wayne dealing with problems without batman costume another star man was tom hardy as bane scary yes intimidating yes witty yes this list can go thing that tipped it was that we can only see his eyes me he was only acting with his menacing eyes that just captivates any audience anne hathaway as catwomen was perfect cast as she brings zing film shes elegant yet sexy at same time which was perfect casting perfect casting all round including obviously joseph gordon levitt as blake robin dark knight rises give audiences nearly three hours pure excitement me i wanted it continue another three hours film was so good i had watch next day because it had every element what makes good batman film such as villain bane because he was physical match batman not like other phenomenal batman films which was more psychotic villains good love story that doesnt bore audience great ending overall this was ultimate ending ultimate trilogy which is must watch once again christopher nolan has done something special,0.5834627329192548,0.23198757763975159,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.2}"
9,"Sometimes predictable, but often astonishing","Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn.",sometimes predictable but often astonishing,christopher nolans stunning conclusion his batman trilogy is welcome return form after slightly overrated dark knight which was so obsessed with being all dark brooding that it forgot tell much story despite presence much hyped lamented heath ledger cast i found that film be less entertaining than batman begins although it still remains engaging watchable film dark knight rises horrible title by way though blows it out water offering piece sheer spectacle thats as involving as tightly plotted as you could wish its eight years since last film christian bales bruce wayne is nowadays retired definitely feeling his age before long though hulking brute bad guy tom hardy whose sheer physicality role will surprise nobody whos seen bronson decides do some very unpleasant things city so its time dust off bat suit get back into action good news viewer as usual nolan surpasses conventions his genre making this superhero film that looks nothing like superhero film instead more like modern day epic dramatic cinema yes at end day its still about suited guys beating hell out each other nolan once again relies old conventions clich s such as ticking bomb trope which hes repeated his last three films now see him through but everyone runs so well so smoothly that you end up not minding cast is thorough involved as ever bale as usual going extra mile portray tortured hero caine lending emotional support as alfred hardys villain is sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene hes nolan brings back couple his favourites inception marion cotillard joseph gordon levitt good measure theres not quite as much action as you might expect film this type but storyline is so involved that you dont care throw plenty stunning special effects into mix you have real crowd pleaser film with real brain as well as brawn,0.45969742063492075,0.04045634920634921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,The Grand Experience,"Christopher Nolan reinvents Batman in a powerful and much darker way. Batman Begins is a gripping and compelling origin of the hero. The Dark Knight is a lot more serious, realistic, and powerful Batman movie. The Dark Knight Rises is the last of the series. It is ought to be larger and better. It does succeed to be the biggest of the rest of the series. Although, it's not as as superior as The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises is still a fantastic and grand cinematic experience.Every sequel gets bigger and bigger. The threats are getting worse and worse. The Dark Knight Rises is more than just big stuff. There is always suspense that keeps the movie exciting. The best thing about the action is it's not about being pretentiously cool, but it is made to give you anxiety to the fights of Batman between the enemy. Tom Hardy nailed it as Bane. He brings a lot of fear and menace to it. It's different to The Joker but Bane is an intriguing villain.Most of the movie is the anarchy in Gotham and Bruce Wayne's suffering. There isn't much action fighting in those scenes. What matters here is how you can feel the danger of the characters. The chaotic turn of Gotham really looks bleak and gloomy that makes you think everybody is doomed. Compelling and heartbreaking emotions is always there.Much credit goes to Christopher Nolan. Despite of its almost three hour runtime, the film is well fast paced and completely entertaining. His action scenes are totally different to the action scenes of movies these days. He's focused to the thrills than looking cool. Some fistfights can be a little underwhelming, but he's best at the chase scenes. The CGI is obviously good and not excessive.The Dark Knight Rises is a lot more daring than anyone would expect. It's one of those superhero movies that cares more to heroism than just action. The scale is large and it is so explosive. That is the usual formula of all blockbusters, but here, it uses it in a darker and suspenseful way. The Dark Knight Rises is just beyond your expectations. It's also a fitting end of this amazing trilogy. I still think The Dark Knight is the best of the three. That movie is something you can't compare to any other film. Even this and Batman Begins.

10,The Perfect Conclusion to a Perfect Trilogy!,"Christopher Nolan's ambitious Batman trilogy has come to a close with perhaps one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Both Batman Begins and the Dark Knight were cinematic masterpieces and are complimented nicely with this film, The Dark Knight Rises. Being the longest film in the series, it has incredible set pieces, a sinister villain, excellent acting, a loud and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer, and lots of emotional depth.Nolan's film takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne has moved into seclusion. Regarding Gotham, crime has been suppressed with the Dent laws, but now a new force led by the notorious Bane is threatening to take control over Gotham. So is it time for Bruce to give his cowl and cape another shot? This film has a plethora of characters so events may be confusing at time(which it wasn't for me.) Christian Bale as always is near perfect as Batman and he adds some emotional depth to his eccentricity. Michael Caine has a bigger role here and has some of the biggest, most emotion-filled dialogue of the film. While different in stature from the Joker, Tom Hardy makes a great Bane and reminds me greatly of Hannibal. Both Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return and are amazing. I didn't think Anne Hathaway as Catwoman would be effective, but I was proved wrong. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings his talent as well as a few surprises to the film.Overall, this is an amazing ending to the greatest superhero trilogy. Some of the set pieces are just amazing and incredible to watch. The football stadium, the opening sequence with the airplanes, and the takeover of the stock exchange were just a few of my favorite sequences. But nothing competes with that amazing, action-packed finale. Some people may not like the ending at all, but I think it's a fair way to end the film.

10,The Citizen Kane of superhero movies,"Apologies, Dominus, I have done many reviews here but to get this one right took me 5 years and multiple re-watchings.Conclusion? Not merely great, but the ""great-est"" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.Bale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.So why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.Ordinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.Like an orchestra reaching a crescendo.Not so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.The Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.It is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever.",citizen kane superhero movies,apologies dominus i have done many reviews here but get this one right took me 5 years multiple re watchings conclusion not merely great but great est superhero film all time story is iconic majestic scope script not merely good it borders perfection performances are nothing less than stunning bale oldman could not give bad performance even if you asked them hathaway has never looked this good her height frame infusing her catwoman with vibe never seen before or since almost invisible tom hardy one greatest actors our age btw makes bane as interesting character if not moreso than even darth vader himself so why did this review take me 5 years discover dissonance between three parts trilogy which is only flaw achilles heel boxed set ordinarily trilogy should be harmonious consistent look at original lord rings as best example each part not only stands its own but taken sequence story builds characters become clearer everything works conclusion like orchestra reaching crescendo not so here whole is weakened by sum parts batman begins is frankly sloppy great ideas even great performances are lost weak narrative with unsatisfying conclusion dark knight has become iconic its own right but not because way it continues story but rather because amazing one kind performance by ledger it is only when we get part 3 that we achieve perfection this film is not merely better than than first two it may be best film its genre ever,0.6260884353741497,0.2739455782312925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1,"Lazy, incoherent, and unsatisfying on nearly every level.","What makes things worse, is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius, but TDKR lacks essentially everything that made The Dark Knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced. On top of all this, everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's ""supposed"" to be great, right?!?! How could Nolan's finale not be a masterpiece?! Well, I'll tell you...Bruce Wayne acts out-of-character from not just the first two movies, but from the comic as well. Catwoman's motivation and place in the story is weak, flat, and forced. For a movie that's almost three hours long, you only get about 20 minutes of Batman in costume (if you're lucky). The movie jumps in weird time increments that are mildly confusing, but mostly forced to facilitate its wanna-be epic nature. As for more heavily SPOILERY observations...Commissioner Gordon is barely in the movie, spending most his time injured in a hospital, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character comes out of the blue and does what you'd expect the Commissioner to be doing... solution- COMBINE THE TWO CHARACTERS!!! The two Batman vs. Bane fights are flat and boring as hell. Bane is a cardboard, unexplored (until a late-third act flashback... of all ridiculous cliché plot devices) character that reaches for sympathy in one of the most embarrassing, wanna-be-tender, totally out-of-place, extremely laughable scenes I've ever seen in my life- HE FRIGGIN' CRIES?!!?!? Every single, yes EVERY SINGLE cop in Gotham marches down into the sewers on a tip that Bane's raising a secret army, only to have all the entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there... for like three months. Reread that last sentence and tell me what part of it makes sense.Bane holds Gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device, after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city, for three months and the U.S. government does nothing. Seriously, nothing. It's said they negotiated a truce and had FEMA send in supplies for survival. Read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.The ""real"" villain reveals him/her self in an absurd Act 3 ""twist"" that's followed by a narrated flashback (the same one that leads to Bane CRYING), and throughout the entire monologue Batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust/held into his side.After the 2nd lame Bats/Bane fight, the bulk of the late Act 3rd ""action sequence"" consists of little more than Batman flying around in that weird-looking clunky flying thing that supposed to be the Bat Plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky ""plane"" couldn't have possibly eluded.I really, really, really, really, really, really wanted to not just like this, but LOVE it, but as it progressed the enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared to the point of my being utterly flabberghasted in disappointment- mostly because I can't believe the director of The Dark Knight and the masterpiece that is Inception was responsible for this movie. It's lazy and uninspired to the point of being offensive to everyone who's ever been not just a Batman fan, but a fan of non- intelligence-insulting movies.",lazy incoherent unsatisfying nearly every level,what makes things worse is that its predecessors were basically intricate works genius but tdkr lacks essentially everything that made dark knight particularly one greatest superhero movies ever produced top all this everyones bandwagoning thinking its great because its supposed be great right how could nolans finale not be masterpiece well ill tell you bruce wayne acts out character not just first two movies but comic as well catwomans motivation place story is weak flat forced movie thats almost three hours long you only get about 20 minutes batman costume if youre lucky movie jumps weird time increments that are mildly confusing but mostly forced facilitate its wanna be epic nature as more heavily spoilery observations commissioner gordon is barely movie spending most his time injured hospital while joseph gordon levitts character comes out blue does what youd expect commissioner be doing solution combine two characters two batman vs bane fights are flat boring as hell bane is cardboard unexplored until late third act flashback all ridiculous clich plot devices character that reaches sympathy one most embarrassing wanna be tender totally out place extremely laughable scenes ive ever seen my life he friggin cries every single yes every single cop gotham marches down into sewers tip that banes raising secret army only have all entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there like three months reread that last sentence tell me what part it makes sense bane holds gotham hostage with 4 megaton nuclear device after blowing up all but one bridge leading into out city three months u s government does nothing seriously nothing its said they negotiated truce had fema send supplies survival read that last paragraph tell me what part it makes sense real villain reveals him her self absurd act 3 twist thats followed by narrated flashback same one that leads bane crying throughout entire monologue batman sits there doing nothing after knife has been thrust held into his side after 2nd lame bats bane fight bulk late act 3rd action sequence consists little more than batman flying around that weird looking clunky flying thing that supposed be bat plane half which is him outmaneuvering missiles that bulky plane couldnt have possibly eluded i really really really really really really wanted not just like this but love it but as it progressed enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared point my being utterly flabberghasted disappointment mostly because i cant believe director dark knight masterpiece that is inception was responsible this movie its lazy uninspired point being offensive everyone whos ever been not just batman fan but fan non intelligence insulting movies,0.5184985866492716,-0.04950804522722331,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1,Godawful on a Grand Scale...,"Hundreds of millions of dollars, and the best they can do is yet another bloated episode of a TV cop show??? The first hour or 90 minutes of this talking heads marathon plays out like a segment of LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND BORING. Maybe the Nolans haven't gotten the news, yet, but We ain't all that fond of watching the Rich wallow in their Riches over here. Where was the guy we came to see- the guy with the black leather body armor and the cape? Doing his impression of Howard Huge! Really? THAT'S what we came to see? (Not that that really matters: Batman gets outed yet again in this installment. Little wonder he doesn't bother to suit up...) Nolan's idea of an Occupy Movement says a lot, I think: the VILLAINS take over City Hall (or whatever it is in this monstrously slow-moving movie) and are set upon at film's end by Gotham's finest like peaceful protesters at a sit-in. The guy who plays Bane seems to be channeling Sean Connery, and Catwoman transmorgriphies, finally, into Batwoman. At least the worst-designed Batmobile in the 70-plus year history of the character has been laid to rest (not to mention the aerodynamically unsound piece of flying wreckage that's supposed to be the Batplane). (I've always thought that SPAWN was by far the worst-designed comic book character in comic book history- a mish-mash of ideas lifted from Spider-man and Doctor Strange-and a character whose name was ripped off from a Jack Kirby NEW GODS story- but the Batmobile in this trilogy made me step back and reevaluate things. Batman's wheels in these films look like slabs of scrap metal haphazardly fused or magnetized together. Hopefully, we've seen the last of them.) For future reference: filmmakers, if we pay money to see a super-hero movie, it's because we want to see the super-hero- NOT his UNsuper-heroic alter ego.

1,An Abject Failure...,"A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills. Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is. Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie. And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible. The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie. Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS! 1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a ""real world"" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end. 5. ""Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.""6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing.

3,"Boys, Playing It Cool -- Bruce","One star for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fresh and believable take on the rookie cop with street smarts, ideals and courage.One star for Anne Hathaway's purr-fect performance as the Catwoman.One star for an aging Michael Caine, in memory of the man who was a king.Beyond that, it's all a murky sea of meaningless explosions, sodden speeches, missed opportunities, and plot holes you could drive the Batmobile through.Some lowlights include . . .A super villain who mumbles so much he might just as well have a sock in his mouth. And speaking of laundry, why can't Bane afford an undershirt? A doctor who explains in clinical detail, with X-rays, exactly why Bruce Wayne can't fight anymore. Just so his fight scenes will feel even more fake than they already did.A pointless half hour in a phony-looking prison in some make believe foreign country where guys walk around all day clapping and chanting. Cool Hand Luke, this ain't. I really didn't care if Bruce Wayne climbed out of that stupid hole with a rope -- but then, the guards didn't seem to care much either. (""Climbin' out of here, boss!"" ""Yeah, Bruce, climb on out of there."") All I wanted was for Bruce to ""prove"" himself by eating fifty eggs, like in the Paul Newman classic. And at the end he could send the boys a postcard of him back in Gotham City, wearing a custom-made suit, with his arms around Miranda and Selena Kyle. And the card could just say, ""Boys, playing it cool -- Bruce.""A staggering total of 3000 cops trapped in a sewer for three months -- yet they all emerge in clean uniforms, in good health, ready to beat Bane's minions in a good old-fashioned street brawl.
