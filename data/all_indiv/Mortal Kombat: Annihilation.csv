3.0,"An annihilation of the series. The tag line itself states, ""destroy all expectations"". We have James Remar doing lots of wire fu.","I had seen bits n pieces of it in the early 2k on a cable tv channel.Saw the entire movie recently on a fast forward mode.This is the second installment in the Mortal Kombat film series based on the video game and the story picks up immediately after the last film ended.While the first part was at least entertaining, this one is sheer lousy.We have James Remar's body double doing all the wire fu stunts and unlike Christopher Lambert, James Remar got bored with his long hair n white monk gown. He does a crop cut n wears a designer waist coat n military boots.I found Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade more attractive than the previous part's gal.Talisa Soto who played Kitana is only 4 years younger to Musetta Vander who played Kitana's mother.

2.0,Mortal Kumquat,"By all that's Holy! A film that made me cringe the whole way through! Dear Lord how the studio bosses must have laughed as they counted the money that they made off this turkey. Now, I thought the first MK was an OK film, great soundtrack, OK acting and plenty of fighting. A good no-brainer actioner. But this....this....defies belief.How on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings? It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson! The actors playing the bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful to watch, expecially the centaur guy. He exuded ham to a level I've not seen before.The special effects were truly special, but only in a ""special needs"" kind of way. Looks like they were lifted straight from the video game itself. Laugh as you watch something resembling a dragon perform martial arts very badly. Laugh as Brian Thompson turns into a......thing. Laugh at the terrible lack of detail in it all. Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and laugh again, right up until they slap the straightjacket on you and cart you off to the loony bin. Because only someone truly demented would want to sit through this terrible, terrible film. Eh? What's that Doc? Yes, I know I sat through it. But it was all in the name of science, you see. I was doing research. By the way, you couldn't loosen this jacket a bit, could you?Anyway, as I say, the best actor was Brian Thompson. Only he saved it from getting a 1, but even then, the rest prevented it from getting any more than a 2.Avoid it if you value your sanity!",mortal kumquat,by all thats holy film that made me cringe whole way through dear lord how studio bosses must have laughed as they counted money that they made off this turkey now i thought first mk was ok film great soundtrack ok acting plenty fighting good no brainer actioner but this this defies belief how earth can you get such bunch wooden actors together still manage hide all strings it comes something when you look at film can honestly say best actor it is brian thompson actors playing bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful watch expecially centaur guy he exuded ham level ive not seen before special effects were truly special but only special needs kind way looks like they were lifted straight video game itself laugh as you watch something resembling dragon perform martial arts very badly laugh as brian thompson turns into thing laugh at terrible lack detail it all laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh again right up until they slap straightjacket you cart you off loony bin because only someone truly demented would want sit through this terrible terrible film eh whats that doc yes i know i sat through it but it was all name science you see i was doing research by way you couldnt loosen this jacket bit could you anyway as i say best actor was brian thompson only he saved it getting 1 but even then rest prevented it getting any more than 2 avoid it if you value your sanity,0.48974358974358967,0.14120879120879115,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie in the Realm of Known Existence,"I made the mistake of going to see this movie, first show, first day, in the theater, in 1997 when it was released. The first movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was fun. I expected more with the 2nd. The only thing I knew about it going in was that James Remar was replacing Christopher Lambert as Rayden, which I was upset about, but I thought Remar would do a good job.Boy, was I wrong. The whole cast, even Robin Shou, who was decent in the 1st, and great in Beverly Hills Ninja, can't seem to act his way out of a paper bag in this one.*** Mega Spoilers, Cause You Shouldn't See This Movie Anyway ***The big mistake the writers made with this movie, was trying to incorporate all of the characters, even the hidden ones, from not just Mortal Kombat 2, but Mortal Kombat 3 as well. (The plot is taken from the MK3 video game). MK1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3, a trio, a team, and their ""teacher"" Raiden. And only 2 bad guys (Goro, Shang Tsung). In MK2, we have a virtual plethora of heroes and baddies.Heroes (8): Liu Kang/Rayden/Kitana/Sonya/Jax/Johnny Cage/Nightwolf/Sub ZeroBaddies (14): Shao Kahn, Shinnok, Sindel, Motaro, Jade, Sheeva, Cyrax, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Ermac, Rain, Baraka, Smoke, and Mileena.Yeah, I thought that was a lot too. All of these characters have lines and/or fight scenes too. This doesn't even include the characters from the games that are mentioned, but not shown. A bunch of these baddies (and even some heroes) die or just leave, never to return, in about a minute after they appear. For instance, here's the plot of some of the sub characters:Rain: Says hi, gets thrown into a fiery pit.Sub Zero: Shows up, says hi, fights and kills botty Smoke, tells Liu Kang ""you are not ready"", then disappears, never to be heard from again. Smoke: Killed within a 2 minutes by aforementioned Sub Zero.Baraka: er.. I think you see him.. once.Mileena: Shows up, attacks Sonya, somehow dies from a bonk on the head.Scorpion: Shows up, fights Sub-Zero, kidnaps Kitana, disappears.Johnny Cage: Shows up, says hi, Shao Kahn breaks his neck a good minute into the movie. Sheeva: Has a few lines early, Liu Kang kills her in under 10 seconds in her first fight.Those are just some examples. On top of these character issues, the entire movie seems to have been filmed on the first take. There are literally *tons* of continuity and placement errors. A few quick examples, all from the same 10 minute stretch:Rayden leaves Sonya, and tells her to find her buddy Jaz, then to head to ""The Temple of the Elder Gods"". Of course, after she finds Jax, she immediately knows where it is.When we first meet His Jaxness himself, he punches into a wall trying to kill Cyrax. We pan away with his fist somehow stuck in a wall with a good inch of space around it. We pan back a few seconds later, and his entire arm is stuck in the wall.Sonya gets into a muddy fan-service fight with Mileena. After a muddy battle, and a split scene later, all her clothes have somehow been drycleaned.During aforementioned Muddy Fan-Service fight, Sonya gets thrown into a rock. This big rock, about 10 times the size of her, waggles and moves a bit with her weight falling on it. Again, those are just some examples, but they're *rampant* in the movie. As for the plot, well, the idea and premise is interesting, but they delve way too deep into it. It would have been better if they kept it superficial, the way they did in the first movie. But, no, they had to try to explain everything: life, existence, the tournament, and why the toast always lands butter side down.The result of all this atrocity is a corny, poorly directed, aterribly written, underbudgeted (looks like most of the stuff *I* could have pulled off with my home computer) nightmare that's worth buying solely to laugh at. 0/10",quite possibly worst movie realm known existence,i made mistake going see this movie first show first day theater 1997 when it was released first movie wasnt bad it wasnt great but it was fun i expected more with 2nd only thing i knew about it going was that james remar was replacing christopher lambert as rayden which i was upset about but i thought remar would do good job boy was i wrong whole cast even robin shou who was decent 1st great beverly hills ninja cant seem act his way out paper bag this one mega spoilers cause you shouldnt see this movie anyway big mistake writers made with this movie was trying incorporate all characters even hidden ones not just mortal kombat 2 but mortal kombat 3 as well plot is taken mk3 video game mk1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3 trio team their teacher raiden only 2 bad guys goro shang tsung mk2 we have virtual plethora heroes baddies heroes 8 liu kang rayden kitana sonya jax johnny cage nightwolf sub zerobaddies 14 shao kahn shinnok sindel motaro jade sheeva cyrax scorpion noob saibot ermac rain baraka smoke mileena yeah i thought that was lot too all these characters have lines or fight scenes too this doesnt even include characters games that are mentioned but not shown bunch these baddies even some heroes die or just leave never return about minute after they appear instance heres plot some sub characters rain says hi gets thrown into fiery pit sub zero shows up says hi fights kills botty smoke tells liu kang you are not ready then disappears never be heard again smoke killed within 2 minutes by aforementioned sub zero baraka er i think you see him once mileena shows up attacks sonya somehow dies bonk head scorpion shows up fights sub zero kidnaps kitana disappears johnny cage shows up says hi shao kahn breaks his neck good minute into movie sheeva has few lines early liu kang kills her under 10 seconds her first fight those are just some examples top these character issues entire movie seems have been filmed first take there are literally tons continuity placement errors few quick examples all same 10 minute stretch rayden leaves sonya tells her find her buddy jaz then head temple elder gods course after she finds jax she immediately knows where it is when we first meet his jaxness himself he punches into wall trying kill cyrax we pan away with his fist somehow stuck wall with good inch space around it we pan back few seconds later his entire arm is stuck wall sonya gets into muddy fan service fight with mileena after muddy battle split scene later all her clothes have somehow been drycleaned during aforementioned muddy fan service fight sonya gets thrown into rock this big rock about 10 times size her waggles moves bit with her weight falling it again those are just some examples but theyre rampant movie as plot well idea premise is interesting but they delve way too deep into it it would have been better if they kept it superficial way they did first movie but no they had try explain everything life existence tournament why toast always lands butter side down result all this atrocity is corny poorly directed aterribly written underbudgeted looks like most stuff i could have pulled off with my home computer nightmare thats worth buying solely laugh at 0 10,0.3968621399176956,0.08569958847736625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,"So not ""Toasty!""","Oh, boy, where do I start with this movie? I still want to think that this movie was just an evil joke. The first Mortal Kombat was such a fun high action packed film that was just a great time. I still watch it like crazy today, it's got so much energy and makes me want to play the game again and again. So since the first film was a success, naturally they were going to make a sequel and they did manage to mess this one up badly. I'll start with the ""plot"" first and explain in a moment all the badness that is the mess.The evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld to the Earthrealm and has reclaimed his queen Sindel, who is Kitana's long-dead mother. Earthrealm is therefore in danger of being absorbed into Outworld within six days, a fate which Liu Kang and the others must fight to prevent. Sonya enlists the help of her old partner, Jax , while Kitana and Liu Kang search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf , who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Kitana and Liu Kang dispatch him with the aid of Sub-Zero, but Scorpion suddenly appears, attacks Sub-Zero, and kidnaps Kitana. Now Liu must save her as well as Earth from Kahn who wishes to blend the realms together.I'm sure you've read and heard it before but in case you haven't and you're reading my comment first for some reason to find out what makes this a bad movie, well read away. First off, what bad replacements for the actors: Sonja, Johnny Cage, Rayden. They don't look anything like the original actors, it was just bad. The acting is horrible, like really bad, like they went to the Keanu Reeves school of acting bad. The special effects are something that could be easily done on an elementary school computer. The editing is too fast and gives you a massive headache.There's a mud wrestling match between Sonja and Mileena, which I'm sure the director was telling them it was for the ""cool effect"" of the fight while I'm sure he was playing with his stick shift behind the camera while this was going on. There is no explanation for why Scorpion and Sub Zero are back, except that Sub Zero is Sub Zero's brother, yet they have the same names? Doesn't make much sense does it? The fight scenes are so badly put together, there's a scene where the ninjas look like they're doing ballet, not fighting. Rayden spends so much time talking to the group and finally when he has a chance to fight, he bows out like a coward.Yeah, that's just some of the film that I'm describing. Scary sounding, isn't it? I don't know what they were thinking when they thought that this was OK to put in the theaters. The first film was a lot of fun, it stuck true to the video games and is one of the best video game movies of all time. This just happened to have the characters in a crappy Mortal Kombat ""plot"" that made no sense. Just skip this movie, it's just horrible.1/10",so not toasty,oh boy where do i start with this movie i still want think that this movie was just evil joke first mortal kombat was such fun high action packed film that was just great time i still watch it like crazy today its got so much energy makes me want play game again again so since first film was success naturally they were going make sequel they did manage mess this one up badly ill start with plot first explain moment all badness that is mess evil emperor shao kahn opens portal outworld earthrealm has reclaimed his queen sindel who is kitanas long dead mother earthrealm is therefore danger being absorbed into outworld within six days fate which liu kang others must fight prevent sonya enlists help her old partner jax while kitana liu kang search native american shaman named nightwolf who seemingly knows key defeating kahn kitana liu kang dispatch him with aid sub zero but scorpion suddenly appears attacks sub zero kidnaps kitana now liu must save her as well as earth kahn who wishes blend realms together im sure youve read heard it before but case you havent youre reading my comment first some reason find out what makes this bad movie well read away first off what bad replacements actors sonja johnny cage rayden they dont look anything like original actors it was just bad acting is horrible like really bad like they went keanu reeves school acting bad special effects are something that could be easily done elementary school computer editing is too fast gives you massive headache theres mud wrestling match between sonja mileena which im sure director was telling them it was cool effect fight while im sure he was playing with his stick shift behind camera while this was going there is no explanation why scorpion sub zero are back except that sub zero is sub zeros brother yet they have same names doesnt make much sense does it fight scenes are so badly put together theres scene where ninjas look like theyre doing ballet not fighting rayden spends so much time talking group finally when he has chance fight he bows out like coward yeah thats just some film that im describing scary sounding isnt it i dont know what they were thinking when they thought that this was ok put theaters first film was lot fun it stuck true video games is one best video game movies all time this just happened have characters crappy mortal kombat plot that made no sense just skip this movie its just horrible 1 10,0.5276463700234191,-0.03236924277907883,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.36}"
2.0,"Oh, I'll tell you how bad this movie is, allright","You know, I really liked the original Mortal Kombat. Sure they ripped off the premise from another movie, but at least it was good (Enter the Dragon). I loved the games until the 4th one and was widely known as being one of its best and most devoted followers. So maybe all this is why my then-girlfriend's idiot stoner brother told me that he heard this movie was incredible, and I excitedly went to see it.I'm a patient guy, and I have almost never felt the urge to walk out of a movie due to boredom (Tank Girl is the only other one I recall). But MKA here is a joke. If you really feel the need to see this movie and be surprised, then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead.Here's one right off the bat. MKA isn't a sequel proper to the original Mortal Kombat. The original MK was, reasonably, based on the first game. A couple future characters made cameos, but that's it. So it stands to also reason that MKA would be about the second game, the one most fans widely regard to be the best. But whereas the MK film was made at the time that part 2 was yielding to part 3, a lot changed in the extra couple years it took for this film sequel. As MK the movie was leaving theaters, MK3 the game was getting kind of a lukewarm reception, and people got sicker and sicker of it by the time MK4 came out. By now the games were in 3d and the storyline had gone from basic Enter the Dragon tournaments to all out apocalyptic robot wars and sorcerors controlling the fates of a bunch of new, generic characters. Until its decent reinventing in 2002, the MK games had hit a rough and oversaturated spot and would take 5 years to bounce back.So here in this worst time comes MKA, which skips the best chapter of the games entirely and jumps in at sort of a story junction between the 3rd and 4th games, the worst. So we have characters from all 4 games running around and interacting, which is goofy as it is, and things get worse when sense is tried to be made of it. For example, (spoiler), in maybe the first 2 minutes Johnny Cage, a main character and semi-hero of the first movie, is summarily and unceremoniously killed off. My guess for this is because he wasn't in the 3rd game.Soon after (more spoilers. In fact, there will be several so if you continue, do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA), robots from game 3 come in, negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero, a character killed in the first movie. Leading the attacks by these fiends and others is Shao Kahn, who in the first movie appeared as a giant demonic face in the sky and here appears as....a masculine human being.Making things moe complicated is that elder God Raiden, played by Christopher Lambert in the original, is here played by someone else and seems to not want to fight at all, as the character has gone from wizardly power god to short haired, weasely Power Rangers nerd, giving up his immortality in the process and teaching our heroes a thing or two about friendship and courage. Huh?Sticking things out, unfortunately for them, are Robin Shou and Talisia Soto, who play central characters Liu Kang and Kitana and who've returned from the original film. This time, neither of them are allowed to do anything much more than look shocked at the stupid story developments, and Liu Kang engages in a few fights that capture none of the magic or uniqueness of the original film. And in fact this goes for any fight in this film that I care to remember. In the original, the fights were well choreographed and showcased a good selection of acrobatic and martial arts skill. Action was conveyed through close combat, good angles, and lengthy tradeoffs. And at the very least, there was a genuine moment or two where one might say ""wow, that was a cool move!"". This time, a lot of the action is illusional, with the camera making quick cuts and sudden moves to sort of convey that stuff is going on. There's nary an actual hand-to hand combat scene that lasts more than 30 seconds, and when you see what else was thrown in instead, you'll want to kill someone yourself.For example, remember the character Baraka, with his beast face and bladed arms? He's here, and in fact is joined by several identical others, who assault Liu Kang with their reflective cardboard blades in a high-flying trapeze act straight out of the circus. And what about Sheeva, 4-armed character that should have been the answer to decently done Goro, 4-armed creature of the original film? Well, whereas he was conveyed through puppeteering and animatronics, here Sheeva is played by a tall woman in generic spandex who tries to look menacing and does a couple unthreatening hops with her cheesy extra special effect arms.Things (don't) pick up later on, when Liu Kang randomly encounters Native American character Nightwolf, who explains that Liu must harness his ""animality"" to succeed. Anyone familiar with the MK universe knows that the ""animality"" was a ridiculous player rumor which supposed that the MK games contained a method of killing one's opponent by turning into an animal and committing not a fatality but an ""animality"". This dumb rumor was added to the 3rd game as fan service, and apparently delighted the producers of this film enough that it was actually explained as a real, feasible occurence. ""Feel your animality"", N.Wolf says to Liu, urging him to harness the beast within. Mr. Wolf then briefly shows Liu how to do it, and then asks,""pretty cool, huh?""We who haven't left the room yet are saying ""no"", but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise. At the end of the film, Liu Kang fights with big masculine guy (er, Shao Kahn), and instead of actual wanted fisticuffs, we get to see the two of them feel their animality and turn into giant, god awful stupid computer-generated beasts who do combat with each other. No, I mean it. They turn into giant computer animated beasts. And we're not talking about Gollum of the Lord of the Rings here- I mean big, shiny, plasticy-looking ""we know we want to make big magical creatures but don't yet have the technology to do anything but make them eye-strainingly obvious"" effects. Liu Kang could reasonably have turned into a cool chinese dragon or something, but instead winds up being this big-nosed, cross eyed, dopey dragon thing. Shao Kahn turns into something equally ridiculous and less memorable and the two have it out. Then at the last minute Shao Kahn's sorceror dad decides he's gone too far, disgraced the family name by becoming a crappy visual effect, and makes him disappear or something. Then everyone hugs, and more or less runs far, far away.I hope that this has been an accurate rendering of what my feelings are for this film, because I actually haven't seen it in several years. I don't hate myself enough to watch it more than that. But if you want an actual review without the sarcasm, just look at it this way: It is an insult to the MK franchise and its fans, it fails as a follow-up to the fun original MK film, it fails TERRIBLY as a martial arts film, and in general it just is a dumb waste of time, an arbitrary, thrown-together cash-in sequel. Do yourself a favor and just watch the original, and if you still crave more, go play the games. And if you do insist on seeing this movie, then at the very least inject some fun into it like trying to figure out where those Baraka masks were purchased.",oh ill tell you how bad this movie is allright,you know i really liked original mortal kombat sure they ripped off premise another movie but at least it was good enter dragon i loved games until 4th one was widely known as being one its best most devoted followers so maybe all this is why my then girlfriends idiot stoner brother told me that he heard this movie was incredible i excitedly went see it im patient guy i have almost never felt urge walk out movie due boredom tank girl is only other one i recall but mka here is joke if you really feel need see this movie be surprised then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead heres one right off bat mka isnt sequel proper original mortal kombat original mk was reasonably based first game couple future characters made cameos but thats it so it stands also reason that mka would be about second game one most fans widely regard be best but whereas mk film was made at time that part 2 was yielding part 3 lot changed extra couple years it took this film sequel as mk movie

apocalyptic robot wars sorcerors controlling fates bunch new generic characters until its decent reinventing 2002 mk games had hit rough oversaturated spot would take 5 years bounce back so here this worst time comes mka which skips best chapter games entirely jumps at sort story junction between 3rd 4th games worst so we have characters all 4 games running around interacting which is goofy as it is things get worse when sense is tried be made it example spoiler maybe first 2 minutes johnny cage main character semi hero first movie is summarily unceremoniously killed off my guess this is because he wasnt 3rd game soon after more spoilers fact there will be several so if you continue do at risk ruining wonderful cinematic experience that is mka robots game 3 come negating fact that their sole purpose games was hunt sub zero character killed first movie leading attacks by these fiends others is shao kahn who first movie appeared as giant demonic face sky here appears as masculine human being making things moe complicated is that elder god raiden played by christopher lambert original is here played by someone else seems not want fight at all as character has gone wizardly power god short haired weasely power rangers nerd giving up his immortality process teaching our heroes thing or two about friendship courage huh sticking things out unfortunately them are robin shou talisia soto who play central characters liu kang kitana whove returned original film this time neither them are allowed do anything much more than look shocked at stupid story developments liu kang engages few fights that capture none magic or uniqueness original film fact this goes any fight this film that i care remember original fights were well choreographed showcased good selection

he was conveyed through puppeteering animatronics here sheeva is played by tall woman generic spandex who tries look menacing does couple unthreatening hops with her cheesy extra special effect arms things dont pick up later when liu kang randomly encounters native american character nightwolf who explains that liu must harness his animality succeed anyone familiar with mk universe knows that

2.0,Raiden gets a haircut!,"I saw this film at the cinema the same day as I saw Lost in Space (the new one, with Gary Oldman). By comparison, Lost in Space was high art full of deep metaphysical dilemmas. MK:A is terrible.I loved the Mortal Kombat games, and was pleased to see that MK The Movie was better than Street Fighter II The Movie. Sure, it was a light-on film, but it had some moments and I spent most of my time laughing at the unintentionally bad bits. MK:A makes MK The Movie look sophisticated.The first five minutes basically drops a piano on the head of the first movie - new bad guy, Johnny Cage dies, new heroes appear, minimal explanation. From then on you have a sub-standard martial arts film packed full of cheap costumes on cheap actors following a cliched script. I know there's not a lot of narrative you can squeeze out of a fighting computer game, but surely the writers could have tried a little harder to make something work. Having gone to the movie with a guy who didn't play the games, I had to explain what the hell was going on for the first half (like why is that guy fighting him?) and gave up after that.That said, this movie contains the most unintentionally hilarious moment I have ever seen on film.

1.0,This is probably the worst sequel ever,"The problem with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation isn't that it's stupid, with no significant plot, dialogue or characters. That is undebatably true of Annihilation, but that was also true with the first Mortal Kombat movie, and that was a great movie. The problem is the HUGE let down in the martial arts and special effects scenes. MK had some terrific fight scenes, such as the brilliant Cage/Scorpion fight in the forest, the great Liu Kang/SubZero fight, and the cool finale with Shang Tsung. Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three, many of the fight scenes made no sense, and the finale was horrible. In addition, some things in Annihilation I would really like an explanation for:Why did Raiden dress up like Aladdin half way through the movie? Was looking like a complete dork part of becoming mortal? And where was Christopher Lambert, anyway?What was the third test? Where did that Wolf-guy go? What happened to Sub-Zero?Why did they do that stupid thing with Jax' bionic arms? Stupid movies should admit they are stupid movies. Stupid movies which try to have serious elemends become bad movies.Same deal with Katana's mother.What was point of that huge monster that came out of nowhere to attack Sonya, then immediately went back to it's whole when Jax hit it on the head? Was it a whack-a-mole?How is it that Sonya and Jade began to fight IN A DESERT and they immediately fell into a mud pit?Why did Smoke maticulously break every window in that random building before fighting Sonya and Jax?What was the point of having Liu Kang turn into a dragon? He just turned into a human again, without having done anything effective as a dragon. How was that useful?Why didn't they spend more then $80 on the special effects for that dragon? I could do better then that with miniatures and clay animation.How is it that this movie could have been made so badly, with such bad cinematography and such pathetic martial arts effects, after the first one was so good?",this is probably worst sequel ever,problem with mortal kombat annihilation isnt that its stupid with no significant plot dialogue or characters that is undebatably true annihilation but that was also true with first mortal kombat movie that was great movie problem is huge let down martial arts special effects scenes mk had some terrific fight scenes such as brilliant cage scorpion fight forest great liu kang subzero fight cool finale with shang tsung annihilation didnt have any fight scenes up quality those three many fight scenes made no sense finale was horrible addition some things annihilation i would really like explanation why did raiden dress up like aladdin half way through movie was looking like complete dork part becoming mortal where was christopher lambert anyway what was third test where did that wolf guy go what happened sub zero why did they do that stupid thing with jax bionic arms stupid movies should admit they are stupid movies stupid movies which try have serious elemends become bad movies same deal with katanas mother what was point that huge monster that came out nowhere attack sonya then immediately went back its whole when jax hit it head was it whack mole how is it that sonya jade began fight desert they immediately fell into mud pit why did smoke maticulously break every window that random building before fighting sonya jax what was point having liu kang turn into dragon he just turned into human again without having done anything effective as dragon how was that useful why didnt they spend more then 80 special effects that dragon i could do better then that with miniatures clay animation how is it that this movie could have been made so badly with such bad cinematography such pathetic martial arts effects after first one was so good,0.5839947089947091,-0.017266038359788318,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.22}"

The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.Line example: Kitana: ""My mother is dead."" Sindel: ""As will be her daughter!""

1.0,The Only Summary of This Film!!! *few to mild spoilers*,"I shan't start off by saying ""I used to be an MK fan"", because whenever I read those I want to fetch my violin and start playing. I enjoyed playing the games but was never ""that"" into them. Suffice to say I found the first Mortal Kombat, to be fairly entertaining. Mild stuff really, verging on ""almost could be cool if..."" A real four stars out of ten fiasco, but one that wouldn't offend.MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film. It is tragic. Enough said. This film has nothing going for it. Everything has taken a step backwards.The special effects are woeful. Instead of three characters with mild in-depth studies, they jetisoned that for seven main characters, each with their own personal demons to overcome. Riveting. The script is what I have the most problem with. Pour example:1) A new Raiden. Lambert, gave the role some credibility in the original and was responsible for giving MK a moderate turn over. Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second. So inevitably they had to bring in someone else. The audience knows this. The actors know this. The writers know this. But please don't have the character you created know this. He's supposed to be the same person, so to have him say ""i've had a haircut rar rar"" is a tragic way of saying ""i know i'm not lambert so I did something different"". 2) Robin Shao...Oh Robin. Many nights have been wiled away laughing at his demise from ewokian heights. A tragic actor, only in for his mild kung-fu knowledge, on the premise he could ""act"". Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung (don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun). In this one, he's supposed to hold it all together...and fails miserably. To be fair, again however he has no script with which to work. At one moment, before the ""final confrontation"", it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan. So your characters mantra is ""i want to do it, but i'm not ready"", and you layer over that with dialogue, meanings, symbolism, action etc etc...you don't have your character say those words!!! Talk about a mickey mouse operation. The writers obviously fed up at this point that their obvious talents were wasted on this low budget tripe, so just had the character say it, so they could invariably fit in more ""action"" sequences. 3) Far too many to go into. The fact that everything is figured out so matter of factly. Raiden figures out the ""prophecy"" (don't ask) was a lie. Surely not??? So to explain this travesty of events he claims ""they must of lied to me"". Bravo. Many nights burning the midnight oil for that one huh? It is all too, ""it is so because it is so""The special effects truly are tragic. The only ones in the original were Sub Zero's Ice Blast, which in fairness was quite tastefully done if you are a hardcore fan. Scorpions ""get over here"", which is always a crowd favourite. Reptile, and Lui Kangs dragon punch (goro was Plasticine). But here they've wanted to go over the top with not nearly enough money. Sindels spinning to escape is woeful. Scorpions ""get over here"" is a pitiful remake (which also reminds me, Sub and Scorp are back, the two greatest characters ever, and yet they're midgets. About half the size from the original, looks as if they've been on three simultaneous atkins diets), and everything else is shambolic.The action skips from one scene to the next, but nothing grabs the eye. Raidens fight against three reptile is the closest thing to stylish or anyway near the premise of ""cool"". But it is still a long way away. To dispense with the formalities.

1.0,More ridiculous than the first film and worse in almost every way imaginable,"Having won the battle of the realms in the first film, Liu Kang (Robin Shou) and others enjoy a short period of peace on Earth. Then one day leader of the outer realm Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) opens up a portal between the two realms and announces that he intends to merge the two realms in six days. With time ticking away, can Liu Kang and his crew stop Shao Kahn in time? I didn't care much for the first film, but curiosity got the better of me so I decided that I'd give the sequel a shot (really just to see if it's as bad as its rating suggests, and sadly it is).The first film had a storyline that was quite poorly developed, but it wasn't totally ridiculous. Here we basically have a 'world domination' storyline in place because the outer realm lost the battle with the Earth Realm. If you take away all the pretence then it boils down to the outer realm being sore losers. Playing this sequel as a straight forward revenge film would have been a better move.I'm probably giving this film too much credit by discussing the story because it seemed like the writers didn't care much for the story themselves. It seemed that any time there was an attempt at character interaction or plot development that we would have a ridiculous fight sequence coupled with the over-bearing soundtrack that we saw in the first film. The first film was directed MTV Style, but this film looks as though it was directed by someone on acid - the fight sequences were much more over the top, the editing was choppy and the choreography was laughable. It's almost like the director went for the bigger is better approach, but it just doesn't quite work here.The dialogue between the characters was laughable and painful. One of the worst examples of this is when Kahn is looking for a new general. This scene gives us some of the most cringe inducing exchanges of dialogue that I've ever heard. We're also handed some laughable plot twists, villains that are more cartoonish than anything else and don't even start me on the final fight scene between Liu Kang and Kahn sigh....The only thing that made this film very slightly tolerable was Jax. He provided the film with the occasional moment of comic relief, but this aspect alone is not enough to save this utter shambles. The only other minor positive that I took from watching this sequel is that it made me appreciate the first film more.

1.0,this made my brain bleed,"Oh man... and people thought Mortal Kombat 1 was bad. Annihilation makes MK1 look like Schindler's List. This movie is a courageous foray into the nightmarish underworld of utter mindlessness. I only suspend my disbelief so much - then I start becoming frustrated and asking questions like: How the heck does somebody travel through the molten core of the earth in a sailing American Gladiators ball? There is no wind underground. Not even in Raiden's magical tunnels, dude. Sorry. I understand how lots of movies are only capsules for their fight scenes, and I'm okay with that, but the stipulation is that the fight scenes have to be at least kind of cool.I think that this movie may have hurt my physical body.

3.0,Highly watchable crap.,"Yeah its flawed. Its idiotic. It doesn't follow the video game well enough. The acting is the worst you'll ever see anywhere. The fight scenes are pathetic and the choreography is even worse than its predecessor. The special effects are terrible and worse than you can possibly imagine. The storyline is nonexistent. There are a lot of scenes and parts which make no sense whatsoever. But at no point is it ever boring. So it is highly watchable despite being a piece of crap. If you be a fan of the MK franchise or are expecting a good movie, watch it to see how bad a movie can get, just for education. It does however take a special kind of talent to ruin a franchise and movie which already has a good plot in place (refer to the MK video games). This movie's entire cast and crew have that talent and so does a retard called Paul Anderson.",highly watchable crap,yeah its flawed its idiotic it doesnt follow video game well enough acting is worst youll ever see anywhere fight scenes are pathetic choreography is even worse than its predecessor special effects are terrible worse than you can possibly imagine storyline is nonexistent there are lot scenes parts which make no sense whatsoever but at no point is it ever boring so it is highly watchable despite being piece crap if you be fan mk franchise or are expecting good movie watch it see how bad movie can get just education it does however take special kind talent ruin franchise movie which already has good plot place refer mk video games this movies entire cast crew have that talent so does retard called paul anderson,0.6936607142857142,-0.27218253968253975,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.13}"
7.0,"""I'll take my Mother."" Very bad but at the same time perversely lots of fun.","Mortal Kombat: Annihilation starts as the victorious Liu Kang (Robin Shou) celebrates his triumph in the mortal kombat arena with his friends Lord Rayden (James Remar), Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess), Johnny Cage (Chris Conrad) & the slinky Kitana (Talisa Soto). Unfortunately the party is cut short when evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) & his generals, the four armed Sheeva (Marjean Holden), the half horse half man creature Motaro (Deron McBee) & Kitana's also not unattractive Mother Queen Sindel (Musetta Vander) appear & announce their plans for the destruction of the Earth as we know it. Shao Kahn has opened portals between the Outworld & Earth which will merge the two within 6 days & he will rule both unless our unlikely group of heroes can stop him & save the human race as well as themselves. With the odds seemingly stacked against them can they do it?Directed by John R. Leonetti Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is the sequel to the decent Mortal Kombat (1995) & both were based on the popular video game series of the same name which I can vividly remember playing with my mate on my Super Nintendo during the mid 90's, it was one of those games that you could have great fun with & one which we always went back to. Anyway, the script by Brent V. Friedman & Bryce Zabel takes just about all the character's up-to Mortal Kombat III which what the video game series was at when this came out & sticks them in one long fight sequence, to be perfectly honest there isn't a story really & any semblance of plot that is buried in here merely sets up the next fight or is there to introduce another character from the game. Sometimes you can just sit back & enjoy a film for what it is & that's what I did with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, for me it brought back good memories of years gone by, it moves like an absolute rocket & you never have time to catch a breath before the next fight/monster/explosion/favourite character or just some good looking lady in a tight fitting costume kicking ass, what more do you want? On the negative side the Mortal Kombat games caused controversy because of the on screen violence & bloodshed like Sub-Zero's fatality where he would rip his opponents head off & the spine would still be attached, unfortunately the filmmakers obviously had a teenage audience in mind & I just thought it was far too tame & the fights had no satisfying pay-offs, also Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is probably the most far removed from reality film I've ever seen & it's just incredibly silly so anyone looking for something meaningful would probably be wise to skip this.Director Leonetti does a good job, the sets are cool with some nice colour schemes, the action is shot nicely by which I mean the camera doesn't jump cut every millisecond like a lot of films these days, this has the added bonus of us, the viewer that is, actually being able to see whats going on & keeping track of where everyone is & what their doing. The fights are very well choreographed & a lot of special moves from the games are here although I must again bring to your attention the general lack of ferocity & violence, it's just so tame & I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood during the entire film. Some of the CGI is absolutely terrible, some of the monsters are embarrassing to look at. The costumes are neat although I think the women could have worn a bit more leather if you know what I mean.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 it's well made, bad CGI apart, & you get plenty of fights & action for your money. Surprised to learn a fair amount of it was shot in England as well as Wales, Jordan & Thailand. The less said about the acting the better. There are some nice looking ladies here & a special mention goes to Talisa Soto whom is very easy on the eyes.Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that I liked a lot but I'm positive that many will hate, I don't really care though as films are all about personal opinion & I liked Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, it ain't going to win any awards but for non-stop action, fights & mindless fun I doubt there's much better out there. I just wish the filmmakers had some balls & made it more violent & stick some gory fatalities in there. Oh well, nothings perfect I suppose... I liked it but I'm sure many won't, the choice is yours. Followed by the TV series Mortal Kombat: Conquest (1998 - 1999) & a third film titled Mortal Kombat: Devastation (2007) is listed on the IMDb as being 'Announced'.",ill take my mother very bad but at same time perversely lots fun,mortal kombat annihilation starts as victorious liu kang robin shou celebrates his triumph mortal kombat arena with his friends lord rayden james remar sonya blade sandra hess johnny cage chris conrad slinky kitana talisa soto unfortunately party is cut short when evil outworld emperor shao kahn brian thompson his generals four armed sheeva marjean holden half horse half man creature motaro deron mcbee kitanas also not unattractive mother queen sindel musetta vander appear announce their plans destruction earth as we know it shao kahn has opened portals between outworld earth which will merge two within 6 days he will rule both unless our unlikely group heroes can stop him save human race as well as themselves with odds seemingly stacked against them can they do it directed by john r leonetti mortal kombat annihilation is sequel decent mortal kombat 1995 both were based popular video game series same name which i can vividly remember playing with my mate my super nintendo during mid 90s it was one those games that you could have great fun with one which we always went back anyway script by brent v friedman bryce zabel takes just about all characters up mortal kombat iii which what video game series was at when this came out sticks them one long fight sequence be perfectly honest there isnt story really any semblance plot that is buried here merely sets up next fight or is there introduce another character game sometimes you can just sit back enjoy film what it is thats what i did with mortal kombat annihilation me it brought back good memories years gone by it moves like absolute rocket you never have time catch breath before next fight monster explosion favourite character or just some good looking lady tight fitting costume kicking ass what more do you want negative side mortal kombat games caused controversy because screen violence bloodshed like sub zeros fatality where he would rip his opponents head off spine would still be attached unfortunately filmmakers obviously had teenage audience mind i just thought it was far too tame fights had no satisfying pay offs also mortal kombat annihilation is probably most far removed reality film ive ever seen its just incredibly silly so anyone looking something meaningful would probably be wise skip this director leonetti does good job sets are cool with some nice colour schemes action is shot nicely by which i mean camera doesnt jump cut every millisecond like lot films these days this has added bonus us viewer that is actually being able see whats going keeping track where everyone is what their doing fights are very well choreographed lot special moves games are here although i must again bring your attention general lack ferocity violence its just so tame i dont remember seeing single drop blood during entire film some cgi is absolutely terrible some monsters are embarrassing look at costumes are neat although i think women could have worn bit more leather if you know what i mean with supposed budget about 30 000 000 its well made bad cgi apart you get plenty fights action your money surprised learn fair amount it was shot england as well as wales jordan thailand less said about acting better there are some nice looking ladies here special mention goes talisa soto whom is very easy eyes mortal kombat annihilation is one those films that i liked lot but im positive that many will hate i dont really care though as films are all about personal opinion i liked mortal kombat annihilation it aint going win any awards but non stop action fights mindless fun i doubt theres much better out there i just wish filmmakers had some balls made it more violent stick some gory fatalities there oh well nothings perfect i suppose i liked it but im sure many wont choice is yours followed by tv series mortal kombat conquest 1998 1999 third film titled mortal kombat devastation 2007 is listed imdb as being announced,0.5296618616206245,0.0990882313562726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
