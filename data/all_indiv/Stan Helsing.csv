3.0,Lives Up to Expectations,"Okay, it is quite horrible. Yet, despite the overall harsh criticisms found on here, it is nothing at all near being one of the worst movies I have ever seen - in my lifetime, this year, or even this month. Bad? Yes indeedy! But God Awful? Not quite(though perhaps closer than I am letting on to). Steve Howey plays Stan Helsing who works at a video store. Halloween night is here and Stan meets up with two incredibly hot girls and his buddy Kenan Thompson(you figure out which one is unlikely to be in that quartet in reality). Thankfully Kenan is there, because he has a few of the few laughs that are in this film(the others belonging to octogenarian and living legend Leslie Nielsen dressed as a hideous barmaid). It seems Stan is destined to live up to his ancestry and slay monsters - what monsters you may ask? Well, ridiculously and inept looking ones NOT from classic horror but from modern ""classics""(I shudder even putting THAT in parentheses!) We get Pleatherface with a leaf blower and a line when he no longer has it, ""It looks like no one will get blown tonight."" Stop your sides from aching now with laughter. We get Chucky looking like a guy with painted x's and o's on his face. A Pinhead double from Hellraiser. Anf let's no forget the Michael Myers, Jason, and Fweddy doubles as well. All of these look so stupid and like someone from a fifth grade art class got to work on their wardrobe and costumes. There are other horror references and a story that defies logic - and explanation here for lack of need. Really, Stan Helsing is like Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, and Date Movie. It has a few laughs but not enough to even keep this lame crap afloat long at all. The humor is mostly adolescent and sophomoric with at least four references to bathrooms and all that great humor that comes from noises and the other fertile comedic ground that is inherent in feces and urine. Does the movie have any saving graces? Well, Kenan Thompson and good ole Leslie Nielsen are good some of the time. There are a few jokes that land roughly but in place. Then there are the female cast members who for the most part are very, very pleasant to look at like the three gals playing vampire strippers and Diora Baird and Desi Lydic as the two female leads. Neither can really act though Lydic has comedic potential. Baird has some fine assets to keep abreast of nonetheless. If you are looking for clever or witty humor, you must look elsewhere. If you have an IQ near that of a quasi-literate teen - you might think it is totally rad or some such feeling. Phewwww!",lives up expectations,okay it is quite horrible yet despite overall harsh criticisms found here it is nothing at all near being one worst movies i have ever seen my lifetime this year or even this month bad yes indeedy but god awful not quite though perhaps closer than i am letting steve howey plays stan helsing who works at video store halloween night is here stan meets up with two incredibly hot girls his buddy kenan thompson you figure out which one is unlikely be that quartet reality thankfully kenan is there because he has few few laughs that are this film others belonging octogenarian living legend leslie nielsen dressed as hideous barmaid it seems stan is destined live up his ancestry slay monsters what monsters you may ask well ridiculously inept looking ones not classic horror but modern classics i shudder even putting that parentheses we get pleatherface with leaf blower line when he no longer has it it looks like no one will get blown tonight stop your sides aching now with laughter we get chucky looking like guy with painted xs os his face pinhead double hellraiser anf lets no forget michael myers jason fweddy doubles as well all these look so stupid like someone fifth grade art class got work their wardrobe costumes there are other horror references story that defies logic explanation here lack need really stan helsing is like epic movie disaster movie date movie it has few laughs but not enough even keep this lame crap afloat long at all humor is mostly adolescent sophomoric with at least four references bathrooms all that great humor that comes noises other fertile comedic ground that is inherent feces urine does movie have any saving graces well kenan thompson good ole leslie nielsen are good some time there are few jokes that land roughly but place then there are female cast members who most part are very very pleasant look at like three gals playing vampire strippers diora baird desi lydic as two female leads neither can really act though lydic has comedic potential baird has some fine assets keep abreast nonetheless if you are looking clever or witty humor you must look elsewhere if you have iq near that quasi literate teen you might think it is totally rad or some such feeling phewwww,0.5010204081632653,-0.03252319109461966,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"

5.0,I Hate To Admit I Enjoyed This,"Stan Helsing, a video clerk for a certain video chain store, is ready for a Halloween party with three of his closest friends. But before the party, he has been asked to deliver a bag full of movies to the store's manager, who lives in a gated community. What lies beyond the gate: karaoke, monsters and gay porn studios. This is going to be a long night.Let me be blunt, when you tell me a film is coming from the same people, or the same sort of people who brought us ""Scary Movie"", ""Date Movie"", ""Disaster Movie"" and so on... I'm inclined to believe this is one more film that was a waste of time for the actors, a waste of money to make, and a waste of brain cells for anyone who watches it. Mysteriously, despite this bias, I enjoyed ""Stan Helsing"".Sure, the humor is juvenile, revolving almost entirely around hookers, strippers, porn and the same gratuitous sex that we've come to expect since at least ""American Pie"" (you can say such humor dates back at least to ""Porky's"", but don't tell me that the new wave of it has any wit behind the smut). Somehow, with my mind turned off and my stomach full of Corby's brand whiskey, I found this film humorous and enjoyable from the first five minutes.It has some disappointments. The monsters are such a minor part of the plot, sadly, and even Leslie Neilson has a role that isn't as funny as it should be. But such simple jokes as the porn title spoofs got me laughing (""Glad He Ate Her""? Classic) and I don't mind a few gorgeous women on my screen from time to time.But as I say, if you're looking for a clever monster spoof, it's not here. The monsters sing a karaoke song, but their origins are not explained and they have maybe ten to fifteen minutes of screen time, contrary to what it would appear by the cover. But if you like dumb humor, like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", this would be worth your time... especially with a friend and a bottle of Feckin Irish whiskey.",i hate admit i enjoyed this,stan helsing video clerk certain video chain store is ready halloween party with three his closest friends but before party he has been asked deliver bag full movies stores manager who lives gated community what lies beyond gate karaoke monsters gay porn studios this is going be long night let me be blunt when you tell me film is coming same people or same sort people who brought us scary movie date movie disaster movie so im inclined believe this is one more film that was waste time actors waste money make waste brain cells anyone who watches it mysteriously despite this bias i enjoyed stan helsing sure humor is juvenile revolving almost entirely around hookers strippers porn same gratuitous sex that weve come expect since at least american pie you can say such humor dates back at least porkys but dont tell me that new wave it has any wit behind smut somehow with my mind turned off my stomach full corbys brand whiskey i found this film humorous enjoyable first five minutes it has some disappointments monsters are such minor part plot sadly even leslie neilson has role that isnt as funny as it should be but such simple jokes as porn title spoofs got me laughing glad he ate her classic i dont mind few gorgeous women my screen time time but as i say if youre looking clever monster spoof its not here monsters sing karaoke song but their origins are not explained they have maybe ten fifteen minutes screen time contrary what it would appear by cover but if you like dumb humor like dude wheres my car this would be worth your time especially with friend bottle feckin irish whiskey,0.4831021586123628,0.04236019082957858,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,Very bad...but not nearly as bad as I'd assumed.,"The IMDB Bottom 100 List consists of the one hundred worst rated major motion pictures of all time....and many of them are very similar parody films marketed to very dumb young people. They all feature extremely crude humor, bad writing and make your brain dumber as a result of watching them. ""Disaster Movie, ""Epic Movie"", ""Meet the Spartans"", ""Date Movie"" and ""The Starving Games"" are just a few of these incredibly bad movies that made the list...as well as ""Stan Helsing"". However, after watching ""Stan Helsing"" I was surprised. I was a bad film....crude, stupid and generally unfunny...but NOT to the level of awfulness of these other films. In fact, I'd have a hard time putting this on a bottom 1000 list...let alone bottom 100. Unlike many of these films, there actually is a bit more plot and cohesion than the other movies. Not much...but more...though NOT enough that I'd recommend it to anyone I like!The film is the story of four idiots who get lost on a Halloween night and end up stumbling into a cursed town of the dead. Various psychotic murders like Jason, Freddy Kruger and Pinhead wander through the place...looking to kill these four idiots. And, apparently, Stan is their only help...though he certainly doesn't realize he's the hero of the film.Crude, stupid and annoying....but a few of the jokes actually made me smile and the film was only about 94% terrible!",very bad but not nearly as bad as id assumed,imdb bottom 100 list consists one hundred worst rated major motion pictures all time many them are very similar parody films marketed very dumb young people they all feature extremely crude humor bad writing make your brain dumber as result watching them disaster movie epic movie meet spartans date movie starving games are just few these incredibly bad movies that made list as well as stan helsing however after watching stan helsing i was surprised i was bad film crude stupid generally unfunny but not level awfulness these other films fact id have hard time putting this bottom 1000 list let alone bottom 100 unlike many these films there actually is bit more plot cohesion than other movies not much but more though not enough that id recommend it anyone i like film is story four idiots who get lost halloween night end up stumbling into cursed town dead various psychotic murders like jason freddy kruger pinhead wander through place looking kill these four idiots apparently stan is their only help though he certainly doesnt realize hes hero film crude stupid annoying but few jokes actually made me smile film was only about 94 terrible,0.6096843853820599,-0.2328460686600221,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.55, 'Fear': 0.12}"
2.0,"Quite possible the worst movie I have seen this year.,,,","Its rare that I actually despise a movie as much as this one. Now before you say I am coming down too hard on this movie...if you don't believe me just watch it. The movie starts out 'ok' like a decent rip off of Scary Movie; however, it quickly descends into a downward whirlpool of bad acting, poor direction and a plot that makes little sense.Basically this movie is a spoof on horror movies. There were a few parts where I laughed- near the beginning, but after that it seems as though the film budget ran out of money or something because after the halfway point it completely looses direction. I kept expecting a story to develop or some kind of back history on 'Van Helsing' to appear. It didn't. The characters are poorly written...and even with the comedic assistance of Leslie Neilson it still flops hardcore.Leslie Neilson must be really hard up for acting spots to have taken a spot in this stinker.

7.0,I'm going to say I like it.,"I'm going to say I like it. Don""t get me wrong its a bad movie but it doesn't mean its not enjoyable. Its not to much like Meet the Spartans or date movie were they parody scenes from the movie they parody and make them stupid. They did do that with the monsters by making them look like morons and give them really dumb names but beside that they do have some funny scenes and dialog. And they do try to make the a bit like the people they are base off of. Like when they use their weakness is like what fans made fun of the real people they copied. To defeat Freddy get rid of his glove. Pinhead push the nails in. The mask think with Jason and Myers is not their weakness but it showed how similar they are and that Jason was a ripoff of Myers. Leatherface wait till his chainsaw runs out of gas. And Chucky he is a doll. If you missed that then you have no business making fun of this movie. And the other main characters I thought was a good casting choice and they were really funny. Finally they didn't a a truck load of over the top reality breaking jokes. They have those but its more down played. I'm just saying rethink this one.",im going say i like it,im going say i like it don t get me wrong its bad movie but it doesnt mean its not enjoyable its not much like meet spartans or date movie were they parody scenes movie they parody make them stupid they did do that with monsters by making them look like morons give them really dumb names but beside that they do have some funny scenes dialog they do try make bit like people they are base off like when they use their weakness is like what fans made fun real people they copied defeat freddy get rid his glove pinhead push nails mask think with jason myers is not their weakness but it showed how similar they are that jason was ripoff myers leatherface wait till his chainsaw runs out gas chucky he is doll if you missed that then you have no business making fun this movie other main characters i thought was good casting choice they were really funny finally they didnt truck load over top reality breaking jokes they have those but its more down played im just saying rethink this one,0.6023358585858586,-0.07960858585858586,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1.0,Absolutely dreadful!,Nothing like Scary Movie at all. As spoofs go this movie doesn't do anything to make you laugh. And isn't that the point of a movie like this. There was a real potential in making this a fun movie. But somehow I guess that the director and producers couldn't be bothered. I can't blame the cast since they obviously try their best to make this work. But you can see the desperation in the main character's eyes when he has to do another pointless dialog. Shutting your mind of isn't an option either since there is no slapstick comedy to be enjoyed. Well there are some redeeming elements or maybe even the only reason to watch this. The two girls. One with very nice boobs (Diora Baird) and the other one extremely hot blonde (Desi Lydic). Sadly this just isn't enough to be tortured through the whole movie. (My advice skip to the sexy scenes with the girls and forget about everything else). Ignore previous comment and don't waste your time.

2.0,A Nutshell Review: Stan Helsing,"There are some comedies that just try too hard, and Stan Helsing falls into this category. Written and directed by Bo Zenga who has more producing credits and making his directorial debut, Stan Helsing stars a cast of relative unknowns hobbled together to forcefully create laugh-a-minute sequences that don't always hit their marks, but instead fall quite short in not being silly for silliness sake.One thing's for sure though, is that Zenga dug deep to throw plenty of movie references from the horror genre into his comedy, especially when the villains turn out to be cheap knockoffs of their real cult counterparts, with Fweddy (Freddy from A Nightmare from Elm Street), Mason (Jason from Friday the 13th), Needlehead (Pinhead from Hellraiser), Pleatherface (Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Lucky (Chucky from Child's Play) and Michael Crier (Michael Myers from Halloween), and not including minor ones such as the Hitcher, and a giant cockroach. But ultimately there's nothing here to make this film anywhere near being horrific, except that the end product is quite horrific in itself.On the other corner of the ring of good, we follow the adventures of a foursome consisting of the slacker Schlockbuster video clerk Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) whom everyone mistakes from Van Helsing the monster exterminator, who has been tasked to drop off some videos en route to his Halloween party with hottie ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird), his best friend Teddy (Kenan Thompson) and an exotic dancer cum massage therapist (interpret this as you will!) Mia (Desi Lydic), on a road trip filled with last minute detours leading from point to point and incident filled. The entire journey unravels with inexplicable coincidences relying on cliché after cliché to bring on some cheap laughs, which when proved inadequate there's always the odd toilet joke to stink bomb everything.Dialogue is full of sexual double meanings, with Mia being the group idiot to fall for, or become the butt of the jokes. Nothing in the narrative ever makes much good sense other than to react or create a hilarious situation for our foursome to get into, and filmmakers perhaps need to stop and take stock of the comedy genre now that spoofing pop culture, or pop icons, are no longer a quick and easy way to surprise and satisfy an audience, and not when the impersonations was far from their mark.Don't get me wrong that I've lost my funny bone, but this relatively cheap production didn't have much to laugh at. What's more painful is that it starred the late Leslie Nielsen in drag and makeup as a bar waitress, and seemed more like a desperate role meant for paying the bills. Filled with jokes with some being naughty while others nonsensical and silly, probably the scenes set within the video store bookending the film with patrons providing sight gags and trash talking became the main highlights.",nutshell review stan helsing,there are some comedies that just try too hard stan helsing falls into this category written directed by bo zenga who has more producing credits making his directorial debut stan helsing stars cast relative unknowns hobbled together forcefully create laugh minute sequences that dont always hit their marks but instead fall quite short not being silly silliness sake one things sure though is that zenga dug deep throw plenty movie references horror genre into his comedy especially when villains turn out be cheap knockoffs their real cult counterparts with fweddy freddy nightmare elm street mason jason friday 13th needlehead pinhead hellraiser pleatherface leatherface texas chainsaw massacre lucky chucky childs play michael crier michael myers halloween not including minor ones such as hitcher giant cockroach but ultimately theres nothing here make this film anywhere near being horrific except that end product is quite horrific itself other corner ring good we follow adventures foursome consisting slacker schlockbuster video clerk stan helsing steve howey whom everyone mistakes van helsing monster exterminator who has been tasked drop off some videos en route his halloween party with hottie ex girlfriend nadine diora baird his best friend teddy kenan thompson exotic dancer cum massage therapist interpret this as you will mia desi lydic road trip filled with last minute detours leading point point incident filled entire journey unravels with inexplicable coincidences relying clich after clich bring some cheap laughs which when proved inadequate theres always odd toilet joke stink bomb everything dialogue is full sexual double meanings with mia being group idiot fall or become butt jokes nothing narrative ever makes much good sense other than react or create hilarious situation our foursome get into filmmakers perhaps need stop take stock comedy genre now that spoofing pop culture or pop icons are no longer quick easy way surprise satisfy audience not when impersonations was far their mark dont get me wrong that ive lost my funny bone but this relatively cheap production didnt have much laugh at whats more painful is that it starred late leslie nielsen drag makeup as bar waitress seemed more like desperate role meant paying bills filled with jokes with some being naughty while others nonsensical silly probably scenes set within video store bookending film with patrons providing sight gags trash talking became main highlights,0.605828373015873,0.06473214285714286,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"

,"It has it's funny moments, but they are to few and far between","This is a good example of what happens when decent comic actors accept parts in a terrible movie vehicle. They probably need the work, so they do their best even if they can't hide that the movie stinks. For one, Kenan Thompson has a real comic flare, I only hope he gets better films to feature it in. And the other three leads showed comic potential too. I admit there were some genuinely funny moments that made me laugh, like the Karaoke scenes and some of the lines by the blond character (Desi Lydic).

2.0,"A movie, you shouldn't watch on Halloween. Nor ever. This movie was so awful.","As of late, the parody movies genre is pretty bad. With film franchises like the Scary Movie, and National Lampoons, the parody movie has been getting dumber and dumber. Makes you miss for the days of Naked Gun, Mel Brooks, and Monty Python, all pretty dumb movies, but at less had some smart humor. Even with rock-bottom expectations, I was disappointed by this film. Stan Helsing barely had anything laughable. The film is about video store clerk Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) whom with his friends must make a routine video delivery on Halloween night. Steve Howey doesn't really stand out in this role. I mistake him for Josh Duhamel for the longest time. His friends are some of the most annoying, dumb, stereotype characters, I have ever saw. There is the comic relief sidekick, Teddy (Kenan Thompson) who plays one of the blandest side character guy ever. You would thought for a guy that use to be in ALL That and Saturday Night Live skits, that they would use him as a character actor in this movie, but no. There were a lot of background or side characters that could had use his odd sense of humor. Then there is the love- interest, ex-girlfriend Nadine (Dioare Baird) who really doesn't do much, but act sexy. Then last is the dumb blonde slutty girl, Mia (Desi Lydrics) who changes costumes several time throughout the movie. Instead of a normal drive, Stan and the gang find themselves in Stormy Night Estates facing a group of form of parodies of movie monster icons. It's not even the monster monsters that the normal Van Helsing would had face anyways such as Frankenstein or Dracula. The film has nothing to do with Van Helsing at all. The movie itself, isn't much of a parody of anything. It had barley any plot-line. Even the movie return plot-line kinda drop off the face off the world, half way in. Throughout the film we are not sure what the film is parodying. It even parody things outside of Halloween themes. It's just tries too hard to fill in as much dumb pop culture 1980's and 1990's slasher films parodies targets. You know, for a movie made in the late 2000's, you would think this movie would have some more modern pop culture humor. Well, the others were pretty dumb like dark jokes like killing women and dogs, overt sexual jokes that goes flat, frat boy toilet humor that was a bit mean-spirited. It usually made at the expense of the female characters. The group keep doing stupid things that become very irritating than funny. Even the pun writing is pretty bad. The knockoffs of famous franchise horror villains are named Lucky, Mason, Michael Criers, Pleatherface, Fweddy and Needlehead. Seriously, was this the best, the writer/directed Bo Zenda could come up with? It's weird in a way that Stan Helsing is Rated R, but there's nothing in this film that would earn it anything above a PG-13. There isn't that much gore. The language was that harsh. Most of the nudity, was left on the cutting room floor. Those extended sequences are included in the bonus features if you want to see them. I have a pretty high tolerance for intentionally stupid comedies, and have more fondness for potty humor than most other people would probably admit to. But even by those standards, this movie is dull, boring, and worst of all, unfunny. The only things going for this self-proclaimed horror film parody are decent production values and attractive actresses. Not even, parody king Leslie Nielsen can save this movie with his mediocre small cameo as a cross-dresser waitress. I think if they had some better talented actors, and a witty storyline, maybe this film could had work. 2011's Cabin in the Woods was a pretty good satire simply because it was made by people who knew the genre and lovingly made fun of its flaws. This was made to capitalize on way more popular horror movies that, the writers barely knew anything about. For 90 minutes, this movie gave a sad attempt of parody that is better used for internet shorts. There is small smarter Halloween type parodies on Youtube better than this film that people have produce with less money. It just prove that these movies are more cash-in shlocks than real movies. If you really feel the need to watch this flick, rent it. I warn you.",movie you shouldnt watch halloween nor ever this movie was so awful,as late parody movies genre is pretty bad with film franchises like scary movie national lampoons parody movie has been getting dumber dumber makes you miss days naked gun mel brooks monty python all pretty dumb movies but at less had some smart humor even with rock bottom expectations i was disappointed by this film stan helsing barely had anything laughable film is about video store clerk stan helsing steve howey whom with his friends must make routine video delivery halloween night steve howey doesnt really stand out this role i mistake him josh duhamel longest time his friends are some most annoying dumb stereotype characters i have ever saw there is comic relief sidekick teddy kenan thompson who plays one blandest side character guy ever you would thought guy that use be all that saturday night live skits that they would use him as character actor this movie but no there were lot background or side characters that could had use his odd sense humor then there is love interest ex girlfriend nadine dioare baird who really doesnt do much but act sexy then last is dumb blonde slutty girl mia desi lydrics who changes costumes several time throughout movie instead normal drive stan gang find themselves stormy night estates facing group form parodies movie monster icons its not even monster monsters that normal van helsing would had face anyways such as frankenstein or dracula film has nothing do with van helsing at all movie itself isnt much parody anything it had barley any plot line even movie return plot line kinda drop off face off world half way throughout film we are not sure what film is parodying it even parody things outside halloween themes its just tries too hard fill as much dumb pop culture 1980s 1990s slasher films parodies targets you know movie made late 2000s you would think this movie would have some more modern pop culture humor well others were pretty dumb like dark jokes like killing women dogs overt sexual jokes that goes flat frat boy toilet humor that was bit mean spirited it usually made at expense female characters group keep doing stupid things that become very irritating than funny even pun writing is pretty bad knockoffs famous franchise horror villains are named lucky mason michael criers pleatherface fweddy needlehead seriously was this best writer directed bo zenda could come up with its weird way that stan helsing is rated r but theres nothing this film that would earn it anything above pg 13 there isnt that much gore language was that harsh most nudity was left cutting room floor those extended sequences are included bonus features if you want see them i have pretty high tolerance intentionally stupid comedies have more fondness potty humor than most other people would probably admit but even by those standards this movie is dull boring worst all unfunny only things going this self proclaimed horror film parody are decent production values attractive actresses not even parody king leslie nielsen can save this movie with his mediocre small cameo as cross dresser waitress i think if they had some better talented actors witty storyline maybe this film could had work 2011s cabin woods was pretty good satire simply because it was made by people who knew genre lovingly made fun its flaws this was made capitalize way more popular horror movies that writers barely knew anything about 90 minutes this movie gave sad attempt parody that is better used internet shorts there is small smarter halloween type parodies youtube better than this film that people have produce with less money it just prove that these movies are more cash shlocks than real movies if you really feel need watch this flick rent it i warn you,0.5680665566556656,0.005311709742402833,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

2.0,Somebody Evidently Thot This Would Be Funny,"Stan Helsing: A Parody (R, 1:30) — Other: Comedy, bargain basement, formula2 background facts:(1) In Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, the intrepid Dutch adventurer who was the vampire count's nemesis was Abraham Van Helsing. (""Bram"", incidentally, is a diminutive of ""Abraham"".)(2) By vote of knowledgeable fans at the 2003 World Science Fiction Convention, the 3rd best SF film of the 20th Century was Forbidden Planet. It was released in 1956. It starred Leslie Nielsen as the heroic spaceship captain.I have listed this film as a comedy, since that's what it purports to be. Certainly it's full of formulaic horror-movie stereotypes, which you would expect from a self-proclaimed parody. And I laffed out loud a couple of times, which means it can't sink to the absolute rock bottom of my ratingometer. That's about it for the singing of praises, tho.The protagonist is the slacker video clerk Stan Helsing (family name simply Helsing, not Van Helsing), who keeps getting mistaken for his ancestor by people who are particularly well informed on this issue while otherwise showing a remarkable tendency to drown while gazing upward open-mouthed during a rainstorm.Stan (Steve Howey) and 3 friends set out for a Halloween party. One of the group, Nadine (Diora Baird) is Stan's ex-girlfriend, she's pretty emphatic about the ""ex"" part, and we see in flashback why she feels that way, as Stan is one of the most insensitive lunkheads on the planet. This raises the question ""Why the hell is Nadine going to a party with this schmuck?""No attempt is made to answer that or explain the many other improbabilities. The viewer is left to infer that the various horror-movie creatures wandering around wreaking havoc are going unnoticed because everyone else thinks they're just costumed for Halloween.Poor Nielsen plays Kay, an overworked waitress, in lipstick and drag. This was just painful to watch.Among many random occurrences thrown into the plot in no particular order are gratuitous panty and boob shots; a monsters vs. heroes karaoke contest; Freddie, Jason, and a little kid in a hockey mask who gets seriously whacked in a case of mistaken identity; and a hard-to- miss giant cockroach that the lesbians in the next toilet stall nonetheless managed to miss.Somebody evidently thot this would be funny.

10.0,I honestly laughed!,"Well, after reading all of these reviews that said this movie sucked and what not, i figured that I'll still give it a shot.

At some parts I was kind of like ""WTF?"" but still they made me laugh. It was funny how they always called him ""Van Helsing"" and he would say "" why does everyone call me that!"" . Pinhead with the dartboard head was pretty funny. And I liked how Michael Myerss' characters mask changed, the leatherface spoof was pretty comical with the leaf blower.etc...Point being, this wasn't supposed to be a big award winning film, and I do believe that the makers of the film knew it as well. It's just supposed to be a fun movie that you watch with a bunch of friends and laugh at.

1.0,Garbage Pail Kids 2: Kill Stan,"Ohmy'Stan Helsing' is just a plain, awful mess. It's completely unfunny, uninteresting and unbelievably stupid. There is not one moment of humor, and when they try and set up a ""joke,"" it's already seen coming a mile away. It's hard to describe how bad this was, but I will try: It would be more fun to watch paint dry, listen to keys stuck in a running garbage disposal for an hour or bungee jump without the bungee cord. It's equally hard to describe the plot. Again, I will try: boy-wonder, Stan, commonly mistaken for the original ""Van Helsing"" (Ha, ha, ha, that is so funny – no seriously, it was so funny, you will hear that joke 2 dozen times) and his gang are off to a Halloween party, but get detoured when Stan has to drop off videos. On this comical (sorry, I cannot lie, make that sobering) journey they meet the Garbage Pail Kid's versions of Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, Chucky and Jason. A lot of the time when I dislike a movie, I can safely say, ""well, to each their own, someone's gotta find value in this."" For this piece of trash, I will confidently say: ""STAY AWAY. DO NOT RENT OR WATCH, EVEN FOR FREE. EXORCISE THIS ABOMINATION."" Am I being too harsh? Well, anyone that didn't adhere to my warning, you tell me. Please also tell me how this got green-lit? It couldn't be the sad Leslie Nielsen cameo. It couldn't be the producers even though people remembered who ""Van Helsing"" was – this is like spoofing '13th Warrior' now in 2009.

1.0,"Don't, I Repeat, DON'T be fooled by this one.","I first heard about this one at the FanExpo in Toronto where I picked up the awesome looking poster. AFter watching the trailer I was a tad bit disappointed but was still aching to see it. Now I'm aching that I did.Quite possibly one of the biggest wastes of time ever. Just so everyone gets the picture, the humour in this and the overall quality is on par with the disastrous collection from Seltzer and Friedberg (Epic, date Movie etc.) There are so many problems with this film that it borders on insanity. There is virtually NO plot, structure or pacing and we never get any explanation of whats going on or why. Even all the villain spoofs (which is what the point of the movie is supposed to be) are so paper thin and mind-bogglingly-stupid. Why is Freddy supposed to be all gangsta? or why is Mike Myers Jewish? The villains get minimal screen time and their all just kind of there...for no particular reason.The film is full of toilet humour and gross out/sex gags (as i said, Friedberg/Seltzer) and while I did chuckle once or twice, I wouldn't say it was funny.While watching I was hoping that there would be some wicked fight at the end to redeem it to some degree. But the ending is just as disappointingly awful as the rest of the film.The idea of a great descendant of Van Helsing fighting off all of the big time movie monsters of contemporary film is actually a great idea and It could have worked as a zany spoof or a Jack Brooks style over the top horror-comedy, but it is so poorly executed that it defies logic. It doesn't work as a comedy. It doesn't' work as a horror. But most importantly, it doesn't work as a MOVIE. There is no film here.
