9.0,"Fantastic acting, script, and direction in a thought-provoking movie","Outstanding film. Star-studded with several fantastic performances. Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way. I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument – and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments. There are also so many brilliant scenes. Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke. The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars. Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty. The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to. Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks. Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching. It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours. Heck, you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk! In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.As for the trial itself, the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters), not makers of law. They didn't know about the atrocities in the concentration camps. At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich. They were patriots, saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power, but did not know how far he would go. If you were going to convict these judges, you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?). The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did, just as countless others in Germany were, and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied. Anyone who's lived under a totalitarian regime may understand, or at least empathize.I'm not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis, but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking. How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does – simply pursuing the facts, and in a quiet, thoughtful way. It's the best of humanity. How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster's character, admitting they knew, admitting their guilt, knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong, and yet seeking Tracy's understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end – intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked. Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong. Had the Axis won the war, I don't know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, or for dropping the atomic bombs, but the film makes one think, even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be. The particulars of this trial were fictionalized, but it's representative of what really occurred, and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today – and yet are so vitally important to understand, and remember.",fantastic acting script direction thought provoking movie,outstanding film star studded with several fantastic performances highly emotional given subject matter but presented very intelligent balanced way i was struck at once by that by how well director stanley kramer gives us both sides argument avoids simply paying lip service defense german judges trial maximilian schell is brilliant as defense attorney well worthy his oscar is forceful compelling his arguments there are also so many brilliant scenes spencer tracy walking empty arena where nazi rallies were held with kramer focusing dais which hitler spoke testimony montgomery clift judy garland both whom are outstanding should have gotten oscars burt lancaster role one german judges one tortured by his complicity knowing he others are guilty devastating real film clips concentration camps which are still spine tingling despite all we know or have been exposed marlene dietrich as german generals wife haunted but expressing german viewpoint one time while people are singing over drinks her night stroll with tracy as she explains words one song is touching it just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another film did not seem long at all at three hours heck youve even got werner klemperer william shatner before they would become colonel klink captain kirk this film acting script direction are all brilliant harmony with one another as trial itself defense argument was along these lines they were judges therefore interpreters not makers law they didnt know about atrocities concentration camps at least one them saved or helped many by staying their roles doing best they could under heavy hand third reich they were patriots saw improvement country when hitler took power but did not know how far he would go if you were going convict these judges you would have convict many more germans where would it stop americans themselves practiced eugenics killed thousands thousands innocents at hiroshima nagasaki one small weakness i found was that defense never makes simple argument that these judges were forced do what they did just as countless others germany were would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied anyone whos lived under totalitarian regime may understand or at least empathize im not saying i bought into these arguments or that one should be apologist nazis but fact that film presented such strong defense was thought provoking how fantastic is it that spencer tracy plays his character way he does simply pursuing facts quiet thoughtful way its best humanity how heartbreaking is burt lancasters character admitting they knew admitting their guilt knowing that what happened was horrible that they were wrong yet seeking tracys understanding that scene jail cell at end intellectual intellectual being rebuked even single life taken unjustly was wrong had axis won war i dont know which americans would have been trial war crimes fire bombings dresden tokyo or dropping atomic bombs but film makes one think even war when things were seemingly as black white as they could ever be particulars this trial were fictionalized but its representative what really occurred it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today yet are so vitally important understand remember,0.48865079365079356,0.1243650793650794,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Cinematic Theater Of A Remarkable Kind,"Beyond its compelling subject matter ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" revolutionizes the court room drama genre. The camera swings and swerves and dives between the lines of this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. ""I am half the man I've ever been"" Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have seen ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of the subject it always manages to entertain and inspire.",cinematic theater remarkable kind,beyond its compelling subject matter judgement at neuremberg revolutionizes court room drama genre camera swings swerves dives between lines this exemplary abby mann script stanley kramer conducts his orchestra iconic stars with precision swiss watchmaker language barriers confinement action masterfully resolved spencer tracy is simply magnificent as per usual we believe every word that comes out his mouth his judge is american monument unsentimental humanity twentynine year old maimilian schell won oscar as best actor his performance survived test time with vigor his conviction montgomery cliff makes his short minutes screen one those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able forget man character merging into one chilling shattering truth i am half man ive ever been marlene dietrich gives her german aristocrat legendary star quality judy garland overweight almost unrecognizable breaks your heart gets her last oscar nomination my only troubles came with stoic burt lancaster because i could never forget it was burt lancaster with richard widmarks strident prosecutor i have seen judgement at neuremberg more than dozen times it never ceases amaze me that no matter darkness subject it always manages entertain inspire,0.5010416666666667,0.27499999999999997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"""My counsel says we were not aware of the extermination of the millions. He would give you the excuse: We were only aware of the extermination of the hundreds.""","This quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes I have ever heard. It is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. Furthermore Judgment at Nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies I have seen. Even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. This film is loosely based on the trials in Nuremburg in 1948. Right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. The acting was collectively amazing. One of the best casts ever assembled which included Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster as well as international stars Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich. It is not just the fact that this is a star studded cast that made it so great, it was the way everyone appeared to blend in together. Maximilian Schell gave the performance of his life in this film playing the defense lawyer for Burt Lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay in your mind forever. Schell's character use of logic is that of something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says. Richard Widmark playing the prosecutor gave the type of supporting performance that was necessary for Schell to shine. The way both actors fed off each other was a joy to watch. Then of course the tiny appearances of Garland and Clift were excellent and worth every second they spent on camera. I usually find myself frustrated with cameos and actors receiving recognition for them but this film used cameos the best way I have ever seen. Then of course Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich provided such great presence were perfect for the lead.The direction of Stanley Kramer was spectacular as the film intensified more and more as it wore on. It was always engrossing and never let up. The writing of Abby Mann was great, filled up with great material and narratives allowing every actor in the cast to give a superb performance. There were many memorable quotes as well. The writing carried the film forward and allowed all the potential and talent to push this film to another level.Judgement at Nuremburg is not just another movie. It is a very thought provoking movie. More than that though it is haunting. Just thinking about the course of the events being talked about in the movie became subtly haunting in a way I really didn't expect. What was the most compelling though was the way we need to separate what we feel with what has to be truly done, with what is truly right.",my counsel says we were not aware extermination millions he would give you excuse we were only aware extermination hundreds,this quote is one most shocking yet truthful quotes i have ever heard it is one many shocking intense quotes movie furthermore judgment at nuremburg is one most absorbing movies i have seen even though most if not all it is dialog it is very much haunting film this film is loosely based trials nuremburg 1948 right start movie captures your mind never lets it go acting was collectively amazing one best casts ever assembled which included spencer tracy montgomery clift judy garland richard widmark burt lancaster as well as international stars maximilian schell marlene dietrich it is not just fact that this is star studded cast that made it so great it was way everyone appeared blend together maximilian schell gave performance his life this film playing defense lawyer burt lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay your mind forever schells character use logic is that something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says richard widmark playing prosecutor gave type supporting performance that was necessary schell shine way both actors fed off each other was joy watch then course tiny appearances garland clift were excellent worth every second they spent camera i usually find myself frustrated with cameos actors receiving recognition them but this film used cameos best way i have ever seen then course spencer tracy marlene dietrich provided such great presence were perfect lead direction stanley kramer was spectacular as film intensified more more as it wore it was always engrossing never let up writing abby mann was great filled up with great material narratives allowing every actor cast give superb performance there were many memorable quotes as well writing carried film forward allowed all potential talent push this film another level judgement at nuremburg is not just another movie it is very thought provoking movie more than that though it is haunting just thinking about course events being talked about movie became subtly haunting way i really didnt expect what was most compelling though was way we need separate what we feel with what has be truly done with what is truly right,0.5490551412872842,0.3015260334903192,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,A Film Of Enduring Value,"They say that time heals all heartache. In the case of the Third Reich, I'm not sure that the old saying is true. Out of respect for the Holocaust victims, and as an important history lesson, there's something to be said for not forgetting the evils of Hitler. Fortunately, we have this great film to help us not forget.""Judgment At Nuremberg"" is a dramatization of one of the many real life post WWII Nuremberg trials of high ranking Nazis. Most of the film focuses on the 1948 courtroom trial of four judges who helped to carry out Hitler's decrees. As part of the prosecution's case against the judges, real life, graphic film footage showing the horrors of the death camps engenders a gut level impression that is both powerful and persuasive. The film thus educates viewers in ways that a dry textbook of facts and figures never could.But there's more to the film than the trial. In other parts of Nuremberg we see ordinary Germans trying to get on with their lives as best they can, three years after the war's end, in a bombed out and bleak city. One of these persons is Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the wife of a dead German soldier. In contrast to the harsh and contentious trial, Madame Bertholt's kindness toward the tribunal's lead judge, Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), provides an example of the innocence and decency of ordinary Germans, and thus adds a softer, more contemplative perspective to the ordeal. In these non-courtroom scenes, the melancholy background music and the soft production lighting create a mood of depression and sadness.I find very little to criticize in this three hour film. Perhaps the plot could have been clearer in identifying the legal counsel of three of the four defendants. And maybe in those scenes wherein the four defendants conversed among themselves, the dialogue should have been in German, not English. But these are trivial points. Overall, this is a film that is well written and directed, a film with credible actors giving stellar performances, and most of all, a film that assures preservation of that era's historic significance, with a political and social message that has enduring value.",film enduring value,they say that time heals all heartache case third reich im not sure that old saying is true out respect holocaust victims as important history lesson theres something be said not forgetting evils hitler fortunately we have this great film help us not forget judgment at nuremberg is dramatization one many real life post wwii nuremberg trials high ranking nazis most film focuses 1948 courtroom trial four judges who helped carry out hitlers decrees as part prosecutions case against judges real life graphic film footage showing horrors death camps engenders gut level impression that is both powerful persuasive film thus educates viewers ways that dry textbook facts figures never could but theres more film than trial other parts nuremberg we see ordinary germans trying get with their lives as best they can three years after wars end bombed out bleak city one these persons is madame bertholt marlene dietrich wife dead german soldier contrast harsh contentious trial madame bertholts kindness toward tribunals lead judge dan haywood spencer tracy provides example innocence decency ordinary germans thus adds softer more contemplative perspective ordeal these non courtroom scenes melancholy background music soft production lighting create mood depression sadness i find very little criticize this three hour film perhaps plot could have been clearer identifying legal counsel three four defendants maybe those scenes wherein four defendants conversed among themselves dialogue should have been german not english but these are trivial points overall this is film that is well written directed film with credible actors giving stellar performances most all film that assures preservation that eras historic significance with political social message that has enduring value,0.43028528528528526,0.1299436936936937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,A True Cinematic Masterpiece,"""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is one of the great films of all time. This can be attributed to the excellent script written by Abby Mann, its skillful direction by Stanley Kramer and possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a motion picture.The subject trial takes place in 1948 long after the trials of the major German military generals when most people had lost interest in such proceedings. Writer Mann chose to write about the trial of German judges, the people who above all, should have seen the evil of Hitler and his followers coming.Assigned to the trial as Chief Judge is Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) a low profile justice who by his own admission was not the original or subsequent choice. The prosecutor is Col. Tad Lansing (Richard Widmark) an ""army man"" who vows to convict the four ex-German Judges. Defending the accused is Hans Rolfe (Maximillian Schell) who must convince the court that the defendants were acting only for the love of their country.Among the defendants are respected Judge Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who has written several books on law accepted the world over. Lawson accuses the defendants of signing orders for the sterilization of innocent men and the execution of those who opposed to the Reich and the extermination of the jews. He puts Rudolph Peterson (Montgomery Clift) on the stand as a victim of sterilization. Rolfe manages to expose the pitiful Peterson as mentally challenged. Later Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland) is put on the stand to explain her alleged affair at the age of 16 with an elderly jew. As his coup de grace, Lawson shows a film depicting the horrors of German concentration camps.In between the sessions, Judge Haywood strikes up a friendship with Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) the widow of a former German general, in whose former home the judge is staying. In spite of their differences they begin to grow fond of each other.The army pressures Lawson to ease up and suggests that acquittal or light sentences would best serve American interests since this was the time that the blockade of Berlin was beginning. Judge Haywood is also pressured to go easy on the sentencing.Maximillian Schell deservedly won an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Rolfe. Any one of the other principals could have easily won as well. Clift and Garland are simply outstanding as are Widmark and Lancaster. And Tracy, did he ever give a bad performance? The still beautiful Dietrich was also excellent. Others in the cast are a very young William Shatner as Capt. Byers, a court officer, Werner Kemperer as Emil Hahn the most militant of the defendants and Ray Teal as Judge Ives. Teal had long been a fixture in westerns and is probably best remembered for playing Sheriff Coffey on TV's Bonanza.The DVD release contains an excellent conversation between Abby Mann and Maximillian Schell plus an interview with Kramer's widow, the still beautiful former actress Karen Sharpe.A true cinematic masterpiece.",true cinematic masterpiece,judgment at nuremberg is one great films all time this can be attributed excellent script written by abby mann its skillful direction by stanley kramer possibly one greatest casts ever assembled motion picture subject trial takes place 1948 long after trials major german military generals when most people had lost interest such proceedings writer mann chose write about trial german judges people who above all should have seen evil hitler his followers coming assigned trial as chief judge is dan haywood spencer tracy low profile justice who by his own admission was not original or subsequent choice prosecutor is col tad lansing richard widmark army man who vows convict four ex german judges defending accused is hans rolfe maximillian schell who must convince court that defendants were acting only love their country among defendants are respected judge ernst janning burt lancaster who has written several books law accepted world over lawson accuses defendants signing orders sterilization innocent men execution those who opposed reich extermination jews he puts rudolph peterson montgomery clift stand as victim sterilization rolfe manages expose pitiful peterson as mentally challenged later irene hoffman judy garland is put stand explain her alleged affair at age 16 with elderly jew as his coup de grace lawson shows film depicting horrors german concentration camps between sessions judge haywood strikes up friendship with madame bertholt marlene dietrich widow former german general whose former home judge is staying spite their differences they begin grow fond each other army pressures lawson ease up suggests that acquittal or light sentences would best serve american interests since this was time that blockade berlin was beginning judge haywood is also pressured go easy sentencing maximillian schell deservedly won oscar his outstanding performance as rolfe any one other principals could have easily won as well clift garland are simply outstanding as are widmark lancaster tracy did he ever give bad performance still beautiful dietrich was also excellent others cast are very young william shatner as capt byers court officer werner kemperer as emil hahn most militant defendants ray teal as judge ives teal had long been fixture westerns is probably best remembered playing sheriff coffey tvs bonanza dvd release contains excellent conversation between abby mann maximillian schell plus interview with kramers widow still beautiful former actress karen sharpe true cinematic masterpiece,0.45869047619047615,0.2058928571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?,"I watched ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" on PBS the other night. I had never seen it before. I expected an empty-headed, Hollywood-style, quasi-melodrama, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even Spencer Tracy, that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me, gave an honest and heartfelt portrayal of a ""simple man"" who was also a deeply conflicted judge.What I liked most about this movie was that it didn't pull any punches, in the manner of other ""controversial"" films of its time. The defense attorney, superbly played by Maximilian Schell, weaves a simple, but undeniable web of logic: Sterilization of ""undesirables,"" one of the charges against the Nazi war criminals, was at one time condoned by the U.S. courts, and encouraged by none other than Oliver Wendell Holmes. - Numerous leading industrialists in the U.S. contributed to the development of the Nazi war machine. - Encouragement was given to Hitler's expansionism by both Russia and England. - Churchill is quoted as having admired Hitler. - The Vatican actively collaborated with the Nazis.Correct me if I'm wrong, but it must have taken major cojones to present that kind of message to American filmgoers in 1961. Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?I tend to doubt it. One further note. The film describes how the Nazis went about stripping the German judiciary of judges who were known for their objectivity, and replacing them with judges who were appointed based solely on their party loyalties.The mind boggles at the implications and yes, the prescience of this well-written, well-played masterpiece.",would film that candor have chance being made today,i watched judgment at nuremburg pbs other night i had never seen it before i expected empty headed hollywood style quasi melodrama but i was pleasantly surprised even spencer tracy that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me gave honest heartfelt portrayal simple man who was also deeply conflicted judge what i liked most about this movie was that it didnt pull any punches manner other controversial films its time defense attorney superbly played by maximilian schell weaves simple but undeniable web logic sterilization undesirables one charges against nazi war criminals was at one time condoned by u s courts encouraged by none other than oliver wendell holmes numerous leading industrialists u s contributed development nazi war machine encouragement was given hitlers expansionism by both russia england churchill is quoted as having admired hitler vatican actively collaborated with nazis correct me if im wrong but it must have taken major cojones present that kind message american filmgoers 1961 would film that candor have chance being made today i tend doubt it one further note film describes how nazis went about stripping german judiciary judges who were known their objectivity replacing them with judges who were appointed based solely their party loyalties mind boggles at implications yes prescience this well written well played masterpiece,0.5495879120879121,0.12323717948717948,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,An ageless examination of the aftermath of war,"Full too the brim with more star wattage fire power than a dozen other films combined, Stanley Kramer's Oscar winning courtroom epic Judgment at Nuremberg is a powerful and ageless dialogue heavy classic that remains to this day one of the best World War 2 themed films, all without ever firing a single shot or even a single battle.Inspired by real life courtroom trials that came to public attention in the aftermath of the great war as Nazi members were trialed for their actions during the horrific period in Germany's history, Kramer and Nuremberg's writer Abby Mann (with unofficial work from one of the films stars Montgomery Clift) spend a great deal of time exploring the after effects of the Nazi reign on Germany and how those caught up in the situation dealt with what was for all intents and purposes a hopeless situation to be a part of.Lead by a powerful performance from its main focus Spencer Tracy as aging American judge Dan Haywood (who delivers a stunning final monologue in the films later stretches), we only spend brief moments of Nuremberg's runtime outside of the sweat inducing caught room action that sees Maximillian Schell's defense lawyer Hans Rolfe go head to head with Richard Winmark's American army lawyer Col. Tad Lawson but the film never feels small or confined by its devices as we explore the mental anguish and eye opening examinations of what the war meant outside of the battlefield, what it meant to those everyday people who were nothing more than pawns in a much bigger game of life and death.In this loaded ensemble we also get a memorable Burt Lancaster turn as German judge Dr. Ernst Janning with both the actors performance and characters arc making for an extremely moving examination of a good man caught in an horrific predicament while screen legends such as Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland and a very young William Shatner all deliver great turns with varying degrees of screen time, ensuring Nuremberg is one of the era's most well-rounded examples of a collection of once in a generation talents.The whole production is beautifully constructed by the often underappreciated Stanley Kramer who alongside this effort and the likes of On the Beach, Guess Whose Coming to Dinner, comedy gem It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and The Defiant Ones, established himself as a director of true worth that may not have received the plaudits of some of his era's peers but remains a director with a fantastic catalogue of films he managed to produce in a career that will stand tall during the tests of time.Final Say -Powerful and emotion packed without the need for any theatrics, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the most stunning cinematic examples of a courtroom and World War 2 drama respectively and is a film that should continue to be adored by cinephiles for the years yet to come.5 Opa's out of 5.",ageless examination aftermath war,full too brim with more star wattage fire power than dozen other films combined stanley kramers oscar winning courtroom epic judgment at nuremberg is powerful ageless dialogue heavy classic that remains this day one best world war 2 themed films all without ever firing single shot or even single battle inspired by real life courtroom trials that came public attention aftermath great war as nazi members were trialed their actions during horrific period germanys history kramer nurembergs writer abby mann with unofficial work one films stars montgomery clift spend great deal time exploring after effects nazi reign germany how those caught up situation dealt with what was all intents purposes hopeless situation be part lead by powerful performance its main focus spencer tracy as aging american judge dan haywood who delivers stunning final monologue films later stretches we only spend brief moments nurembergs runtime outside sweat inducing caught room action that sees maximillian schells defense lawyer hans rolfe go head head with richard winmarks american army lawyer col tad lawson but film never feels small or confined by its devices as we explore mental anguish eye opening examinations what war meant outside battlefield what it meant those everyday people who were nothing more than pawns much bigger game life death this loaded ensemble we also get memorable burt lancaster turn as german judge dr ernst janning with both actors performance characters arc making extremely moving examination good man caught horrific predicament while screen legends such as marlene dietrich judy garland very young william shatner all deliver great turns with varying degrees screen time ensuring nuremberg is one eras most well rounded examples collection once generation talents whole production is beautifully constructed by often underappreciated stanley kramer who alongside this effort likes beach guess whose coming dinner comedy gem its mad mad mad mad world defiant ones established himself as director true worth that may not have received plaudits some his eras peers but remains director with fantastic catalogue films he managed produce career that will stand tall during tests time final say powerful emotion packed without need any theatrics judgment at nuremberg is one most stunning cinematic examples courtroom world war 2 drama respectively is film that should continue be adored by cinephiles years yet come 5 opas out 5,0.5521305418719212,0.108111658456486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,~One of the most Powerful Films ever made.~,"Judgement At Nurmeberg is a 1961 film about four Nazi Judges are in trial for crimes against humanity. Well let me just start out by saying that this is a very sad, powerful film. I was expecting it to be very boring and I guess I underestimated it. The film is also very well written, so well written that actually it makes you really think. I'm happy that it won an Oscar for writing. The best quality about the film HAS to be the acting. Judy Garland, I think should of won a Supporting Actress. This is her finest performance ever, and I'm sad she didn't win one. Maximilian Schell gives the performance of a lifetime in his role as the defense attorney for the judges. He truly deserved his Oscar because he was very powerful. Spencer Tracy also gave a quite exceptional performance as he always had. (He isn't a Two-Time Oscar Winner for nothing. As for Montgomery Clift he deserved his Oscar Nomination. I am kind of ticked off that Marlene didn't get an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I always feel she is underrated.As for Stanley Kramer (The Director) he had real talent and this film shows it. The 9-Time Oscar nominated Director should've of won an Oscar for Best Director for Judgement at Nuremberg. I hope his talent though will be remembered for many years to come.My Overall Consensus is that the movie definitely succeeds due to the Extraordinary Performances and the Quite Exceptional Writing.You Should see this Film. 10/10",one most powerful films ever made,judgement at nurmeberg is 1961 film about four nazi judges are trial crimes against humanity well let me just start out by saying that this is very sad powerful film i was expecting it be very boring i guess i underestimated it film is also very well written so well written that actually it makes you really think im happy that it won oscar writing best quality about film has be acting judy garland i think should won supporting actress this is her finest performance ever im sad she didnt win one maximilian schell gives performance lifetime his role as defense attorney judges he truly deserved his oscar because he was very powerful spencer tracy also gave quite exceptional performance as he always had he isnt two time oscar winner nothing as montgomery clift he deserved his oscar nomination i am kind ticked off that marlene didnt get oscar nomination best supporting actress i always feel she is underrated as stanley kramer director he had real talent this film shows it 9 time oscar nominated director shouldve won oscar best director judgement at nuremberg i hope his talent though will be remembered many years come my overall consensus is that movie definitely succeeds due extraordinary performances quite exceptional writing you should see this film 10 10,0.5583333333333333,0.31043209876543215,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,Questions Without Answers - Which Is The History Of Nazi Germany,"Lacking the big names of what people normally think of as the ""Nuremberg Trials"" - the trial of Nazi leaders such as Goering, Hess and Speer - this movie focuses on the lesser known people who were tried for war crimes: the German judges whose responsibility it was to dispense ""justice"" in Hitler's Germany. Although the big names are missing, the movie is powerful and masterfully deals with the troubling questions around Nazism: how could normally good, decent people (represented in this movie by Ernst Janning, played by Burt Lancaster, on trial with three others) have allowed themselves to be sucked into the evil that was Hitler and National Socialism? How could the German people have turned a blind eye to what was going on and simply denied all responsibility? And the movie also considers a troubling question about the United States: if Nazism was evil enough to have warranted a war and then all the effort of the Nuremberg trials, why were the Americans suddenly so willing to ""forgive and forget"" with the onset of the Cold War and the threat of communism?The implication here is that the Americans never really took the secondary trials seriously. A second-rate judge (Dan Haywood, available only because he had been defeated in an election, and played magnificently by Spencer Tracy) was appointed to head the trial, the Army was putting pressure on the prosecution to go lightly. It's an amazing fact of history that within three years of the end of World War II, the feeling was so clearly against pursuing those who had played roles in the Nazi nightmare (and, of course, it's a question that still haunts us today as Nazi war criminals from time to time turn up and the response of the public is often, ""he's an old man. Why bother?"")Focussing largely on the trial itself, the movie is consistently gripping throughout, and even the diversions outside the courtroom (such as the relationship between Judge Haywood and Mrs. Bertholt -Marlene Dietrich) don't detract from the suspense, as they continue to push the question: ""how can you just sit there and deny knowing anything?"" Anyone with an interest in the puzzle of Nazi Germany should watch this. In the end, it raises a lot of questions and offers few answers, but that may be the legacy of Nazism. But the movie makes its point. As Judge Janning talks to Judge Haywood at the end of the movie he says almost pleadingly, ""we never knew it would go so far."" Haywood simply responds, ""Herr Janning, it went that far the first time you convicted a man you knew was innocent.""

8.0,Magnificent film based on actual events with top-notch performances by all star cast,"A stimulating portrayal of the Nuremberg trials in which members of the German judiciary were brought to response their crimes in the immediate post-war period.The movie initiates with scenes of Nuremberg, Germany, 1948. The destruction of the war is clear everywhere. Judge Haywood(Spencer Tracy) is driven through the rotten buildings. Judge Hayward along with two other judges (Ray Teal, Kednneth Mackenna), to preside over the trial of Ministry of Justice, judges and Nazi prosecutors for their complicity in Third Reich. Hayward is helped by his assistant Harrison (William Shatner). In its opening declaration , the prosecution (an excellent prosecutor played by Richard Widmark) calls these defendants to account not for violation of due process or other constitutional violations but for killings, tortures, and cruelties committed during WWII. The accuser statements that the accused cannot claim ignorance that they should have known better for their high position and knowledges.Defender Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) counsel's opening statement he declares that the aim of this judgment is the reestablishment of the code of justice with honor and innocence, because of judges don't make the laws . He argues the disobedience to the Fuehrer would have been choice between patriotism and treason for the justices with the subsequent firing squad. Finally the defending explains that not only are the judges on trial, so are the German people.One of the more dramatic portions of the film centers around Judge Janning's (Burt Lancaster) performance during the Feldenstein case (in real life, the Katzenberger case). Fedlenstein was charged with race mixing, of having relations with an Aryan, Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland). The trial was to be used as a showcase for National Socialism. Emil Hahn (Werner Kemplerer) had been the accuser and he was determined to find Feldenstein guilty despite evidence that he had merely been a family friend to Irene Hoffman. Hahn had told Irene that it was no use to deny having relations. That if she protected Feldenstein she would be arrested for perjury. She said she couldn't lie and was arrested. She said that Emil Hahn mocked Feldenstein, ridiculed him. Janning had been the presiding judge and he took no action to prevent the injustice. He had been the only hope for the defense since he had a reputation for being fair. Feldenstein was found guilty and executed.Prosecutor Lawson (Richard Widmark) submitted documents by which the judges and prosecutors had sent thousands to their deaths. A film was shown , a short-documentary is based on real events by means of photographs and stock-footage. As appears work camps are transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference . At the concentration camps was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates.Millions of prisoners died in the concentration camps through mistreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or were executed as unfit for labor. More than six million Jews died in them, usually in gas chambers, although many were killed in mass shootings and by other means . As the documentary showed a gas chamber at Dachau , but it is a mistake because of it was never used, prisoners died from mistreatment or from execution by means other than gas. The archival footage shows tattooed skin , but Buchenwald prisoners with unusual tattoos were killed , then their skin was preserved for the tattoo collection of convicted war criminal Ilse Koch. Defense counsel speaks to the content of the films shown the previous day. He states that there is no justification for what happened, but, that it was wrong and unfair to show such films in court against these defendants. He claims that the extremists are responsible, not the defendants. He says that very few Germans knew what was going on. He claimed that the defendants stayed in their positions to keep things from getting worse. The defending then calls Irene Hoffman. In this unseemly portion of the defense, the defense counsel tries to portray Irene Hoffman as a law breaker and Judge Janning as merely doing his duty. The hypocrisy is evident and seems to bother even defense counsel Rolfe. Yet he continues to badger Irene, trying to break her down, to show that she did in fact have an affair with Feldenstein. Janning interrupts him and stops him from continuing.The next day Janning testifies about the Feldenstien case. He tells that there was fear in the country. That Hitler told the people to lift their heads. That once the gypsies, Jewish, and others were destroyed all would be well.Janning was content to sit by during his trial until he realized the same arguments were being used in this trial in his defense that had been used in the Feldenstien trial. Janning denies that Germans were unaware of the exterminations. He says that all were aware of what was going on, maybe not the details, but only because they did not want to know the details.Judge Hayward affirms the value of a single human life, and the responsibility of the justices, and by implication the German people, for their actions and inaction. This graphic account of the Nuremberg trials were immediately brought to book and subsequently adapted by Stanley Kramer in ¨Playhouse ¨ style. Judge Haywood is perfectly played by Spencer Tracy, he gives us the uneasy feeling that the German people never really came to terms with their innocence or guilty. This film takes the point of view that Germany, at the time of the picture was realized, was moving beyond the war a little too fast, and was doing so with the help of the US and other allies because of the Cold War. For his passionated acting of the defending advocate Maximilian Schell won an Oscar as the years's best player and special mention Montgomery Clif, also uncredited as screenwriter.

,"A sickening truth, A story needed to be told.","At the end of the Second World War in 1945, the world was dealt the final blow, with the discovery and liberation of the Nazi death camps.The human race who had already faced up to and who had become hardened to nearly six years of murder and violence, found this level of barbarity and cruelty unlike anything the world had witnessed before or since.For four years after the war, the heads of the former Nazi state were gathered and put on trial for their crimes. This film tells the story of these trials at Nuremberg.Richard Widmark, plays an American army officer, one of the unfortunate few who marched in to liberate a concentration camp and was sickened by what he saw, a man who is now hell bent on prosecuting the culprits and bringing them to justice.Spencer Tracy, without doubt one of the greatest screen actors of all time plays Judge Haywood, the man who is to sit in judgement over the proceedings,a man trying to remain impartial, despite his own personal views of disgust and hatred.Burt Lancaster, in probably his finest performance, plays Dr. Ernst Janning, a former German lawyer, a man who had worked for the Nazis and had been responsible for sending many innocent men to their deaths in the interests of Hitler's Reich. A man now eaten away by his inner torment and feelings of guilt. A man who is now on trial for his own life just as his victims had once been on trial for theirs.Maximillian Schell, deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of Hans Rolfe, the German defence lawyer, trying to defend these men he knows are guilty, while at the same time trying to salvage some threads of dignity for the people of his defeated and war battered nation.Other notable performances come from Judy Garland, who showed us what a fine dramatic actress she could be when give the opportunity, and Marlene Deitrich as the widow of an already executed German officer...both performances, especially that of Garland were in my opinion Oscar winning level.It is however Lancaster's performance which gripped me most. He takes the stand against Rolfe's advice and speaks to the court of his crimes, his guilt and his repentance.He says that for the German people to rebuild their self respect, then they need to face up to the terrible things they have done. He lays mention to the fact that most Germans are saying that they didn't know of the death camps, and his speech is both heartfelt and moving.'When train loads of women and children past through our towns, crammed in like cattle on the way to their extermination.....were we blind? When we heard those children crying out to us in the night and did nothing to help them....were we deaf? We didn't know because we didn't WANT to know.' He mentions how he thought Nazism was a good thing in the beginning, but how he had become too heavily involved and was too scared to back out once he realised the levels to which it had risen.A poignant speech and one that still leaves a lump in my throat.Spencer Tracy has the most accurate and thought provoking line in the whole movie.Jannings tells Haywood, that he was shocked and appalled at the figure of six million victims....he explains how he never knew it would go that far.Spence looks down at his shoes and says with neither hatred or kindness, 'It went that far the first time you ever sentenced someone to death whom you knew was innocent.' A truer word could not have been spoken.It is my belief that every person in the entire world should be made to watch two movies as part of their education of life. Schindlers List and Judgement at Nuremberg. In no other film has the horrific and sickening crimes of the Nazis, been described or portrayed more vividly or graphically as in these two productions.It is only by keeping this fresh in the mind of future generations can we ensure it can never happen again.",sickening truth story needed be told,at end second world war 1945 world was dealt final blow with discovery liberation nazi death camps human race who had already faced up who had become hardened nearly six years murder violence found this level barbarity cruelty unlike anything world had witnessed before or since four years after war heads former nazi state were gathered put trial their crimes this film tells story these trials at nuremberg richard widmark plays american army officer one unfortunate few who marched liberate concentration camp was sickened by what he saw man who is now hell bent prosecuting culprits bringing them justice spencer tracy without doubt one greatest screen actors all time plays judge haywood man who is sit judgement over proceedings man trying remain impartial despite his own personal views disgust hatred burt lancaster probably his finest performance plays dr ernst janning former german lawyer man who had worked nazis had been responsible sending many innocent men their deaths interests hitlers reich man now eaten away by his inner torment feelings guilt man who is now trial his own life just as his victims had once been trial theirs maximillian schell deservedly won oscar his portrayal hans rolfe german defence lawyer trying defend these men he knows are guilty while at same time trying salvage some threads dignity people his defeated war battered nation other notable performances come judy garland who showed us what fine dramatic actress she could be when give opportunity marlene deitrich as widow already executed german officer both performances especially that garland were my opinion oscar winning level it is however lancasters performance which gripped me most he takes stand against rolfes advice speaks court his crimes his guilt his repentance he says that german people rebuild their self respect then they need face up terrible things they have done he lays mention fact that most germans are saying that they didnt know death camps his speech is both heartfelt moving when train loads women children past through our towns crammed like cattle way their extermination were we blind when we heard those children crying out us night did nothing help them were we deaf we didnt know because we didnt want know he mentions how he thought nazism was good thing beginning but how he had become too heavily involved was too scared back out once he realised levels which it had risen poignant speech one that still leaves lump my throat spencer tracy has most accurate thought provoking line whole movie jannings tells haywood that he was shocked appalled at figure six million victims he explains how he never knew it would go that far spence looks down at his shoes says with neither hatred or kindness it went that far first time you ever sentenced someone death whom you knew was innocent truer word could not have been spoken it is my belief that every person entire world should be made watch two movies as part their education life schindlers list judgement at nuremberg no other film has horrific sickening crimes nazis been described or portrayed more vividly or graphically as these two productions it is only by keeping this fresh mind future generations can we ensure it can never happen again,0.5385648148148147,0.021504629629629624,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,Hollywood's best in an important film,"It is so easy to dismiss this as a story of other people in another time in another land. Unfortunately, what was done then, is being done by the leaders of our country in the name of protection from terrorists, and we, the people, sit silently by and let it happen just as the German people did seven decades ago.We need to watch films like this over and over to remind us of what is important and what we, as civilized humans, can be reduced to out of fear.This is another great film by the fantastic Abby Mann, who died last month. He won an Oscar for his screenplay, and it was well deserved.Maximilian Schell was simply fantastic, as was Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, and Judy Garland.

The plot is written by Abby Mann who won best screenplay Oscar from that and quite deserving one. The story based on Nuremberg trials held after fall of Nazi's in Germany but this movie is nice blend of history with fiction as the major characters were fictional but the evidences and indictments presented in the trial ever authentic and truly depicts the conditions of Nazi occupied Germany. The most intriguing thing of the movie was the true representation of aftermaths of Nazi's occupation in Germany and the feeling of German toward the trial and immaculate direction of Kramer made possible to convey these types of sentiment on cinema for the very first time. The cast was also fascinating with big names like Tracy and surely he did justice with his role as he was very compelling and humble as Judge Haywood. Maximilian Schell was at his best as a compassionate enthusiastic zealous and patriotic attorney to defend the dignity of Nation. He won best actor Oscar for his role. Montgomery Clift was also the one who made this movie special as he played a role of feeble minded sterile man who was nominated for best actor in supporting role though he only played for 9 min in the movie. Burt Lancaster gave one of the most extraordinary cinematic performances as Ernst Janning.

,The logic of evil.,"I once read a review of this film that criticized the fact that the American chief prosecutor as played by Richard Widmark was a less sympathetic and engaging character than the defending lawyer, Herr Rolfe as portrayed by Max Schell. Schell's Oscar winning performance illuminated the ""shattering truth"" that the film reveals about Nazism. Extremely able and educated men were able to rationalize what they did with an irresistible logic. They loved their country and, in a time of a national crisis, found it necessary to implement certain measures. As expounded by Rolfe, it all sounds so logical and reasonable. He also cites the fact that many world leaders actually commended Hitler upon his leadership in getting Germany out of the Depression as swiftly as he did.Widmark's character, Lawson, is understandably appalled by Herr Rolfe's defence of the indefencible and therefore he pulls no punches. He wants those responsible to be held fully responsible but he finds Germans who are ready to extenuate and rationalize. After he is told to tone down his demands for justice, Lawson acerbically retorts, ""There are no Nazis in Germany. It was those damned Eskimos."" The moment that illuminates how pure reason without humanity is so dangerous is when Pohl, a right hand man for Eichman, explains how it was possible to kill millions of people in purely technical terms. His explanation as he eats his lunch is devoid of any hint of human empathy for the victims he has so blithely exterminated. His was a job that was the logical extension of a policy and he carried it out with a detached and technical logic.The key point that the film makes is that to be logical is not always to be morally right.",logic evil,i once read review this film that criticized fact that american chief prosecutor as played by richard widmark was less sympathetic engaging character than defending lawyer herr rolfe as portrayed by max schell schells oscar winning performance illuminated shattering truth that film reveals about nazism extremely able educated men were able rationalize what they did with irresistible logic they loved their country time national crisis found it necessary implement certain measures as expounded by rolfe it all sounds so logical reasonable he also cites fact that many world leaders actually commended hitler upon his leadership getting germany out depression as swiftly as he did widmarks character lawson is understandably appalled by herr rolfes defence indefencible therefore he pulls no punches he wants those responsible be held fully responsible but he finds germans who are ready extenuate rationalize after he is told tone down his demands justice lawson acerbically retorts there are no nazis germany it was those damned eskimos moment that illuminates how pure reason without humanity is so dangerous is when pohl right hand man eichman explains how it was possible kill millions people purely technical terms his explanation as he eats his lunch is devoid any hint human empathy victims he has so blithely exterminated his was job that was logical extension policy he carried it out with detached technical logic key point that film makes is that be logical is not always be morally right,0.5166185666185665,0.10690235690235692,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,The Complainant At the Bar is Civilization Itself,"Following a trail first started by Marty, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the first films to be taken from television. Abby Mann wrote this script for a live drama on Playhouse 90. Only Maximilian Schell and Werner Klemperer repeated their roles from the 1959 production. Others in that cast were Claude Rains as Judge Haywood and Paul Lukas as the defendant Ernest Janning.Stanley Kramer assembled a cast of some big movie names for his film and directed this film reverently as it has an eternal message. To get the film out of the Nuremberg Tribunal courtroom, the role of the widow of the German general played by Marlene Dietrich was created and the other German citizens were also created show that Kramer could get some dialog in about how the ordinary German felt. In the original play their only advocate is defense lawyer Maximilian Schell.Schell is some good advocate indeed. While not lessening the guilt of any of the four German judges in the dock, he does raise some disturbing questions about other societies and how very easily the slide into totalitarian brutality can happen. He also shows some of the worst aspects in German character in his cross examination of Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift.The Nuremberg Tribunal has been going on four two years now. The big Nazi fish have been dealt with and we're now trying four German judges who apparently forgot all about due process in their efforts to ingratiate themselves with the new Nazi regime. Clift and Garland are two examples of German everypeople who got caught up in it and their performances well merited Oscar nominations in the Supporting player categories.Richard Widmark is the lead prosecutor and this is probably one of the least complex roles Widmark ever played. He's identified as a New Deal liberal, a protégé of the late President Roosevelt. He was in at the liberation of concentration camps and it effected him. It made him the good advocate for civilization itself.In an original cast album of the film, the monologues with Burt Lancaster confessing his guilt and Spencer Tracy rendering the verdicts were included. Lancaster in a smaller way plays the part of Albert Speer who probably escaped the hangman by just throwing himself on the mercy of the court. He's the only one who shows contrition. His confession though is a textbook example of how a demagogue can come to power in a nation left without pride.Spencer Tracy and Maximilian Schell got Academy Award nominations for Best Actor with Schell winning. But Tracy's summation of the trial is devastatingly correct. The real complainant at the bar is civilization itself as he so eloquently states. No player before or since has ever done so many lengthy speeches in his films and done them so well. This is the best of them, a creed for civilization that we as humans should all live by.In some of the smaller roles take note of some good performances by Virginia Christine as Tracy's housekeeper, Werner Klemperer as the unrepentant Nazi judge, and Howard Caine as Judy Garland's husband who does not want her victimized all over again on the witness stand. A real cross section of the German public circa 1948.Judgment at Nuremberg should be seen back to back with Schindler's List as a portrayal of the brutality itself and how civilization tried to deal with the consequences. Judgement at Nuremberg is a film whose message will never not be timely.",complainant at bar is civilization itself,following trail first started by marty judgment at nuremberg is one first films be taken television abby mann wrote this script live drama playhouse 90 only maximilian schell werner klemperer repeated their roles 1959 production others that cast were claude rains as judge haywood paul lukas as defendant ernest janning stanley kramer assembled cast some big movie names his film directed this film reverently as it has eternal message get film out nuremberg tribunal courtroom role widow german general played by marlene dietrich was created other german citizens were also created show that kramer could get some dialog about how ordinary german felt original play their only advocate is defense lawyer maximilian schell schell is some good advocate indeed while not lessening guilt any four german judges dock he does raise some disturbing questions about other societies how very easily slide into totalitarian brutality can happen he also shows some worst aspects german character his cross examination judy garland montgomery clift nuremberg tribunal has been going four two years now big nazi fish have been dealt with were now trying four german judges who apparently forgot all about due process their efforts ingratiate themselves with new nazi regime clift garland are two examples german everypeople who got caught up it their performances well merited oscar nominations supporting player categories richard widmark is lead prosecutor this is probably one least complex roles widmark ever played hes identified as new deal liberal prot g late president roosevelt he was at liberation concentration camps it effected him it made him good advocate civilization itself original cast album film monologues with burt lancaster confessing his guilt spencer tracy rendering verdicts were included lancaster smaller way plays part albert speer who probably escaped hangman by just throwing himself mercy court hes only one who shows contrition his confession though is textbook example how demagogue can come power nation left without pride spencer tracy maximilian schell got academy award nominations best actor with schell winning but tracys summation trial is devastatingly correct real complainant at bar is civilization itself as he so eloquently states no player before or since has ever done so many lengthy speeches his films done them so well this is best them creed civilization that we as humans should all live by some smaller roles take note some good performances by virginia christine as tracys housekeeper werner klemperer as unrepentant nazi judge howard caine as judy garlands husband who does not want her victimized all over again witness stand real cross section german public circa 1948 judgment at nuremberg should be seen back back with schindlers list as portrayal brutality itself how civilization tried deal with consequences judgement at nuremberg is film whose message will never not be timely,0.390719696969697,0.07661130536130535,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,When films like this can be made.......,"If this is not considered as one of THE great films of all time, then all of us film fans should pack up bags and go home I cannot fault anyone, any scene, anything in this film. The dialogue races along in its smooth yet supremely captivating style. You grab a film like this, see a whole host of famous actors, and wonder if such a mix could ever work. It does, believe me, it really, really does.Tracy. He was given the most powerful of dialogues, he presents it to us in a way that does not shout at you, yet holds you in a vice like grip every time he comes on screen.

10.0,The Hare Was Shot by the Hunter in the Bunker,"Abby Mann re-documents his stunning 1959 ""Playhouse 90"" teleplay for director Stanley Kramer, with Maximilian Schell towering over a magnificent ensemble cast. The focus isn't on Nazi atrocities (though they are here, in horrific images). But, this being a trial drama, ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" attempts to answer questions about humanity, beginning with HOW? ""How could this have happened?"" And, while only four mid-level Nazis receive justice, the film makes you wonder Where does punishment for the Holocaust end? And, if you do not stop, don't you become the enemy? That wanders, of course, into subjective interpretation; and, there are certainly others. This only makes an already strong piece of work more relevant. Criticisms about it being fictionalized and too long are curiously incongruent. Fewer people would sit through the real trials. The actors seem to employ demons (two, nakedly) to give electrifying, all-time greatest performances. The film is repellent and manipulative, but necessarily so. It exposes guilt, innocence and timeless evil.********** Judgment at Nuremberg (12/14/61) Stanley Kramer ~ Maximilian Schell, Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland",hare was shot by hunter bunker,abby mann re documents his stunning 1959 playhouse 90 teleplay director stanley kramer with maximilian schell towering over magnificent ensemble cast focus isnt nazi atrocities though they are here horrific images but this being trial drama judgment at nuremberg attempts answer questions about humanity beginning with how how could this have happened while only four mid level nazis receive justice film makes you wonder where does punishment holocaust end if you do not stop dont you become enemy that wanders course into subjective interpretation there are certainly others this only makes already strong piece work more relevant criticisms about it being fictionalized too long are curiously incongruent fewer people would sit through real trials actors seem employ demons two nakedly give electrifying all time greatest performances film is repellent manipulative but necessarily so it exposes guilt innocence timeless evil judgment at nuremberg 12 14 61 stanley kramer maximilian schell spencer tracy montgomery clift judy garland,0.766931216931217,0.06653439153439152,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Probably one of the most important films of the 1960s...still highly relevant...,"JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG was adapted from Abby Mann's TV play and turned into a masterful piece of work by director Stanley Kramer. His sterling cast included SPENCER TRACY and RICHARD WIDMARK (American judge and prosecutor, respectively), German defense attorney MAXIMILIAN SCHELL in his award-winning Best Actor role, and such impressive defendants as MARLENE DIETRICH, JUDY GARLAND and MONTGOMERY CLIFT, all giving deeply felt performances.As every student of history knows, there were trials after World War II held in Nuremberg, Germany for Nazis who committed crimes against humanity during the war. This story concerns some fictional German defendants who were more like second tier when it came to atrocities committed since the primary leaders had already been judged. Nevertheless, their part in the war crimes is investigated as the trial proceeds to occupy most of the film, giving the whole story a claustrophobic feeling, the kind one always gets from a real-life courtroom setting.Tracy has some marvelous speeches to make--and Maximilian Schell has his moments where the viewpoint of an intelligent German defense attorney is seen as opposed to the violently opposite statements of RICHARD WIDMARK as the American prosecutor. The audience is forced to view both viewpoints and, having heard all the evidence presented, make up its own mind as to the outcome.It's an important film historically and one can certainly understand why so many of the actors were honored with Academy Award nominations or winners of Golden Globes. They all play an important part in keeping the film grounded in reality and not given to melodramatic outbursts.Summing up: Honest and thought-provoking, it serves as a valuable history lesson as well as a solid piece of entertainment.",probably one most important films 1960s still highly relevant,judgment at nuremberg was adapted abby manns tv play turned into masterful piece work by director stanley kramer his sterling cast included spencer tracy richard widmark american judge prosecutor respectively german defense attorney maximilian schell his award winning best actor role such impressive defendants as marlene dietrich judy garland montgomery clift all giving deeply felt performances as every student history knows there were trials after world war ii held nuremberg germany nazis who committed crimes against humanity during war this story concerns some fictional german defendants who were more like second tier when it came atrocities committed since primary leaders had already been judged nevertheless their part war crimes is investigated as trial proceeds occupy most film giving whole story claustrophobic feeling kind one always gets real life courtroom setting tracy has some marvelous speeches make maximilian schell has his moments where viewpoint intelligent german defense attorney is seen as opposed violently opposite statements richard widmark as american prosecutor audience is forced view both viewpoints having heard all evidence presented make up its own mind as outcome its important film historically one can certainly understand why so many actors were honored with academy award nominations or winners golden globes they all play important part keeping film grounded reality not given melodramatic outbursts summing up honest thought provoking it serves as valuable history lesson as well as solid piece entertainment,0.503373015873016,0.3045634920634921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Revelation of Horror,"This is a fine film by a fine director, but I can only hope that Stanley Kramer, in committing to full length film a television story, knew at heart the message his movie was trying to say. Because this is truly a message movie, for all mankind, but if the reviews I've read on this site are any indication, the message has been lost to some degree.I've entitled my review ""Revelation of Horror"", but the horror revealed was not the Holocaust. That had already been revealed, although Kramer's film certainly lent its emotional impact. The revelation was a deep, true insight into how it happened, and the horror is that it happened in a civilized country. Few on this earth can imagine the true horror of Nazi Germany--I've read criticism of Widmark's Colonel Lawson as too preachy, but the character and the acting conveyed the mission of one who actually saw the horrors, beyond any scope we can identify with.Kramer's achievement is that everything in this movie reminds us that the Nazi's used every facet of civilization, no matter how minute, to foster their extermination of their enemies, to inculcate it as an ordinary part of life. That was why judges were chosen to portray the issue of ""obeying orders"" versus ""human decency."" Herr Rolf is ""forced"" to defend the worst criminals imaginable, and yet his very defense and the principles behind it are abused in the process, used as a weapon against the very law they represent. Thus did the Nazis prevail with the willing acquiescence of the German people, and the abominable disregard of the rest of the world.The other horror revealed in this film is the incessant excusing of it. Beyond the obvious pleas of the guilty (""We didn't know"", or as one judge says to another, ""Was it possible to kill like that?"") are the multiplicity of subtle excuses: the reminder of centuries' old German culture, Rolf's plaintive cry of ""unfairness"" at the showing of the death camp films because of their inflammatory nature, the invocation of ""Lili Marlene"" throughout the film, to name just a few. While the song evokes sadness, a guilty German society meant for it to invoke sadness. Long before Germany had its country destroyed by bombs, it had its soul destroyed by Hitler.Because this is a courtroom drama, respecting the sacred role of the Rule of Law in safeguarding humanity, almost every scene, every line is a statement that Nazi Germany perverted the Rule of Law, as did the very defense of the war criminals. But what is principle on a small scale of a single man being judged by society becomes outrage when used to defend the indefensible on an impossibly massive scale. Tracy's character at the film's end has a realization that this is so, as well as an awareness that what happened in Germany during the Third Reich was an Aristotelian tragedy for anyone touched by it, even remotely, so that any personal considerations (such as Mrs. Berthold) are made utterly impossible.Rolf's speech about the guilty responsibility of the rest of the world was valid--but he was indicting the world to save one man. Where have we heard that in our own time? This quality about ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" makes its message forever fresh--and its warnings.",revelation horror,this is fine film by fine director but i can only hope that stanley kramer committing full length film television story knew at heart message his movie was trying say because this is truly message movie all mankind but if reviews ive read this site are any indication message has been lost some degree ive entitled my review revelation horror but horror revealed was not holocaust that had already been revealed although kramers film certainly lent its emotional impact revelation was deep true insight into how it happened horror is that it happened civilized country few this earth can imagine true horror nazi germany ive read criticism widmarks colonel lawson as too preachy but character acting conveyed mission one who actually saw horrors beyond any scope we can identify with kramers achievement is that everything this movie reminds us that nazis used every facet civilization no matter how minute foster their extermination their enemies inculcate it as ordinary part life that was why judges were chosen portray issue obeying orders versus human decency herr rolf is forced defend worst criminals imaginable yet his very defense principles behind it are abused process used as weapon against very law they represent thus did nazis prevail with willing acquiescence german people abominable disregard rest world other horror revealed this film is incessant excusing it beyond obvious pleas guilty we didnt know or as one judge says another was it possible kill like that are multiplicity subtle excuses reminder centuries old german culture rolfs plaintive cry unfairness at showing death camp films because their inflammatory nature invocation lili marlene throughout film name just few while song evokes sadness guilty german society meant it invoke sadness long before germany had its country destroyed by bombs it had its soul destroyed by hitler because this is courtroom drama respecting sacred role rule law safeguarding humanity almost every scene every line is statement that nazi germany perverted rule law as did very defense war criminals but what is principle small scale single man being judged by society becomes outrage when used defend indefensible impossibly massive scale tracys character at films end has realization that this is so as well as awareness that what happened germany during third reich was aristotelian tragedy anyone touched by it even remotely so that any personal considerations such as mrs berthold are made utterly impossible rolfs speech about guilty responsibility rest world was valid but he was indicting world save one man where have we heard that our own time this quality about judgment at nuremburg makes its message forever fresh its warnings,0.4828416149068323,-0.028234989648033136,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,"Quite grim, but also very gripping","What can I say? Judgment at Nuremberg was just wonderful. At three hours, it is just mesmerising from start to finish. The subject matter of the story is admittedly grim and hard-hitting, but in the way it is put across and acted it is also incredibly gripping. The production values are striking, Ernest Gold's music is memorable and Kramer's direction is superb. Then there is the script, intelligent, thought-provoking, poignant, quite simply a brilliant screenplay, and the cast is for me one of the best on film. This film does have a lot of dignity, exemplified by Burt Lancaster's thoughtful performance as Ernst Janning, and a startling turn from Maximillian Schell.

10.0,"A great humanistic document, compelling and nearly timeless","I am actually humbled by this film, and I am unusually grateful to have seen it, finally, 45 years after its making.There are some superficial aspects of *Judgement at Nuremberg* that are dated: some of Stanley Kramer's camera-work is unnecessarily showy or gimmicky. Some of the sets are noticeably fake, and some of the dialog is stilted, especially in early scenes outside the courtroom. The music goes momentarily over the top in the climactic confrontation between the key defendant, played by Burt Lancaster, and the chief judge (Spencer Tracy) after the trial.Much more striking, however, are the film's strengths, and how unusually well it holds up. I usually think of Kramer as an overstated liberal autodidact, but here the acting is, for the most part, admirably restrained and authentic. Even *William Shatner*--no kidding--is subtle here. After an unpromisingly sensational opening salvo by Richard Widmark as the chief prosecutor, this movie settles into a gravity, balance and rigorous honesty (both intellectual and emotional) that are utterly necessary for a serious treatment of a subject as overwhelmingly important as the origin and expression of Nazi evil.Balance is a key to this film's greatness. It is not insignificant that it was Maximillian Schell, who played the Nazi judges' defense attorney not as a slimy shyster but as a powerfully rigorous advocate determined to hold the *world's* feet to the fire rather than let his clients become patsies for a vast breakdown of moral responsibility with astonishingly widespread implications. By looking courageously into the teeth of the reality of German society and politics leading up to and during the Second World War and the reality of American, European and Communist moral failings, Abby Mann's great screenplay creates an extraordinarily persuasive context for the extraordinarily powerful thematic statements against Nazi atrocities with which it concludes.Two scenes near the movie's conclusion struck me most powerfully. First, I have never been more sickened, enraged and humbled by visual evidence of the Holocaust than I was when it was presented in the context of the trial at this film's center. Second, I was chilled--frightened in a very contemporary and immediate way--by the great speech of judgment given at the trial's end by Spencer Tracy's Chief Judge Dan Hayward. I urge anyone that is concerned about the erosion of civil liberties in America today to watch this film to better understand how insidiously evil may overtake a modern nation in crisis. More important, I urge anyone that believes that America is today in a crisis that requires extraordinary measures to watch this movie, listen with an open mind to this speech, and consider its implications for the direction of our own country today.Stepping down now from my soap box, let me say more clearly: Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

,A Very Interesting & Well-Crafted Look at a Difficult Subject,"This is a very interesting, well-crafted, and thought-provoking look at a difficult subject from a difficult period in world history. It recreates the complex feelings and issues of the era with care, and it goes out of its way to be fair to all of the characters and what they stand for.Between the difficult decisions involved in determining responsibility for the outrages that took place under the Nazi regime, and the diplomatic worries of the era, there is a lot of emotionally charged material, and yet ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" uses an excellent cast and well-conceived characters to create a movie that is both worthwhile for its themes and interesting to watch.The characters are well-chosen so as to allow the opportunity for each major perspective to have a hearing, and the cast members do quite well in bringing their characters to life. Spencer Tracy gives one of his finest performances as the judge in the center of it all. Very few other actors could have been so believable in portraying the character as he carefully weighs so many different viewpoints, knowing that he must come to a decision.Burt Lancaster is very effective as the most interesting of the defendants, and the one whose case is the hardest to evaluate. His character is contrasted effectively with the other defendants, and Lancaster makes the character interesting and his case significant. Maximilian Schell also succeeds in a challenging role. Marlene Dietrich works well in her role, which represents yet another aspect of the general situation. The other characters likewise all have a purpose, and are all portrayed believably, with Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland in particular standing out as two traumatized witnesses.Even within the lengthy running time, it would not be possible to cover every significant point involved in the discussion. But this dramatization is one of the best depictions available of the dilemmas and challenges that had to be faced in the aftermath of the Second World War.",very interesting well crafted look at difficult subject,this is very interesting well crafted thought provoking look at difficult subject difficult period world history it recreates complex feelings issues era with care it goes out its way be fair all characters what they stand between difficult decisions involved determining responsibility outrages that took place under nazi regime diplomatic worries era there is lot emotionally charged material yet judgment at nuremberg uses excellent cast well conceived characters create movie that is both worthwhile its themes interesting watch characters are well chosen so as allow opportunity each major perspective have hearing cast members do quite well bringing their characters life spencer tracy gives one his finest performances as judge center it all very few other actors could have been so believable portraying character as he carefully weighs so many different viewpoints knowing that he must come decision burt lancaster is very effective as most interesting defendants one whose case is hardest evaluate his character is contrasted effectively with other defendants lancaster makes character interesting his case significant maximilian schell also succeeds challenging role marlene dietrich works well her role which represents yet another aspect general situation other characters likewise all have purpose are all portrayed believably with montgomery clift judy garland particular standing out as two traumatized witnesses even within lengthy running time it would not be possible cover every significant point involved discussion but this dramatization is one best depictions available dilemmas challenges that had be faced aftermath second world war,0.588875,0.21352083333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.53}"
5.0,Verdict Guilty -- Defendants AND Movie,"SPOILERS.I watch this once in a while if it happens to be on TV because the performances are as good as they are. Tracy is the epitome of rock-ribbed Republican rectitude. Widmark is good. Maximilian Schell is nothing less than great. He deserved his awards. Burt Lancaster should avoid any part that calls for an accent unless the movie is a comedy. But Garland and Monty Clift are truly pathetic, for more reasons than the script gives them.But that's the problem with the movie -- the script. The trial is a court set up in such a way that we must fight the values behind World-War-Two Germany all over again. Except for Lancaster's character the defendants are inhuman caricatures. Werner Klemperer is compelled to be a malignant version of Colonel Klink. The others are plain nasty. And Schell must try to get them off by defending their actions, which is impossible. The best he can do for Lancaster is to argue that Lancaster knew the justice system was rotten but was determined to minimize the harm it did by working against it from the inside, occasionally letting rotten things happen because the rottenness was prescribed by the law. If you think about it, that's kind of what a judge is supposed to do, isn't it? See that the law is carried out? Here's how two analysts posed the dilemma: ""The criminal law usually punishes people that break laws, not carry them out. The responsibility imposed by such a standard requires a judge to choose between resigning immediately or becoming an international criminal if he enforces an unjust law or becoming a German criminal if he refuses to enforce it. This is a lot to ask of anyone."" (Bergman and Isamov, ""Reel Justice,"" 1996.)But it's best not to think too hard about this movie. Some idea of its self-congratulatory and self-righteous nature is given by Abby Mann's speech when he won the academy award, accepting it not only for himself but ""for all intellectuals everywhere."" Really. He's very mistaken if he actually believes that this movie is in any way ""intellectual."" It doesn't invite analysis. It invites judgment based on hatred of the Nazis. Or, let's be honest about it, hatred of Germans. There isn't a good German in it. Tracy's butler and his wife seem compliant and obedient but ""we knew nothing of what was going on."" Then there is Marlene Dietrich, cultivated and intelligent and helpful and friendly towards Tracy. When the guilty verdict comes in, her true nature reveals itself and she refuses to answer his phone call, sitting alone in the dark, filled with the kind of anger that brought Hitler to power. (The Germans will never change, not even the best of them.)Tracy has a last jailhouse conversation with Lancaster, at Lancaster's request. Burt has been mute throughout most of the trial, refusing to speak in his own defense, but here he tries to tell Tracy, as one morally upright man to another, that he, Lancaster, didn't know Germany was going to turn into what it did. Tracy sneers at him and says, ""You knew what was going to happen the first time you sent an innocent man to jail."" That's judgment at Nurenberg for you.The movie never asks what a moral person might do in Lancaster's circumstances. Mann and Kramer don't bother to ask because they already know the answer. The rest of us may not be quite so sure what we might do because we are aware of our moral flaws, our weaknesses, our desire to get along trying to do well without stepping on too many toes or striking useless heroic poses. But the writer and director haven't really thought about it. The worst scene in the movie, perhaps, among so many, has Schell grilling Judy Garland (Judy Garland!), who as a young girl had some innocent dalliance with an elderly Jew who was then convicted of consorting with Aryans and was disappeared. The most damning evidence was that she'd been seen sitting on the man's lap. She stutters neurotically while Schell bears down on her and he finally shouts at her -- ""DID YOU -- SIT -- ON -- HIS -- LAP???"" Enough is enough, finally. I really dislike this movie for its fake humanitarianism. The victims were innocent, but does that make all of their countrymen evil? That's the kind of stereotypica, digital, black-and-white thinking that will lead to the next war, the next genocide. If the Nazis hadn't existed we would be almost forced to invent them because as a society we need bad examples. Without evil, how can we possibly convince ourselves that we are good? So we can all leave the theater or switch off the TV, eyes brimming with tears at the tragedy that has been brought to our attention again, cheapened though it is by this film, and go to bed glowing with self satisfaction.",verdict guilty defendants movie,spoilers i watch this once while if it happens be tv because performances are as good as they are tracy is epitome rock ribbed republican rectitude widmark is good maximilian schell is nothing less than great he deserved his awards burt lancaster should avoid any part that calls accent unless movie is comedy but garland monty clift are truly pathetic more reasons than script gives them but thats problem with movie script trial is court set up such way that we must fight values behind world war two germany all over again except lancasters character defendants are inhuman caricatures werner klemperer is compelled be malignant version colonel klink others are plain nasty schell must try get them off by defending their actions which is impossible best he can do lancaster is argue that lancaster knew justice system was rotten but was determined minimize harm it did by working against it inside occasionally letting rotten things happen because rottenness was prescribed by law if you think about it thats kind what judge is supposed do isnt it see that law is carried out heres how two analysts posed dilemma criminal law usually punishes people that break laws not carry them out responsibility imposed by such standard requires judge choose between resigning immediately or becoming international criminal if he enforces unjust law or becoming german criminal if he refuses enforce it this is lot ask anyone bergman isamov reel justice 1996 but its best not think too hard about this movie some idea its self congratulatory self righteous nature is given by abby manns speech when he won academy award accepting it not only himself but all intellectuals everywhere really hes very mistaken if he actually believes that this movie is any way intellectual it doesnt invite analysis it invites judgment based hatred nazis or lets be honest about it hatred germans there isnt good german it tracys butler his wife seem compliant obedient but we knew nothing what was going then there is marlene dietrich cultivated intelligent helpful friendly towards tracy when guilty verdict comes her true nature reveals itself she refuses answer his phone call sitting alone dark filled with kind anger that brought hitler power germans will never change not even best them tracy has last jailhouse conversation with lancaster at lancasters request burt has been mute throughout most trial refusing speak his own defense but here he tries tell tracy as one morally upright man another that he lancaster didnt know germany was going turn into what it did tracy sneers at him says you knew what was going happen first time you sent innocent man jail thats judgment at nurenberg you movie never asks what moral person might do lancasters circumstances mann kramer dont bother ask because they already know answer rest us may not be quite so sure what we might do because we are aware our moral flaws our weaknesses our desire get along trying do well without stepping too many toes or striking useless heroic poses but writer director havent really thought about it worst scene movie perhaps among so many has schell grilling judy garland judy garland who as young girl had some innocent dalliance with elderly jew who was then convicted consorting with aryans was disappeared most damning evidence was that shed been seen sitting mans lap she stutters neurotically while schell bears down her he finally shouts at her did you sit his lap enough is enough finally i really dislike this movie its fake humanitarianism victims were innocent but does that make all their countrymen evil thats kind stereotypica digital black white thinking that will lead next war next genocide if nazis hadnt existed we would be almost forced invent them because as society we need bad examples without evil how can we possibly convince ourselves that we are good so we can all leave theater or switch off tv eyes brimming with tears at tragedy that has been brought our attention again cheapened though it is by this film go bed glowing with self satisfaction,0.526375046142488,0.08911037283130303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,"Reflections from watching ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" again","The first reflection is a musical one, as I suddenly realize how Stanley Kramer liked to use hauntingly beautiful songs to enhance scenes. ""Lili Marleen"" is already itself a languid, melancholic song and the effect it has in ""Nuremberg"" is plain to see. Really ingenious however is the transformation of ""Waltzing Matilda"" into a dreamy a cappella background song that takes the dancing scene in ""On the beach"" (between Gregory Peck and Eva Gardner) to an emotional height.On a more serious plane, it's uncanny how this movie, 45 years later, is still right on its mark about American occupation of foreign soil, as of today. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe's (Maximilian Schell) biggest challenge is not in convincing the tribunal that his client Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) is innocent, but in convincing the client himself. The arguments he put before the court were the best he could marshal under the circumstances: (a) his client was obligated to carry out the law existing in his country at the time, no matter how evil these laws were; (b) if his client, and also the German people, were guilty of condoning Hitler's rise to power, the rest of the world must also be guilty; (c) his client was not aware of the atrocities going on under the Nazi regime, so chillingly depicted by prosecuting attorney Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark). None of these was very compelling but he did the best he could, as even Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) admitted.Rolfe's biggest challenge was to convince Janning that it's up to them both to be the last defense of the dignity of the German people. Without that dignity, Germany could never be rebuilt. But it was Janning, after all, who had better insight and foresight, to be able to see that to uphold the dignity of the German people, he must honestly admit his guilt rather than deny it. Janning was of course right. It's the German leaders who have the courage to admit the Nazi crimes (even when they were not part of it) that enable the country to be raise its head high again, cleansed of atrocities committed by a minority of extremists.The 4 key roles were superbly acted. I realize that it's quite meaningless but if I have to rank them, I would have to put Tracy first, followed by Widmark, Schell (even when he won the Oscar) and Lancaster. Not to be forgotten are the 3 marvelous actors in the supporting roles, played with no less excellence than the key roles  Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Cliff and Judy Garland (not in any particular order).",reflections watching judgement at nuremberg again,first reflection is musical one as i suddenly realize how stanley kramer liked use hauntingly beautiful songs enhance scenes lili marleen is already itself languid melancholic song effect it has nuremberg is plain see really ingenious however is transformation waltzing matilda into dreamy cappella background song that takes dancing scene beach between gregory peck eva gardner emotional height more serious plane its uncanny how this movie 45 years later is still right its mark about american occupation foreign soil as today defense attorney hans rolfes maximilian schell biggest challenge is not convincing tribunal that his client ernst janning burt lancaster is innocent but convincing client himself arguments he put before court were best he could marshal under circumstances his client was obligated carry out law existing his country at time no matter how evil these laws were b if his client also german people were guilty condoning hitlers rise power rest world must also be guilty c his client was not aware atrocities going under nazi regime so chillingly depicted by prosecuting attorney col tad lawson richard widmark none these was very compelling but he did best he could as even judge dan haywood spencer tracy admitted rolfes biggest challenge was convince janning that its up them both be last defense dignity german people without that dignity germany could never be rebuilt but it was janning after all who had better insight foresight be able see that uphold dignity german people he must honestly admit his guilt rather than deny it janning was course right its german leaders who have courage admit nazi crimes even when they were not part it that enable country be raise its head high again cleansed atrocities committed by minority extremists 4 key roles were superbly acted i realize that its quite meaningless but if i have rank them i would have put tracy first followed by widmark schell even when he won oscar lancaster not be forgotten are 3 marvelous actors supporting roles played with no less excellence than key roles marlene dietrich montgomery cliff judy garland not any particular order,0.5499682539682539,0.14052910052910053,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"
