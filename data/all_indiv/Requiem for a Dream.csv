9.0,"Great movie, I hated every minute of it","This movie is about how drugs can affect your life. Watching this movie really hurts. If you want to convince someone to stop doing drugs / live more healthy this is the movie to do it. Great acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn) and a realistic / convincing story but man is it painful to watch. This is the kind of movie you are happy to have watched at some point but you don't want to rewatch it because it is a real mood killer.9/10 would recommend if you are looking for a heavy, dramatic movie.",great movie i hated every minute it,this movie is about how drugs can affect your life watching this movie really hurts if you want convince someone stop doing drugs live more healthy this is movie do it great acting especially by ellen burstyn realistic convincing story but man is it painful watch this is kind movie you are happy have watched at some point but you dont want rewatch it because it is real mood killer 9 10 would recommend if you are looking heavy dramatic movie,0.6137254901960785,0.17468805704099824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.11}"
10.0,A visual assault on the senses about the hellishness of addiction.,"Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all star in this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent. When the film begins, the first three folks are all using heroin yet seem to be reasonably functional. Over the course of the film, their lives begin to disintegrate badly. At the same time, Burstyn plays an older woman who becomes addicted to amphetamines because of an irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy...and she goes from a relatively normal lady to someone who seems like she's crossed over the line from sanity to oblivion.""Requiem for a Dream"" is an exceptional movie and there's nothing else like it. However, it's a film that I am happy did not spur on other similar films, as it's also a visual assault on the senses and very difficult to watch...and I would hate to see film after film made like this Darren Aronofsky project. Using rapid intercutting (far, far more than normal) of scenes, fisheye lenses, exaggerated sound effects, shaking lenses, multipanes, television characters that come popping out of the screen and other strange gimmicks, he makes the viewer feel as if they, too, are stuck in the throes of addiction and, eventually, insanity! It's mesmerizing as well as unpleasant...and it's appropriately so considering the subject matter. In fact, I don't think a better film has ever been made about the hellishness of addiction...it sure captures it in all its vivid awfulness!In addition to the incredibly clever use of all these films techniques, the movie has a lot going for it. The script, though very episodic, works well...and is made all the better thanks to some amazing performances, particularly by Burstyn. My only complaint about the film, and it's very minor, is that Jennifer Connelly is just way too pretty to be playing a woman who is that addicted. Sure, over time she falls apart...but she still looks model beautiful during most of the film. She would have been better looking skankier...or an uglier actress might have worked better!So who would I recommend should see this film? Well, anyone who loves films and longs for something different should certainly see the film. Also, despite all the nudity, violence, vomiting and nastiness, I actually recommend parents consider showing it to their kids (especially if the teens have begun dabbling in drugs or thing it looks cool or fun). It will do far more to discourage them from using drugs than any pat message or sermonizing!! It shows drugs in all its sleazy awfulness....no holds barred. I challenge you to find a film THIS difficult to watch and effective when it comes to presenting the effects of drugs. I am not sure how the film received an R rating, as it seems more like something that should be NC-17. Horrible to watch...especially as the film progresses, so don't say you weren't warned!! By the end, I was in tears...I should note that the Etc (electro-convulsive therapy) they show in the film is similar to the type done decades ago. They do NOT do shock treatment like this today and it is a relatively benign sort of treatment for folks who simply won't respond to other treatments for depression...thank goodness.",visual assault senses about hellishness addiction,jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly ellen burstyn all star this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent when film begins first three folks are all using heroin yet seem be reasonably functional over course film their lives begin disintegrate badly at same time burstyn plays older woman who becomes addicted amphetamines because irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy she goes relatively normal lady someone who seems like shes crossed over line sanity oblivion requiem dream is exceptional movie theres nothing else like it however its film that i am happy did not spur other similar films as its also visual assault senses very difficult watch i would hate see film after film made like this darren aronofsky project using rapid intercutting far far more than normal scenes fisheye lenses exaggerated sound effects shaking lenses multipanes television characters that come popping out screen other strange gimmicks he makes viewer feel as if they too are stuck throes addiction eventually insanity its mesmerizing as well as unpleasant its appropriately so considering subject matter fact i dont think better film has ever been made about hellishness addiction it sure captures it all its vivid awfulness addition incredibly clever use all these films techniques movie has lot going it script though very episodic works well is made all better thanks some amazing performances particularly by burstyn my only complaint about film its very minor is that jennifer connelly is just way too pretty be playing woman who is that addicted sure over time she falls apart but she still looks model beautiful during most film she would have been better looking skankier or uglier actress might have worked better so who would i recommend should see this film well anyone who loves films longs something different should certainly see film also despite all nudity violence vomiting nastiness i actually recommend parents consider showing it their kids especially if teens have begun dabbling drugs or thing it looks cool or fun it will do far more discourage them using drugs than any pat message or sermonizing it shows drugs all its sleazy awfulness no holds barred i challenge you find film this difficult watch effective when it comes presenting effects drugs i am not sure how film received r rating as it seems more like something that should be nc 17 horrible watch especially as film progresses so dont say you werent warned by end i was tears i should note that etc electro convulsive therapy they show film is similar type done decades ago they do not do shock treatment like this today it is relatively benign sort treatment folks who simply wont respond other treatments depression thank goodness,0.5995610119047617,0.09530133928571427,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,"Great direction, great acting, great score, great script combine to produce a great film that is depressing but totally gripping even if it will not be to everyone's taste","Harry and Tyrone are drug users who decide to try and make some money by cutting their cocaine and selling it on. This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with $20 bills  Harry even buys his mother, Sara, a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news, after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high, things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price  forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile, Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills, morning, noon and night.I came to this film with not even the slightest idea of what it was about but only that it was supposed to be 'good'. I was not totally prepared for a story that grabbed me from the start and delivered an intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting, amazingly stylish directing, editing and production. While this onslaught will not be to everyone's tastes, I defy pretty much anyone not to be astonished by this film although I expect many will find it to be a pretty hard ride. The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control  and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is; I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and, although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine, is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing  and I'm not overdoing that; hers is a fearless performance that is totally, totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be. Connelly is the next to stick in the mind, conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs  an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans; I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here  avoiding all the ethnic clichés that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on (as the extras on the DVD show). Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David, Baker, Weeks and Naidu only help.Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well  making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course, some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see  certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two, while others will look at the reference to Dark City (even though Aronofsky) or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time; this is not a rip off or a fluke, this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images, increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times, tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive  whether it be the different cameras, the make up, the editing, the use of mobile stop motion, it is all impressive.Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak, relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances  in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic. I am rarely left breathless by a film but I was by this one and I honestly cannot believe that this escaped me for so many years.",great direction great acting great score great script combine produce great film that is depressing but totally gripping even if it will not be everyones taste,harry tyrone are drug users who decide try make some money by cutting their cocaine selling it this idea works very well pair start filling shoe box with 20 bills harry even buys his mother sara television make up all times that he used steal her old one sell it cash sara has her won good news after years being ordinary lonely widow she has chance appear television show herself is actively dieting try fit into her favourite dress it with harrys girlfriend pregnant but happily high things take bad turn when rival dealers start war dramatically cut availability up price forcing harry tyrone do whatever they can get not only fix but supply sell meanwhile saras desire lose weight sees her starting regime diet pills morning noon night i came this film with not even slightest idea what it was about but only that it was supposed be good i was not totally prepared story that grabbed me start delivered intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting amazingly stylish directing editing production while this onslaught will not be everyones tastes i defy pretty much anyone not be astonished by this film although i expect many will find it be pretty hard ride story sees four characters each getting into addiction having it cause their lives spiral out control thats pretty much it however it is not so much story but telling because it is delivery that makes film as amazing compelling as it is i dont want oversell it but all aspects this film come together perfectly writing is realistic although not containing speeches that make cast shine is really well written never strikes bum note script writes highs lows addiction so very well that it is easy forget that what you see film has come script story boards course without delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances burstyn is amazing im not overdoing that hers is fearless performance that is totally totally convincing her descent is so tragic involving that it is major art story instead subplot it appeared it would be connelly is next stick mind conveying total peace beauty when things are good but terrible sweaty look inner agony her face as she degrades herself drugs amazing performance leto is not someone im that aware but he was good here held his own well beside two actresses however actual surprise film came wayans im so used hating him lazy performances that i forgot he can act he is good here avoiding all ethnic clich s that he usually does mcdonald is excellent his cleverly used segments it is easy dismiss his performance as cheesy easy but he does get it spot as extras dvd show supporting roles people recognisable likes david baker weeks naidu only help course main impact film comes relentless direction that not only produces stylish product but also draws audience into highs lows characters experience as well as repetitive rituals their lives he also handles hallucinations really well making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly i cannot describe it very well but direction really hits nail head with heavy style different techniques course some may feel that they have seen elements it before will say aronofsky that he has borrowed much what we see certainly front mounted camera characters harks back mean streets spike lee name two while others will look at reference dark city even though aronofsky or claim that hyper direction is trainspotting x10 however accuse him just stealing is lazy nonsensical because he weaves it altogether whole running time this is not rip off or fluke this is talented director spinning style substance score by mansell kronos quartet is perfect is wonderful compliment images increasing their impact making film feel fast exciting at times tragic moving at other times these are just two examples but film is technically impressive whether it be different cameras make up editing use mobile stop motion it is all impressive overall this is amazing film but it is not one that will appeal all audiences it is bleak relentless hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you refuses let you go until very end film has simple plot but great script that is delivered by collection great performances particular burstyn connelly direction only adds aronofskys reputation original score is fantastic i am rarely left breathless by film but i was by this one i honestly cannot believe that this escaped me so many years,0.6259144088669951,0.21170361247947456,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Like being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by Mike Tyson,"It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.I bought the film on DVD the day it came out, but it took me around six months to watch it again. And only then because a friend of mine was curious. If anything, the impact was heavier than the first time I watched it and I've vowed never to watch it ever again.Yet I have still awarded a rating of 10 on imdb and would definitely assert that it's one of the three greatest films I have ever seen. Why? The acting is just amazing. Jennifer Connolly gives the best performance of her career (not too tricky considering the movies she's been in) and remains stunningly beautiful (in a haggard sort of a way) and noble even when she's roped into a gang bang to fund her heroin habit. Jared Leto annoyed me intensely in Fight Club but he's perfect as hapless junky Harry - forever exuding an air of kindly incompetence that endears him to the audience but that will ultimately destroy him. Marlon Wayans is equally brilliant - wearing a beaming smile for the first half of the film and a compelling look of confusion and betrayal for the rest of it.As for Ellen Burstyn... never has an actress been so unfairly cheated out of an Oscar (and I've seen the atrocity that won Marcia Gay Harden that Oscar for). She is just the picture of sadness the whole film through - a heartbreaking example of what loneliness can do to vulnerable people. The scene where she complains to Harry about being old is honestly one of the most tragic things I've ever seen and it makes me want to break down just thinking about it.As such, I can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations. If your favourite film is 'You've Got Mail' steer well clear. If 'Snow Dogs' has been your most thrilling cinematic experience of this year then put this film back on the shelf. Trust me, it'll save the costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions.However, if you believe that cinema is an important tool in helping us understand ourselves and that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing the absolute depths of despair and self-destruction then you must watch Requiem For a Dream.",like being repeatedly punched back head by mike tyson,its difficult know what say about requiem dream i first saw it cinema when it was released england i have never seen audience react film like this one climactic sequence where protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions seemed trigger bout heavy breathing audience as it was ending i heard few people crying my girlfriend i didnt say single word each other bus home i bought film dvd day it came out but it took me around six months watch it again only then because friend mine was curious if anything impact was heavier than first time i watched it ive vowed never watch it ever again yet i have still awarded rating 10 imdb would definitely assert that its one three greatest films i have ever seen why acting is just amazing jennifer connolly gives best performance her career not too tricky considering movies shes been remains stunningly beautiful haggard sort way noble even when shes roped into gang bang fund her heroin habit jared leto annoyed me intensely fight club but hes perfect as hapless junky harry forever exuding air kindly incompetence that endears him audience but that will ultimately destroy him marlon wayans is equally brilliant wearing beaming smile first half film compelling look confusion betrayal rest it as ellen burstyn never has actress been so unfairly cheated out oscar ive seen atrocity that won marcia gay harden that oscar she is just picture sadness whole film through heartbreaking example what loneliness can do vulnerable people scene where she complains harry about being old is honestly one most tragic things ive ever seen it makes me want break down just thinking about it as such i can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations if your favourite film is youve got mail steer well clear if snow dogs has been your most thrilling cinematic experience this year then put this film back shelf trust me itll save costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions however if you believe that cinema is important tool helping us understand ourselves that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing absolute depths despair self destruction then you must watch requiem dream,0.608325702075702,0.1425442612942613,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,Good Lord!,"I was tempted to title this ""Drugs are bad, mm'kay?"" because ""Requiem"" was so sad I was desperate to inject some humor. Man, what a sad, scary, excellent, grim, disturbing, well-made movie. The more I read about RFAD and learned, the more fascinating it seemed. I'm one of those people who, upon hearing a movie is extremely shocking, has a burning urge to see it as fast as possible to see if it shocks me (especially unrated or NC-17), since I'm pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.Unfortunately, I read so much about the making of the movie that I knew a little too much about the plot going in, so there were few plot surprises. ""Requiem"" concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can start her own business. Their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. VERY ugly. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress to appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out addicted to TV and candy, but has the bad luck to visit a doctor who-in what I thought was the only unrealistic aspect-gives her an RX for 'diet pills', that turn out to be speed. I say unrealistic because, as anyone who's ever worked in the medical profession knows, few doctors will write a new patient a huge prescription for extremely powerful, addictive controlled substances without even an exam.I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes her pills and starts losing weight, plus suddenly becoming energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug, her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use, so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through, Harry visits her --the only visit where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope. He's briefly riding high (in more ways than one) and announces he bought her a big-screen TV; he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that ""TV is her fix"". He looks uneasy when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning, then he hears her grinding her teeth, and figures it out ...the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung-out hallucinations-starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. An aggressive fridge may sound Monty Python-esque now, but trust me, you won't be smiling by the end of the movie.One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug, and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high, there's a slam-bang fast-cut montage of the same images over and over; a sigh, a pupil dilating, cells changing color. The description I probably agree with most came from Aronofsky himself; he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome, depressing, worst-case-scenario fates of all four characters are just as intense, hard to watch, and nightmarish as I heard they were. I don't think I will ever forget Harry's mother's transformation from a harmless, plump, friendly older woman to someone so frightening looking that people cringe away in fear and revulsion at the sight of her.My only complaints would be that I wished there was more time for character development. The film is divided into 3 segments, Summer (things going fine, having fun getting high) Fall (the beginning of the downhill slide) and Winter (end of the line). I would've liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before addiction, as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is stellar- Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros- I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it, but here ...wow. I would've liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before, but he's excellent and also almost unrecognizable (he dropped 1/5 of his weight for the role and oh, it shows). Connelly I actively disliked before, but I was very impressed and now know she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime- not only convincing, but dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell; few actresses over 55 would probably be as fearless.Not recommended if you're easily shocked, squeamish, or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place, stay away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board, and we all who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition, this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supported/glorified that whole 'heroin chic' crap. Also a good movie if you are having some problems in your life and want to put them in perspective VERY fast. 9 out of 10 stars.

9.0,"""Requiem"" Is a Heavyweight","You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction. I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film ""Pi,"" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style. Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia. Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in ""The Exorcist.""But this is a director's film if there ever was one. Aronofsky knows how to tell a story in a way that is dazzling in its use of sound, editing, and cinematography. The score by the Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell is the most striking movie music I have heard in a very long time.""Requiem for a Dream"" is not a movie for everyone. It is the essence of independent filmmaking, a daring, engrossing, artful film that stays with you long after you leave the theater.

,"Disturbing, Graphic and Great","I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close.

10.0,"Brutal, honest, and a must see movie","This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two). This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence. Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you. I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves. Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time) BRUTAL film. The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role. Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.

10.0,Absolutely Heartbreaking,"I had been looking forward to Aronofsky's follow-up to his critically acclaimed art-house film, Pi, of a few years back and when it did finally open in 1 theatre in Toronto, I gathered a bunch of friends to go down and see it. Some have never even heard of Pi before. For others, this would be their first Independent film experience. However, coming out of the movie, we all agreed that it was one of most powerful piece of contemporary cinema that anyone has seen.""Requiem for a Dream"" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it be family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favourite red dress, that she wore to her sun's graduation, on television. However, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. All of the characters have drugs (the bad kind) affect their lives, which eventually take over their lives. The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at, Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high' - all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast I started to find it hard to keep up, and literally took my breath away as the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that I have not personally experienced when watching any film before.As the title indicates, ""Requiem for a Dream"" does not contain a happy ending. It is in no way optimistic, and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness. However, It does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety. It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies.",absolutely heartbreaking,i had been looking forward aronofskys follow up his critically acclaimed art house film pi few years back when it did finally open 1 theatre toronto i gathered bunch friends go down see it some have never even heard pi before others this would be their first independent film experience however coming out movie we all agreed that it was one most powerful piece contemporary cinema that anyone has seen requiem dream tells story 4 people connected either through blood or some kind personal relationship whether it be family girlfriend or business partner although characters lived far what you i would consider be normal lifestyles they shared something common with each every member audience hopes aspirations dreams sara goldfarb played so wonderfully by ellen burstyn dreams one day being tv show one day gets her chance she fantasizes about how she could wear her favourite red dress that she wore her suns graduation television however upon trying wear red dress sara discovers that she has gained some weight over years tries desperately lose her weight eventually resorting medication all characters have drugs bad kind affect their lives which eventually take over their lives movie documents how each 4 people are effected eroded by drugs look film is extremely stylized but justifiably so aronofsky uses surreal imagery as vehicle realism something that really works when done well done well it was by using combination slow fast motion shots extreme close ups more edits than you can shake stick at aronofsky successfully brings audience into world mind someone with drug problem audience visually experiences first hand what it is like be scared or high all this 3rd person all this comfort theatre chair course all this effort would be vain if it didnt mean anything at end film leads audience down spiral addiction until grand finale which features montage graphically intense scenes images with more edits per second than any film pacing at end when compared earlier parts movie was so fast i started find it hard keep up literally took my breath away as credits came up all all effect was amazing something that i have not personally experienced when watching any film before as title indicates requiem dream does not contain happy ending it is no way optimistic only gives audience faint pieces hope happiness however it does show what desperate people are willing do how desperation will change someones life its entirety it is recognition desperation where hope lies,0.585037393162393,0.0973344017094017,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"

8.0,The ultimate addiction movie,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American 100-minute film from 2000 and probably still the most known work by director Darren Aronofsky, who also worked on adapting Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel for the screen here, actually with the late Selby himself. The cast includes Ellen Burstyn, already an Oscar winner at that point, the super stunning Jennifer Connelly, briefly before her Oscar win, and Jared Leto, a recent Oscar winner, so acting talent is certainly enough in here. Still this is a film that is really a lot more about the story and the overall picture than about individual performances, even if Burstyn managed to get nominated again, which was her most recent nomination at the Oscars, maybe even her final. I find it pretty shocking though that the movie did not get any nominations for other cast members (Leto and Connelly would not have been undeserving), for the direction, for the script, also for the make-up and for the truly memorable soundtrack. It is without a doubt one of the very best films from the first year of the new millennium and besides Gladiator it is also probably the most known from that year.There are so many excellent aspects about the film it's tough to decide with which to start first. Maybe Burstyn's performance, who is certainly one of the best portrayals of loneliness and delusion I have ever seen. The whole red-dress story-line is extremely heartbreaking and her one scene with Leto is a definite contender for best-acted scene of the year and probably also the main reason why she was nominated for an Oscar. I'd be honestly very surprised if I end up liking Roberts (the winner) more than Burstyn. The main theme is a piece of brilliance and not only utterly catchy, but also very fitting to the story in terms of the contents. I just used the word ""heartbreaking"" and this is pretty much what can be used to describe the fate of each and every character in here. Their addictions to whatever they are addicted to is destroying their lives. The four central characters lose their dignity, their limbs, their sanity, their friends, their businesses, their freedom and a lot more because of how they cannot get away from their drugs. So they lose basically everything except their lives eventually. All the final shots from the characters in their moments of biggest agony are really memorable of course, but I like to mention the one with Connelly's character especially as we see her lying down after this fateful night and we see that it's not Leto's character in her arms, but that all her love is for her drug now which is the movie at its most depressing. And if you see the very final scene with the television appearance and mother and son being reunited as something positive only because Burstyn's character does and she is somewhat happy in her own fictitious right, that's up to you of course.All in all, I think no matter from which perspective you see this film, it is a true piece of art. I also think it is a really important film because honestly I could not think of a better anti-drug and anti-addiction film than this one here. Is there anything wrong with it? One needs to dig very deep to find flaws here. Maybe Wayans' character is a bit of a filler to be honest as his story was basically a poor man's version of Leto's character's story and did not add too much. But it's not bad either and maybe just forgettable because everything else about this film is so outstandingly memorable. A bit on the filler side perhaps. Anyway, if there are still people out there who have not yet seen these slightly over 1.5 hours more than 1.5 decades after they came out, then it's high time. This movie is a must-see and it has aged brilliantly in a way where you really don't want to miss out. That is if you don't mind the very graphic aspect in here when it comes to violence, drug abuse and other stuff that is not too beautiful to watch like vomiting scenes. But it belongs to this film like everything else and just results in more realistic elements overall, which is definitely another reason to give it a thumbs-up. Nothing about this film is for the sake of it. Highly highly recommended. Aronofsky was only around the age of 30 when he made this, his second full feature film and what an achievement for such a young director.",ultimate addiction movie,requiem dream is american 100 minute film 2000 probably still most known work by director darren aronofsky who also worked adapting hubert selby jr s novel screen here actually with late selby himself cast includes ellen burstyn already oscar winner at that point super stunning jennifer connelly briefly before her oscar win jared leto recent oscar winner so acting talent is certainly enough here still this is film that is really lot more about story overall picture than about individual performances even if burstyn managed get nominated again which was her most recent nomination at oscars maybe even her final i find it pretty shocking though that movie did not get any nominations other cast members leto connelly would not have been undeserving direction script also make up truly memorable soundtrack it is without doubt one very best films first year new millennium besides gladiator it is also probably most known that year there are so many excellent aspects about film its tough decide with which start first maybe burstyns performance who is certainly one best portrayals loneliness delusion i have ever seen whole red dress story line is extremely heartbreaking her one scene with leto is definite contender best acted scene year probably also main reason why she was nominated oscar id be honestly very surprised if i end up liking roberts winner more than burstyn main theme is piece brilliance not only utterly catchy but also very fitting story terms contents i just used word heartbreaking this is pretty much what can be used describe fate each every character here their addictions whatever they are addicted is destroying their lives four central characters lose their dignity their limbs their sanity their friends their businesses their freedom lot more because how they cannot get away their drugs so they lose basically everything except their lives eventually all final shots characters their moments biggest agony are really memorable course but i like mention one with connellys character especially as we see her lying down after this fateful night we see that its not letos character her arms but that all her love is her drug now which is movie at its most depressing if you see very final scene with television appearance mother son being reunited as something positive only because burstyns character does she is somewhat happy her own fictitious right thats up you course all all i think no matter which perspective you see this film it is true piece art i also think it is really important film because honestly i could not think better anti drug anti addiction film than this one here is there anything wrong with it one needs dig very deep find flaws here maybe wayans character is bit filler be honest as his story was basically poor mans version letos characters story did not add too much but its not bad either maybe just forgettable because everything else about this film is so outstandingly memorable bit filler side perhaps anyway if there are still people out there who have not yet seen these slightly over 1 5 hours more than 1 5 decades after they came out then its high time this movie is must see it has aged brilliantly way where you really dont want miss out that is if you dont mind very graphic aspect here when it comes violence drug abuse other stuff that is not too beautiful watch like vomiting scenes but it belongs this film like everything else just results more realistic elements overall which is definitely another reason give it thumbs up nothing about this film is sake it highly highly recommended aronofsky was only around age 30 when he made this his second full feature film what achievement such young director,0.5693617376775271,0.19379851143009044,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,Suicidal,"Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.",suicidal,well i ve seen pi was fascinated now there s requiem dream my expectations were very very high that can be downfall movie but this case i wasn t disappointed aronofsky proves not only that he can direct bigger movie he also shows how one can do so without selling out be more precise rfad is one most disturbing depressing movies that came out us looooong time opening scene its final curtain it s well requiem characters who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors ellen burstyn is unbelievable power her performance can only be compared that bj rk dancer dark aronofskys direction is even more experimental than pi some his ideas like his combination sound picture are really innovative give his movie musical feel without creating long music video downside you could say that this movie offers no hope no solution but then this would ve been lousy compromise,0.6021666666666667,0.07533333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.61}"

9.0,No need for a comfort zone.,"Requiem for a Dream (2000) - Directed by Darren AronofskyThis film is a human-character-study. Darren Aronofsky's, crazy, rollercoaster, drug-induced Requiem for a Dream (2000). Aronofsky gives that 1980s feel to the viewer throughout the film. It has a fantastic calling to old-Hollywood-style film-making. The best component to the film is the acting.Ellen Burstyn is Sara Goldfarb, a retired couch-potato, who is addicted to a bad self-help TV show that cons her into believing she can lose weight if she uses certain drugs, Pharmaceuticals that eventually destroy her mind and create a horrible addiction. Meanwhile, her dead-beat son, Harry (Jared Leto), comes up with the brilliantly dumb idea of creating a haven for himself, his friend, Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), by getting into the street-drug-business. Unfortunately, he and his friends are all now junkies and things don't go so well as planned.This film is not for the squeamish. It involves many horrible aspects of life, the terrible things humans are capable of doing to themselves and the consequences of such poor decisions. It does manage to pull at the heart-strings and makes you feel very sorry for these people. I won't say anymore, but there is a reason why Ellen Burstyn was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar that year. The directing, camera-work and editing is fantastic and quite fitting for the drug-incited delusions seen in the film. The film is rated R, but could have gone even further. Jennifer Connelly's performance is staggeringly good. She definitely leaves her comfort zone for this film. For myself, this film shocked, brought out many emotions and contained a life-lesson we should all pay attention to.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB",no need comfort zone,requiem dream 2000 directed by darren aronofskythis film is human character study darren aronofskys crazy rollercoaster drug induced requiem dream 2000 aronofsky gives that 1980s feel viewer throughout film it has fantastic calling old hollywood style film making best component film is acting ellen burstyn is sara goldfarb retired couch potato who is addicted bad self help tv show that cons her into believing she can lose weight if she uses certain drugs pharmaceuticals that eventually destroy her mind create horrible addiction meanwhile her dead beat son harry jared leto comes up with brilliantly dumb idea creating haven himself his friend tyrone marlan wayans harrys girlfriend marion jennifer connelly by getting into street drug business unfortunately he his friends are all now junkies things dont go so well as planned this film is not squeamish it involves many horrible aspects life terrible things humans are capable doing themselves consequences such poor decisions it does manage pull at heart strings makes you feel very sorry these people i wont say anymore but there is reason why ellen burstyn was nominated best actress oscar that year directing camera work editing is fantastic quite fitting drug incited delusions seen film film is rated r but could have gone even further jennifer connellys performance is staggeringly good she definitely leaves her comfort zone this film myself this film shocked brought out many emotions contained life lesson we should all pay attention 9 0 mygrade 9 imdb,0.5771756978653532,-0.07623152709359605,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Descending Into Junkie Hell.,"One of the anti-drug slogans in the 80s was ""Just say no,"" and it was given to us by not just the then First Lady, but by a slew of actors, many of them neck-deep into their own drug-induced binges fueled by too much money and a total lack of advice. If this movie had only come out then. Darren Aronofsky's powerful film REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that ultimate slogan who never preaches its message: it just allows its presence to slowly filter itself into the images as the four people at the core of this story slowly begin to rot from the inside out as their ""dreams"" ultimately become replaced by the need to get high.What begins as just another story of regular people living in relative complacency in Brooklyn, NY, each of them wearing their aspirations on their sleeves -- Sara Goldfarb to go on television; her son Harry and his friend Tyrone to make it big; Harry's girlfriend Marian to become an dress designer in her own right -- starts to go sour almost immediately. Sara, a widow living a lonely life, gets a call (or imagines it as it can be interpreted) that comes as a promise for things to get better: she will be a contestant in her favorite TV show which she watches compulsively as she downs sweets and to get slim for her Big Night she decides to take some ""diet pills"" to fit into her Red Dress. Harry and Tyrone experiment a little with the drugs they are selling and that leads to more and more and more. Into that web Marian is pulled, maybe out of her own displacement in the world, and since drugs passively target towards the displaced and the unwanted, making it all seem better -- we are informed that she is on the outs with her family even as they have given her full use of the apartment she lives in -- she falls under its spell.One would think, though, that with drug usage things would change, perception would change. That we see Sara going through the motions not once, twice, but for hours and hours and hours on a stretch as the ""diet pills"" -- really speed -- take a hold over her is made more frightening when her own body starts cannibalizing itself and her own mind begins to wander. Her own security, her own privacy, literally becomes invaded one night as her own TV -- it in itself a source of addictive promises -- floods her own living room with a nightmarish game show that sends her screaming into the streets, Red Dress in tatters, a hag, still looking for her dream.That we see relationships crumble -- Marian and Harry eventually become strangers to one another and any promise they will ever see each other again is hollow; Tyrone and Harry's friendship also collapses -- is only secondary to the power of storytelling and to the degrees that these characters descend in their addictions. At times it does seem too cruel to even watch: there is a sequence involving all of the character's final destiny that takes stomach to follow, but if the rot that addiction was still contained up until now, this final sequence -- the climax of the film -- lets all the pus out and sends it relentlessly out into the audience and not once are we let a moment's breath until it's over. There is a final, haunting sequence, one involving all of the characters crawling into a fetal position, destroyed beyond repair, that is heart-rending. These, after all, were once children and were safe (as Tyrone's last vision indicates).The acting here is beyond all praise and material awards. Ellen Burstyn does what no actress yet has done in film history: push her physicality to extremes to convey an ordinary woman dehumanized by what she innocently thought were diet pills. She is a woman who could be anyone's mother, caught like a rabbit under a drug. All glamor and star ego goes out the window here -- and in doing so she single-handedly assured her Place in what is called being an Actress.The same can be said with Jennifer Connelly in a role that could have been underwritten (and at times seems so) but in a move similar to Jennifer Jason Leigh she reveals herself so nakedly I'm almost sure her Best Supporting Oscar the following year was one a ""consolation"" award for being overlooked here. Both Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans come through with their lost yet sympathetic roles, Wayans more so, since we get that glimpse into his past and all he dreams is of being a good son to his Momma.There is little relief but a painful compassion emerging from seeing REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. The Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell create an equally tragic score (that has been used in promos for LORD OF THE RINGS), and contains images that already can be considered classic.

10.0,Downer Picturesque.,"I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say, I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork, intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.Jared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definately deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.The other characters themselves hold their own with the two abovementioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem.The cinematography of Matthew Libatique gives total light on the chracterizations of the people in habiting Aronofsky's sick world, from the sliently flickering sick-green flourescents to the exaggerated wide angle shots and the beautifully sad and haunting Coney Island picturesque of the pier which suggests a certain beauty amidst all the sadness and depravity. A Downer Picturesque, as portrayed by the photographs of Robert Frank and the Frank influenced cinematography of Darius Khondji in Seven. In my books, Matthew Libatique has just joined those ranks.Jay Rabinowitz' editing stands out as well, with in-your-face smash title cards(emphasising the downward crash of the character's lives through the seasons), as well as the close-up constructions of the drug taking process. The latter sequences, edited so tightly and seamlessly, make the moment so beautiful but so fleeting, as is the case with drugs. The sequences are almost like a drug, making you crave for more of them, a fix which you get, whenever the characters get their own fix in the film. Lots of people might misinterpret this as glamourising the drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that they're over before you even know it, and then it's back to Harry, Marion, Sarah and Tyrone's sick and depraved search for the next fix, which very accurately portrays the twisted quest of a true and sincere addiction.The film is also superbly scored by Clint Mansell and hauntingly performed by the Kronos Quartet. A series of hauntingly shocking, yet mind-numbingly beautiful pieces which linger in your head long after you've left the cinema.Lastly, the direction of Aronofsky, brilliant, beautiful, empathic. There are not enough words to describe his direction or this film and I think the best way to say it is that I am speechless. Aronofsky has shown me that, jaded by so many films, something can still prompt me to sit up and take notice. To see something that I have never seen before or learn something I don't already know. The ending, is sheer power. A masterpiece of all the elements of what filmmaking is about, mixed together in some sick souffle and thrown into your face, burning hot and scalding. The film leaves a deep impression, in fact, a huge scar. And it is a scar I am proud to wear.",downer picturesque,i just saw requiem dream i have say i was blown away not since 1995s basketball diaries has film so accurately portrayed craving depravity person dealing with or succumbing addiction it is beautifully articulated piece artwork intricately presented silver platter director darren aronofsky shines his brilliant direction style this depiction downward spiral lives four people living with their respective addictions jared leto gives excellent solid performance as harry goldfarb man living inch his life always search fix emotional powerhouse performance he proves audiences that he can shine through major role as opposed previous smaller roles fight club american psycho however it appears be hollywood joke sorts that it seems he has penchant mutilation or at least roles he seems take seem have him fight club he had his face rearranged american psycho his head cut off requiem however it is mutilation his life his whole character that takes centerstage ending satisfying climax gargantuan proportions which he gives audience more than their moneys worth his power packed performance however real star film lies talent ellen burstyn audiences will wonder at her appearance at beginning film not really knowing if it is fact her her performance as television sugar eventually diet pill addicted mother harry shows that shes still got it after all these years if you want make comparison her thespian skills throughout years watch revived version exorcist she can only get better she takes role sarah goldfarb with gusto never backing down second totally throwing herself into role you tend forget how she really looks like given only fleeting moments film which suggest her real appearance i have say shes got guts how many female actresses her age would dare have camera strapped her person as aronofsky so creatively did inch away her face with wide angle lens she definately deserves her oscar nomination if not oscar itself her tour de force performance other characters themselves hold their own with two abovementioned powerhouses jennifer connelly marlon wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as marion silver harrys girlfriend rebellious suburbanite chick who degenerates prostitution her fix tyrone c love harrys best friend fellow pusher here wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed portray boy trapped mans body just yearning his mothers approval but seeking it instead drugs connelly as well who has been taking smaller roles projects over last few years is finally given enough room play with her character gives winning performance requiem cinematography matthew libatique gives total light chracterizations people habiting aronofskys sick world sliently flickering sick green flourescents exaggerated wide angle shots beautifully sad haunting coney island picturesque pier which suggests certain beauty amidst all sadness depravity downer picturesque as portrayed by photographs robert frank frank influenced cinematography darius khondji seven my books matthew libatique has just joined those ranks jay rabinowitz editing stands out as well with your face smash title cards emphasising downward crash characters lives through seasons as well as close up constructions drug taking process latter sequences edited so tightly seamlessly make moment so beautiful but so fleeting as is case with drugs sequences are almost like drug making you crave more them fix which you get whenever characters get their own fix film lots people might misinterpret this as glamourising drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that theyre over before you even know it then its back harry marion sarah tyrones sick depraved search next fix which very accurately portrays twisted quest true sincere addiction film is also superbly scored by clint mansell hauntingly performed by kronos quartet series hauntingly shocking yet mind numbingly beautiful pieces which linger your head long after youve left cinema lastly direction aronofsky brilliant beautiful empathic there are not enough words describe his direction or this film i think best way say it is that i am speechless aronofsky has shown me that jaded by so many films something can still prompt me sit up take notice see something that i have never seen before or learn something i dont already know ending is sheer power masterpiece all elements what filmmaking is about mixed together some sick souffle thrown into your face burning hot scalding film leaves deep impression fact huge scar it is scar i am proud wear,0.5405490956072352,0.151656053894426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Awful and Essential,"I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines. A pretty sure sign that those folks weren't able or willing to watch with an open mind. Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream. Not because they will like it, or that it will teach them something they did not already know, but that it's a rare piece of work that will challenge and probably change them. It's a film that has never been made before, with nothing to compare to it - a rarity these days. I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe. These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I'd like my family to see this, but can't *recommend* it to them. I've recommended it to two friends, and they both had the same reaction: I am glad I watched it, but I doubt I'll be in the frame of mind to watch it again, knowing what you feel.As I sat watching the credits roll, I began crying, but I'm still not sure why. Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending, partly the beauty (yes) of the film, partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend, not because I wanted to upset her, but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled, we both were silent for a good ten minutes. I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express, but could find no words. This is one of the few films that are painful to experience, but I feel compelled to share with people I care about. Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line, Happiness, River's Edge,and The Deer Hunter.These films all share a quality that's difficult to name. No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film, a work of art, a piece of music, but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think, not just be entertained, is important now and then.""Favorite"" does not apply to this for me - this isn't about entertainment.

10.0,Simply Put This Is A Masterwork,"I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldn't help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this - 72 hours after seeing it I still can't get it out of my mind !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! Aronofsky has made an entirely expressionist film . He expresses in visual form what the characters are feeling . This goes all the way back to almost a hundred years ago to a movement in Germany and since then we see influences in productions as diverse as the BBC serial of QUATERMASS 2 to Harvey Keitel's drunken sequence in MEAN STREETS but I can't think of anything where this technique is better suited than here where the mental as well as the physical disintegration of the characters take place . The technique may put off a potential audience but that's the point , the characters are going through a living nightmare that they will never recover fully from and Aronofsky conveys their misery totally The director also brings a subtle in joke of semiotics . In THE GODFATHER before someone is killed the colour orange is prominent . In CHILDREN OF MEN someone is peeling an orange before they're killed . It's a subliminal code used in films but one that is familiar to pretentious film students and movie geeks . When the characters enter a drugs den the audience are shown a close up of an orange being peeled and then all hell breaks loose . Expressionism and semiotics in the same movie ? Not necessarily the work of a genius , nor is it the mark of a genius for noticing this but should still be appreciated One criticism the film has is that it's rabid anti drugs propaganda . Such criticism seems to be missing the point since Sara is addicted to legally prescribed drugs - amphetamine based diet pills and barbiuates . It's not a subtle film but does make subtle points that the amphetamine has almost certainly caused Sara to become schizophrenic . Likewise much of the drug taking and destruction is fuelled entirely by self delusion such as Harry and Marion wanting to open a store funded by the money they made dealing drugs . One criticism that is possibly valid is that there's medical facts that are ignored such as electro convulsive therapy being used on a conscious patient or how limbs are amputated but Aronofsky has rightly ignored these facts in order to make a more shocking film Make no mistake that this is a truly shocking film . Compared to this TRAINSPOTTING is a cartoon for children and no other film has ever portrayed the misery and danger of drugs so potently . Nine years after its limited release the soundtrack by Clint Mansell has become legend and rightly so . However REQUIEM FOR A DREAM itself deserves to become legendary amongst a mainstream audience . It is quite simply a masterwork and a film that whilst I'm in no hurry to see again due to its harrowing content is a film I will never forget",simply put this is masterwork,i vaguely heard few years ago that director pi followed it up by making film based novel featuring drug addicts called requiem dream it got couple good reviews but i couldnt help noticing it took another six years darren aronofsky make another movie entitled fountain which was one worst pieces pretentious nonsense i ever watched still however cult requiem dream grew grew over years it is highly rated amongst prolific voters this website has received almost aggressive praise some quarters yet i had serious doubts its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies only received very limited release cinemas certainly i had no real intention watching it until it appeared sky movie channel how good was it let me put it like this 72 hours after seeing it i still cant get it out my mind mild spoilers aronofsky has made entirely expressionist film he expresses visual form what characters are feeling this goes all way back almost hundred years ago movement germany since then we see influences productions as diverse as bbc serial quatermass 2 harvey keitels drunken sequence mean streets but i cant think anything where this technique is better suited than here where mental as well as physical disintegration characters take place technique may put off potential audience but thats point characters are going through living nightmare that they will never recover fully aronofsky conveys their misery totally director also brings subtle joke semiotics godfather before someone is killed colour orange is prominent children men someone is peeling orange before theyre killed its subliminal code used films but one that is familiar pretentious film students movie geeks when characters enter drugs den audience are shown close up orange being peeled then all hell breaks loose expressionism semiotics same movie not necessarily work genius nor is it mark genius noticing this but should still be appreciated one criticism film has is that its rabid anti drugs propaganda such criticism seems be missing point since sara is addicted legally prescribed drugs amphetamine based diet pills barbiuates its not subtle film but does make subtle points that amphetamine has almost certainly caused sara become schizophrenic likewise much drug taking destruction is fuelled entirely by self delusion such as harry marion wanting open store funded by money they made dealing drugs one criticism that is possibly valid is that theres medical facts that are ignored such as electro convulsive therapy being used conscious patient or how limbs are amputated but aronofsky has rightly ignored these facts order make more shocking film make no mistake that this is truly shocking film compared this trainspotting is cartoon children no other film has ever portrayed misery danger drugs so potently nine years after its limited release soundtrack by clint mansell has become legend rightly so however requiem dream itself deserves become legendary amongst mainstream audience it is quite simply masterwork film that whilst im no hurry see again due its harrowing content is film i will never forget,0.47561931348221675,0.011593406593406594,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made),"Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance. In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination. Like it or not though, this film begs for multiple viewings- and some extra years of looking at other films, which was the case with me. There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end, and nothing will ever be the same for anyone, especially as they're alive and lacking redemption (though if I had to place who's story is most compelling, and performance-wise as well, it would be Burstyn's).",unique look at addiction by aronofsky selby its best dare movie never made or would be made,mr aronofskys requiem dream definitely is unique no other film i have seen heroin or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this it helps that i saw it again because first viewing i looked more performances liked it but didnt really regard actual cinematic technique it with as much un equaled regard as many others have at time i considered it more mtv styled take very powerful topic but now watching it years later 2006 i mean despite what date this comment says i watch it having gone through lots other film viewing experience i like it lot more way whats really mesmerizing heartbreaking about picture is that contrivances are not based actual script or story not that there isnt one or two that might be hard not have there but rather sort fashioning continuous cinematic contrivance other words aronofsky pushes bounds everything that can be done with camera editing terms subjective viewpoints ideas through montage power abstractions realm main theme film unattainable escapism one might be tempted compare eisenstein with montage but unlike him arnonofsky isnt putting forward political message but societal one while cinematography by matthew libatique editing by jay rambinowitz give viewer whole subjective jarring view what it feels like first person do these dangerous drugs some time all this being says it almost goes by too quickly if you blink youll miss characters actually intaking drugs which are done half second cuts not that thats bad thing fact techniques used here which include fast motion camera strapped front person shots odd high angle placements wild array things done that i still wonder how one could think them up are quite ingenious only one scene repeat viewing when sarah goldfarb burtyn is going totally off deep end her apartment with tv show spiraling around her doesnt totally work me also it will be difficult some people view characters their dissension demise bustyn who if you still believe oscars really be mark merit true achievements proves this be false via her loss much less warranted julia robert plays old lonely woman who dreams getting game show that she doesnt realize might not be real decides her favorite red dress is all that matters show show its too small so she goes doctor get pills uppers they do indeed work but then she starts taking too too many ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving first film use refrigerator puppeteer by way then things start spiral this also goes her entranged son harry jared leto who is slipping into descent into smack with his girlfriend marion jennifer connelly who sleeps with other men then some order get stuff when harry can his best friend tyrone marlon wayans his best performance date who is also descending but might seem have it not as bad as others by time film ends but like i said it is hard view these characters falling deeper deeper into insanity desperation all since it is also difficult sympathize with these people yet by end film i almost felt like i was going burst into tears not because i felt sad characters but more because how powerful there journey led then their destination like it or not though this film begs multiple viewings some extra years looking at other films which was case with me there is almost no room true catharsis at end nothing will ever be same anyone especially as theyre alive lacking redemption though if i had place whos story is most compelling performance wise as well it would be burstyns,0.47351731601731595,0.10606060606060601,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,when dreams and nightmares collide...,"My God! ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.To watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" is like being punched in the face. It's the kind of movie which can't leave indifferent. It is impossible to come out of this horrifying movie unharmed. It was made by a young director Darren Aronofsky whose previous movie ""Pi"" (1998) was very hailed. I must admit that I wasn't fully convinced by this indie movie but here, without a doubt, the director entirely hypnotized me and I thank him for that.The movie was made from a novel written by Hubert Selby Jr. It isn't the first time that a work from this novelist is adapted for the screen. Indeed, in 1989, Uli Edel had shot ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" which developed a nightmarish and apocalyptic vision of a mankind who lived in hell. Here, the movie focuses on 4 main characters. There's Harry Goldfarb. He, his girlfriend Marion Silver and his best mate Tyrone C Love plan to become high-rolling smack dealers. In the meantime, his mother Sarah Goldfarb has got her head in the clouds. She received a call and she learned that she's going to appear on television. At the beginning of the film, the 4 characters' hopes amazingly answers the shiny weather of the summer. But as we usually say: best things have an end. Summer will go away to leave place to fall and winter. Just like the dreams will slowly but surely shatter and the 4 main protagonists will embark on an endless suffering. A vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one and which will reach its climax in winter in the last half-hour of the movie. From this moment, the film presents a flood of incredible pictures; they are so painful so much that they make the view unbearable. However, you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion and fascination.Darren Aronofsky invites us to a climbing in the morbid. ""Requiem for a Dream"" strikes by its visual and sonorous frenzy. Through, accelerated frenetic sequences, hysterical split-screens, parallel images, the director doesn't pull his punches to describe this diving in absolute horror for the 4 characters. However, in his crazy making, there's none form of unwarranted nature. The features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary to answer several things which aren't pleasant to hear like for example, to denounce the omnipresence of the consumer society. These abuses express themselves, here, by the crushing presence of objects, perfectly representative of this society like the television or the refrigerator. The another goals of the film: to make us share the physical and moral sufferings of a drug addict, notably through the deterioration of their visual and sonorous perceptions. But also to show us in a straight-forward and rough way, the dependence of a drug addict on his drug. Aronofsky's message is simple to understand. There's not only the drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like the television or the refrigerator. They can destroy our faculties of reasoning and judgment. In a way ""Requiem for a Dream"" illustrates very well Brad Pitt's key cue in ""Fight Club"" (1999): ""things you own end up owning you..."". On the other hand, if we put the stress on drug, the least we can say is that the moments of shooting, the withdrawal times are showed with a realism and bluntness rarely reached. True, ""Trainspotting"" (1996) had already presented similar scenes but Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to go further in daring.It would be unfair to neglect the terrific cast. Beginning with Ellen Burstyn who in all respects gives a dazzling performance. She renders very well the degeneration of her character. In the beginning, she is a normal old lady but in the end, she looks like a senseless living dead. Why didn't she get her Oscar in 2001 instead of Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000)? Then, concerning Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly well their sensitiveness and fragility are impressive. But the biggest surprise is Marlon Wayans. Who could have thought that he could be at ease in a comic role (Scary Movie) as well as in a dramatic role? These 4 actors make particularly harrowing the very last sequences of the film which show them forever in the depths of despair or madness where pain, humiliation and misery suffer into them. And then, during the final credits, we can hear the sea with a little of relief as if we had just made a nightmare.But what is extraordinary in Aronofsky's work is that he manages to find a little place for humor which acts in an efficient way. In conclusion, this young film-maker has shot a film with a real emotional power. I must confess that I almost shed a tear several times. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie I highly recommend but beware! It's not a movie for everyone and for the spectators who didn't watch it, I advise you not to see it if you are in a sad mood. It demands a strong stomach and I think the people who say they weren't afraid during the projection are liars. Don't forget your handkerchief.",when dreams nightmares collide,my god requiem dream 2000 what movie its always difficult write reviews about perfect movies but im going try first there are three adjectives which come my mind describe this movie theyre ones which everyone thinks powerful harrowing heart breaking certain sequences remain engraved memories like example jared letos wounded arm caused by drug watch requiem dream is like being punched face its kind movie which cant leave indifferent it is impossible come out this horrifying movie unharmed it was made by young director darren aronofsky whose previous movie pi 1998 was very hailed i must admit that i wasnt fully convinced by this indie movie but here without doubt director entirely hypnotized me i thank him that movie was made novel written by hubert selby jr it isnt first time that work this novelist is adapted screen indeed 1989 uli edel had shot last exit brooklyn which developed nightmarish apocalyptic vision mankind who lived hell here movie focuses 4 main characters theres harry goldfarb he his girlfriend marion silver his best mate tyrone c love plan become high rolling smack dealers meantime his mother sarah goldfarb has got her head clouds she received call she learned that shes going appear television at beginning film 4 characters hopes amazingly answers shiny weather summer but as we usually say best things have end summer will go away leave place fall winter just like dreams will slowly but surely shatter 4 main protagonists will embark endless suffering vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one which will reach its climax winter last half hour movie this moment film presents flood incredible pictures they are so painful so much that they make view unbearable however you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion fascination darren aronofsky invites us climbing morbid requiem dream strikes by its visual sonorous frenzy through accelerated frenetic sequences hysterical split screens parallel images director doesnt pull his punches describe this diving absolute horror 4 characters however his crazy making theres none form unwarranted nature features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary answer several things which arent pleasant hear like example denounce omnipresence consumer society these abuses express themselves here by crushing presence objects perfectly representative this society like television or refrigerator another goals film make us share physical moral sufferings drug addict notably through deterioration their visual sonorous perceptions but also show us straight forward rough way dependence drug addict his drug aronofskys message is simple understand theres not only drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like television or refrigerator they can destroy our faculties reasoning judgment way requiem dream illustrates very well brad pitts key cue fight club 1999 things you own end up owning you other hand if we put stress drug least we can say is that moments shooting withdrawal times are showed with realism bluntness rarely reached true trainspotting 1996 had already presented similar scenes but darren aronofsky isnt afraid go further daring it would be unfair neglect terrific cast beginning with ellen burstyn who all respects gives dazzling performance she renders very well degeneration her character beginning she is normal old lady but end she looks like senseless living dead why didnt she get her oscar 2001 instead julia roberts erin brockovich 2000 then concerning jared leto jennifer connelly well their sensitiveness fragility are impressive but biggest surprise is marlon wayans who could have thought that he could be at ease comic role scary movie as well as dramatic role these 4 actors make particularly harrowing very last sequences film which show them forever depths despair or madness where pain humiliation misery suffer into them then during final credits we can hear sea with little relief as if we had just made nightmare but what is extraordinary aronofskys work is that he manages find little place humor which acts efficient way conclusion this young film maker has shot film with real emotional power i must confess that i almost shed tear several times requiem dream is movie i highly recommend but beware its not movie everyone spectators who didnt watch it i advise you not see it if you are sad mood it demands strong stomach i think people who say they werent afraid during projection are liars dont forget your handkerchief,0.5684347442680775,0.05899206349206351,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.4}"

8.0,Disturbing unique vision,"Four lives are disintegrating. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) wants to start selling drugs on their own. She is obsessed with TV infomercial personality Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). She gets a call about her winning a TV contest and she's so excited that she goes on a crash diet. Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend and she's pulled into his scheme.It's director Darren Aronofsky's second full length feature, and it shows that he has an unique vision. These are compelling characters in unforgettable stories. Ellen Burstyn is completely immersed into her role. Their slow descent is hard to take and hard to take my eyes off of. The use of quick cuts, fast forwards, and close ups all accentuate the disturbing nature of drugs. The use of SnorriCam which attached to the actors' bodies is probably the most memorable. It's all very disturbing.",disturbing unique vision,four lives are disintegrating harry goldfarb jared leto is drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother ellen burstyn s tv he his druggie friend tyrone c love marlon wayans wants start selling drugs their own she is obsessed with tv infomercial personality tappy tibbons christopher mcdonald she gets call about her winning tv contest shes so excited that she goes crash diet marion silver jennifer connelly is harrys girlfriend shes pulled into his scheme its director darren aronofskys second full length feature it shows that he has unique vision these are compelling characters unforgettable stories ellen burstyn is completely immersed into her role their slow descent is hard take hard take my eyes off use quick cuts fast forwards close ups all accentuate disturbing nature drugs use snorricam which attached actors bodies is probably most memorable its all very disturbing,0.6710144927536232,0.12934782608695655,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.42}"
