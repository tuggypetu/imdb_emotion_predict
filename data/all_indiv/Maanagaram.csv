9,An excellent screenplay and technical brilliance,"Lokesh Kanagaraj a debutant (Which is hard to believe) has delivered an exciting movie watching experience. Managaram is a kind of movie which doesn't fall even for a minute (Not even in the songs).The movie starts off with different characters and different lives moves into something unexpected. Though it has too many characters, Lokesh hasn't wasted time in introductions. The story webs around us from frame one.No character is wasted, each and every character contributes something to the plot. The story travels at a phase, that if a scene is missed we might lose track. The planning and execution of each scene is a master class of Lokesh's screenplay.The suspense that travels along with the plot keeps the audience hooked, even a one minute song might make us restless- an edge of the seat thriller. Lokesh's brilliant yet again takes him high in the climax, the end of the movie might give a confident booster because of the message it delivers.Technical aspects: Technically the movie is strong, thought eh technicians are almost new. Cinematography by SK Selvakumar shows the reality of the metro. Each and every frame of his is real. We might encounter any of it in our real life.Music by Javed Riaz has taken the movie to another extent. Though he doesn't have much to prove in songs the BGM works great time. Philomin's editing is tight packed. She has done an exceptional job in bringing Lokesh's screenplay to life.Above all its Lokesh Kanagaraj's who has done ample of hard work which is evident throughout. His screenplay, the characters, the technical brilliance everything is a clear indication of his passion towards cinema. Though this is his debut he has taken over some experienced directors with his work for sure. Kollywood has got a brilliant director.Cast performance: Cast has worked great time for the movie. Sundeep Kishan as a kind hearted rough guy has exhibited excellence. He was equally contributed by Sri who has lived his character throughout. Though Regina doesn't have much to contribute still she impresses. Charlie's acting has proved he wasn't used well by other directors. He does his character with ease. Above all its Munishkanth (Ramdoss) , he steals the whole movie with his funny dialogues. His comedy has worked in a great time and never falls flat. One of his career bests.On the whole Managaram is a must watch for any moviegoer. It will stay in the hearts as one of the best screenplays ever.",excellent screenplay technical brilliance,lokesh kanagaraj debutant which is hard believe has delivered exciting movie watching experience managaram is kind movie which doesnt fall even minute not even songs movie starts off with different characters different lives moves into something unexpected though it has too many characters lokesh hasnt wasted time introductions story webs around us frame one no character is wasted each every character contributes something plot story travels at phase that if scene is missed we might lose track planning execution each scene is master class lokeshs screenplay suspense that travels along with plot keeps audience hooked even one minute song might make us restless edge seat thriller lokeshs brilliant yet again takes him high climax end movie might give confident booster because message it delivers technical aspects technically movie is strong thought eh technicians are almost new cinematography by sk selvakumar shows reality metro each every frame his is real we might encounter any it our real life music by javed riaz has taken movie another extent though he doesnt have much prove songs bgm works great time philomins editing is tight packed she has done exceptional job bringing lokeshs screenplay life above all its lokesh kanagarajs who has done ample hard work which is evident throughout his screenplay characters technical brilliance everything is clear indication his passion towards cinema though this is his debut he has taken over some experienced directors with his work sure kollywood has got brilliant director cast performance cast has worked great time movie sundeep kishan as kind hearted rough guy has exhibited excellence he was equally contributed by sri who has lived his character throughout though regina doesnt have much contribute still she impresses charlies acting has proved he wasnt used well by other directors he does his character with ease above all its munishkanth ramdoss he steals whole movie with his funny dialogues his comedy has worked great time never falls flat one his career bests whole managaram is must watch any moviegoer it will stay hearts as one best screenplays ever,0.49461917309743386,0.2583578016186711,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"

7,A smartly written and intelligently executed crime anthology by Lokesh Kanagaraj on useless city pride.,"Maanagaram (2017) : Brief Review -A smartly written and intelligently executed crime anthology by Lokesh Kanagaraj on useless city pride. Crime anthologies are always fun to watch because we expect some new stuff, innovative storytelling and lots of surprises. Maanagaram is a perfect fit for that even though it doesn't prove its point property. Well, if the motive doesn't matter to you then Maanagram is fantastic watch for you and if it matters, you can still give it a watch for excellent filmmaking. Maanagaram is a story of Four youngsters who arrive in a big city and with dreams and accidently their lives become interlinked. Actually, this crossover hints a dangerous ride all the time, and it works too but the problem appears in the motiveless screenplay. Maybe, even that's not an issue untill you are enjoying the show but then you have to ask yourself that what was the point of narrating this story at the end? Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered but fortunately it provides a happy ending to almost all the characters as per the justification in cinematic Liberty. There are few useless things in the film which could have been avoided to keep it more curved towards the crime zone. I personally feel that this love story angle and emotional struggle for it actually spoils the main theme of crime dramas unless it has some suspense to reveal at the end, something like we have seen in Aaranya Kaandam (2011). Nevertheless, Maanagaram still has a lot to offer in its own zone. It has smartly written script with gripping screenplay and brilliant direction of Lokesh Kanagaraj. Little more care and it would have been a classic film but its still very much worthy. I didn't understand the logic behind glorifying the fake city pride otherwise it's a terrific crime anthology to watch.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",smartly written intelligently executed crime anthology by lokesh kanagaraj useless city pride,maanagaram 2017 brief review smartly written intelligently executed crime anthology by lokesh kanagaraj useless city pride crime anthologies are always fun watch because we expect some new stuff innovative storytelling lots surprises maanagaram is perfect fit that even though it doesnt prove its point property well if motive doesnt matter you then maanagram is fantastic watch you if it matters you can still give it watch excellent filmmaking maanagaram is story four youngsters who arrive big city with dreams accidently their lives become interlinked actually this crossover hints dangerous ride all time it works too but problem appears motiveless screenplay maybe even thats not issue untill you are enjoying show but then you have ask yourself that what was point narrating this story at end unfortunately this question remains unanswered but fortunately it provides happy ending almost all characters as per justification cinematic liberty there are few useless things film which could have been avoided keep it more curved towards crime zone i personally feel that this love story angle emotional struggle it actually spoils main theme crime dramas unless it has some suspense reveal at end something like we have seen aaranya kaandam 2011 nevertheless maanagaram still has lot offer its own zone it has smartly written script with gripping screenplay brilliant direction lokesh kanagaraj little more care it would have been classic film but its still very much worthy i didnt understand logic behind glorifying fake city pride otherwise its terrific crime anthology watch rating 7 10 by,0.5920583384869098,0.18710446299732014,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10,Awesome flick to watch in theatre with a popcorn,"Story itself is so powerful which depicts the notion which outsiders keep on metro cities, whatever be the reason for anyone's experience the metro cities have been a boon for our country. Some want to be around for sake of money and some stay out for their goodness. No one wish to give and take from what the city has, metro cities have been giving so much purpose and interesting life to everyone which all can't have it in their very own native side.

Wonderfully crafted story having significance for each character a city has everywhere. Story moves with present common problems a city has, and revolving around it. Director made an interesting connection of Theft,acid attacks,rowdism,kiddnaping, police corruption, sentiments and love in the city which ends to a happy note of telling people that do what is right and things will have a positive change for sure in the end.Best flick with good story, and camera work however screenplay could have been better.",awesome flick watch theatre with popcorn,story itself is so powerful which depicts notion which outsiders keep metro cities whatever be reason anyones experience metro cities have been boon our country some want be around sake money some stay out their goodness no one wish give take what city has metro cities have been giving so much purpose interesting life everyone which all cant have it their very own native side remember catch its people who make place beautiful talking about film its starts so real best camera work shown wonderfully crafted story having significance each character city has everywhere story moves with present common problems city has revolving around it director made interesting connection theft acid attacks rowdism kiddnaping police corruption sentiments love city which ends happy note telling people that do what is right things will have positive change sure end best flick with good story camera work however screenplay could have been better,0.6378977747398801,0.5443677375256323,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8,"Maanagaram is an engaging realistic crime dram with terrific direction,amazing performances and dialogues.","Maanagaram (2017): Few films make me realize about the importance of young talent in Indian Cinema.Especially in Kollywood,there are lot of such talented youngsters who are waiting for their chance.Karthik Subbaraj,Ashwin,Nalan Kumaraswamy etc..Now Lokesh Kangaraj is the debutante who is another gift to Kollywood.Plot:Set in the big city of Chennai, a youngster (Sree) from a small town comes to the city for a job opportunity at an IT firm. After he bags the job, on the same night he is beaten up on the road for mistaken identity and no one seems to come for his help. He gets annoyed about how insensitive are the people of the city.On the other hand, there is this young brash Sundeep Kishan who is good at heart and madly in love with his college mate and HR in charge at the IT firm (Regina Cassandra) and goes to any extent to safeguard her. Then you have this soft-natured migrant driver (Charlie), who comes to Chennai for the treatment of his ailing son and lands up the job as a call taxi driver. There's also this notorious mafia gang leader PKB (Madhusudhan), a corrupt policeman who is Sundeep's uncle, and a group of ruthless thugs with a misfit amongst them (Ramdoss.) He kidnaps the wrong child (who happens to be PKB's son) and ever since is on a damage control exercise. How all the characters get interlinked in the climax forms the rest.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: We have seen lot of hyper linked films like Yuva,Manamantha,Vedam and lot of Hollywood films. With a solid story, deft handling and a seamless screenplay (despite a complex script), extracting the best of performances from the entire cast, picture perfect frames (Selvakumar), engrossing music (Javed Riaz) and crisp editing (Philomin Raj), Lokesh has weaved a captivating thriller which is not to be missed. Lokesh scores the most is in how superbly he interlinks all these different stories and characters. The interlinking does not come across as mere coincidences or conveniences for the plot to progress, but as an observation of the interconnectedness that marks life in the city.2)BGM: BGM is rocking and raised the intensity in scenes to the top.3)Dialogues: In one scene in film,Hero asks a person about the most commonly used vulgar work ""La..Ko..Ka"".The way he criticizes the nature of folks in city using the word for everything is one of my most fav scenes in the movie.There are lot of such amazing dialogues in this film.4)Performances: Everyone in the film has given their career best performances Especially Sree and Charlie stole the entire movie with their brilliant performances.Sundeep Kishan is amazing as rough guy in love with a girl.Minus Points:1)Lengthy Climax: Even though the screenplay is engaging at its best lengthy and feels dragged.So,Maanagaram is an engaging realistic crime dram with terrific direction,amazing performances and dialogues.My rating 7.5/10",maanagaram is engaging realistic crime dram with terrific direction amazing performances dialogues,maanagaram 2017 few films make me realize about importance young talent indian cinema especially kollywood there are lot such talented youngsters who are waiting their chance karthik subbaraj ashwin nalan kumaraswamy etc now lokesh kangaraj is debutante who is another gift kollywood plot set big city chennai youngster sree small town comes city job opportunity at it firm after he bags job same night he is beaten up road mistaken identity no one seems come his help he gets annoyed about how insensitive are people city other hand there is this young brash sundeep kishan who is good at heart madly love with his college mate hr charge at it firm regina cassandra goes any extent safeguard her then you have this soft natured migrant driver charlie who comes chennai treatment his ailing son lands up job as call taxi driver theres also this notorious mafia gang leader pkb madhusudhan corrupt policeman who is sundeeps uncle group ruthless thugs with misfit amongst them ramdoss he kidnaps wrong child who happens be pkbs son ever since is damage control exercise how all characters get interlinked climax forms rest plus points 1 screenplay direction we have seen lot hyper linked films like yuva manamantha vedam lot hollywood films with solid story deft handling seamless screenplay despite complex script extracting best performances entire cast picture perfect frames selvakumar engrossing music javed riaz crisp editing philomin raj lokesh has weaved captivating thriller which is not be missed lokesh scores most is how superbly he interlinks all these different stories characters interlinking does not come across as mere coincidences or conveniences plot progress but as observation interconnectedness that marks life city 2 bgm bgm is rocking raised intensity scenes top 3 dialogues one scene film hero asks person about most commonly used vulgar work la ko ka way he criticizes nature folks city using word everything is one my most fav scenes movie there are lot such amazing dialogues this film 4 performances everyone film has given their career best performances especially sree charlie stole entire movie with their brilliant performances sundeep kishan is amazing as rough guy love with girl minus points 1 lengthy climax even though screenplay is engaging at its best lengthy feels dragged so maanagaram is engaging realistic crime dram with terrific direction amazing performances dialogues my rating 7 5 10,0.5997175141242939,0.1865819209039548,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"

7,I didn't hate or love this,"Many times in the film, the characters were just talking about the city. I wonder why? Might be because the writers could not find a better dialogue to write.Maanagaram is story of four different people or group of people whose lives somehow intersect. The chaos never spread, we wait for a major event but that never arrives. The minor twists make a good watch. But it's never excellent.The way Sundeep krishna's character is introduced to us, I don't think anyone is going to like it, neither as a hero, nor as a villian. None of the actors did something worth a mention.What saves this films is it's untimely comedy. Untimely, but not in a bad way. The dark humour is present in situations in which we least expect it to be.
