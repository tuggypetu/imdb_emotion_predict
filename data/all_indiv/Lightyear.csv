6,No signs of intelligent life anywhere....,"6.4/10The nostalgia was there for ten minutes and then it went away as the story trails away into something that just didn't sit right. While we never got firm info about Buzz's origins in the ""Toy Story"" films. This isn't what I expected for his story. I expected this to be an emotional journey, but there were maybe three moments where a tear was shed. The rest was just ""empty"" space.The voice acting was good. Chris Evans sounded like Buzz and brought the character to life. The surrounding characters were just as enjoyable. Definitely some funny moments amongst them. I did get a few laughs out, but it felt forced sometimes to be able to enjoy the film.The film definitely looked, and sounded, great, but it didn't do enough to grasp a love for the character, or the story. Honestly, I don't think this film was for adults to reach back to the childhood nostalgia, but rather its for a new generation to make the character it's own meaning. Flip side to Buzz was Zurg. Zurg was perhaps the biggest disappointment with how they portrayed him. Who he was in ""Toy Story"" is not the same as who is here, and again, it didn't sit right.I think the biggest thing is to forget the trailer. Go in with an open-mind and make of it what you will. The kids in the theatre seemed to have loved.Overall, not the outstanding film I was expecting even with all the great visual and sound. The story lacked expectations for a nostalgic character, but wasn't necessarily terrible, so again, go in with an open-mind.Thank you for reading my review. Until next time....

4,"""Zurg.""","""In 1997, a child named Andy bought a Buzz Lightyear action figure after seeing the character in his favorite movie. This is that movie."" These sentences precede Lightyear, a gorgeously realized and superbly animated film which has also been finely calculated and sterilized to assuage those who greenlit its production. Despite its visual splendor, Lightyear is not always easy to look at, with the knowledge that a soulless, artless, superficial corporate entity has hollowed out the insides, and is wearing the film like a glossy, finely crafted skinsuit.The film follows Buzz Lightyear as he attempts to bring home a crew aboard ""The Turnip"" an exploratory vessel used by Star Command. His attempts bring about strange consequences with time, and he is quickly thrust into an unfamiliar timeline with a trio of unlikely helpers, including the teenaged granddaughter of his compatriot, Izzy Hawthorne. Together, they must stop a robot invasion and complete the mission Buzz began almost a century ago.There are a number of threads and disparate qualities to Lightyear, many of wildly varying quality, but one thing is certain; this is a proudly corporate and sterilized product. This nagging fact presents itself with the aforementioned opening lines, a reminder that the film currently being watched is explicitly and purposefully nothing more than a product consumed by a child twenty-five years ago. The message is stated not only to help Disney merchandise the film, but to remind and entice their audience about the wonderful array of products present under their corporate umbrella, their distressingly tightening grip on all entertainment. The sentiment registers early and often; this is not story, this is product.This corporate slavishness manifests itself in the typical risk-aversion attitude and spinelessness of contemporary Hollywood. Lightyear is bland; not visually, but in its story, in most of its directorial choices, and its tone. It's a painstakingly manufactured blandness, meticulously constructed to smooth over or erase the rough edges of human complication. The nature of the story and the moodiness of the animation call for a mature telling, but the writers and producers of the film clearly aren't interested in mining any potential emotional complexity or intrigue.Another irritating and telling sign of Lightyear's men-in-suits meddling is its frantic pace and fear of looking death in the eye. Buzz's story here is actually quite tragic, a futuristic vision of uncontrolled loss and temporal grief akin to Interstellar or Ad Astra. A film more attuned with its characters and their psychological needs and nightmares would nurture this tragedy, use it to frame their journey early and often. Lightyear not only blows by this thread in the pursuit of lubricating its plot, but its final twist runs totally counter to Buzz's previous motivations and desires. Buzz is not allowed to feel true human-like grief because he's not human. He's merchandise. The same could be said for all other characters.A counterargument arises: ""It's just a kid's film!"" But if there's any animation studio which has shown the propensity for mature children's programming in the past, it's Pixar Animation. Even goofier franchises, like Kung Fu Panda, have occasionally hit emotional paydirt because the writers were aligned with their characters, psychologically and plot-wise. When Po learns of his parents' death at the hands of Lord Shen, he mourns, and the film mourns with him. He's allowed time to focus within and process the information. He doesn't immediately stumble onto a new plot point, he doesn't mindlessly enter into a final confrontation, he doesn't make any insipid quips. Buzz Lightyear, when presented with emotionally charged material, does all three...though not in that order.The writing is simply too cartoonish for the material presented, in terms of both visual awe and narrative substance. No character is fleshed out beyond a few superficial quirks. The trio which accompanies Buzz succeeds too often in spite of themselves, careening jollily from one set piece to the next with no recognition of the stakes or danger within the film.All four characters are at least twenty-two years of age, but consistently behave like children, hooting and hollering in the face of clear and present danger. Just quip, quip, quip, quip, quip. No setups, no punchlines, few personality-driven situations; just quip, quip, quip, as if the film were ghostwritten by a prepubescent James Gunn. Again, this approach usually works in lighter, lower-staked children's material, but Lightyear promises to be something more early on. The immediacy and frequency with which the film reneges on that promise is incredibly frustrating.There is a final problem with Lightyear which is difficult to describe without spoiling. Buzz makes an all-cinema selfish decision at the film's climax, which is inexplicably framed as heroic and unquestionably morally correct. The decision is framed as such in no small part because of Disney's creative bankruptcy. It's a sad reality that the company most noted for typifying villainous roles and creating memorable, distinct, and creative threats has succumbed to believing that no one individual is ever a true villain. Everyone is simply misunderstood or morally gray. It's a shame. Another small but relevant note is the film's general lack of structure or causality. The whole endeavor feels generally purposeless, and the film struggles to sustain itself.As mentioned, for all of the film's narrative and emotional problems, there is an incredible team using unbelievable technology at work. The animators of Lightyear have created a stunning, immersive, and moody alien environment. It's staggering to look back at the original Toy Story and realize just how far the medium has come. Extensive and frequent credit must be given to the artists at work, who are undoubtably the best of their craft. Many of the sequences feel like hyper-stylized renderings of recent sci-fi extravaganzas, like the aforementioned Ad Astra or Interstellar, with just a sprinkling of 2001: A Space Odyssey for good measure. Some of the film's images are truly breathtaking.All in all, Lightyear is a typically disappointing and spiritless stab to create new life from old IP. There are many problems with the film's writing, but the central issue is Lightyear's eponymous caricature. The audience is told Andy wanted a Buzz toy after seeing this movie; even beyond the transparent cynicism of such a statement, it's hard to even believe at face value. This film's Buzz Lightyear is a mostly incompetent, insecure, rash, and boneheaded figure. Younger viewers will probably enjoy the space-age antics, but most out of grade school will feel the familiar tinge of disappointment.

6,Not worthy of the 'Pixar' title,"Toy Story is a legendary franchise and Buzz Lightyear might be among the most iconic animated characters ever created. Taking risks and telling an unique story with these priceless assets is therefore a daunting task. A task which Pixar could not fulfill.Characters in the early scenes of the movie are well written and the relationships well established. The newly introduced characters (which you spend most of your time with) are not. They all got potential, but they fail to connect with Buzz and therefore fail to connect with the audience. The main antagonist has the same issue. He could've been an interesting character, but Pixar went for the easy route instead. This means that we got to see a very generic evil villain, one of which we've seen countless times before.The plot was predictable. Lightyear never tries to surprise you, stun you, wow you or shock you. You simply go from A to B to C (sometimes with an obstacle in the way) till the movie is over.Lightyear isn't unique.

5,It's a movie that exists.,"What's sad about Lightyear is that it doesn't have nearly the originality, intelligence, or emotional payoff that any of the Toy Story films have.

5,"This feels more like the movie BEFORE the movie Andy would've fallen in love with, which I'd be game to watch","This movie had quite a bit to live up to. Not because of Toy Story, since this is technically no more in the universe than fictional films are within our universe. No, rather because (1) Pixar and (2) this was supposedly Andy's favorite film and his reason for loving Buzz Lightyear in the first place. Personally, I don't think it lived up to either.I'm kind of surprised by this being Andy's favorite movie and the character that brought the toy he so desired. I'm having trouble tapping into the nine-year-old within myself to formulate how much I would have enjoyed this movie. I think I would have had a lot of fun with it, but I'm also thinking about how much more fun I can have. I look at a film like The Incredibles, and honestly Pixar didn't have to do too much with it other than make an animated superhero movie (sure there was the family dynamic, but this wasn't the first of its kind to do that), and it turned out very excellent and fun. When they made the decision for this movie to be more generic than the Pixar magic they tend to bring light with, along the way I think they tied themselves down a bit and forgot to hash out the excellently fun elements.In a sense, I'm actually waiting for the sequel to this movie. I think that is the one where they would be able to get it off the ground and make it the exhilarating sci-fi adventure that Buzz Lightyear: Space Ranger is meant to be. I think the sequel to this movie is the one that Andy would've fallen in love with. Pixar has an interesting opportunity here in that they can spinoff a franchise from this individual character and have it be completely of its own accord in science fiction if they want to, and I want them to. This first entry, if you will, is very much a character study. I just don't see this as the toy that I would want to rush out and purchase (though there is another one I think a lot of people will want to buy, more on that later).Lightyear heavily borrows from Star Wars, Star Trek, Interstellar, and throws in Toy Story Easter eggs here and there (some quotes and mannerisms you've seen from Buzz). Sadly, I think it's only all for the best if you haven't seen those movies before. When I see something it pays homage to, I know that in other films I have either seen it better, can't be caught by surprise with it, or it can't tug at my heartstrings again. This is all especially true of Toy Story, because although it has nothing to do with the toys, this is supposed to mold into Andy's toy, and again I just have yet to see that. This mostly has to do with the fact that Buzz is a different character here than Andy portrays him as (and I think his character here is better since he is flawed), and this is especially problematic with how they chose to represent the villain. Again, these things aren't a problem if you've seen these other films, so either a sequel can choose to tie it all closer or distance itself all more. Either way, there is this middle ground they decided to hit which left me scratching my head.Overall, this movie becomes a bit too pedestrian by playing safe against the material that it likens itself with and decides against being the all-out fun space opera that it can be (though I feel a sequel can remedy that). There is one pretty intense scene, but it was the only time that I felt any actual peril for any characters. Most all of the comedy falls flat for my age group, with the exception of Sox. And yes, I'm saving the best for last. Sox saves this film. He is adorable, hilarious, a scene-stealer, and will obviously be a big toy-seller. He alone might have brought this movie up a full point or two, especially because he brings the comedy that I think the other characters fail to. IVAN is also great, but not really a character.I don't think this movie is bad at all, but in all that it is good in it falls short of delivering the Pixar magic, the adventure, the consistency with the character we believed Andy fell in love with (which is fine on its face if you decide to separate that), and the villain choices were bothersome. In all, I still very much want this to be a franchise and want the sequel that I know Andy truly would've loved with Buzz Lightyear, and I think Pixar has a chance at giving us the Incredibles parallel in this franchise.There are three credits scenes. None are necessarily groundbreaking, but I just want you to know that they're there.Also, I didn't see any trailers before watching this movie, so I wanted to search up a trailer before leaving impressions to see what I should and shouldn't say content-wise. Sadly, in just typing ""lightyear,"" the predictive search options brought up five or six hits that frankly should not be the focus of this movie. It is so 2022 that this movie is probably going to be known for a controversial talking point, when really I thought it was part of the best written aspect of the movie and it was done really well. Perhaps if the rest of the movie was written as well, people wouldn't draw their focus to this.",this feels more like movie before movie andy wouldve fallen love with which id be game watch,this movie had quite bit live up not because toy story since this is technically no more universe than fictional films are within our universe no rather because 1 pixar 2 this was supposedly andys favorite film his reason loving buzz lightyear first place personally i dont think it lived up either im kind surprised by this being andys favorite movie character that brought toy he so desired im having trouble tapping into nine year old within myself formulate how much i would have enjoyed this movie i think i would have had lot fun with it but im also thinking about how much more fun i can have i look at film like incredibles honestly pixar didnt have do too much with it other than make animated superhero movie sure there was family dynamic but this wasnt first its kind do that it turned out very excellent fun when they made decision this movie be more generic than pixar magic they tend bring light with along way i think they tied themselves down bit forgot hash out excellently fun elements sense im actually waiting sequel this movie i think that is one where they would be able get it off ground make it exhilarating sci fi adventure that buzz lightyear space ranger is meant be i think sequel this movie is one that andy wouldve fallen love with pixar has interesting opportunity here that they can spinoff franchise this individual character have it be completely its own accord science fiction if they want i want them this first entry if you will is very much character study i just dont see this as toy that i would want rush out purchase though there is another one i think lot people will want buy more that later lightyear heavily borrows star wars star trek interstellar throws toy story easter eggs here there some quotes mannerisms youve seen buzz sadly i think its only all best if you havent seen those movies before when i see something it pays homage i know that other films i have either seen it better cant be caught by surprise with it or it cant tug at my heartstrings again this is all especially true toy story because although it has nothing do with toys this is supposed mold into andys toy again i just have yet see that this mostly has do with fact that buzz is different character here than andy portrays him as i think his character here is better since he is flawed this is especially problematic with how they chose represent villain again these things arent problem if youve seen these other films so either sequel can choose tie it all closer or distance itself all more either way there is this middle ground they decided hit which left me scratching my head overall this movie becomes bit too pedestrian by playing safe against material that it likens itself with decides against being all out fun space opera that it can be though i feel sequel can remedy that there is one pretty intense scene but it was only time that i felt any actual peril any characters most all comedy falls flat my age group with exception sox yes im saving best last sox saves this film he is adorable hilarious scene stealer will obviously be big toy seller he alone might have brought this movie up full point or two especially because he brings comedy that i think other characters fail ivan is also great but not really character i dont think this movie is bad at all but all that it is good it falls short delivering pixar magic adventure consistency with character we believed andy fell love with which is fine its face if you decide separate that villain choices were bothersome all i still very much want this be franchise want sequel that i know andy truly wouldve loved with buzz lightyear i think pixar has chance at giving us incredibles parallel this franchise there are three credits scenes none are necessarily groundbreaking but i just want you know that theyre there also i didnt see any trailers before watching this movie so i wanted search up trailer before leaving impressions see what i should shouldnt say content wise sadly just typing lightyear predictive search options brought up five or six hits that frankly should not be focus this movie it is so 2022 that this movie is probably going be known controversial talking point when really i thought it was part best written aspect movie it was done really well perhaps if rest movie was written as well people wouldnt draw their focus this,0.5211896745230078,0.24689368431792674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.27}"

4,Feels like a miss for Pixar,"This is a visually stunning movie and Sox the cat is great - but that's about all it has going for it unfortunately.This doesn't feel like the fun blockbuster action sci-fi adventure that Andy would have seen in the early 90s that makes him desperate for the toy and it borrows elements from more modern movies that definitely weren't a thing in the early 90s.It has an emotional start that is surprisingly weighty for a kids movie but done well, and then it goes downhill from there.It has a ""twist"" near the end that you can see coming a mile off and changes the lore of the franchise in such a way that ignores the popular Star Command cartoon and likely means that some rides will have to be changed at Disney theme parks.Much of the movie is unfortunately propelled by characters making silly mistakes and the supporting characters don't really have a character arc. One character in particular is so dumb and clumsy it gets boring fast.Sox is the best part of the movie for sure and it would probably make sense that Andy would have wanted a Sox toy rather than a Buzz.It's not an awful movie but it falls far short of what could have been and is nearer the bottom of the Pixar movies.

7,It's a mindless action-adventure film and I loved it!,"It's not bad at all.A side movie within a movie as the text at the beginning states that this movie was released in 1995 to sell the Buzz Lightyear toy in Toy Story.If you're looking for any Toy Story references or expecting this film to be like Toy Story, think again. In fact, as a Pixar movie, it a little subpair in the usual Disney formula.What it had going for it is that it's a fast-paced exciting, animated film from beginning to end. It never stops being charming.I don't know why they decided to replace Tim Allen after 25 years of being Buzz, but I'm not mad at all at what Chris Evans did with the character. KeKe Palmer was also a good voice over but not as good as Uzo Aduba who killed it.It may not impress Toy Story fan but if you think about as its own thing which in every way that matters it is than it works greatly.For what it was I enjoyed myself.
