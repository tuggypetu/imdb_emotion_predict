His favorite possession is his plastic sword! Yesterday, going to the movie, he asked me if I could get him a parrot to sit on his shoulder!

10.0,Excellent movie but heavily underrated.,"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 is the follow-up to 1999's Baby Geniuses. In it, four smart babies team up with 7-year-old ""defender of children everywhere"" Kahuna to prevent media mogul Bill Biscane's plot to enslave the world through powerful subliminal TV programming.Babies start jumping at day-care center Bobbins World, in the stewardship of Stan and Jean Bobbins. (Stan's brother from the first film owns the center but is busy saving children overseas.) The Bobbins are preparing for the arrival of Mr. Biscane, who, at this point in the film, is an internationally recognized advocate of children and orphans. Biscane has chosen the Bobbins' upscale L.A. day care to premier his new television show for kids. Stan hopes the exposure will turn the day care into a nationally known brand, ""the McDonald's of day care."" Biscane has other ideas.As the Bobbinses work themselves into a high-stress lather over the near visit, four smart babies:Archie, Finkleman, Rosita and Alex sit talking to one another in a play area. To the ordinary watcher, it looks as if they're just talking baby talk. But Jean becomes convinced that they're actually having a conversation. And she's right: Archie is telling the other toddlers about the legend of Kahuna, a 7-year-old überspy who prevented the evil Nazi-like commander Kane's plot to enslave orphaned East German children.The other babies dismiss Archie's tall tale. But they soon discover that Kahuna is no legend when he comes to their rescue—which they desperately need after getting unwittingly dragged into Biscane's malevolent sights—tricked out with all the requisite Bond-like hardware, including a snazzy rocket-powered three-wheeler. Along the way, Kahuna empowers the babies to believe in themselves, revealing each one's superpower!.This movie is so great .I still do not know why it is heavily underrated. It was an enjoyable thing to do watching the movie on DVD and I am so certain it would be magical to see this excellent movie in 3D at the movies.",excellent movie but heavily underrated,superbabies baby geniuses 2 is follow up 1999s baby geniuses it four smart babies team up with 7 year old defender children everywhere kahuna prevent media mogul bill biscanes plot enslave world through powerful subliminal tv programming babies start jumping at day care center bobbins world stewardship stan jean bobbins stans brother first film owns center but is busy saving children overseas bobbins are preparing arrival mr biscane who at this point film is internationally recognized advocate children orphans biscane has chosen bobbins upscale l day care premier his new television show kids stan hopes exposure will turn day care into nationally known brand mcdonalds day care biscane has other ideas as bobbinses work themselves into high stress lather over near visit four smart babies archie finkleman rosita alex sit talking one another play area ordinary watcher it looks as if theyre just talking baby talk but jean becomes convinced that theyre actually having conversation shes right archie is telling other toddlers about legend kahuna 7 year old berspy who prevented evil nazi like commander kanes plot enslave orphaned east german children other babies dismiss archies tall tale but they soon discover that kahuna is no legend when he comes their rescue which they desperately need after getting unwittingly dragged into biscanes malevolent sights tricked out with all requisite bond like hardware including snazzy rocket powered three wheeler along way kahuna empowers babies believe themselves revealing each ones superpower this movie is so great i still do not know why it is heavily underrated it was enjoyable thing do watching movie dvd i am so certain it would be magical see this excellent movie 3d at movies,0.5192172880882558,0.0758043569333892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,Sunglasses wearing bad-ass babies.,"Jon Voight's performance in this film was downright spellbinding. He brought what we in the industry call pizazz from the opening scene in this below average movie. His fights scene were a personal highlight of the movie for myself, however it must be said that when he originally fought Kahuna (superbaby) it was the latter that really shone through, and produced an Oscar/Emmy winning performance. Kahuna, despite obviously being a child, somehow managed to look like a midget stuntman throughout his fight scenes, which was a classy and well thought out touch. It must be mentioned that we appreciated, on a professional level, the Three Stooges reference and were pretty much blown away by the obscure Popeye reference to Popeye. Still on Kahuna, his superpowers were up there with other really good superheroes like Batman and/or Iron Man. His superpowers were as follows: fighting, glowing green, driving a small little persons car, pilot, floating on a bean bag, meditating and being about 5 or 6 forever. Oh and his dashing good looks and nursery charms. Do you know fans what was out of this world, and maybe any other world? The CGI and special effects thereof in this film. Amazingly the production team managed to make it look like the babies were actually saying these really funny one liners like ""Can a brother get some water?"" (We get that satire) As huge fans of computers, we really enjoyed the babies frequent use of the MSN Kids operating system, and would like to petition for its return to all new computers from this point onwards. Loved the cameo of the Whoopster Whoopi Goldberg. It was like she wasn't there and was actually at home the whole time, but we obviously know she wasn't. Ha. However, it must be said that the blistering appearance of the Grammy winning superstar making Florida band O-Town was something to behold for generations past and present. Those guys brought it, and we loved it. Loved it. In conclusion, this film was below average. That guy from Diagnosis Murder wasn't very good. The plot was a bit weird. The pacing was off, and almost strange. So, we have had to dock several points accordingly. As a result, we have been forced to give it a 9.0 out of 10.0. Two thumbs up. Would definitely watch it again, without such high expectations. GOLD. Better than Battle Royale.",sunglasses wearing bad ass babies,jon voights performance this film was downright spellbinding he brought what we industry call pizazz opening scene this below average movie his fights scene were personal highlight movie myself however it must be said that when he originally fought kahuna superbaby it was latter that really shone through produced oscar emmy winning performance kahuna despite obviously being child somehow managed look like midget stuntman throughout his fight scenes which was classy well thought out touch it must be mentioned that we appreciated professional level three stooges reference were pretty much blown away by obscure popeye reference popeye still kahuna his superpowers were up there with other really good superheroes like batman or iron man his superpowers were as follows fighting glowing green driving small little persons car pilot floating bean bag meditating being about 5 or 6 forever oh his dashing good looks nursery charms do you know fans what was out this world maybe any other world cgi special effects thereof this film amazingly production team managed make it look like babies were actually saying these really funny one liners like can brother get some water we get that satire as huge fans computers we really enjoyed babies frequent use msn kids operating system would like petition its return all new computers this point onwards loved cameo whoopster whoopi goldberg it was like she wasnt there was actually at home whole time but we obviously know she wasnt ha however it must be said that blistering appearance grammy winning superstar making florida band o town was something behold generations past present those guys brought it we loved it loved it conclusion this film was below average that guy diagnosis murder wasnt very good plot was bit weird pacing was off almost strange so we have had dock several points accordingly as result we have been forced give it 9 0 out 10 0 two thumbs up would definitely watch it again without such high expectations gold better than battle royale,0.4875029934604403,0.15002141475545733,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"

1.0,Teething was more fun,"If you've been thinking about hiring somebody to clean out those clogged gutters or to get that darned septic tank working again, just call Jon Voight.

The star of ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""Catch-22"" and ""Conrack"" -- you know, Angelina Jolie's dad.Why bother Mr. Voight? Well, considering that he's lending his name to ""SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2,"" he clearly has a lot of time on his hands, doesn't consider any job too demeaning and probably won't charge too much.In case you're wondering why Voight would elect to appear in ""SuperBabies,"" the follow-up to a movie he wasn't in, instead of ""Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" -- and don't pretend you don't remember the scene in the first ""Anaconda"" in which the gargantuan serpent swallows, then coughs up Voight -- here's a hint: Voight was an executive producer of the original ""Baby Geniuses."" Since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left of the screen careers of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner, it must have been a formidable challenge finding actors eager to strip themselves of every scintilla of dignity to perform alongside a bunch of feisty computer-generated toddlers (with the exception of Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel, of course). Apparently for Voight it was put up or shut up time.So here he is, ladies and gentlemen, outfitted with not one, but two dollar-store-quality wigs and employing an absurd German accent as Bill Biscane, a megalomaniac who plans to use cheaply made, insipid kiddie TV shows to hypnotize babies around the world and rob them of their free will; clearly, Biscane marches to the sound of his own drummer. But those who cherish the ideal of infants being able to make their own choices need not despair: SuperBaby Kahuna (played by Gerry, Leo and Myles Fitzgerald, who are by no means identical triplets) is on the case, and if there's anybody you want on your side when you're facing an onslaught of wretched programming, it's ""a small fry with a big attitude"" who taunts his enemies with such put-downs as ""Why don't you pick on somebody half your size?"" and ""Never send a man to do a boy's job.""Kahuna -- who is revealed to be a grown man trapped in the body of a pre-schooler, in a slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes to post-World War II Germany to explain -- has some major connections, too. He can jump on his computer network and converse with Whoopi Goldberg, the members of that nearly forgotten boy-band O-Town, or any other celebrity or pseudo-celebrity willing to be pasted into a movie that only an unfortunate few are fated to see. Although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that ""every child has power -- all you have to do is believe,"" Kahuna lives in what looks like a papier-mache cave full of large plywood and plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged from the windows of a now-defunct F.A.O. Schwarz location. It's a sad sight indeed.There are other four SuperBabies, too, and just prior to the climactic showdown with Biscane and his goons, this diaper-clad quartet jumps onto Kahuna's magic carousel, where they are transformed into Brain Boy (who wears a scaled-down cap and gown), Cupid Girl (who shoots arrows that cause grown men to stop fighting and hug each other instead), Bounce Baby (who is stuck inside an orange beach ball) and Baby Courageous (whose get-up proves that the only thing that looks worse than a grown man in a tacky hairpiece is a toddler in a bad toupee).Watching from the sidelines are Baio and Angel, as the dizzy owners of a highly questionable day care center in which most of the children parade around half-dressed, and Hilary Duff clone Skyler Shaye and Frankie Muniz lookalike Justin Chatwin, who attempt to provide a bit of squeaky-clean teen love interest -- not exactly what the target audience of 6-year-olds is itching to see.As was the case with ""Baby Geniuses,"" the movie contains a surplus of awkward-looking digital effects that are supposed to convince us the wee ones are actually making wisecracks and running wild. The results are generally pitiful. If ""SuperBabies"" is marginally better than the excruciating ""Geniuses"" -- and you sure wouldn't want to live on the difference -- it's because director Bob Clark and screenwriter Gregory Poppen don't shoehorn in nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around; they're equally stingy with charm and imagination as well.By the way, Voight's next project is called ""The Karate Dog,"" in which he'll co-star with Simon Rex, Pat Morita and Chevy Chase, who'll provide ""the voice of Cho-Cho,"" according to the Internet Movie Database. Do an Oscar winner a big favor and call him this weekend -- really, the guy must be willing to do just about anything for a couple bucks.",teething was more fun,if youve been thinking about hiring somebody clean out those clogged gutters or get that darned septic tank working again just call jon voight yeah same jon voight who won academy award as best actor 1978 coming home star midnight cowboy catch 22 conrack you know angelina jolies dad why bother mr voight well considering that hes lending his name superbabies baby geniuses 2 he clearly has lot time his hands doesnt consider any job too demeaning probably wont charge too much case youre wondering why voight would elect appear superbabies follow up movie he wasnt instead anacondas hunt blood orchid dont pretend you dont remember scene first anaconda which gargantuan serpent swallows then coughs up voight heres hint voight was executive producer original baby geniuses since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left screen careers christopher lloyd kathleen turner it must have been formidable challenge finding actors eager strip themselves every scintilla dignity perform alongside bunch feisty computer generated toddlers with exception scott baio vanessa angel course apparently voight it was put up or shut up time so here he is ladies gentlemen outfitted with not one but two dollar store quality wigs employing absurd german accent as bill biscane megalomaniac who plans use cheaply made insipid kiddie tv shows hypnotize babies around world rob them their free will clearly biscane marches sound his own drummer but those who cherish ideal infants being able make their own choices need not despair superbaby kahuna played by gerry leo myles fitzgerald who are by no means identical triplets is case if theres anybody you want your side when youre facing onslaught wretched programming its small fry with big attitude who taunts his enemies with such put downs as why dont you pick somebody half your size never send man do boys job kahuna who is revealed be grown man trapped body pre schooler slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes post world war ii germany explain has some major connections too he can jump his computer network converse with whoopi goldberg members that nearly forgotten boy band o town or any other celebrity or pseudo celebrity willing be pasted into movie that only unfortunate few are fated see although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that every child has power all you have do is believe kahuna lives what looks like papier mache cave full large plywood plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged windows now defunct f o schwarz location its sad sight indeed there are other four superbabies too just prior climactic showdown with biscane his goons this diaper clad quartet jumps onto kahunas magic carousel where they are transformed into brain boy who wears scaled down cap gown cupid girl who shoots arrows that cause grown men stop fighting hug each other instead bounce baby who is stuck inside orange beach ball baby courageous whose get up proves that only thing that looks worse than grown man tacky hairpiece is toddler bad toupee watching sidelines are baio angel as dizzy owners highly questionable day care center which most children parade around half dressed hilary duff clone skyler shaye frankie muniz lookalike justin chatwin who attempt provide bit squeaky clean teen love interest not exactly what target audience 6 year olds is itching see as was case with baby geniuses movie contains surplus awkward looking digital effects that are supposed convince us wee ones are actually making wisecracks running wild results are generally pitiful if superbabies is marginally better than excruciating geniuses you sure wouldnt want live difference its because director bob clark screenwriter gregory poppen dont shoehorn nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around theyre equally stingy with charm imagination as well by way voights next project is called karate dog which hell co star with simon rex pat morita chevy chase wholl provide voice cho cho according internet movie database do oscar winner big favor call him this weekend really guy must be willing do just about anything couple bucks,0.48195516945516964,0.1006656819156819,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,Not Even Funny,"I saw this movie with my friends just so we could make fun of it, but you can't even really do that, the movie is just so repetitive, boring, and ridiculous that you stop laughing at it start smashing your head against a table. The plot makes no sense and there's nothing holding the movie together, it's like the director made it terrible on purpose just to torture whoever sees it. Don't see the movie, even if you just want to make fun of it, it's just way too terrible. If I had the option of choking myself to death and watching this movie again I would choke myself to death.
