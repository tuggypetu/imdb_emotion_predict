10.0,"The Boy Who Loved ""Star Wars""","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",boy who loved star wars,long time ago galaxy far far away there was boy who was only two years old when original star wars film was released he doesnt remember first seeing movie but he also doesnt remember life before it he does remember first star wars themed gift he got shoebox full action figures original set he was too young fully appreciate how special that gift would be but years later he would get what this day goes down as one best gifts hes ever received another box full action figures ten final twelve he needed complete his collection its now legendary this boys family how last action figure he needed anakin skywalker stopped being produced carried stores how this boy went about ten years until he got into college trying track one down finally bought it someone his dorm floor bag beer nuggets dont ask its northern illinois university thing i cant review star wars as movie it represents absolutely everything good fun magical about my childhood theres no separating it my mind christmases birthdays summers winters growing up winter my friends i would build snow forts pretend we were hoth i was always han solo my friends dad built them kick ass tree house that served as ewok village they also had huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough create sort cave underneath it this made great spot pretend we were yodas home i am unabashedly dorky when it comes star wars i think people either just understand that or they dont i dont get appeal lord rings or star trek but i understand rabid flocks fans that follow them because i am rabid fan george lucass films i feel no need defend my opinion these movies as some greatest all time every time i put them dvd player i feel like im eight years old again when life was simple biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going track down figure anakin skywalker grade entire trilogy,0.5156968641114982,0.23049941927990705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.52}"

8.0,"Flawed, very entertaining solid third sequel an epic conclusion to the original trilogy!","Star Wars: Episode VI â€“ Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.",flawed very entertaining solid third sequel epic conclusion original trilogy,star wars episode vi return jedi 1983 is third sequel original star wars trilogy it is flawed yet very entertaining solid third sequel epic conclusion original star wars trilogy honestly my opinion return jedi is far way better film than force awakens that movie was disaster it sucked i rather watch this movie any time it is not my favorite film series i dont love this movie that much like i love first two movies but i like it it think it is very good at some points film has lot problems that hurts movie i still have enjoyed this movie i had lot fun return jedi 1983 is directed this time richard marquand different director than it was directed irvin kershner george lucas this movie was released same year that i was born 1983 film is pretty good it is own way but other thing it suffers problems flaws things i like this movie first hour is set back planet tatooine which is rescue mission which i like story is set where first movie begins ends here jedi knight luke skywalker chewbacca lando calrissian princess leia organa c 3po r2 d2 return tatooine rescue han solo who was encased carbonite at end star wars episode v empire strikes back gangster jabba hutt voice larry ward battle ship with luke steadily taking fight jabbas men during battle leia strangles jabba death with chain around her neck with r2 d2s help escapes her bonds heroes destroy ship kills bad guys save han solo i love explosion rescue than they are all save i love that we find out ghost obi wan ben kenobi alec guinness that leia carrie fisher is sister luke mark hamill i love that luke revels leia that she is his sister i like battle endor leia han chewbacca c 3po r2 d2 ewoks are battling stormtroopers destroying shield generator second death star they do destroy it lando his assault team destroys deaths tar end luke face darth vader evil emperor fights both them while they where both trying bring him dark side force join them i love when vader toys with notion turning leia dark side luke gives his rage furiously gains upper hand battle slicing off vaders right robotic hand rage one swift cut makes his father succumb defeat at mercy his sons blade realizing that luke cannot be turned emperor uses force lightning against him torture attempt kill him deeply affected by sight his son dying before him vader repents turns emperor throwing him down reactor shaft his death luke trys save anakin but he dies before he could save him i feel that lukes transition teenager calm collected warrior force feels very authentic his conflict between darth vader emperor contains some best scenes entire saga things i dont like film has few problems that are really unnecessary i really hate it this movies biggest flaw is pacing ewoks their role film star wars been forest arent star wars suppose set galaxy not forest personally i dont mind ewoks but their introduction causes movie comes screeching halt another fault this movie is its attempts at humor it feels often unnatural forced lot time phantom menace has been notorious having this problem as well but they most likely originated here master yoda dies this film why watching yoda prequels i have really enjoyed him much more than i have watching him last two movies little guy grove up my heart so i disagree about him dying i am giving this movie 8 i watch new hope retun jedi tv as kid i dont remember watching empire strikes back but i have saw those tow movies still i like return jedi lot,0.46753447170113827,0.12369012546095884,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,One Of The Best In The Series,"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",one best series,up until sixth last episode star wars saga which finally ended 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film long running series varied action scenes really different characters jabba hut furry woodland creatures etc made this particularly appealing movie none action ever focused too long one spot either last half hour exemplifies this most as scene switches every few minutes woods battle among space ships individual laser duel between luke skywalker darth vader another nice characteristic this film had that two previous did not was absence fighting between two stars gone was incessant bickering between carrie fisher harrison ford finally everyone was same page it was nice see end this was simply wonderful adventure tale more than anything else,0.45659722222222227,0.1953125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.52}"
,"Fitting closure to the 'Star Wars' series, now out on DVD.","My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time.

6.0,"The least effective of the original trilogy, but packed with charm and excitement","As a child, I owned all of the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS, purchased when 'remastering' was all the rage and the iconic sci-fi saga found itself on the receiving end of a much-needed cleaning-up. This was, however, before George Lucas tampered with his already- near-perfect legacy, adding unneeded special effects and elongating certain scenes for seemingly no other reason to show how far CGI had come (although it now looks incredibly dated). Despite the perfection of episodes four and five, my go-to Star Wars movie on a boring Sunday afternoon was always Return of the Jedi, the third instalment now widely remembered as the poorest of the bunch. I don't quite know what it was about Jedi that always caused me to reach for it. It certainly wasn't the Ewoks, those cuddly fur-balls shoe-horned in to sell more merchandise, although they aren't as annoying or distracting as I remembered.Jedi is most certainly the least effective of Lucas' creation, but there's still plenty of charm and excitement to solidify the entry as, at the very least, a satisfying closure to the saga, despite Disney's welcome efforts to further explore the Star Wars universe. The Empire Strikes Back broke up its characters but managed to keep a firm grasp on the various story-threads. Jedi does the same again, but is less successful at holding all the action together. Nevertheless, the characters get to enjoy an early reunion at Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, where the slug-like abomination hangs Han Solo (Harrison Ford), still frozen in his carbonite prison from the last movie. C- 3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) all arrive at various intervals as part of a rescue operation, as does Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the latter having completed his Jedi training and going about his business with a brooding confidence.A horrific car crash may have robbed Hamill of some of his boyish good-looks, but it did nothing to dampen his skills as an actor. Skywalker's newly-found intensity, which no doubt stems from his flourishing grasp on the Force and skill with a lightsaber, is matched by Hamill's execution. He stops by to see Yoda (Frank Oz), who confirms that Darth Vader is indeed his father and a fallen Jedi, and has a brief chat with the spirit of his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Skywalker's thread is by far the most interesting, inevitably heading towards a showdown with his father and the puppet-master behind the Empire, the rasping Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). Although Vader's brutality has been turned down as he plays lap-dog to his boss, audiences back in 1983 must have been holding their breath as the Emperor tortures Luke in an attempt to turn him to the Dark Side, and Vader is clearly shown to be wrestling with his allegiance.The rest of the action fares less well, as Han Solo and Leia find themselves captured by the community of Ewoks who seem to want to eat them, while C-3PO bares a close resemblance to the God the little critters worship. Their aim is to take down a generator controlling the energy shield of a brand new Death Star - yes, they have somehow managed to nearly complete a bigger, meaner planet- killer in a remarkably short space of time. Lando and the remaining Rebel Alliance are forced to repeat the climax of A New Hope, and while it's certainly a spectacular battle, it can't help but feel like more of the same. Jedi is best remembered as a series of memorable moments than a truly great film. It's easy to forget the film's messy narrative and cynical desire to boost merchandise sales, especially as a child, but it's hard to forget Leia in a gold bikini, Jabba's grotesque rat-like pet, the high-speed chase through the forests of Endor, or the shockingly crap death of fan-favourite Boba Fett. Nowhere near the annoying child-pandering misfire some believe it to be, but also some way off the magnificence of its predecessors.",least effective original trilogy but packed with charm excitement,as child i owned all original star wars trilogy vhs purchased when remastering was all rage iconic sci fi saga found itself receiving end much needed cleaning up this was however before george lucas tampered with his already near perfect legacy adding unneeded special effects elongating certain scenes seemingly no other reason show how far cgi had come although it now looks incredibly dated despite perfection episodes four five my go star wars movie boring sunday afternoon was always return jedi third instalment now widely remembered as poorest bunch i dont quite know what it was about jedi that always caused me reach it it certainly wasnt ewoks those cuddly fur balls shoe horned sell more merchandise although they arent as annoying or distracting as i remembered jedi is most certainly least effective lucas creation but theres still plenty charm excitement solidify entry as at very least satisfying closure saga despite disneys welcome efforts further explore star wars universe empire strikes back broke up its characters but managed keep firm grasp various story threads jedi does same again but is less successful at holding all action together nevertheless characters get enjoy early reunion at jabba hutts palace tatooine where slug like abomination hangs han solo harrison ford still frozen his carbonite prison last movie c 3po anthony daniels r2 d2 kenny baker chewbacca peter mayhew lando calrissian billy dee williams all arrive at various intervals as part rescue operation as does princess leia carrie fisher luke skywalker mark hamill latter having completed his jedi training going about his business with brooding confidence horrific car crash may have robbed hamill some his boyish good looks but it did nothing dampen his skills as actor skywalkers newly found intensity which no doubt stems his flourishing grasp force skill with lightsaber is matched by hamills execution he stops by see yoda frank oz who confirms that darth vader is indeed his father fallen jedi has brief chat with spirit his mentor obi wan kenobi alec guinness skywalkers thread is by far most interesting inevitably heading towards showdown with his father puppet master behind empire rasping emperor ian mcdiarmid although vaders brutality has been turned down as he plays lap dog his boss audiences back 1983 must have been holding their breath as emperor tortures luke attempt turn him dark side vader is clearly shown be wrestling with his allegiance rest action fares less well as han solo leia find themselves captured by community ewoks who seem want eat them while c 3po bares close resemblance god little critters worship their aim is take down generator controlling energy shield brand new death star yes they have somehow managed nearly complete bigger meaner planet killer remarkably short space time lando remaining rebel alliance are forced repeat climax new hope while its certainly spectacular battle it cant help but feel like more same jedi is best remembered as series memorable moments than truly great film its easy forget films messy narrative cynical desire boost merchandise sales especially as child but its hard forget leia gold bikini jabbas grotesque rat like pet high speed chase through forests endor or shockingly crap death fan favourite boba fett nowhere near annoying child pandering misfire some believe it be but also some way off magnificence its predecessors,0.5250932471185633,0.08148135970920778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,"My least favourite film from the original trilogy, but it still makes for essential viewing","So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors? Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.I have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences, maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female, I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive, with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending, and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford, in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music, brilliant and innovative, unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all, while my least favourite of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",my least favourite film original trilogy but it still makes essential viewing,so what made this movie step down than its two predecessors well forgive me nit picking but i didnt think humour is as strong as it was new hope empire strikes back plus while it was evident romantic elements werent as developed either however putting these flaws aside it is still enormously entertaining thanks elaborate set pieces well choreographed battles final battle especially was knockout i will say that it is vast improvement over prequels plot is still fast paced sophisticated screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever i have heard many complaints about ewoks i think it depends your perspective whether you like them or not maybe delight younger audiences maybe too sickly cute adult being 17 year old female i thought they were very cute acting is still very impressive with mark hamill spontaneously likable lead frank oz is perfect yoda his death scene is heart rending ian mcdairmund also steals his scenes as emperor harrison ford inspired bit casting is great again as han solo carrie fisher is still vivacious alec guiness great actor that he was is brilliant as obi wan but my favourite is james earl jones as voice darth vader his majestic booming voice is very ideal dark menacing villain i must mention john williamss music brilliant innovative unquestionably one best film scores all time all all while my least favourite original trilogy return jedi makes essential viewing 9 10 bethany cox,0.5873507805325986,0.28668503213957763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10.0,This movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows the Jedi and Luke needing to save their ally, Solo, who even after being saved will need to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire. For them to be successful, Luke will likely need to face his father one last time.This movie is directed by Richard Marquand (Jagged Edge) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Blade Runner), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Batman), Ian McDiarmid (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) and James Earl Jones (Conan the Barbarian).The entire Jabba the Hutt opening is always one of my favorite sequences in the series and a great way to start the movie. Harrison Ford was hilarious both in his lines and his body language. He couldn't have been better cast. The escape scene in this is everything you could want and every scene on Endor is magic. The chase through the woods opening and the mystery and unveiling of the Ewoks was super cool. The final two battles involving Luke, Vader and the Emperor is classic science fiction gold and a wonderful depiction of the force and the dark side.Overall this movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should.

8.0,Good,"I didn't watch this movie when I was a kid.It is quite normal not to know about this film in Azerbaijan, which used to be a part of the Soviet Union.

7.0,"36 years and 737 reviews later, what is new left to be said?...","...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.It just takes itself too seriously. ""I know he's OK....I can feeeel it!"". Oh, brother. Talking about The Farce being with you. And no I did not just misspell that word.

""So you told me a bunch of lies?"" Luke asks his one time mentor.

Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star.

5.0,"Its fun, but full of holes and inconsistencies","In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can't just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places.The opening sequences in Jabba's palace entertained me to no end as a child, but now it just confuses me. How long has it been since Empire Strikes Back? Didn't Lando and Chewie go in to try and rescue Han? Chewie and the droids are turned over to Jabba, but Leia seems ready to get Han out of there and leave them behind. Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke's plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year, and if so, why wasn't ""is Vader really my father"" not asked then? The film's screenplay is quite messy and doesn't flow on from the rest of the saga. In one typical scene, Yoda admonishes Luke for rushing off to face Vader without proper training, then says he doesn't need anymore training and only when he confronts Vader will he be a Jedi. Again, maybe some concrete evidence on how long has passed would help. This film is the point where the story meant little to Lucas and the details even less (Solo is promoted from Captain to General where all he did was get frozen in carbonite, and Calrissian walks off the street into the role of General!). I've always regarded Darth Vader quite lowly on my list of movie villains, and watching Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back I found myself wondering why. I now realise its because Return of the Jedi completely nukes him. The idea of there still being good in Vader comes completely out of nowhere - he tortured his son with the knowledge that his father is the most evil man in the galaxy and then chopped his hand off and let him fall to his likely death. The addition of Emperor Palpatine also relegates Darth Vader to a side character - during the conversations between Luke and the Emperor, Vader sort of stands diffently to the side and chips in with the occasional ""yeah. what he said."" Palpatine's character development pretty much begins and ends with ""evil"" - he seems so sure that Luke will join him, yet Luke's battle with the dark side emerges only as a plot point in those scenes. Even if Luke turns to the dark side, what will make him join Palpatine? The expanded universe implies more information about this, but its not very well established here. The execution is pretty inconsistent - Luke goes from being Alec Guinness-style calm to flailing his lightsaber around like he's never held one before. Now that I mention it, Mark Hamill seems to be playing two characters simultaneously. I've covered what I didn't like, but this is a Star Wars film and there's so much to love. The epic space battle at the second Death Star only reminds me how much I missed it in Empire Strikes Back. Ford is having a lot of fun in this movie, and the rest of the cast delivers pretty solidly as well. The gorgeously shot introduction of Red Guards in stark contrast with the white stormtroopers is a beautiful throwback to Vader's black/white contrast in the original Star Wars, and once again, it tells us the bars have been raised. The sound editing/mixing is always in good form in Star Wars - my favourite scene being a harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as Luke says Vader won't hurt him or turn him over to Palpatine. The Battle of Endor walks a narrow line between cheesy and genuinely exciting, and Marquand keeps the Ewoks just shy of the Gungans.Return of the Jedi is a really fun movie, but its not a cinematic artwork like its predecessors. I grew up watching this film, but when I read about where the story would have gone were it not for Lucas' toy revenue - the death of Han Solo and a tired Luke walking into the distance like an old Western - I'd be lying if I said the film's sickly sweet dance party ending didn't stick in my craw just a bit.",its fun but full holes inconsistencies,many ways return jedi cut firmly against brilliant grain set by empire strikes back reason empire was so effective was that it showed us rebels were still losing you cant just destroy death star have everything go away but here lucas rounds out trilogy with another climactic space battle everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask return jedi is clearly least impressive original trilogy it is full holes tonal inconsistencies plot implausibilities id chalk this up richard marquand not being half as competent as irvin kershner departure gary kurtz project kurtz reportedly left because he lucas couldnt agree whether story or spectacle should take priority lucas was obviously favour spectacle you can tell because return jedis story makes absolutely no sense places opening sequences jabbas palace entertained me no end as child but now it just confuses me how long has it been since empire strikes back didnt lando chewie go try rescue han chewie droids are turned over jabba but leia seems ready get han out there leave them behind was it plan get captured was lukes plan get captured since when can luke do jedi mind tricks did luke go back train with yoda year if so why wasnt is vader really my father not asked then films screenplay is quite messy doesnt flow rest saga one typical scene yoda admonishes luke rushing off face vader without proper training then says he doesnt need anymore training only when he confronts vader will he be jedi again maybe some concrete evidence how long has passed would help this film is point where story meant little lucas details even less solo is promoted captain general where all he did was get frozen carbonite calrissian walks off street into role general ive always regarded darth vader quite lowly my list movie villains watching star wars empire strikes back i found myself wondering why i now realise its because return jedi completely nukes him idea there still being good vader comes completely out nowhere he tortured his son with knowledge that his father is most evil man galaxy then chopped his hand off let him fall his likely death addition emperor palpatine also relegates darth vader side character during conversations between luke emperor vader sort stands diffently side chips with occasional yeah what he said palpatines character development pretty much begins ends with evil he seems so sure that luke will join him yet lukes battle with dark side emerges only as plot point those scenes even if luke turns dark side what will make him join palpatine expanded universe implies more information about this but its not very well established here execution is pretty inconsistent luke goes being alec guinness style calm flailing his lightsaber around like hes never held one before now that i mention it mark hamill seems be playing two characters simultaneously ive covered what i didnt like but this is star wars film theres so much love epic space battle at second death star only reminds me how much i missed it empire strikes back ford is having lot fun this movie rest cast delivers pretty solidly as well gorgeously shot introduction red guards stark contrast with white stormtroopers is beautiful throwback vaders black white contrast original star wars once again it tells us bars have been raised sound editing mixing is always good form star wars my favourite scene being harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as luke says vader wont hurt him or turn him over palpatine battle endor walks narrow line between cheesy genuinely exciting marquand keeps ewoks just shy gungans return jedi is really fun movie but its not cinematic artwork like its predecessors i grew up watching this film but when i read about where story would have gone were it not lucas toy revenue death han solo tired luke walking into distance like old western id be lying if i said films sickly sweet dance party ending didnt stick my craw just bit,0.47295657726692214,0.09650383141762453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,...and the trilogy is finished with yet another great film.,"After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.",trilogy is finished with yet another great film,after star wars new hope redefined science fiction empire strikes back redefined star wars its hard believe that third final film this trilogy can manage be as good as other two but this one really does nice job first part film resolves cliffhanger left by previous one with elaborate escape plan that is keeping with incredible suspense action first two films then film moves back rebel alliance whats going war there is lot action scenes building up rebellions final confrontation with emperor when battle begins audience is already edge their seats everything leading up it this final battle is even more intense than those other films this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part trilogy with most at stake rebellion this is continually changing between ground battle between rebel strike crew land including han solo chewbacca leia battle raging space including lando confrontation between luke emperor new death star which leads up another duel with darth vader it is really intense since rebels constantly seem be losing battle that will determine outcome war there seems be no escape although i think idea ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is bit far fetched it didnt seem very unrealistic since they were more distraction that rebels could use rather than actual threat stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them there is also twist or two at end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that empire strikes back but still complete very spectacular trilogy very well with light tone new hope more sinnister tone empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining two this grand finale special edition return jedi concentrated what would have been nice change since not much original really needed it fifteen years technology advancements didnt seem make up fifteen years deterioration as far as rancor scene is concerned there still is occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good gaping non threatening sarlaacs mouth was given moving tentacles huge fly trap looking head that emerged which definitely added suspense also disco was taken out jabbas palace lame ending original was replaced by huge victory celebration spanning entire galaxy instead just small ewok village which was case original that didnt really end story this big way it deserved its hard say which three films was best but since its all part same story over all trilogy is like one big outstanding film third must see film fans,0.513874154014999,0.19378498262301078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9.0,A touching end,"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks! True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable. Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant. It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius!

7.0,Age helps final episode of sci-fi saga,"Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: ""Return of the Jedi"". Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga. Following on from the conclusion of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts. Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire. Now swathed all in black, Luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty Sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone. The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke's destiny is played out on screen. ROTJ really is Luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original. His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in ""Empire"". In fact only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion. This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from ""Star Wars"", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. Ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all. Fisher's Leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", John Williams' score is as much a part of ""Star Wars"" folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again. ROTJ works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. Is it already? The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series. This is why ""Return of the Jedi"" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.",age helps final episode sci fi saga,perspective is good thing since release star wars episode i phantom menace claims counter claims just how episodes ii iii will eventuate has taken spotlight off original star wars films making them part cohesive whole rather than segregating older new films into separate trilogies what new films have done is allow fresh perspectives be placed older films this new outlook allows us greater appreciate what has often been viewed as weakest original trilogy return jedi often derided its overly cute factor rotj is sense as strong as original only slightly less impressive than nearly perfect empire strikes back indeed cute element rotj namely ewoks remains weak link entire series did george lucas place furry midgets film purely merchandising possibilities only he can answer that question this cute factor aside film is brilliant full circle evolution saga following conclusion empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill follows his rebel alliance friends tatooine his home planet rescue han solo harrison ford space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba hutt overdue debts skywalker is changed man since leaving tatooine with ben obi wan kenobi alec guiness fight evil empire now swathed all black lukes discovery his origins have left him confused torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest while he might aim always assist his rebel friends he yearns another chance confront evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as whether he will destroy him or eventually turn dark side join vader at emperors side early scenes tatooine are impressive jabbas lair his floating palace almighty sarlac intenstine that lives sand lucas cgi enhancements film 1997 actually worsened overall effect sarlac making it look fake overdone battle scene tatooine is outstanding is one more memorable saga luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba his cronies proving his prowess as jedi is now almost complete when luke returns degobah system visit ailing yoda one more time viewer is let down by yodas distinct lack screentime undoubtably star empire strikes back yoda is all but erased story as progression lukes destiny is played out screen rotj really is lukes film perhaps even more so than original his journey carries movie as he moves closer his confrontation with darth vader his fate other rebel characters certainly work his shadow romance between leia carrie fisher solo is all but non existant unlike empire fact only leias character is developed rotj solos character seems fade as facets his personality have become too familiar first two films their roles are consigned working alongside rebels destroy all new death star that nears completion this time emperor himself is overseeing final stages construction empire intends crush rebellion once all while emperor himself schemes bring now powerful skywalker his side work alongside or is that replace darth vader emperor is different kind evil this film less cunning than governor tarkin peter cushing star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid emperor is just one those characters you love hate all other actors are well entrenched their roles hamill surprises as more wisened luke making his characters progression whiny teenager impatient student enlightened warrior one few real character developments series fords role is waring thin as all his charm charisma was spent first two films he was real star first film after all fishers leia is more prop at least unti end film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda loveable chewbacca c 3po r2d2 series resembles family more than cast despite films corny forest battle involving ewoks empire it ends well includes three way battle sequence endor space death star each with very impressive special effects music as always is brilliant captures mood perfectly every instance just as blue danube worked perfectly 2001 space odyssey john williams score is as much part star wars folklore as light sabers force lucas left ending open interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made indeed sci fi fans have created their own versions episodes vii viii ix their heads over over again rotj works when given chance furry cute animals aside is good finish series when all six episodes get be viewed together this saga could well be best ever made is it already addition episode i changed landscape series this is why return jedi can now be viewed different light be given whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release,0.5574396563032927,0.19010888101797188,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,The Empire finally Falls....,"After ''Empire strikes back'' ''Return of the Jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series.Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba,where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess Leia in a disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca's cell.Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it. Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han,Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. Luke,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han,Luke and Chewie as well c3po and R2. Everybody's safe again,Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi,as well his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda says to Luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's dad, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies,Obi wan's spirit shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.At the same time, the Emperor says to Vader that he must give Luke to him when he shows up, since Luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side.Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' Death Star 2'', Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and chewie needs to turn off the 'Death star 2' power field, with the help of the EWOKS.

10.0,The Last Jedi,"Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO and R2-D2 go to Taooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the powerful criminal Jabba the Hutt. After many fights, they are well succeeded in their mission. The group returns to the Rebel Alliance base while Luke heads to Dagobah to finish his training with Yoda; however the Jedi is dying and he confirms that Darth Vader (David Prowse) is his father and Luke also learns that he has a sister, Leia. Meanwhile the rebels discover that the Empire is building a new Death Star more powerful than the first one that is protected by an energy shield generated by a generator in planet Endor. Luke and his group goes to the forest in the planet to destroy the generator while Lando and the rebels wait for the right moment to attack the station. The group in Endor teams-up with the inhabitants, Ewoks, to fight against the Imperial troops but they are captured in a trap; Luke is brought to Darth Vader but he refuses to fight against his father.

""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is the last episode of the fantastic saga. In 1983, this film was a sensation and now, in 2015, it has not lost the impact.
