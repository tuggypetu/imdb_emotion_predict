7.0,Sorry but this made me laugh.,"Just needed an easy no brainer comedy after my week. This ticked the boxes. Couple of tokes, and this movie, made me laugh. Changed the course of my day.

8.0,I wasn't expecting to have this much fun.,"What a cool , simple but really effective feel good movie. The characters are fun , some jokes are brilliant when they go into the political incorrect territory and the whole plot line works because the main actress is awesome.There's not much to say about this. Initially it feels like another of those terrible high school teenage films but soon we get into some absurd and adult humor that makes the vibe change and this becomes a funny satire about woke which is not afraid to offend everyone and does it with a big smile.If you don't get offended easily and you have a good sense of humor watch this. If you offend easily , then it's almost mandatory. One of the best feel good movies on Netflix right now.",i wasnt expecting have this much fun,what cool simple but really effective feel good movie characters are fun some jokes are brilliant when they go into political incorrect territory whole plot line works because main actress is awesome theres not much say about this initially it feels like another those terrible high school teenage films but soon we get into some absurd adult humor that makes vibe change this becomes funny satire about woke which is not afraid offend everyone does it with big smile if you dont get offended easily you have good sense humor watch this if you offend easily then its almost mandatory one best feel good movies netflix right now,0.5172448979591838,0.2706802721088436,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.34, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.41}"

3.0,Painful.,"Although there is the occasional amusing inappropriate zinger Rebel Wilson is known for, this is basically a bottom of the barrel adult-oriented variation on the endless plethora of Disneyesque teen fantasies from the early millenium.

5.0,Sugary story with a light satirical core,"Despite being a formulaic cliché, this does have an interesting satirical element. Of course all the tired tropes are there, unrequited love, wonder at technology development and child in a woman's body.The intriguing part is the stark contrast in sensibilities over twenty years. Naturally it is caricatured for comedic effect, but perhaps we have thrown the baby out with the bathwater.

3.0,A Horror Movie in Disguise,"Senior Year is a lighthearted comedy with a few decent chuckles. In most cases that would be enough. The problem comes in how it deals with its premise.Steph (Rebel Wilson) is involved in a cheerleadering accident that leaves her comatose for 20 years. When she wakes up she's 37, but from her perspective she was 17 only hours before.This tragic premise was an opportunity to centre the movie around heart, empathy, and the struggle of helping someone in an impossible situation. The majority of jokes could have stayed in, but this underlying theme could have brought depth and compassion to the characters, particularly in the third act.Instead, the characters around Steph insist that she ""grow up"" and start acting like an adult, something she fundamentally hasn't had time to become. Not even the most reasonable and caring characters bother to empathise with her extremely difficult situation, resulting in every one of them feeling like a shallow, self-absorbed husk, no matter how the script struggles to convince us otherwise.There's a deep sense of both horror and tragedy in the premise of Senior Year that could have been leveraged to craft a movie with true depth and heart, but is instead treated as a shallow setup for a standard story of a protagonist stuck in the past.",horror movie disguise,senior year is lighthearted comedy with few decent chuckles most cases that would be enough problem comes how it deals with its premise steph rebel wilson is involved cheerleadering accident that leaves her comatose 20 years when she wakes up shes 37 but her perspective she was 17 only hours before this tragic premise was opportunity centre movie around heart empathy struggle helping someone impossible situation majority jokes could have stayed but this underlying theme could have brought depth compassion characters particularly third act instead characters around steph insist that she grow up start acting like adult something she fundamentally hasnt had time become not even most reasonable caring characters bother empathise with her extremely difficult situation resulting every one them feeling like shallow self absorbed husk no matter how script struggles convince us otherwise theres deep sense both horror tragedy premise senior year that could have been leveraged craft movie with true depth heart but is instead treated as shallow setup standard story protagonist stuck past,0.5058333333333334,-0.04583333333333332,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.46}"
