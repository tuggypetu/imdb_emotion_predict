3.0,Rushed clumsy b-movie,"Warning Spoilers.First part of the movie, tried to be some kind of self-ironic introspective on the state of movies and even made a direct reference to a Matrix sequel. Now the problem with that kind of commentary is that you effectively break the 4th wall or ruin any idea that this isn't just a movie.The film then stumbles towards some kind of plot about the new matrix and Neo/Trinity but fails miserably.The ending is a bore fest of mindless dark action (I mean filmed in the dark) with no tension or point.Did they have a budget of 10m and a timeline of a week to make this film, it certainly looks like it.The original Matrix, in my opinion, is the best film ever made. It has perfect pacing, actions, beautifully realised, cool conversations, properly filmed and choreographed action scenes and even manages a philosophical theme, with all that going on. There is tension, people may and do die, there is a purpose to what they want to achieve. It had a serious tone. It established a set of rules, which is crucial to this type of movie. It was an against-the-odds film.In this, the fights are meaningless, badly filmed, just thrown in for no reason. Neo now just has a super-power and that's it. There is no tension, no one dies, nothing is really at stake, the FX are terrible. When Neo realises, he has Kung Fu abilities again, he has zero reaction, nothing.Did anyone believe the Japanese train was real? The casting is awful, did anyone care about any of the characters and their terrible acting. It looked rushed, cheap, and amateurish.The mocking of the original film and it dialog was sacrilege and childish. Showing actual film footage and claiming it was game footage, really?I suspect the comment at the beginning of the movie, about having to make a sequel, was genuine, so they made the worse film they could.",rushed clumsy b movie,warning spoilers first part movie tried be some kind self ironic introspective state movies even made direct reference matrix sequel now problem with that kind commentary is that you effectively break 4th wall or ruin any idea that this isnt just movie film then stumbles towards some kind plot about new matrix neo trinity but fails miserably ending is bore fest mindless dark action i mean filmed dark with no tension or point did they have budget 10m timeline week make this film it certainly looks like it original matrix my opinion is best film ever made it has perfect pacing actions beautifully realised cool conversations properly filmed choreographed action scenes even manages philosophical theme with all that going there is tension people may do die there is purpose what they want achieve it had serious tone it established set rules which is crucial this type movie it was against odds film this fights are meaningless badly filmed just thrown no reason neo now just has super power thats it there is no tension no one dies nothing is really at stake fx are terrible when neo realises he has kung fu abilities again he has zero reaction nothing did anyone believe japanese train was real casting is awful did anyone care about any characters their terrible acting it looked rushed cheap amateurish mocking original film it dialog was sacrilege childish showing actual film footage claiming it was game footage really i suspect comment at beginning movie about having make sequel was genuine so they made worse film they could,0.5781914643327688,0.013872811970638048,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,What was this?,"Some kind of fan-fiction? Did they write 5 scripts and couldn't decide on which one to go with so the blended them together? This was not a Matrix movie by any stretch of the imagination. Even worse than Reloaded or Revolutions. This was a mess of a movie, and the action scenes made no sense. I don't know who the fight choreographer was, but they must have been sold a bill of goods with whoever they went with. Also, Neo can fight, then he can't, then he can? Also, the action in the other Matrix movies (even the bad ones) you could tell what was going on. This seemed like every time there was a fight scene in this one, they used a lot of shaky cam/quick cuts so the action was incomprehensible. If you are going to bring The Matrix back for another installment after almost 20 years, you had better have something special, as the original Matrix used all the newest technology available at the time to tell an already awesome story. This one, they tried to make action scenes (which were awful) to cover up the fact that they had nothing to add to The Matrix story, and both together were just embarrassing. 5 stars only because Keanu Reeves was in this. I don't know why he agreed to do it, but he was there, I don't think he brought his A game, but he was, in fact, in the movie. That's about all I can say, no one in this movie looked exited to be making it.",what was this,some kind fan fiction did they write 5 scripts couldnt decide which one go with so blended them together this was not matrix movie by any stretch imagination even worse than reloaded or revolutions this was mess movie action scenes made no sense i dont know who fight choreographer was but they must have been sold bill goods with whoever they went with also neo can fight then he cant then he can also action other matrix movies even bad ones you could tell what was going this seemed like every time there was fight scene this one they used lot shaky cam quick cuts so action was incomprehensible if you are going bring matrix back another installment after almost 20 years you had better have something special as original matrix used all newest technology available at time tell already awesome story this one they tried make action scenes which were awful cover up fact that they had nothing add matrix story both together were just embarrassing 5 stars only because keanu reeves was this i dont know why he agreed do it but he was there i dont think he brought his game but he was fact movie thats about all i can say no one this movie looked exited be making it,0.48690476190476195,0.041607142857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.34}"
3.0,The Matrix Regurgitated,"I had been holding off from watching The Matrix Resurrections for fear of disappointment, but I eventually took the red pill and went down the rabbit hole, hoping I would party like it was 1999. I hate to say it, but the party is well and truly over: The Matrix Reloaded peed in the punch, and Revolutions made a right royal mess of the bathroom, but Resurrections calls the police, who break down the door and arrest everyone for disturbing the peace. In short, a good time is not had by all.Keanu Reeves, sporting his strange half-beard and lank hair, once again plays Neo, who has been resurrected by the machines and plugged back into the Matrix as top games designer Thomas Anderson, famous for his groundbreaking Matrix series (how meta!). Thomas is approached by some alternative types with stupid names and stupid hair who convince him that his life is a lie and extract him from the matrix. After regaining his mojo (kung fu skills and stopping bullets in mid-air), Neo and his new pals attempt to rescue Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is still being used as a battery by the machines.Part four in the franchise, directed by Lana Wachowski, should have been called The Matrix Regurgitations for it is content to deliver exactly the same kind of nonsense as seen almost two decades ago in Reloaded and Revolutions, namely lots of shooting, lots of fighting, lots of explosions, lots of CGI, and an incomprehensible load of old cyber-crap masquerading as a plot. In short, it's a big case of déjà vu (see what I did there?). Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne had the good sense to stay away from this embarrassing attempt to flog an old horse to death; I bet Christina Ricci and Neil Patrick Harris wish they had followed suit.",matrix regurgitated,i had been holding off watching matrix resurrections fear disappointment but i eventually took red pill went down rabbit hole hoping i would party like it was 1999 i hate say it but party is well truly over matrix reloaded peed punch revolutions made right royal mess bathroom but resurrections calls police who break down door arrest everyone disturbing peace short good time is not had by all keanu reeves sporting his strange half beard lank hair once again plays neo who has been resurrected by machines plugged back into matrix as top games designer thomas anderson famous his groundbreaking matrix series how meta thomas is approached by some alternative types with stupid names stupid hair who convince him that his life is lie extract him matrix after regaining his mojo kung fu skills stopping bullets mid air neo his new pals attempt rescue trinity carrie anne moss who is still being used as battery by machines part four franchise directed by lana wachowski should have been called matrix regurgitations it is content deliver exactly same kind nonsense as seen almost two decades ago reloaded revolutions namely lots shooting lots fighting lots explosions lots cgi incomprehensible load old cyber crap masquerading as plot short its big case d j vu see what i did there hugo weaving laurence fishburne had good sense stay away this embarrassing attempt flog old horse death i bet christina ricci neil patrick harris wish they had followed suit,0.42088229231086377,-0.05109642341785198,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"

2.0,"And I Thought ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" Were Bad","After ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" I knew that the odds were better than good that ""Resurrections"" was going to be awful. Still, I went against my better judgment and went to see it. Part of it has to do with a false hope and part of it has to do with the dearth of movies to watch in theater.The movie is called ""Resurrections"" because ""duh,"" Neo (Keanu Reeves) is resurrected along with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). I won't even go into the ridiculous mumbo jumbo spouted out to explain their resurrection. It all made as much sense as the Architect did in ""Revolutions."" Just know that Neo was magically back as was Trinity. Morpheus (Yahya Abdul Mateen) was back in some cyborg manner and Agent Smith (Jonathan Groff) was a younger version. I think it's telling that both Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving were not a part of this project. I think they saw the script and thought better of having such a stain on their resumes.You know a movie is bad when they spoof themselves within the movie. You'll occasionally see that in vapid sequels that are fresh out of ideas such as Scream 3 and 4 or ""New Nightmare"" (A Nightmare on Elm Street 6). In the beginning of ""Resurrections"" Neo was back to being Thomas Anderson. He was a game designer who had designed a game called ""The Matrix."" Basically, the three previous Matrix movies were all just designs of his. His coworkers spent way too much screen time discussing what the Matrix was supposed to mean and what a new Matrix video game should be. It was quite pathetic seeing the movie try so hard to make it seem like everything that had occurred was all Mr. Anderson's imagination. It was a forced plot if there ever was one.To further drive home that the movie wasn't going to generate anything fresh and new, there were frequent insertions of scenes from Matrixes past. There were probably a dozen or more clips from the older movies thrust into ""Resurrections"" to either refresh the viewer's memory or add content that was actually good. All that does is denigrate the movie at hand because you're constantly being reminded of how good it was. It's as if the production team gave up already and conceded that what people yearn for is the original but we will never be able to amount to that, so here are some clips from the original as a supplement. Even the way the archive footage was shoehorned in there showed a lack of creativity or concern.I could rant on about the putridness of this movie, but what would be the point? It was long, slow, boring, talkative, emotionless, and unexciting. Nothing about it was new, fresh, or stimulating. The fighting was the same as were the outfits and copious bullets fired. This movie was just a stale remake dressed as a sequel, but I deserved what I got because I knew better.",i thought reloaded revolutions were bad,after reloaded revolutions i knew that odds were better than good that resurrections was going be awful still i went against my better judgment went see it part it has do with false hope part it has do with dearth movies watch theater movie is called resurrections because duh neo keanu reeves is resurrected along with trinity carrie anne moss i wont even go into ridiculous mumbo jumbo spouted out explain their resurrection it all made as much sense as architect did revolutions just know that neo was magically back as was trinity morpheus yahya abdul mateen was back some cyborg manner agent smith jonathan groff was younger version i think its telling that both laurence fishburne hugo weaving were not part this project i think they saw script thought better having such stain their resumes you know movie is bad when they spoof themselves within movie youll occasionally see that vapid sequels that are fresh out ideas such as scream 3 4 or new nightmare nightmare elm street 6 beginning resurrections neo was back being thomas anderson he was game designer who had designed game called matrix basically three previous matrix movies were all just designs his his coworkers spent way too much screen time discussing what matrix was supposed mean what new matrix video game should be it was quite pathetic seeing movie try so hard make it seem like everything that had occurred was all mr andersons imagination it was forced plot if there ever was one further drive home that movie wasnt going generate anything fresh new there were frequent insertions scenes matrixes past there were probably dozen or more clips older movies thrust into resurrections either refresh viewers memory or add content that was actually good all that does is denigrate movie at hand because youre constantly being reminded how good it was its as if production team gave up already conceded that what people yearn is original but we will never be able amount that so here are some clips original as supplement even way archive footage was shoehorned there showed lack creativity or concern i could rant about putridness this movie but what would be point it was long slow boring talkative emotionless unexciting nothing about it was new fresh or stimulating fighting was same as were outfits copious bullets fired this movie was just stale remake dressed as sequel but i deserved what i got because i knew better,0.4507225028058361,-0.024852693602693612,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"

In this movie, it just feels like action vomit all over the screen. It ranges from mediocre to bad. And only one part is memorable (certain things are falling onto the street). The fight scenes suffer from close ups and quick cuts, something we never see in the originals.The more I think about it, a 4 star rating seems generous. But that's how I felt leaving the theater.

2.0,"Felt like a sequel to ""Battlefield Earth"" rather then ""Matrix""","Greetings from Lithuania.""The Matrix"" (1999) is in my TOP 3 movies of all time. I was a teenager when it came out and i basically grew up with it. I liked ""Reloaded"" and even ""Revolutions"" was pretty OK movie.Cut to almost 20 years later and we have ""The Matrix Resurrections"" (2021). I was exited after the amazing trailer, yet the track record of movies that Wachowski made after ""Revolutions"" was not giving many hopes. And after seeing latest one on a premier day just now i can say that ""Resurrections"" is the worst movie I've seen in many moons, unfortunately. It was excruciatingly bad.Story was a mess. Writing was horrible. It was so poorly written that audience was started to laugh at things that were not supposed to be funny. Directing was terrible. The only good thing in this disaster was Jessica Henwick's acting - she was good. And Keanu Reeves just sleepwalked trough the whole thing.Overall, ""Resurrections"" felt like a parody of the original trilogy - i kid you not. You have to see by yourself Jada Pinkett Smith's Niobe to believe it - and i will say nothing more. It literally felt like a sequel to ""Battlefield Earth"" (2000) rather to one of the best films ever made. On the other hand - in its 2 h 20 min run time it wasn't boring - with my broken heart i can safely say that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was so bad that it was actually fun to watch.

3.0,It's hard to figure out what's the purpose here,"Original Matrix was a very interesting movie, pretty original and with real artistic value.The second was an attempt to go deeper on the same theme(s), but, it didn't work out very well.The third one was an attempt to wrap things up. It got a little silly near the end, but, it still had _some_ sense of purpose and meaning.But, this... it's completely lost in... well, it's own matrix.Yes, there are a few interesting ideas, like Thomas Anderson making a gaming trilogy that is like the real Matrix movie trilogy and (some) machines siding with humans. But, there are very few.There's one joke that works, but is ruined shortly afterwards. Many attempts at mocking Laurence Fishburne's take on Morpheus land very, very badly. The whole concept of ""The One"", which is the whole point of the trilogy is shattered to pieces with the concept of ""The Pair""... Actually, the whole conclusion of the trilogy is essentially thrown out the window. Just because it wasn't very good and a lot of people didn't like it, doesn't mean you can just pretend like it didn't happen - at least, if you want to do that, explain it somehow, like, make it a dream or some such thing.It's boring a _lot_ of the time. Barney Stinson of HIMYM fame is completely wasted here, even though the general idea of casting him as the Analyst makes some sense, but he both has a few jokes and gags and they are so bad, nobody could pull them off. The next generation leader, which is, of course, a girl, speaks very fast and strange, I could not understand her most of the time. The end with Trinity performing meaningless violence against Barney Stinson is meaningless (he's a computer program, it has no real effect), out of character for her and for Neo who's being a voyeur of the whole silly thing...And, at long last, Priyanka Chopra ain't no Monica Bellucci, not even close.It kind of feels like a very high-end fan film. Yes, those are the characters and that's the setting/environment, but, it's done by people who both don't understand them very well and don't know much about the movie making.Since it's not _terrible_, just bad, if you're a huge Matrix fan, I guess it would make sense to see it.

It was barely coherent. The rest of the movie got slightly better. But there was no real story. Some parts were enjoyable. Some weren't. But, at the end, I didn't feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again. The original Matrix, on the other hand, I still watch that at least once a year.

1.0,A sad remake of itself,"So what if you could remake the original Matrix film, but this time without the big reveal of what the Matrix is and add a twist that tries to explain why you could do that? It's like an idea you joke around about but not actually make into a film that you've made before. And in typical Hollywood fashion, they remake the same thing but just bigger, flashier, with things they think are even cooler, - and results in something so much dumber. Things in this Matrix don't need to make sense provided they look cool, which is all that matters.This Matrix should have stayed dead. Action? No, not really, at least not for a very large part of it - and the kung fu actually sucks. This is The Matrix: A Love Story. But this time, with just cooler looking characters and mumbo jumbo that explains the technology stuff in a way that doesn't make sense to us people but it does to the actors, who nod their heads and smile as if they really know what that techno gobbledygook means.""Wow, this code is freaky!!!!"" one actor says in excitement! LOL, the film becomes a parody of itself, along with replacement actors who can't help but try their best to mimic the iconic performances of a cast that happened to have been cast perfectly. My single word review of this tripe is the replacement phrase for ""whoa!!!"" that was in the original film. ""Fuuuuuuuu*****!"" See it if you're curious.

What a dud,"Matrix resurrection is nothing more than nonsensical garbage with a few rehashed scenes from the original trilogy thrown in for nostalgia.This movie lacks everything that made ""The Matrix"" original & exciting & is more snoozefest than blockbuster.A far better choice would've been to cast a new young lead to continue the story of humans vs the machines.More time spent on developing a decent story would've been far better than throwing copious amounts of money at cgi artists & stuntmen.",wow what dud,matrix resurrection is nothing more than nonsensical garbage with few rehashed scenes original trilogy thrown nostalgia this movie lacks everything that made matrix original exciting is more snoozefest than blockbuster far better choice wouldve been cast new young lead continue story humans vs machines more time spent developing decent story wouldve been far better than throwing copious amounts money at cgi artists stuntmen,0.5950757575757576,0.24706439393939392,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
4.0,There's a reason why we don't resurrect the dead.,"I remember seeing the Matrix in the cinema as a young kid and it blew my mind. It was the essence of cool, combining a then unfamiliar Hong Kong aesthetic with cutting edge special effects, heady themes, and of course bringing bullet time to the forefront of modern cinema. Visually it was soo revolutionary that the 2003 sequels were never able to recapture that impact, and this sequel is no exception.Nowadays there isn't a single superhero movie that hasn't been built on the Matrix's special effects and evolved it to such a level that Resurrections would have truly have had to have been unique to have the same impact as the original, which is something that I doubt anyone was expecting, so all I was asking for was a solid, well thought out, storyline. And that sadly is something that Resurrection does not have. Hell, half of the movie seems to just be footage from the first three movies, one quarter is millennial characters moaning about millennial issues, and one quarter seems to be new, albeit pointless, content.I can see why Hugo, after reading the script, turned down the chance to reprise his Agent Smith role. I would have done the same if I'd have read the script too. And casting Neil Patrick Harris as a villain? He was so miscast that he was comically bad; I genuinely felt embarrassed for him and his performance. Keanu too, sadly, put it a terrible performance, arguable the worst of his career, and Carrie-Anne Moss was clearly just walking in her performance. Jessica Henwick seemed to be about the only one who could be bothered to act in this movie but sadly her storyline was just as dull as the rest of the movie.Morpheus once said that unfortunately no-one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself. Well I'm telling you now that you do not need to see the movie to know that it's bad. Sometimes you should just leave sleeping dogs lie.",theres reason why we dont resurrect dead,i remember seeing matrix cinema as young kid it blew my mind it was essence cool combining then unfamiliar hong kong aesthetic with cutting edge special effects heady themes course bringing bullet time forefront modern cinema visually it was soo revolutionary that 2003 sequels were never able recapture that impact this sequel is no exception nowadays there isnt single superhero movie that hasnt been built matrixs special effects evolved it such level that resurrections would have truly have had have been unique have same impact as original which is something that i doubt anyone was expecting so all i was asking was solid well thought out storyline that sadly is something that resurrection does not have hell half movie seems just be footage first three movies one quarter is millennial characters moaning about millennial issues one quarter seems be new albeit pointless content i can see why hugo after reading script turned down chance reprise his agent smith role i would have done same if id have read script too casting neil patrick harris as villain he was so miscast that he was comically bad i genuinely felt embarrassed him his performance keanu too sadly put it terrible performance arguable worst his career carrie anne moss was clearly just walking her performance jessica henwick seemed be about only one who could be bothered act this movie but sadly her storyline was just as dull as rest movie morpheus once said that unfortunately no one can be told what matrix is you have see it yourself well im telling you now that you do not need see movie know that its bad sometimes you should just leave sleeping dogs lie,0.5664316323407234,-0.11014145786873057,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2.0,What a disappointment.,"This is so cheap that they basically remade the first film yet made it also a sequel at the same time. The majority of the film has the same structure as the first film and most scenes are exactly the same just altered...The good thing is that CGI is very high quality, but at the same time action scenes feel so generic and uninspired, way inferior to the original film, I admit a few moments were cool, but most action not only feel weak but poorly executed like fights feel like they were made by people who don't know how to fight so they just try to imitate what fighting supposed to look like from what they've seen somewhere else.Music is trying real hard to imitate the soundtrack of original films yet feels weaker and more like rip-offs than remixes or remakes of old tracks.What's up with all the references and literally showing footage from previous films? Do they think we have forgotten the films completely? But the insulting part is that film acknowledges that it references itself to the point that it literally tells that fact a few times - as a joke? I guess, sort of breaking the 4th wall but not really I guess. It's just so lame.There are also so many embarrassing scenes, I laughed so hard at some of the stuff that if this film isn't meme material - I don't know what is then.Also, many of the returning characters often feel completely out of character, and I despise how they treated most characters that do not return for this film. It feels like that Matrix parody by CollegeHumor.Most importantly this feels very long (and it is), yet it shows almost nothing cool, most of it just replicates the first film also making it somehow longer yet worse in every way with the only exception being a much better CGI. It's such a shame that such uninspired sequels like this exist.",what disappointment,this is so cheap that they basically remade first film yet made it also sequel at same time majority film has same structure as first film most scenes are exactly same just altered good thing is that cgi is very high quality but at same time action scenes feel so generic uninspired way inferior original film i admit few moments were cool but most action not only feel weak but poorly executed like fights feel like they were made by people who dont know how fight so they just try imitate what fighting supposed look like what theyve seen somewhere else music is trying real hard imitate soundtrack original films yet feels weaker more like rip offs than remixes or remakes old tracks whats up with all references literally showing footage previous films do they think we have forgotten films completely but insulting part is that film acknowledges that it references itself point that it literally tells that fact few times as joke i guess sort breaking 4th wall but not really i guess its just so lame there are also so many embarrassing scenes i laughed so hard at some stuff that if this film isnt meme material i dont know what is then also many returning characters often feel completely out character i despise how they treated most characters that do not return this film it feels like that matrix parody by collegehumor most importantly this feels very long it is yet it shows almost nothing cool most it just replicates first film also making it somehow longer yet worse every way with only exception being much better cgi its such shame that such uninspired sequels like this exist,0.49235666666666655,0.07744333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
