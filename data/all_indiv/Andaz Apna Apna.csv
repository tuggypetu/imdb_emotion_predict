10.0,The best Hindi comedy ever made!,"There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.",best hindi comedy ever made,there have been very few great comedy films history hindi cinema andaz apna apna happens be one them film is based very simple story two poor young men aamir salman who dream becoming rich by marrying millionaires daughter raveena aamir salman khan try their best outwit each other woo raveena plot thickens when paresh rawal co plan take over all wealth movie is well paced very funny rarely does one come across hindi comedy which is both funny intelligent this is one few films with aamir salman together probably only film unfortunately it did not succeed at box office we might never see film this calibre again aamir khan is brilliant film has proved his versatility as actor this film salman khan gives very good performance as dim wit raveena plays convincing role as confused rich girl karishma who is raveenas assistant friend is also funny paresh rawal junior ajith shakti kapoor deven verma jagdeep tiku talsania just add flavour film all all best hindi comedy ever made i wish they make more quality films like this one you will want watch this film time again p s those you who have watched this film i also suggest gol maal chupke chupke chhoti si baat naram garam hera pheri old new etc,0.6429939703153987,0.29594155844155845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Funniest Indian movie of all time.,"This movie is simply excellent. For some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in India.

9.0,One of the funniest movies in the last few decades. MUST SEE!,"Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being Namak Halal (even though that was technically a drama). Story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual. The plot is rather simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both of them get into Raveena's house, Amar as an injured guy and Prem as his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are complicated as Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work. This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I'd also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).",one funniest movies last few decades must see,andaz apna apna is by far my second favorite comedy all time first being namak halal even though that was technically drama story is nothing groundbreaking but complications that are added it make it awesome aamir khan is total cartoon just watch his expressions song yeh raat aur yeh doori he is amazingly good at comedy i never knew salman khan was also good as somewhat dimmer two characters noises he makes are almost as funny as aamirs faces raveena karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing real pick lot is paresh rawal as usual plot is rather simple amar aamir prem salman are useless sons poor fathers they dont believe hard work just want get rich easy way so both their brains come across idea woo rich mans paresh rawal daughter raveena tandon who comes india look husband so amar prem meet trip join hands drive off hundreds other men trying marry this girl when they succeed they now have get rid each other somehow both them get into raveenas house amar as injured guy prem as his doctor here they try oust each other but things are complicated as raveenas friend karisma kapoor falls prem pursues him rich mans evil twin brother rawal also tries get rid heiress her father so he will inherit money sends his two most trusted but bumbling fools do dirty work this is movie you do not want miss watch it it will be worth it i even own dvd its that good if you like this movie id also recommend gol maal if you havent already watched it other good comedies are namak halal hera pheri new,0.5604510354510356,0.12035217035217036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,funniest movie of the century,"There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and ""Kaliaa"" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being ""loud"" at times, it remains one of the scarce ""funny"" movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.",funniest movie century,there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across yet happen be box office failures andaz apna apna intelligent hilarious comedy falls that catogory once indian director has kept mind sensibilities audience not churned out kader khan type stereo typical hoax movie is about two guys who dream riches try accomplish that by wooing millionaires daughter humorous drama unfolds while lot complexities surface story complexities add sheer comedy entire plot aamir khan plays street smart guy while salman khan gives unexpectedly good performance as dumb guy villian played by paresh rawal his henchmen junior ajit kaliaa make you laugh your sleep although movie borrows lot other movies despite shoddy camerawork despite being loud at times it remains one scarce funny movies bombay has come up with after movies like padosan golmal other amol plaekar movies it is sad that it didnt do well at box office that means producers turn back formulas creativity is abandoned,0.6371031746031747,0.13736772486772486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,This comedy has a script !!!,"Its a spoof, its an intelligent comedy, it has some a pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances by the entire cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and over all an script which is so rare in Indian cinema that too in comedy (watch David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc). Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married. Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. Entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and are funny. Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.All an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema.",this comedy has script,its spoof its intelligent comedy it has some pathetic action choreography mind it it is intentional good hummable songs good performances by entire cast brilliant by amir salman paresh over all script which is so rare indian cinema that too comedy watch david dhawan harmesh malhotra etc story is two wastrels whose only aim is get rich famous by any which ways they come across one such way when they find out that rich nri is coming india get married rest story is about oneupmanship how these wastrels try out wit each other entire cast is perfectly cast right deven verma till viju khote songs are rightly placed are funny surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing this particular act gave him his style comedy all all fum film which you should not ignore if you like watch indian cinema,0.6773809523809525,0.29404761904761906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Best Indian comedy of the Khan era!,"It's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. If you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long.

10.0,Brilliantly Marvellous,"Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you'll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism: Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew but for Mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as Balla had once said, ""A Fraud and a Cheat!""). Now, Gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's Dad), though Teja doesn't regret his actions. Teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.I won't reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!",brilliantly marvellous,andaz apna apna is movie that i treasure its one movie i dont mind seeing at any time well almost any time this movie is simply marvelous according me is funniest movie ive ever seen yes i do put it over hera pheri reason hera pheri has scenes youll watch out but andaz apna apna not possible simply because every scene is scene you got watch out aamir salman share great chemistry are perfect their shoes but ill put characters order favoritism rank 1 crime master gogo shakti kapoors best performance till date yes this happened before casting couch gogo is innocent character who belongs well reputed family mogambo mr india fame crime master gogo is actually mogambos nephew but mogambo hes more than responsible handsome charismatic charming son gogo makes biggest mistake life by lending 36 000 rupees teja who is as balla had once said fraud cheat now gogos only goal is get back whats his his journey recovering his lost money gogo realizes that there is more than 36 000 that he needs achieve thus begins gogos struggle against sinner world rank 2 teja teja main hoon mark idhar hai teja is evil character who is ram gopal bajajs twin originally named shyam gopal bajaj teja chooses change his name suit his personality teja as child had always envied his brother then one day things took turn worse when his father gave his entire wealth ram bajaj teja decided kill his father but nights darkness instead killed munshi harish chandra raveenas dad though teja doesnt regret his actions tejas sole mission now is get back his property somehow start his own poultry bakery farm teja also needs return back loan gogo but has no intentions whatsoever do so order achieve his evil goals teja employs two people robert vijay khote who is very good at aiming balla shahzad khan ajits clone son who is very very smart boy rank 3 amar aamir khan wants marry rich heiress raveena so he sells his fathers cheap saloon heads off mumbai amar has no problem taking care big business that raveenas father will hand him over after their wedding is willing sacrifice his happiness shift london if needed rank 4 prem salman khan after gogo prem is second most innocent character appear movie way amar tries take advantage him mask friend is tragic i wont reveal any more characters because jesus christ i just wouldnt stop typing movie is outright stunning go get dvd now beware those cheap vcds as they have omitted many good scenes out movie background music is stud action is better than matrix especially final encountered between prem crime master gogo watch out it it appears climax andaz apna apna is also drama with many negative positive characters teach us lot about life values ethics it teaches us about bravery why else would amar ask prem stay back when they go meet kidnapper even though prem was complaining that he had go toilet andaz apna apna is also tragedy especially scenes where salman is targeted by aamir is given overdose stomach upsetting pills part where teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldnt go london part where gogo is arrested ending without even getting back his 36 000 andaz apna apna is overall complete package sit back enjoy ride bet therell be second ride after that then third movie was considered flop back then i bet no one liked it but buckle up guys this movie is big hit even if it didnt have enough people coming theatres movie is one highest selling home dvds one most frequently movie most channels so producers have laughed their way banks long time back,0.5259826284826286,0.1557586857586857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,Best Indian Comedy Ever!!!!!!!!,"This is my favourite Indian movie of all time. It is comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count.

When the movie released i was a 8 year old and I heard it was a flop but I never understood till now why was it a flop...but let me tell you one thing...this movie would have more money by selling home Cassettes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again. I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it.....The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....Amar and Prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber.

8.0,"Hilarious, but a little too silly at times.","AAA is definitely among Bollywood's funniest movies of the last 15 years. Thanks to Aamir and Salman's comedic talent, the movie starts off well and is downright hilarious during 70% of its length, but sadly begins to lose pace during the final 30 mins. or so. I don't mind cheesy slapstick humor, but what I do mind is cheesy humor targeted at 6-10 year olds. Some of Salman and the 'Goondas' antics during the 2nd half are downright stupid, and NOT funny. Stuff like 'crime master gogo' may appeal to people who laugh too easily....but it ain't my cup of tea. Nonetheless, barring the final 35 mins. or so and the occasional silly humor, AAA is a laugh-riot not to be missed led by Aamir and Salman's great performances. The chemistry shared between these two is something we probably haven't seen shared between any two actors since. Karishma and Raveena have also lend in fine support. Paresh Rawal's double role is a standout among everybody else.

3.0,Sometimes humour simply doesn't translate,"Everyone Has Their Own Style, or Andaz Apna Apna, is an Indian comedy starring Amir Khaan and Salman Khan as two good-looking losers, who decide that their way to riches is to woo a rich heiress who has returned to India to look for a husband. Unfortunately their ""romantic"" efforts are constantly interrupted by scheming bad guys, questionable plots and random comic book villains. Yes, comic book villains.We'll return to our two main leads and their despicability in a moment. But first, let's talk about the actual comedy. This era of Indian film-making seems to think that it's the height of humour for the main character to say something that gets misunderstood, pull a funny face and get whacked on the top of their head. That's about three quarters of the jokes in this film. Stuff you would see in Looney Tunes here in the West. Except more subdued and slow because it's a life-action film.And I'm sorry, but that's just not funny. Perhaps it is to an Indian audience. From what I've read, this is a beloved comedy classic in India. But humour is very subjective and often very hard to translate. And this is a fine example of just that.It doesn't help that I found the two main characters to be utterly loathsome human beings. Everything they do, they do for money. Sure, the film tries to convince you that they end up caring for the heiress and her household, but that's a lie. These two shouldn't get the girls at the end of the film. That's a horrible message to convey to your audience. A sick, disgusting message.Not a good film. This comedy is not funny, subtle or benign.

Personally I have found these films hit or miss, and Andaz joins the clear misses. Films with almost a perfect rating need to justify themselves. Certainly a victim of high expectations, Andaz failed to update or improve comic shticks that were unoriginal fifty years ago. Energetic and upbeat, this film had its heart in the right place, but could rarely elevate jokes above the ""smirk"" level. Every character was initially amusing, but their simplicity and lack of evolution aggravated the already substantial run time. The music was not even memorable. This is not to say I hate the movie or was even particularly bored. Hijinks were certainly abound. I was never surprised by any outcome, but was at least amused watching each bit of chicanery unfold. Humor is arguably the most subject aspect of film, and I will surely not claim that I was able to pick up every subtlety across the language barrier.
