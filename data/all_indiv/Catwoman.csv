6.0,"Predictable and a little weird, but it is not that bad!","I do much prefer Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman,a manipulative character with a crave for jewellery, not emphasised enough in this instalment, but not entirely missed. Unlike some people, I liked Halle Berry in the title role, I liked the scene where she cuts off her hair and revealed her real self. Somehow she didn't look right with all that hair over her face. When she was Catwoman, she looked very sexy in that leather outfit. Now the script was weak at times, but I really liked the overall look of the film, with the splendid sets. The special effects were a bit ropey, and others where it looked part-animated, or like the Matrix, but they're weren't the weakest part of the movie, that was the script, which seemed rather muddled and trite. The supporting players, particularly Sharon Stone weren't that bad, and while slow-moving and predictable at times, neither was the plot. All in all, a fairly watchable movie, not the best superhero movie, but not the worst(Batman and Robin). 6/10 Bethany Cox.",predictable little weird but it is not that bad,i do much prefer michelle pfeiffers catwoman manipulative character with crave jewellery not emphasised enough this instalment but not entirely missed unlike some people i liked halle berry title role i liked scene where she cuts off her hair revealed her real self somehow she didnt look right with all that hair over her face when she was catwoman she looked very sexy that leather outfit now script was weak at times but i really liked overall look film with splendid sets special effects were bit ropey others where it looked part animated or like matrix but theyre werent weakest part movie that was script which seemed rather muddled trite supporting players particularly sharon stone werent that bad while slow moving predictable at times neither was plot all all fairly watchable movie not best superhero movie but not worst batman robin 6 10 bethany cox,0.590952380952381,0.09121428571428573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.24}"
2.0,I will never understand...,"...how movies like this get rushed into theaters.I honestly believe that when the idea of a Catwoman movie came across someone's desk several years back, it was a good idea. Unfortunately what turned up in theaters in 2004 was this mess! Having never picked up a Catwoman comic book, I cannot judge the film on that background. Knowing only of the old Batman TV show from the 60's, the 90's Cartoon and the brilliant portrayal by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's exceptional Batman Returns in 1992. That's all I really have to go on.However, this 2004 update on the character is flawed. Halle Berry is awkwardly cast as the lead. Her screen presence was boring and lacked any real motivation.With 3 writers, it is no wonder the story goes in all directions, never sticking to one line for too long. It is disjointed and incomplete. It almost seems the script was written just to have CGI fight sequences and Berry in that silly (though hot) costume! Pitof, as director strings together a film that has no real entertainment value. Though many scenes are shot beautifully, I do not see where he treated the character of Catwoman as the focal point. It just seems like he was making a movie - nothing more nothing less.All in all the film is bland. Trite. Scripted weakly. Sloppily acted. Well, you get the idea.Long live the days when Michelle Pfeiffer wore the Catwoman costume. She truly demonstrated the characteristics of a true Feline Femme Fatale. She holds ranks with the women that have portrayed Catwoman - Berry, though I love her, does not! 2 out of 10",i will never understand,how movies like this get rushed into theaters i honestly believe that when idea catwoman movie came across someones desk several years back it was good idea unfortunately what turned up theaters 2004 was this mess having never picked up catwoman comic book i cannot judge film that background knowing only old batman tv show 60s 90s cartoon brilliant portrayal by michelle pfeiffer tim burtons exceptional batman returns 1992 thats all i really have go however this 2004 update character is flawed halle berry is awkwardly cast as lead her screen presence was boring lacked any real motivation with 3 writers it is no wonder story goes all directions never sticking one line too long it is disjointed incomplete it almost seems script was written just have cgi fight sequences berry that silly though hot costume pitof as director strings together film that has no real entertainment value though many scenes are shot beautifully i do not see where he treated character catwoman as focal point it just seems like he was making movie nothing more nothing less all all film is bland trite scripted weakly sloppily acted well you get idea long live days when michelle pfeiffer wore catwoman costume she truly demonstrated characteristics true feline femme fatale she holds ranks with women that have portrayed catwoman berry though i love her does not 2 out 10,0.5866666666666667,0.0401010101010101,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.25}"
6.0,"Unquestionably clunky, yet entertainingly cheesy","The reputation of Catwoman really goes before it. And unless you have been living in a cave, you will know that that reputation is not good. Halle Berry famously actually turned up to the Razzies to collect the worst actress award for this (hats off to her for that), although she then used it as a platform to blame her agent for getting her involved in the film – could she not have read the script herself? (Hats that were taken off for her are put back on again). Anyway, it almost doesn't need to be said that this is a pretty obviously clunky and shoddy film in many ways, with cheesy scenes around every corner. It has a bad script, poor direction and not very good acting. It's not helped much if you think back to earlier depictions of Catwoman from Lee Meriwether (Batman: The Movie (1966)) or Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns (1992)), both of whom were effortlessly cool, slinky and sexy, whereas Berry justisn't so much.However, this is still a pretty watchable bit of nonsense. I have no idea how much it deviates from the actual comic-book character, as I know nothing about this. But it moves along at a good pace and we have a string of ridiculous scenes to appreciate as we go. It's not really helped by the fact that Catwoman really does not have a proper adversary to fight against but this is, like I say, down to poor writing. Berry is still decent fun to watch and the film is overall entertaining in a really daft way. It should really have been better though, given the potential.",unquestionably clunky yet entertainingly cheesy,reputation catwoman really goes before it unless you have been living cave you will know that that reputation is not good halle berry famously actually turned up razzies collect worst actress award this hats off her that although she then used it as platform blame her agent getting her involved film could she not have read script herself hats that were taken off her are put back again anyway it almost doesnt need be said that this is pretty obviously clunky shoddy film many ways with cheesy scenes around every corner it has bad script poor direction not very good acting its not helped much if you think back earlier depictions catwoman lee meriwether batman movie 1966 or michelle pfeiffer batman returns 1992 both whom were effortlessly cool slinky sexy whereas berry just isnt so much however this is still pretty watchable bit nonsense i have no idea how much it deviates actual comic book character as i know nothing about this but it moves along at good pace we have string ridiculous scenes appreciate as we go its not really helped by fact that catwoman really does not have proper adversary fight against but this is like i say down poor writing berry is still decent fun watch film is overall entertaining really daft way it should really have been better though given potential,0.47334401709401697,0.01646367521367523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.14}"
7.0,Halle Makes A Perrrfect Catwoman,"24 July 2004. I had doubts, but Halle Berry makes a perrrfect catwoman with her moves and feline behavior. Though a terrible basketball player that stunt doubles or special effects can't hide, her transformation into Catwoman is one of the best personality changes besides The Fly. The action is good, Sharon Stone's script is a little weak though it's good to see her back. The ending is suggestive of Spiderman. Halle isn't so much erotic or sexual as sensual as she herself has described. There isn't so much sex as wild, unbridled heated freedom with enhanced senses. I would think perhaps, this movie might be too threatening for men and a bit out of the box for women. Yet, as a movie - the transformation of the independence of cats into a inhibited, passive women into her own is a powerful message and experience that Catwoman manages to capture.

If you see this movie and are over the age of 16, you will end up hating yourself for letting yourself rot for 104 minutes without getting anything back, except an increased feeling of wanting to get revenge on Hollywood. They say that it is very hard to get your script into a movie. Well, after seeing this movie, I think a one legged monkey could write a better script, without either pen or paper. The fact that Halle Berry even uses a male stunt double, makes me loose all respect for both her and this movie. Besides the stunt double thing, the movie still sucks. The dialog sucks, the acting is not even present and the action looks sloppy and poorly thought through. This movie actually made me like The Core better, which is pretty much impossible.

10.0,I loved it!,"Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a visual artist who is stuck working in the advertising division of a large beauty product manufacturer, Hedare. When she acquires information that could potentially put the company out of business, they try to dispose of her. Because she had previously, unwittingly passed a ""test"", however, she is saved by a group of cats and transformed into a Catwoman.First, let me note that I loved this film. It's a 10 out of 10 for me. Since I'm well aware that most critics, professional and amateur alike, have trashed this film, I'll focus on why I thought it was so good. Maybe this will help some new viewers consider giving it a look, and possibly encourage some reevaluation by those who have already seen the film.The script immediately drew me into the film, and although I'm male, I identified with Patience. I'm also a visual artist. I have also worked for a company similar to Hedare in the past (although a much smaller and less nefarious beauty product company). I lived in an apartment that looked, on the outside, almost exactly the same as Patience's apartment complex. I also had neighbors who night after night played loud music or television until three or four a.m., while I first tried to block out the sound in any way that I could, then asked politely for them to turn the music down, and so on, until I finally called the cops on them so I could get some sleep.Not that I need to identify with a character to like a film, but that made this one have extra resonance with me in the beginning. Additionally, I was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cinematography and set design. Those kinds of things are just as important in a movie as the story is. Film is a visual and aural artform. The whole package is important. Creative, attractive visuals such as those in Catwoman are part of the package.The script, including the subtexts, worked well for me. Catwoman is a film about discovering identities, peeling away literal and metaphorical masks, and the difference between various stages of public versus private ""faces"". That the plot is centered on a beauty product manufacturer, then, is perfect. These themes permeate every aspect of the film. For example, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) is continually peeling away the appearances of Patience, throughout the length of the film, and Patience is doing the same for herself--discovering her ""true self"". I can't think of a scene that doesn't touch on this theme in some way. That's very clever and thought-provoking scriptwriting, and it doesn't end there. There are also themes about femininity cleverly woven through the film, for example.I thought the cast did a fantastic job. Berry is great as a Catwoman, and subtly referenced most of the previous screen Catwomen. She also incorporated a lot of crafty cat-like behavior. I enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Alex Borstein as Patience's friend, Sally. The effects worked well for me, and at times they were also very subtle and clever, such as Catwoman's whip representing a tail in many shots (most of this was achieved via digital effects). I was also impressed with the creativity and different approach of many of the fight scenes. It was nice to see Brazilian martial arts incorporated for a change.Some of the negative criticism probably stems from a kind of purism that is disproportionately found among comic book fans when it comes to comic book films. I'm not much of a purist, but in any event, for anyone paying close attention, you'd note that Berry's character isn't supposed to be Selina Kyle. In the mythology of as presented here, ""Catwoman"" isn't a lone token, but a type. Patience is just another instantiation of a long line of catwomen. So departures from previous portrayals of Selina Kyle aren't relevant, even if we believed that filmmakers were obligated in some way to previous depictions of the ""same"" fictional characters (which I don't believe, not being a purist).Catwoman is worth a (second) chance if you can leave some of your preconceptions at the door and if you're prepared to think a bit about a comic book film.",i loved it,patience phillips halle berry is visual artist who is stuck working advertising division large beauty product manufacturer hedare when she acquires information that could potentially put company out business they try dispose her because she had previously unwittingly passed test however she is saved by group cats transformed into catwoman first let me note that i loved this film its 10 out 10 me since im well aware that most critics professional amateur alike have trashed this film ill focus why i thought it was so good maybe this will help some new viewers consider giving it look possibly encourage some reevaluation by those who have already seen film script immediately drew me into film although im male i identified with patience im also visual artist i have also worked company similar hedare past although much smaller less nefarious beauty product company i lived apartment that looked outside almost exactly same as patiences apartment complex i also had neighbors who night after night played loud music or television until three or four m while i first tried block out sound any way that i could then asked politely them turn music down so until i finally called cops them so i could get some sleep not that i need identify with character like film but that made this one have extra resonance with me beginning additionally i was immediately drawn by fantastic cinematography set design those kinds things are just as important movie as story is film is visual aural artform whole package is important creative attractive visuals such as those catwoman are part package script including subtexts worked well me catwoman is film about discovering identities peeling away literal metaphorical masks difference between various stages public versus private faces that plot is centered beauty product manufacturer then is perfect these themes permeate every aspect film example tom lone benjamin bratt is continually peeling away appearances patience throughout length film patience is doing same herself discovering her true self i cant think scene that doesnt touch this theme some way thats very clever thought provoking scriptwriting it doesnt end there there are also themes about femininity cleverly woven through film example i thought cast did fantastic job berry is great as catwoman subtly referenced most previous screen catwomen she also incorporated lot crafty cat like behavior i enjoyed supporting cast especially alex borstein as patiences friend sally effects worked well me at times they were also very subtle clever such as catwomans whip representing tail many shots most this was achieved via digital effects i was also impressed with creativity different approach many fight scenes it was nice see brazilian martial arts incorporated change some negative criticism probably stems kind purism that is disproportionately found among comic book fans when it comes comic book films im not much purist but any event anyone paying close attention youd note that berrys character isnt supposed be selina kyle mythology as presented here catwoman isnt lone token but type patience is just another instantiation long line catwomen so departures previous portrayals selina kyle arent relevant even if we believed that filmmakers were obligated some way previous depictions same fictional characters which i dont believe not being purist catwoman is worth second chance if you can leave some your preconceptions at door if youre prepared think bit about comic book film,0.4926585074733222,0.16537152833449134,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,What A Shocker!,Reading all these shameful one star reviews I was expecting a truly terrible film with bad acting and dialogue and a confusing ridiculous story line. Well I was shocked at how it wasn't bad in any area. This was a very enjoyable lighthearted film trying to catpture a little of the style and spirit of the original 60's series. Maybe people were expecting a Christopher Nolan type film that takes itself overly serious but I'm very glad that wasn't this film. This film was fun and entertaining and the IMDb rating is a disgrace. Watch some other films with that kind of low rating and you'll soon see the difference between a bad film and this. 8/10,what shocker,reading all these shameful one star reviews i was expecting truly terrible film with bad acting dialogue confusing ridiculous story line well i was shocked at how it wasnt bad any area this was very enjoyable lighthearted film trying catpture little style spirit original 60s series maybe people were expecting christopher nolan type film that takes itself overly serious but im very glad that wasnt this film this film was fun entertaining imdb rating is disgrace watch some other films with that kind low rating youll soon see difference between bad film this 8 10,0.6317592592592592,-0.11134259259259258,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.18}"
7.0,unpretentious comic book film,"I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards ""Catwoman,"" for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world. In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products. When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen. However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.The best parts of ""Catwoman"" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her. It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society. Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well. Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie. Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her ""fading"" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire""). Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film. Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me. And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long. The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable ""Catwoman"" turned out to be.",unpretentious comic book film,i admire approach filmmakers have taken towards catwoman rather than setting their tale same dark cavernous largely computer generated metropolis we are used most these superhero movies they have chosen keep it rooted more real world similar way they manage keep catwoman herself believable vulnerable realistic thanks no small part beautiful beguiling halle berry title role berry plays patience phillips pretty but less than glamorous advertising artist who works major cosmetics company ruled over by tyrannical ceo his equally ruthless wife former spokes model their products when patience mistakenly overhears corporate bigwigs discussing fact that one their best selling creams is causing women become seriously ill she is dutifully murdered by couple boss henchmen however all is not lost patience unbeknownst her she has been chosen receive special gift reincarnation form cat woman who will no longer be subject laws either nature or society best parts catwoman involve patiences incrementally becoming more more catlike her attitude demeanor her slowly dawning realization what is happening her it takes awhile her accept this surprising turn events but when she does she becomes quite literally new woman bold self confident willing take oppressors evildoers our society patience is paired up with attractive police officer apparently only one ever duty that city who gradually comes realize who what she is as well berry benjamin bratt make very appealing romantic couple their scenes together are some best movie also impressive is sharon stone who deserves credit allowing herself appear role which her fading beauty plays such significant part shades vivien leigh playing blanche dubois streetcar named desire stone is villainous wife companys ceo who is determined make sure catwoman doesnt spill beans their defective product special effects are probably least successful aspect this film catwomans jumping rooftop rooftop looks awful lot like cgi effects me movie does occasionally go auto pilot especially towards end though thankfully not usually very long literal cat fight between berry stone at finale is necessary i guess but really rather silly overall still considering pounding this movie received both critics audiences when it was first released summer 2004 i wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable catwoman turned out be,0.5579215716057822,0.20134389002810055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,People were just hating on Halle!,"The idea of a Black superhero/heroine must have been too much for some because after viewing Catwoman, the only conclusion I came up with was that there was a Vendetta against Halle. Harvard University just awarded her a honorary degree with their tasty hasting puddings annual whatever-s in exchange for her promising never to make a sequel to the film. And the Razzies people (The Oscars for bad acting and bad films) awarded her worst actress of the year for playing in the film. It was V for Vendetta for Heroine Halle.

10.0,The best Catwoman character ever,"A fellow fan of superhero comics once asked me my opinion on the hottest female superhero and my answer was the She Hulk. After watching this movie, my answer will now be Catwoman with Halle Berry in the role. Dressed in a sultry and revealing leather costume with a body as lithe as a cat and a sultry demeanor, she embodies sensuality. Unlike the earlier version that was a super villain, this iteration is fighting evil, specifically a cosmetic company that is about to release a new product. Their research has demonstrated that the product is dangerous to use, but the lure of massive profits is too great. The movements of Catwoman are a triumph of special effects, she leaps and walks on narrow surfaces like a cat and sometimes eats like a starved animal. Action scenes are intense and amazing to watch without there being too much smashing and bashing. Catwoman relies more on her avoidance skills than she does on simply whacking on her opponents. There is a dynamic love interest along with a best female friend that adds significant humor to the movie. The friend is not a sidekick in the usual sense, just a friend with a humorous bent that helps keep the alter ego of Catwoman thinking and acting like a human female. This is a fun movie to watch, one of the few superhero movies where women will enjoy the chic-flick aspects.",best catwoman character ever,fellow fan superhero comics once asked me my opinion hottest female superhero my answer was she hulk after watching this movie my answer will now be catwoman with halle berry role dressed sultry revealing leather costume with body as lithe as cat sultry demeanor she embodies sensuality unlike earlier version that was super villain this iteration is fighting evil specifically cosmetic company that is about release new product their research has demonstrated that product is dangerous use but lure massive profits is too great movements catwoman are triumph special effects she leaps walks narrow surfaces like cat sometimes eats like starved animal action scenes are intense amazing watch without there being too much smashing bashing catwoman relies more her avoidance skills than she does simply whacking her opponents there is dynamic love interest along with best female friend that adds significant humor movie friend is not sidekick usual sense just friend with humorous bent that helps keep alter ego catwoman thinking acting like human female this is fun movie watch one few superhero movies where women will enjoy chic flick aspects,0.47304834054834044,0.1683946608946609,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.24}"
1.0,Try to make a worse movie--I dare you,"Oh, where to start...imagine all the intellectual depth of Showgirls, plus all the excessive and ridiculous special effects of Charlie's Angels, and then throw in some dialog crafted by whomever wrote for Governor Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman movie, and only then are you even close to a movie as awful as this.I suppose one should not expect much from a director who actually refers to himself as Pitof. But let's come back to that. Let's move on to Halle Berry. Note to Halle Berry: Letting Billy Bob Thornton ream you endlessly on camera is certainly degrading, but it was also a good career move--and you won an Oscar; feverishly eating catnip and licking people's faces on camera, however, is not a good career move--and you'll probably win a Razzie this time. They make you return Oscars for movies like this. Oh yeah, as for the supernatural explanation for Patience Phillips/Catwoman's superhero status--she gets CPR from an immortal Egyptian cat--I am not kidding.And then there is Benjamin Bratt, who happens to be a pretty solid actor, but could have very likely damaged a good career. If his participation in this movie isn't enough to stigmatize him, then I'm sure he had to pass up a lot of good roles because of all the time he spent having his foot surgically removed from his former agent's rectum. There is a scene in this movie--probably the worst, and that's no small achievement--that is reminiscent of that ridiculous scene in Daredevil where Jennifer Garner/Elektra and Ben Affleck/blind superhero have a Kung Fu fight at a playground in broad daylight; in this movie it's Halle Berry and Ben Bratt playing one-on-one hoops and her doing Catwoman flips and yet no one appears to be too amazed by this, much less pants-soiling surprised, and on top of that it has a sort of VH1/Color Me Bad/early New Edition video feel to it. And I'm really not sure what city this is all supposed to take place in--Gotham, Metropolis, the land beneath the whole in the cutting room floor--but apparently this place only has one detective, the unfortunate Bratt. No matter what the crime is--burglary, murder, domestic disturbance, interrupted ballet performance--he's always there.As for the rest of the cast, that annoying woman from Mad TV--I know that's not specific enough; I mean the most annoying one who plays what I guess is supposed to be some bizarre Asian lady--well, she plays Catwoman's annoying and sort of slutty co-worker comic relief since Rosie O'Donnell was apparently unavailable.And then we come to Sharon Stone. Now I know her career is going down the crapper with all deliberate speed, but it's still hard to understand this one. The only thing I can guess is that the opportunity to break into silly, pseudo-feminist diatribes made this a role she couldn't turn down. Of course Sharon has often lamented the lack of good roles for older women in Hollywood, and she's absolutely right about that, but this is not the best way to lodge a complaint, and plus that's always been a little peculiar coming from an actress whose greatest cinematic achievement is the conspicuous exposure of her labia.Briefly back to this Pitof character--I thought that pretentious one-named idiot who did the Charlie's Angels movies--McG, I believe--was bad enough, but this guy is even more shameless and obviously lacking in talent. What's with these guys who've never made a movie and are already going by only one name? Don't you have to work up to that?

5.0,"1200+ 1 point votes? Get a life, people, it wasn't that bad!","I scored a free ticket to this movie, and I thought, hey, I've wasted my whole life up to now, what's another hundred and forty-one minutes? After all, I have a higher tolerance for crap than most people, and, once in a while, I like to see something that completely sucks. According to the critics and to voters on IMDb, Catwoman is supposed to suck bad. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, the movie really doesn't suck. I mean, yeah, it sucks, but it hardly plumbs the depths of true suckitude. Currently it sits at #35 on the IMDb bottom 100, but I can think of way more than 34 other movies that suck far worse than Catwoman. It is much more fair to say that it is a mediocre, perhaps slightly below average, action film. It has a few pros and lots of cons. The cons first: 1) The jumpy editing is awful. 2) Way too much CGI. Same problem with the 500 pound gorilla comic book movie out right now, as well. CGI is probably the worst thing ever to happen to cinema; it's hard to believe people are worshiping a technique that looks more fake than stop-motion. 3) Benjamin Bratt is a horrible actor, and the ugliest handsome man I've ever seen. 4) How the f*ck did Alex Borstein land a movie role? She should be doomed to die on MAD TV, the longest running train wreck of a show ever. 5) Crappy, crappy script. The pros: 1) The film looks wonderful, even though that's due mostly to the CGI (I guess when it's making buildings and inanimate objects like that, it's not so bad). The costume design, even apart from the Catwoman outfit. And if they gave out Oscars to hair stylists, the ones who worked on this film would have no competition. 2) Sharon Stone  not a great performance, by any means. Her character is downright silly, perhaps even nonsensical. But she's gorgeous and has a great presence. She makes a really boring villain somewhat more interesting. 3) Duh! Halle Berry! She might not have the best ability to choose roles. Perhaps she's just obsessed with money, and now that she's got a statuette, she's going to do everything in her power to become a billionaire. Whatever you can say about her, she's a great actress. Last year, she brought Gothika up a notch, and she does a lot to make Catwoman more entertaining than it ought to be. She plays the characters' two halves, the sweet, insecure girl and the dominatrix, very well. And, come on, I'd be lying if I said I didn't go to the movie because I thought Berry would be walking around in a leather outfit for a good portion of the movie. And, damn, she's hot. This makes the movie watchable, if nothing else. There's a shot where the camera circles Berry from toe to head right after she first dons the Catwoman which was worth the price of me embarrassing myself by handing my free pass over to the cute little theater girl at the counter. 5/10.",1200 1 point votes get life people it wasnt that bad,i scored free ticket this movie i thought hey ive wasted my whole life up now whats another hundred forty one minutes after all i have higher tolerance crap than most people once while i like see something that completely sucks according critics voters imdb catwoman is supposed suck bad fortunately or unfortunately depending how you look at it movie really doesnt suck i mean yeah it sucks but it hardly plumbs depths true suckitude currently it sits at imdb bottom 100 but i can think way more than 34 other movies that suck far worse than catwoman it is much more fair say that it is mediocre perhaps slightly below average action film it has few pros lots cons cons first 1 jumpy editing is awful 2 way too much cgi same problem with 500 pound gorilla comic book movie out right now as well cgi is probably worst thing ever happen cinema its hard believe people are worshiping technique that looks more fake than stop motion 3 benjamin bratt is horrible actor ugliest handsome man ive ever seen 4 how f ck did alex borstein land movie role she should be doomed die mad tv longest running train wreck show ever 5 crappy crappy script pros 1 film looks wonderful even though thats due mostly cgi i guess when its making buildings inanimate objects like that its not so bad costume design even apart catwoman outfit if they gave out oscars hair stylists ones who worked this film would have no competition 2 sharon stone not great performance by any means her character is downright silly perhaps even nonsensical but shes gorgeous has great presence she makes really boring villain somewhat more interesting 3 duh halle berry she might not have best ability choose roles perhaps shes just obsessed with money now that shes got statuette shes going do everything her power become billionaire whatever you can say about her shes great actress last year she brought gothika up notch she does lot make catwoman more entertaining than it ought be she plays characters two halves sweet insecure girl dominatrix very well come id be lying if i said i didnt go movie because i thought berry would be walking around leather outfit good portion movie damn shes hot this makes movie watchable if nothing else theres shot where camera circles berry toe head right after she first dons catwoman which was worth price me embarrassing myself by handing my free pass over cute little theater girl at counter 5 10,0.5951777087646655,0.022412008281573515,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,By far not as bad as many people make it out to be,"You should not sit down to watch a movie as fun as Catwoman and expect to see a masterpiece such as The Godfather or Casablanca played out on screen. It is a full-throttle and entertaining leisure view with a far from perfect, but interesting story and Halle Berry is simply amazing as Catwoman, in my honest opinion. One mistake I have actually seen a few ignorant people make though is that Patience Phillips is not the Catwoman that has been played out in the Batman phenomenon, she is a version of the essence/character that is Catwoman, and in any matter she is a damn fine one at that. She might not be the best portrayal of the character in Catwoman history, since so many think that is so, and she might be the worst, but that doesn't mean she is bad and she is unable to be found enjoyable.I don't care if this film stuck to the original characterizations of Catwoman or not anyway. It does not make the character of Catwoman out to be the villain or the superhero, just the figure that is Catwoman who strives for what she desires and in the end it's what I really enjoy about it. It seems like working hard for what she wants is what Catwoman is all about anyway, so doesn't that stay true to what people have been familiar with from Catwomen in the past in some way? The plot is the worst aspect, but not bad. What kind of plot were people really expecting from a film called ""Catwoman"" and there had been no confirmations that it had anything to do with Batman? It really doesn't matter, because when the cast played out the scenes all the problems it has fade away, in my opinion, for how delightful and exciting they manage to be.Some final thoughts are that it had excellent action, great outfits and was overall a hell of a fun ride from the very beginning to the very end. It's entertainment value and flair makes up for what it lacks in solidity and depth, but most don't believe it has any value whatsoever. In any matter, I enjoy it every time I watch it. The performances are fantastic for what it set out to do regardless of what Halle Berry said at the Razzies. Why would an actor/actress try to boast themselves when excepting a Razzie anyway? Her catsuit was sexy!

How is it?Not good. Actually if you look at the film in pieces its pretty good, unfortunately you have to look at it all at once on the big screen, which means that this movie is a car wreck.The film looks good. Pitof, the director, is a former visual effects director so he knows how to make things look good. I love his first feature, Vidocq, and this film reminds me of that film with its wild moving camera, but here it doesn't always work. I have the sense that Pitof knew it wasn't going to work and got lost in his own thing.The biggest flaw in this film is the script. The writing is cartoony, but not real. Everything that is said and happens seems off the rack as if this was put together by committee. Actually that's what I think happened, everyone putting in something but allowing no central vision to hold it all together. My guess it was the studio heads who really were calling the shots and putting things together according to a check list. Bad mistake since nothing fits together except fleetingly. The acting is okay, but the central casting of Halle Berry was wrong. She's not bad, indeed she is hyper-sexy at times, but she doesn't come across as tough as she really should. She comes off like a young girl playing dress up, who knows none of it is real. Thats great if you're in a bedroom, but not when we have to feel for our heroine.I don't blame her, someone should have seen that she wasn't working and removed her. Its not her fault that she isn't believable since she gives it her best shot.

But no need to dredge up those bad memories (ahem, Superman Returns... ) Is Catwoman unpopular because the fanboys were upset with the way they changed the story? Or was it the general movie going public that didn't like the movie? Yes the story is simplistic. Simple girl, picked on by her boss, and is timid and shy. Dies after uncovering a nefarious scheme. gets brought back to life by magic cats. Spends the rest of the movie struggling between her old self and her new cat self, dressed up in skin tight, revealing spandex. What's not to like.The true star of this movie is Halle Berry's body. A work of art if there ever was one. I didn't find her acting that bad. In fact her performance was Oscar worthy when compared with that girl from Twilight. But I digress...5/10 - no I wouldn't watch it again. But I did enjoy watching Halle Berry in her cat suit.",it wasnt all that bad was it,super hero genre theres been worse but no need dredge up those bad memories ahem superman returns is catwoman unpopular because fanboys were upset with way they changed story or was it general movie going public that didnt like movie yes story is simplistic simple girl picked by her boss is timid shy dies after uncovering nefarious scheme gets brought back life by magic cats spends rest movie struggling between her old self her new cat self dressed up skin tight revealing spandex whats not like true star this movie is halle berrys body work art if there ever was one i didnt find her acting that bad fact her performance was oscar worthy when compared with that girl twilight but i digress 5 10 no i wouldnt watch it again but i did enjoy watching halle berry her cat suit,0.48845978582820687,-0.07766005923900657,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6.0,Cult Classic,"I used to watch Catwoman a lot when I was a child and I am surprised by the negative comments and reviews I have read about the movie. However, some of them were accurate about poor acting, a lack of chemistry between the two lead actors, and bad executed action sequences. But the general visual style and costume design was the concept of the movie's narrative. It was good at showing a woman who lacked confidence in her previous life, dies, and then is resurrected into a confident woman with superhuman feline powers.",cult classic,i used watch catwoman lot when i was child i am surprised by negative comments reviews i have read about movie however some them were accurate about poor acting lack chemistry between two lead actors bad executed action sequences but general visual style costume design was concept movies narrative it was good at showing woman who lacked confidence her previous life dies then is resurrected into confident woman with superhuman feline powers,0.4282051282051282,0.03461538461538463,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7.0,I actually enjoyed this movie.,"Contrary to the movie's general horrible reputation, I actually enjoyed watching this movie. This film is probably ""Catwoman"" in name only, a departure from her true purpose as the sly, sometimes evil, cat burglar, as intended by DC Comics and creator Bob Kane. In this movie, we have Patience Phillips, played by Halle Berry, stumbling upon a plot to get people to buy this beauty cream; you keep on using it, your skin is smooth and strong like marble, and if you stop using it, your skin disintegrates. At the course of the events afterward (I do not want to provide any spoilers), Phillips becomes Catwoman.Catwoman's mission to foil the villain's plot portrays her as an actual hero in the movie, rather than the crafty cat burglar she originally is in the comic book. This probably upset true comic book fans, for Catwoman was not given her true form in this film, contrary to what what Michelle Pfieffer did to the role in ""Batman Returns."" Pfeiffer delivered a solid performance as Catwoman and stayed true to form-portrayed as a burglar and a nemesis to Batman, but also has a love interest for the Cape Crusader and reluctant at times to commit crimes, making her more like an anti-hero rather than a villain. Berry portrayed the character more like a superhero, and bears almost no resemblance to the comic book character. In addition, probably the movie's sometimes cheesy dialog and campy special effects contributed to this film's poor reviews. Aside from that, I personally think the action is quite good, the movie is fast-paced, the plot is followed well, the subplot of how a woman can turn into a Catwoman is interesting and Sharon Stone gave a quite devious performance as the villain. The only problem I had was that her role was not emphasized enough; the producers should of depicted her actually showing her crafty self and committing evil deeds, like the villains did in the Batman movies.In addition, a picture of Michelle Pfieffer in her Catwoman outfit was briefly seen in Orphelia Powers' house, which meant that Patience Phillips is merely ""another"" Catwoman.Overall, a pretty exciting and action-packed movie. My favorite scene is when Berry storms into her neighbor's apartment, furious of his overbearing parties, silences everybody by squirting water in his loudspeakers and jumps on him.So, with this movie, you may like it, you may detest it. I just treat this as a movie involving another Catwoman in the Batman/DC Ccmics universe.Grade B-",i actually enjoyed this movie,contrary movies general horrible reputation i actually enjoyed watching this movie this film is probably catwoman name only departure her true purpose as sly sometimes evil cat burglar as intended by dc comics creator bob kane this movie we have patience phillips played by halle berry stumbling upon plot get people buy this beauty cream you keep using it your skin is smooth strong like marble if you stop using it your skin disintegrates at course events afterward i do not want provide any spoilers phillips becomes catwoman catwomans mission foil villains plot portrays her as actual hero movie rather than crafty cat burglar she originally is comic book this probably upset true comic book fans catwoman was not given her true form this film contrary what what michelle pfieffer did role batman returns pfeiffer delivered solid performance as catwoman stayed true form portrayed as burglar nemesis batman but also has love interest cape crusader reluctant at times commit crimes making her more like anti hero rather than villain berry portrayed character more like superhero bears almost no resemblance comic book character addition probably movies sometimes cheesy dialog campy special effects contributed this films poor reviews aside that i personally think action is quite good movie is fast paced plot is followed well subplot how woman can turn into catwoman is interesting sharon stone gave quite devious performance as villain only problem i had was that her role was not emphasized enough producers should depicted her actually showing her crafty self committing evil deeds like villains did batman movies addition picture michelle pfieffer her catwoman outfit was briefly seen orphelia powers house which meant that patience phillips is merely another catwoman overall pretty exciting action packed movie my favorite scene is when berry storms into her neighbors apartment furious his overbearing parties silences everybody by squirting water his loudspeakers jumps him so with this movie you may like it you may detest it i just treat this as movie involving another catwoman batman dc ccmics universe grade b,0.5960511033681767,0.1204994192799071,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
