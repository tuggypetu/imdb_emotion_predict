9,Stunning drama between law and justice,"Section 375 - A rape is registered, a woman is violated and trampled by a person in superior position, and for the ease of understanding, it's the film industry that's in focus. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and others are people against whom the #MeToo movement began in Hollywood that later spread like a wildfire in India too. The film director in Section 375 played by Rahul Bhat strongly denies the allegations of the junior costume designer but there is almost infallible evidence against him, good enough for his conviction.With a running time of 125 minutes, the narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat as the courtroom drama swings from one end of the spectrum to the other. Truth is often stranger than fiction and lawyers are in the business of law, not justice. Akshay Khanna delivers yet another superlative performance in the role of the suave, smooth talking and convincing defense lawyer, fighting a case that's all but lost, battling public and media fury on the one hand and opposition at home too. Richa Chadha is not exactly spectacular as the public prosecutor, somewhat undermined by her flawed dialogue delivery that sounds monotonous, but quite formidable in her upright mannerisms and conviction of the rape. The director manages to unfold the suspense slowly and logically, keeping the consequence and judgement open to debate, interpretation and it's for you to take sides.Section 375 is deeply disturbing with graphic violence, uncomfortable interrogation of the victim in the courtroom, a botched police investigation and a judiciary under social turbulence. The subject is contemporary and of significant relevance in workplace, any for that matter. It has a message that needs to be absorbed amid all the throbbing drama where sympathy may change sides. If you don't enjoy depth and detail or are looking for entertainment, give Section 375 a miss. But if you like serious narrative, in-depth analysis, crevices of law and human psychology, please watch the film for a very rewarding mental stimulus.",stunning drama between law justice,section 375 rape is registered woman is violated trampled by person superior position ease understanding its film industry thats focus harvey weinstein kevin spacey others are people against whom movement began hollywood that later spread like wildfire india too film director section 375 played by rahul bhat strongly denies allegations junior costume designer but there is almost infallible evidence against him good enough his conviction with running time 125 minutes narrative keeps you edge your seat as courtroom drama swings one end spectrum other truth is often stranger than fiction lawyers are business law not justice akshay khanna delivers yet another superlative performance role suave smooth talking convincing defense lawyer fighting case thats all but lost battling public media fury one hand opposition at home too richa chadha is not exactly spectacular as public prosecutor somewhat undermined by her flawed dialogue delivery that sounds monotonous but quite formidable her upright mannerisms conviction rape director manages unfold suspense slowly logically keeping consequence judgement open debate interpretation its you take sides section 375 is deeply disturbing with graphic violence uncomfortable interrogation victim courtroom botched police investigation judiciary under social turbulence subject is contemporary significant relevance workplace any that matter it has message that needs be absorbed amid all throbbing drama where sympathy may change sides if you dont enjoy depth detail or are looking entertainment give section 375 miss but if you like serious narrative depth analysis crevices law human psychology please watch film very rewarding mental stimulus,0.5155172413793103,0.09683908045977009,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"

8,Stinging Indictment!,"#FinalVerdictIt's not just Director Ajay Bahl & writer Manish Gupta's best work but also one of the best to come out of Bollywood. Kudos to Panorama Studios, SCIPL, Abhishek Pathakk, Kumar Mangat Pathak and Aditya Chowksey! With stellar performances & superlative narration, besides presenting a captivating courtroom drama so effectively, Section 375 will hold your guts till the end & pinch your soul hard. It gets a bit technical to keep it realistic to the core. Near-perfect!Boasting of a gripping screenplay that holds your attention till the end & despite the film's slow narrative, it keeps you engaged. The film has some hard hitting dialogues(Ajay Bahl, Manish Gupta), which elevates the situations & the corresponding elements. The interrogation sequence, Akshaye Khanna confronting with the judges & his opening speech & closing statements along with Richa Chadha's, Section 375 keeps going on a high. It demands your attention and you'll be glued to the screen throughout. Pedantic!Teamwork makes dream work & this holds true for Section 375. The manner in which director Ajay Bahl has extracted realistic performances from the actors is definitely laudable. Manish Gupta is a genius. The verbal jousting is loaded with details and facts. Sudhir K Chaudhary's cinematography is most appropriate. Arif Sheikh & Praveen Angre's editing is razor-sharp. Clinton Cerejo's background score is exhilarating, filling in the silences very well. Apurva Singh Rathore's casting is spot on. Spiffing! From actors in smaller roles to the central players, there isn't a false note here. It's, undoubtedly & undisputedly the towering Akshaye Khanna who steals the show. It won't be erroneous to state that it's one of his career best and memorable performances. Trailing an extreme close second is Richa Chadha, who manages to'earn her place under the sun' with her no-nonsense portrayal of Hiral Gandhi. Meerra Chopra delivers a rock solid performance. She utilises to the maximum the screen time that is offered to her. Rahul Bhat gets into the skin of his character. Watch out for the scene when he comes on the set & blasts everyone. Menacing! Shriswara speaks a lot through her silences & makes her presence felt. Krutika Desai & Kishor Kadam are authentically impressive.On the whole, Section 375 is a hard-hitting/power-packed courtroom drama and a compelling film. It makes its point with such force that it is difficult not to be impressed. It isn't often that Bollywood shows such spine. Don't miss this one!

8,An excellent movie led by a superlative Akshaye Khanna,"If there is one word that can describe my experience watching Section 375, that word would be uncomfortable. That however doesn't imply that this movie is bad by any stretch of imagination. On the contrary, I found it to be excellent and recommend everyone to watch it, however uncomfortable it might it be.The movie navigates a rape case from its inception to its verdict. Akshaye Khanna and Richa Chaddha lead the cast and play the role of lawyers, representing the accused and the victim respectively. In one of the introductory scenes, Khanna is shown explaining the difference between law & justice. Rape is an extremely serious, unforgivable and delicate issue affecting India and the rest of the world. There have been multiple movies depicting stories & tribulations of rape victims which take us through their journey in seeking justice.This movie is not quite that. Rather, the movie takes a step back and introduces some formerly unexplored nuances emerging in a rape case & showcases the perspective of the accuser, which makes the movie an extremely uncomfortable watch. I expected the movie to have a divisive reception, and after browsing through some critic and user reviews, I was right. Some reviews tagged the movie as being misogynistic. I honestly don't agree with this sentiment. Though the movie ventures into really controversial territories, I still found the movie to be an earnest and unbiased attempt at depicting what it was trying to. I feel this is an excellent movie and recommend everyone to try it out and form your own opinion.Let's get back to the review itself. Almost right away, the audience is presented with the rape scene. The accuser is a film director, played by Rahul Bhat and the victim is a young girl helping with the film's costumes, played by Meera Chopra. You know what has happened from the get go; but do you really? The rest of the film navigates through that and makes us question our preconceptions. Throughout the film, you are presented with alternating scenarios of this scene which makes you question what really happened. The way these different scenarios are presented immediately reminded me of Meghna Gulzar's fantastic Talwar.The performances are good. Rahul Bhat as the accuser does a good job and so does Meera Chopra as the victim. Richa Chaddha is reliable as always and does what she can with what she is given. And that is my biggest gripe with this film. The movie for some reason never really dives deeper into her character. Even in the courtroom, she is usually shown as being reactive rather than proactive trying to object what the opposing lawyer is bringing up, most of the time being overruled by the judges. Similarly, the opposing lawyer gets multiple scenes outside the courtroom walking us through his mind and how the case is affecting his life. We get none of this with Richa, and that is very disappointing.The movie also has some production rough edges, especially with editing. The transition between scenes was too jarring sometimes to overlook. Sandhya Mridul plays the opposing lawyers wife and her character feels unidimensional and merely a means an entity to reflect the protagonist's thoughts. Kishore Kadam and Kruttika Desai play the judges, the former putting in a great performance as always.This brings us to the titular character of this movie and that is the lawyer defending the accused, played by Akshaye Khanna. The movie rests squarely on his shoulders and he bravely carries it. He dons the shoes of Tarun Saluja, a no frills lawyer trying to fight the most difficult case of his career. He is shown working pro bono for the underprivileged but also charging a fortune for his regular cases. It is very easy to hate on him at times when he is trying to exploit loopholes in the system to defend the accuser. He works according to his own code and lives with his own set of ideologies. This is a difficult role to play and Akshaye excels and delivers what I feel is one of his career best performances. After a break, it's great to have an actor of his caliber back.The movie is well directed and written and kept me me engaged throughout. I recommend you to give the movie a chance. It is possible that you will end up hating the movie and I get that. But I urge you to form your opinion after watching it yourself. I give it a solid 8/10 rating.",excellent movie led by superlative akshaye khanna,if there is one word that can describe my experience watching section 375 that word would be uncomfortable that however doesnt imply that this movie is bad by any stretch imagination contrary i found it be excellent recommend everyone watch it however uncomfortable it might it be movie navigates rape case its inception its verdict akshaye khanna richa chaddha lead cast play role lawyers representing accused victim respectively one introductory scenes khanna is shown explaining difference between law justice rape is extremely serious unforgivable delicate issue affecting india rest world there have been multiple movies depicting stories tribulations rape victims which take us through their journey seeking justice this movie is not quite that rather movie takes step back introduces some formerly unexplored nuances emerging rape case showcases perspective accuser which makes movie extremely uncomfortable watch i expected movie have divisive reception after browsing through some critic user reviews i was right some reviews tagged movie as being misogynistic i honestly dont agree with this sentiment though movie ventures into really controversial territories i still found movie be earnest unbiased attempt at depicting what it was trying i feel this is excellent movie recommend everyone try it out form your own opinion lets get back review itself almost right away audience is presented with rape scene accuser is film director played by rahul bhat victim is young girl helping with films costumes played by meera chopra you know what has happened get go but do you really rest film navigates through that makes us question our preconceptions throughout film you are presented with alternating scenarios this scene which makes you question what really happened way these different scenarios are presented immediately reminded me meghna gulzars fantastic talwar performances are good rahul bhat as accuser does good job so does meera chopra as victim richa chaddha is reliable as always does what she can with what she is given that is my biggest gripe with this film movie some reason never really dives deeper into her character even courtroom she is usually shown as being reactive rather than proactive trying object what opposing lawyer is bringing up most time being overruled by judges similarly opposing lawyer gets multiple scenes outside courtroom walking us through his mind how case is affecting his life we get none this with richa that is very disappointing movie also has some production rough edges especially with editing transition between scenes was too jarring sometimes overlook sandhya mridul plays opposing lawyers wife her character feels unidimensional merely means entity reflect protagonists thoughts kishore kadam kruttika desai play judges former putting great performance as always this brings us titular character this movie that is lawyer defending accused played by akshaye khanna movie rests squarely his shoulders he bravely carries it he dons shoes tarun saluja no frills lawyer trying fight most difficult case his career he is shown working pro bono underprivileged but also charging fortune his regular cases it is very easy hate him at times when he is trying exploit loopholes system defend accuser he works according his own code lives with his own set ideologies this is difficult role play akshaye excels delivers what i feel is one his career best performances after break its great have actor his caliber back movie is well directed written kept me me engaged throughout i recommend you give movie chance it is possible that you will end up hating movie i get that but i urge you form your opinion after watching it yourself i give it solid 8 10 rating,0.5437137716085085,0.12625313283208017,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8,Gives a new dimension to MeToo movement !!!,"Section 375 - Sexual intercourse with a woman against her will, without her consent, by coercion, misrepresentation or fraud or at a time when she has been intoxicated or duped, or is of unsound mental health and in any case if she is under 18 years of age. - Source - InternetThough Court room drama can be boring but can be an interesting watch if prepared with right content and poewerful performances. Films like Damini, Jolly LLB, Jolly LLB 2 and Pink have successfully explored the sensitive cases with aplomb. Does Section 375 succeeeds in making the court room drama memorable ? Let us find out..Section 375 tells the story of an infamous Bollywood director (Rahul Bhat) who is accused of a rape as claimed by a junior costume designer (Meera Chopra). Richa Chadhha (Hiral Gandhi) takes the case as prosecutor while the powerful lawyer (Akshaye Khanna) plays the defendant as both fight to solve what is actually the true story with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses.I have always believed that the purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. Last year, there was an uproar of MeToo movement across India where many old cases came into limelight. While few cases were genuine others became unapologetic victim of falsely implicated case just because of vengeful act. The magnitude of impact for these fabricated cases were so severe that it cause death and destruction of somebody's career. The motive behind MeToo movement was genuine, the claims diluted as people were being accused of some misconduct in previous years without any genuine evidence.Section 375 is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps with an eye-popping experience. Director of B.A Pass, Ajay Bahl explores the sensitive topic and throws the ball in the court and let audience decide what is right or wrong. Screenplay is the hero with nail-biting moments, thanks to Ajay Bahl and Manish Gupta (Sarkar, Rahasya, The Stoneman Murders). Art direction is fine while Cinematography is just about okay. There is a very good twist in the end which ofcourse I cannot divulge but becomes the crux of the entire film.AkshayeKhanna is a knight in shining armor. Watch out for him in the second half when he questions the witnesses in the courtroom. It is unforgettable performance which should be lauded for his sheer brilliance. Among the actors - Richa Chaddha is good with natural performance.

8,Good courtroom thriller,"A Hindi film with no song and where the actors remain in character all through, are so rare that these itself are a reason to watch.Add to that, the acting from all the 4 lead actors I.e. Akshay Khanna, Richa Chadda, Meera Chopra and Rahul Bhatt shines. It is a crisply written courtroom drama and will keep you hooked till the end.Some of the questioning of the victim and some scenes will make you uncomfortable.Otherwise, it is a well directed film which will make one to think about the laws which are in place to protect women, especially section 375. The final verdict by the two judges as you will see, is a victory of law and not of justice.",good courtroom thriller,hindi film with no song where actors remain character all through are so rare that these itself are reason watch add that acting all 4 lead actors i e akshay khanna richa chadda meera chopra rahul bhatt shines it is crisply written courtroom drama will keep you hooked till end some questioning victim some scenes will make you uncomfortable otherwise it is well directed film which will make one think about laws which are place protect women especially section 375 final verdict by two judges as you will see is victory law not justice,0.6208333333333333,0.084375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9,Order Order!!,"Section 375 review :A thought provoking film on the amended rape law after the much discussed and debated Nirbhaya case, Ajay Bahl's Section 375 lays bare the inescapable loopholes in the judiciary system as well as the unwritten tenet which defence lawyer Tarun Saluja (Akshaye Khanna) shares with newbie prosecutor Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chadha) at the end of the movie, "" We are not in the business of justice; we are in the business of law"". Righto!Saluja is defending filmmaker Rohan Khurana (Rahul Bhat) accused of raping his subordinate costume designer Anjali Dangle (Meera Chopra). Incidentally, his own former student Hiral happens to be his strong opposition in court. Oh ho!Expectedly, evidences are proved invalid, testimonies are rendered false and witnesses found to be liars even as the court proceedings grip you as intense as a Sherlock Holmes murder mystery. Kudos!Writer Manish Gupta and director Ajay Bahl deserve praise for holding your rapt attention right from the opening scene till the end. The dialogues are brilliantly written and the courtroom scenes are so realistic, you actually feel like sitting in that dingy room being a part of all that drama shama. Fantastic!Of the cast, Akshaye Khanna is extraordinary as the defence lawyer who knows the law and talks through his experience. Its difficult to believe the guy is actually acting. Truly outstanding!Richa Chadha is equally splendid as the opposing prosecutor. Marathi actor Kishore Kadam and the ever graceful Krutika Desai are absolutely natural as the judges. Rahul Bhat looks convincing as the rape accused.Reminiscent of the real life Madhur Bhandarkar - Preeti Jain case, Section 375 is as real as it gets. More importantly, it has a pertinent lesson to tell. Even better than the highly celebrated 'Pink' (2016), this one should be your first preferred watch this weekend.
