10.0,"A Magnificent Timeless Tale of Ambition, Manipulation and Betrayal - Certainly One of the Best Classics Ever","The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.""All About Eve"" is a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal, and certainly one of the best classics ever. Everything perfectly works in this movie: the direction is very precise and tight; dialogs are very acid and intelligent; Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm have awesome performances in very powerful characters; the dramatic story is amazingly good, showing what an evil person can plot to reach fame and success.

9.0,Superb Acting And Dialogue,"What a movie! It's the cinematic ideal, the standard by which subsequent films are judged, at least in terms of acting and dialogue. Maybe the camera, which does nothing but sit there as the actors act, could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play, which implies lots of talk and not much ""action"". The film doesn't pretend to do all things. But what it does do, it does extremely well.As Margo, Bette Davis gives what I would consider one of the best performances, if not the best performance, in any film I have ever seen. She truly becomes Margo, that ""fixture of the theater"", so beloved yet so insecure. And as Eve, ""the mousy one, with the trench coat and the funny hat"", breathy Anne Baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character to change gradually over time.Then there's George Sanders who effortlessly slips into the role of witty, urbane, pompous Addison DeWitt, columnist magnifico, a man whose high opinion of himself allows him to declare to us, as viewers, that he is ""essential to the theater"". Celeste Holm and reliable Thelma Ritter give topnotch performances as well.And the Mankiewicz script, which tells the story of a group of theater people, is heavy on dialogue, but it's totally believable, as characters talk shop and interrelate, by means of suitable verbal conflict and subtle subtext. Even more than that, the dialogue is witty and clever, with tons of theatrical metaphors, like when Bill (Gary Merrill) angrily tells Margo: ""And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me, it spells a paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed of."" To which Margo just as angrily spits out: ""Cut, print it, what happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?""One of my favorite scenes has several people sitting on a stairway at a party. A curvaceous but bird-brained Miss Casswell (Marilyn Monroe), ""from the Copacabana school of acting"", desires another drink. ""Oh waiter!"", she yells out. Addison schools her: ""That isn't a waiter, my dear; that's a butler."" To which she fires back: ""Well I can't yell 'Oh butler', can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler"". Addison then concedes: ""You have a point, an idiotic one, but a point.""I'm not sure I really like the characters in this film. Generally, they're self-absorbed, vain, haughty, and backbiting. They're not all that likable. And that would be my only serious complaint.Otherwise, ""All About Eve"" is a film that excels at great language and great acting. If ever there was a film that deserves the status of ""classic"", this is surely it.",superb acting dialogue,what movie its cinematic ideal standard by which subsequent films are judged at least terms acting dialogue maybe camera which does nothing but sit there as actors act could have been made little less static but story screams stage play which implies lots talk not much action film doesnt pretend do all things but what it does do it does extremely well as margo bette davis gives what i would consider one best performances if not best performance any film i have ever seen she truly becomes margo that fixture theater so beloved yet so insecure as eve mousy one with trench coat funny hat breathy anne baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character change gradually over time then theres george sanders who effortlessly slips into role witty urbane pompous addison dewitt columnist magnifico man whose high opinion himself allows him declare us as viewers that he is essential theater celeste holm reliable thelma ritter give topnotch performances as well mankiewicz script which tells story group theater people is heavy dialogue but its totally believable as characters talk shop interrelate by means suitable verbal conflict subtle subtext even more than that dialogue is witty clever with tons theatrical metaphors like when bill gary merrill angrily tells margo intimate anything else doesnt spell jealousy me it spells paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed which margo just as angrily spits out cut print it what happens next reel do i get dragged off screaming snake pits one my favorite scenes has several people sitting stairway at party curvaceous but bird brained miss casswell marilyn monroe copacabana school acting desires another drink oh waiter she yells out addison schools her that isnt waiter my dear thats butler which she fires back well i cant yell oh butler can i maybe somebodys name is butler addison then concedes you have point idiotic one but point im not sure i really like characters this film generally theyre self absorbed vain haughty backbiting theyre not all that likable that would be my only serious complaint otherwise all about eve is film that excels at great language great acting if ever there was film that deserves status classic this is surely it,0.525649895178197,0.1364308176100629,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Just Brilliant!,"Brilliantly acted and cleverly characterized, with sparkling dialogue that mercilessly parries the gloss from the New York theater world's highly sophisticated veneer, ""All About Eve"" is a scintillating comedy of manners that compels rapt attention for the whole of its 2¼ hours. We like George Sanders, pointing out Gregory Ratoff to his escort, Marilyn Monroe (whom the script describes as ""a member of the Copacabana school of acting""), with the words: ""There's a real live producer, honey! Go and do yourself some good!"" And the final scene, in which Sanders asks Barbara Bates, ""Do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?"" — ""More than anything else in the world!"" she answers. ""Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one"", he replies. ""Miss Harrington knows all about it!""It is often complained of Mankiewicz's work that it is too stagey and too talkative, that there is not sufficient movement. There is some justice in this charge in the consideration of such films as Five Fingers, The Quiet American, House of Strangers, and Dragonwyck; certainly Mankiewicz's two spectacles, Guys and Dolls and Cleopatra, are much improved by sharp editing. But in his best films, The Late George Apley, A Letter to Three Wives, All About Eve, People Will Talk (which I regard as his masterpiece — it was too off-beat, unfortunately, for contemporary audiences or critics to appreciate), and The Barefoot Contessa, any trace of over- talkativeness is more than offset by the range and variety, the unusualness of the characters. Moreover, it is the characters themselves that determine the plot — not the fate or some external force.Thus, in All About Eve, Margo Channing is the victim of her egocentricity, Sampson the victim of his own cynicism and Richards, the victim of his own ingenuousness. Eve Harrington is cunning and ruthless enough to exploit these traits in her climb to stardom. Besides Mankiewicz's two awards, All About Eve also won statuettes for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Costumes and Best Sound Recording. Also, producer Darryl Zanuck won the Thalberg Memorial Award for consistent high-quality production over the previous three years.The film also won the New York Film Critics' Citation for Best Picture, Best Direction and Best Actress (Bette Davis). Actually, I thought that Miss Davis' performance, fine as it was, was overshadowed by Anne Baxter's interpretation of the scheming Eve. To cover with a winning veneer of innocence a character that would not stop at blackmail or adultery to win stardom, cannot have been an easy assignment for a young actress; yet Miss Baxter brought it off flawlessly.OTHER VIEWS: I'd had the general idea for All About Eve in mind for a long time. But I never had a middle, a second act. Then our New York office submitted a short story by Mary Orr called ""The Wisdom of Eve"" — later a radio script — and I had my second act. Incidentally, Zanuck deserves some credit for what happened. He was the only studio head in town with the courage and intelligence to try new things. I don't think I could have made this picture on any other lot but 20th Century- Fox. -- J.L.M.",just brilliant,brilliantly acted cleverly characterized with sparkling dialogue that mercilessly parries gloss new york theater worlds highly sophisticated veneer all about eve is scintillating comedy manners that compels rapt attention whole its 2 hours we like george sanders pointing out gregory ratoff his escort marilyn monroe whom script describes as member copacabana school acting with words theres real live producer honey go do yourself some good final scene which sanders asks barbara bates do you want some day have award like that your own more than anything else world she answers then you must ask miss harrington how get one he replies miss harrington knows all about it it is often complained mankiewiczs work that it is too stagey too talkative that there is not sufficient movement there is some justice this charge consideration such films as five fingers quiet american house strangers dragonwyck certainly mankiewiczs two spectacles guys dolls cleopatra are much improved by sharp editing but his best films late george apley letter three wives all about eve people will talk which i regard as his masterpiece it was too off beat unfortunately contemporary audiences or critics appreciate barefoot contessa any trace over talkativeness is more than offset by range variety unusualness characters moreover it is characters themselves that determine plot not fate or some external force thus all about eve margo channing is victim her egocentricity sampson victim his own cynicism richards victim his own ingenuousness eve harrington is cunning ruthless enough exploit these traits her climb stardom besides mankiewiczs two awards all about eve also won statuettes best picture best supporting actor george sanders best costumes best sound recording also producer darryl zanuck won thalberg memorial award consistent high quality production over previous three years film also won new york film critics citation best picture best direction best actress bette davis actually i thought that miss davis performance fine as it was was overshadowed by anne baxters interpretation scheming eve cover with winning veneer innocence character that would not stop at blackmail or adultery win stardom cannot have been easy assignment young actress yet miss baxter brought it off flawlessly other views id had general idea all about eve mind long time but i never had middle second act then our new york office submitted short story by mary orr called wisdom eve later radio script i had my second act incidentally zanuck deserves some credit what happened he was only studio head town with courage intelligence try new things i dont think i could have made this picture any other lot but 20th century fox j l m,0.44789144189144187,0.2421684981684982,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"Wow, an 11 if possible!","All About Eve is my idea of a perfect film,(and I am 17) beautiful and brooding at the same time. People consider this as one of the finest films ever made, and I cannot disagree. This and Shawshank Redemption are actually films that deserve to be in the top 250. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as ""Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night"". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",wow 11 if possible,all about eve is my idea perfect film i am 17 beautiful brooding at same time people consider this as one finest films ever made i cannot disagree this shawshank redemption are actually films that deserve be top 250 black white cinematography is gorgeous script is sharp focused with great lines such as fasten your seat belts its going be bumpy night direction is excellent this is further advantaged by terrific cast very good subject matter sumptuous costumes i couldnt help being captivated by bette daviss performance as margo channing her presence film is actually films main merit davis was incredible actress while not exactly pretty compared maaureen ohara rita hayworth not very easy work with at times she always brought sense command all her roles especially this film i still think that all about eve is her best film i honestly do she is well supported by terrific supporting cast with likes idealistic anne baxter suave george sanders all all beautiful film that is must see if you havent seen it already it is quite long but it is well worth watching daviss performance 10 10 bethany cox,0.6321298593879239,0.29440860215053766,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,All About Great Writing and Great Acting...,"In show business, there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note, acting innocently, revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have. Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee. She looks like a baby-faced fan, but little do we know, there is a fame machine at work in her mind. Bette Davis, as Margo Channing, star of the stage, is a veteran who has seen it all. She is quite the egotist. Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it. Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm. This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation. Mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950) with such skill, the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.The performances are great, regardless, especially by Bette Davis and the always detested George Sanders, one of my favorite actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The film is narrated initially by Sanders, who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic, then by Celeste Holm, the wife of Eve and Margo's playwrighter, then Bette Davis in the performance of a lifetime. The movie is about 90% dialogue, much like a play. The words are so crisp and sharp, you never sway or lose interest. These characters are just too interesting. Bette Davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. ""Fasten your seatbelts. Its going to be a bumpy night!"" This is the one everyone remembers, but I would be remiss to get into any others.The picture runs well over 2 hours, but it doesn't seem like enough. Mankiewicz could've held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this. George Sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an Academy Award, and rumor has it Davis and Baxter, who was just 27 at the time, were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the Oscar. Time has been very good to the film as well. 1950 was a wonderful year for movies and ALL ABOUT EVE's artistic equal that year was the equally well-written SUNSET BOULEVARD, which took us behind the scenes of a tainted Hollywood. EVE takes on theatre and treats Hollywood like an afterthought. There are many references to the film industry, usually involving the scenes with Margo Channing's boyfriend, who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.The movie is highly unpredictable, especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up. There is an Eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. Fasten the belts and listen up. This is screenwriting at its finest.",all about great writing great acting,show business there is probably eve harrington born every day someone who butters up performer note acting innocently revealing none coldhearted ambition they really have anne baxter plays this type person tee she looks like baby faced fan but little do we know there is fame machine at work her mind bette davis as margo channing star stage is veteran who has seen it all she is quite egotist margo is brilliant actress she knows it eve discovers her blind spot moves her like quiet storm this is premise all about eve joseph l mankiewiczs masterpiece sly wit subtle manipulation mankiewicz also wrote picture winner best picture oscar 1950 with such skill talented cast need only memorize lines deliver them with proper technique performances are great regardless especially by bette davis always detested george sanders one my favorite actors golden age hollywood film is narrated initially by sanders who plays ruthless swine theatre critic then by celeste holm wife eve margos playwrighter then bette davis performance lifetime movie is about 90 dialogue much like play words are so crisp sharp you never sway or lose interest these characters are just too interesting bette davis has cavalcade unforgettable dialogue fasten your seatbelts its going be bumpy night this is one everyone remembers but i would be remiss get into any others picture runs well over 2 hours but it doesnt seem like enough mankiewicz couldve held seminar screenwriting by showing this george sanders is only actor roster bring home academy award rumor has it davis baxter who was just 27 at time were feuding during much shoot lusted oscar time has been very good film as well 1950 was wonderful year movies all about eves artistic equal that year was equally well written sunset boulevard which took us behind scenes tainted hollywood eve takes theatre treats hollywood like afterthought there are many references film industry usually involving scenes with margo channings boyfriend who is attempting make career silver screen movie is highly unpredictable especially last scenes which tie ideas story up there is eve everywhere each character gets what he or she deserves fasten belts listen up this is screenwriting at its finest,0.5580487804878048,0.20075203252032525,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"Just a perfect film, and I know nothing about the theater.","And you really don't need to know about the theater, because it is ultimately about the many facets of human nature.I absolutely adore this movie. It helps when I love Bette Davis, but this is something altogether different from your run-of-the-mill drama, much less your typical Bette Davis melodrama. First and foremost, the screenplay is quite simply one of the best ever written alongside Network and a few others. Mankiewicz's tremendous knack for biting language is glorious. He had shown shades of this gift in his screenplay for A Letter to Three Wives the previous year, but this screenplay is something else.A screenplay, nevertheless, can't singlehandedly make a film as brilliant as this. Mankiewicz pairs his writing with superb direction and the performances are splendid. Davis gives almost undoubtedly the best performance of her illustrious career as the aging Margo Channing and Anne Baxter turns in a quite good performance that sneaks up on you before her character, Eve Harrington, falls prey to herself. Celeste Holm is great as the conflicted friend of both Margo and Eve, Karen Richards. Thelma Ritter delivers a funny, yet powerful performance as Birdie, a part that is inconsequential at first glance. My favorite performance, however, is the absolutely magnificent supporting performance given by George Sanders as the cynical, sardonic, conniving journalist Addison DeWitt. His voice is perfect and his cane and cigarette holder are forever etched in my memory. Hugh Marlowe as Lloyd Richards is really a blank, though a better casting choice probably would have resulted in a more complex interpretation of this admittedly bland character.It's rather ironic when Margo confides to Karen that she wants Bill (Gary Merrill) to love her, the woman, not the actress, because the actress will fade with time. Eve worries over the difference in their ages, Eve being eight years older than Bill. Bette Davis and Gary Merrill did get married, and though it lasted longer than Davis' other unions, it ultimately failed. Davis later said that their mistake was that they thought they were marrying the characters in the film, and when the film faded into the past, there was no basis for a relationship.",just perfect film i know nothing about theater,you really dont need know about theater because it is ultimately about many facets human nature i absolutely adore this movie it helps when i love bette davis but this is something altogether different your run mill drama much less your typical bette davis melodrama first foremost screenplay is quite simply one best ever written alongside network few others mankiewiczs tremendous knack biting language is glorious he had shown shades this gift his screenplay letter three wives previous year but this screenplay is something else screenplay nevertheless cant singlehandedly make film as brilliant as this mankiewicz pairs his writing with superb direction performances are splendid davis gives almost undoubtedly best performance her illustrious career as aging margo channing anne baxter turns quite good performance that sneaks up you before her character eve harrington falls prey herself celeste holm is great as conflicted friend both margo eve karen richards thelma ritter delivers funny yet powerful performance as birdie part that is inconsequential at first glance my favorite performance however is absolutely magnificent supporting performance given by george sanders as cynical sardonic conniving journalist addison dewitt his voice is perfect his cane cigarette holder are forever etched my memory hugh marlowe as lloyd richards is really blank though better casting choice probably would have resulted more complex interpretation this admittedly bland character its rather ironic when margo confides karen that she wants bill gary merrill love her woman not actress because actress will fade with time eve worries over difference their ages eve being eight years older than bill bette davis gary merrill did get married though it lasted longer than davis other unions it ultimately failed davis later said that their mistake was that they thought they were marrying characters film when film faded into past there was no basis relationship,0.5444179894179894,0.2698148148148148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"

,***** Perfect!,"Here's perfect writing if ever a movie ever had it-where did Joseph L. Mankiewicz come up with these people? Who would have thought he could not only revive Bette Davis' career with her greatest-ever role, but actually make her even more fascinating than she ever was before?

However, her devotion soon becomes sinister, and Margo lets her friends know, though they just think she's being selfish and unfair. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo's best friend, who at first is on Eve's side but eventually sees how conniving Eve can be and how ruthless she is in climbing to the top. The party scene early on in the film features some of the film's best lines (`Fasten your seat beltsit's going to be a bumpy night!'), though my personal favourite is when Davis tells Baxter to put her award `where you heart should be'; Margo Channing is just about the best female character of the fifties.

10.0,"A masterpiece of old-style theatre back-stabbing with a cherished, hand-picked cast.","THE definitive saga of backstage brouhaha ever dished out by Hollywood. A triumph of screen-writing, never will one see such ripe, acrid dialogue spewed out like this again -- every indelible scene gloriously stained with classic one-liners. An actress wanna-be looking for her big break carefully worms her way into the glamorous life of a legendary Broadway star, then tries to supplant her privately and professionally.A sterling, incandescent cast provides the fire and music to this concerto of theatre attitude. Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as Margo Channing, the indomitable diva caught up in the throes of mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage. Not willing at all to deal with it tactfully, she makes life a living hell for anyone within knife-throwing distance. This juicy, once-in-a-lifetime part turned Davis' own flagging middle-aged career back on its feet, especially coming on the heels of one of her biggest ""dumps"" ever, ""Beyond the Forest."" Remarkable as it may seem, Bette was not the first choice here, replacing an injured Claudette Colbert. With all due respect to Colbert, Bette Davis was BORN to play Margo Channing. A mauling lioness one minute, a coy, declawed pussycat the next, Davis relishes every wickedly bitchy scene she gets to tear into. Yet in her more introspective moments, she evokes real sympathy for Margo (as only a true star can) especially when her character missteps. It's a resounding victory for the Queen Bee in every way, shape and form.Her ""supporting cast"" also manage to create a buzz of excitement. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, known for their relative blandness, are splendid here in their respective roles as queen bee's lover and playwright. While Merrill's Bill Sampson tames Margo the woman with gutsy directness and virile passion, Marlowe's Lloyd Richards appeases Margo the star with flattery, great dialogue and a calm resolve. Worth watching, then, are their fireworks scenes with Margo when intelligence and restraint no longer work. Debonair George Sanders gives customary snob appeal and dry cynicism to his waspish, ultimately loathsome columnist Addison DeWitt, who swarms around Broadway's elite knowledgeable in the fact his lack of heart and poison pen yield exclusive rights and power. The most sensitive and sensible one in the collective bunch, the one lacking a true stinger, is Karen Richards (played wonderfully by Celeste Holm), Margo's best friend and confidante, who finds herself caught between the queen and a hard place when she accidentally makes a pact with the devil. Thelma Ritter couldn't be overlooked if she tried. An inveterate scene-stealer, she weathers strong competition this time in a movie crammed with clever conversation and pungent zingers. As coarse but well-meaning Birdie Coonan, a brash ex-vaudevillian now the queen's ever-loyal ""drone"", Ritter's character properly handles her boss's antics with amusing grit and backbone. On the periphery of this Broadway beehive is mop-faced Gregory Ratoff as an edgy, gullible, thick-accented producer, Marilyn Monroe as a hopelessly vacuous starlet, and Barbara Bates, as a novice schemer with a very bright future, all making their few scenes count -- especially Bates, who is forever enshrined in the film's stunning final shot.The chief thorn in Margo's (and everybody's) side, and the other real star of this picture, is the queen's titular lady-in-waiting, Eve Harrington. As played by Anne Baxter, this role is probably the most delicate and difficult of all for the weight and believability of this drama falls squarely on her shoulders. Unfairly overlooked all these years by the flashier posturings of Davis, Baxter does a beautiful job of drawing initial pathos then panic as she slowly unveils her own lethal stinger.

9.0,two great performances,"In June, actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is the youngest to win the Sarah Siddons Award. Flash back to October, shy Eve is waiting outside of the theater for Margo Channing (Bette Davis) after her lead performance. The playwright's wife Karen Richards notices her there as always after every performance and invites her backstage. The obsessed fan tells them that she lost her husband in the war. Eve insinuates into Margo's life first by moving in and then becoming her assistant. Slowly, Eve schemes to undermine Margo and take over her place.This is one of Bette Davis' greatest role. She is pitch perfect as the aging star. Then there is Anne Baxter who personifies innocence at the start. It's a bit of a shock to see her spiral in her ambitions.

10.0,Stealing One's Life,"This film isn't really ALL About Eve. It's about a young woman's schemes for theatrical success and how she affects all the lives around here.The protagonist is Anne Baxter playing Eve Harrington. Celeste Holm, wife of playwright Hugh Marlowe sees her night after night outside the theater where Bette Davis is starring in her husband's play. Eve tells a sad tale of woe to Bette, Celeste, Hugh, and director Gary Merrill once she's admitted into the star's inner sanctum. The only one who's skeptical is Bette's maid Thelma Ritter. Baxter is admitted into Davis's entourage.Davis, Daxter, Holm, and Ritter all received Academy Award nominations, the first two for Best Actress and the latter two for Best Supporting Actress. The first three already had won awards so more than likely they canceled each other out in the voting. Davis and Baxter lost to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday and Josephine Hull in Harvey beat out Holm and Ritter. But in many ways these may have been the career roles for all these players. Bette Davis made a comeback with this part of Margo Channing. She had left Warner Brothers the year before after a string of very forgettable post World War II films. Davis really was Margo Channing, a big star who was now getting on in years and refused to realize she could not play leading parts for too much longer. Bette had a whole lot of insight to bring to Margo.Anne Baxter had won a Best Supporting Actress Award for The Razor's Edge. But Eve Harrington is miles apart from the tragic Sophie. Sophie is a decent soul who through a tragic accident that claimed her husband and baby went completely bonkers. Eve is a cold and calculating little minx who sets her sights on stardom and she's not too scrupulous about what she has to do to attain it. Both parts show the depths of this very underrated actress.I've always thought Celeste Holm has always been ignored unfairly when people talk about All About Eve. She and George Sanders narrate the film in different spots because the film is told in flashback as Eve Harrington is being presented the Sarah Siddons Award. It's her perspective from which Eve and the rest of the characters are viewed. She's an essentially decent soul, not as ego driven as the others who make their living in the theater. Her life is in her marriage to Hugh Marlowe and it nearly is wrecked because she took pity on a waif outside a theater. Celeste is living proof of the old adage about no good deed going unpunished.All About Eve got a few awards though including the big one for being The Best Picture of 1950. Joseph Mankiewicz got his second Best Director Oscar, he had won the previous year for A Letter to Three Wives.And 1950 proved to be the high point of George Sanders career as he took home a Best Supporting Actor for that 'fishwife' theatrical columnist Addison DeWitt. He also that year stole Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah's with his portrayal of the Saran of Geza. In fact the Saran was a BC version of Addison DeWitt.Sanders is the only other person who sees Baxter for what she is besides Thelma Ritter. He turns out to be quite the investigative reporter and his confrontation with Baxter is the climax of the film. He's not a nice man, but that may make him the only one really equipped to deal with Baxter if she becomes successful.All About Eve hasn't aged a bit in 56 years. I'm not sure about not making films like this any more, but they sure don't write them like this. It's one film you dare not put the mute button on or go to the refrigerator because you'll miss some witty gem. They come pretty fast and furious.And yet for all the sophistication of the film, Margo and her circle aren't a bad bunch. Naive yes, when it comes to Eve, but this con woman takes advantage of the fact that people want to believe someone like Baxter when she tells her tale and they have good extincts.Fortunately none of their good deeds are permanently punished.",stealing ones life,this film isnt really all about eve its about young womans schemes theatrical success how she affects all lives around here protagonist is anne baxter playing eve harrington celeste holm wife playwright hugh marlowe sees her night after night outside theater where bette davis is starring her husbands play eve tells sad tale woe bette celeste hugh director gary merrill once shes admitted into stars inner sanctum only one whos skeptical is bettes maid thelma ritter baxter is admitted into daviss entourage davis daxter holm ritter all received academy award nominations first two best actress latter two best supporting actress first three already had won awards so more than likely they canceled each other out voting davis baxter lost judy holliday born yesterday josephine hull harvey beat out holm ritter but many ways these may have been career roles all these players bette davis made comeback with this part margo channing she had left warner brothers year before after string very forgettable post world war ii films davis really was margo channing big star who was now getting years refused realize she could not play leading parts too much longer bette had whole lot insight bring margo anne baxter had won best supporting actress award razors edge but eve harrington is miles apart tragic sophie sophie is decent soul who through tragic accident that claimed her husband baby went completely bonkers eve is cold calculating little minx who sets her sights stardom shes not too scrupulous about what she has do attain it both parts show depths this very underrated actress ive always thought celeste holm has always been ignored unfairly when people talk about all about eve she george sanders narrate film different spots because film is told flashback as eve harrington is being presented sarah siddons award its her perspective which eve rest characters are viewed shes essentially decent soul not as ego driven as others who make their living theater her life is her marriage hugh marlowe it nearly is wrecked because she took pity waif outside theater celeste is living proof old adage about no good deed going unpunished all about eve got few awards though including big one being best picture 1950 joseph mankiewicz got his second best director oscar he had won previous year letter three wives 1950 proved be high point george sanders career as he took home best supporting actor that fishwife theatrical columnist addison dewitt he also that year stole cecil b demilles samson delilahs with his portrayal saran geza fact saran was bc version addison dewitt sanders is only other person who sees baxter what she is besides thelma ritter he turns out be quite investigative reporter his confrontation with baxter is climax film hes not nice man but that may make him only one really equipped deal with baxter if she becomes successful all about eve hasnt aged bit 56 years im not sure about not making films like this any more but they sure dont write them like this its one film you dare not put mute button or go refrigerator because youll miss some witty gem they come pretty fast furious yet all sophistication film margo her circle arent bad bunch naive yes when it comes eve but this con woman takes advantage fact that people want believe someone like baxter when she tells her tale they have good extincts fortunately none their good deeds are permanently punished,0.4688253968253969,0.1141309523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"

,Bitterly Funny and Perfectly Acted,"All About Eve (1950) **** (out of 4) Broadway star Margo Channing (Bette Davis) invites a woman named Eve (Anne Baxter) into her life because she's an adoring fan but before long the much older Margo begins to fear that the younger woman wants more than friendship. Soon Eve's plans of becoming a star herself come out and she's not going to let anything get into her way.ALL ABOUT EVE was, at the time, the film that captured the most Oscar-nominations with fourteen and it eventually won six including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for George Sanders. If you're a fan of movie stars, directors, producers or anyone in that profession then ALL ABOUT EVE is certainly a must see. Sure, perhaps it does run on a bit too long but there's no question that it contains one of the greatest ensemble acting classes that you'll ever see as well as some perfect direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and his screenplay is bitterly sharp and funny.So much has been said about this film over the years that I couldn't possibly add anything new. What I really respect about the film is the fact that it really could have gone over-dramatic but instead it plays out like a black comedy where we're dealing with some at times ugly people who get out done by a couple snakes in the grass. The way the mystery of this Eve character plays out is so flawlessly done that it's impossible to hate her because you see her game and her goal. You then start to see that she probably didn't do anything that others wouldn't have done also.Davis gets the majority of the credit in the acting department and there's no doubt that she's perfect and this helped rebuild the second stage of her career. As great as she is I think she sometimes overcrowds what others in the film do. Both Gary Merill and Hugh Marlow are terrific in the role of the supporting men. You've got Marilyn Monroe in an early bit and she's really funny here. Thelma Ritter is always fun to watch. Then you've got the three best performances in the film. Celeste Holm is simply divine on so many levels here as the woman who opens the gate for the snake to come in. Baxter is simply wonderful at playing so many different sides of this character. There are so many adjectives used about her character and the actress really delivers everything you could hope for. Then there's Sanders who is perfectly delightful as the rather crooked writer with his own game to play.ALL ABOUT EVE contains a really terrific script for these great actors to sink their teeth in. The film is brutally honest and funny about stardom and what one will do to capture their glory. The way the film plays out is wonderfully done and there's no doubt that the film deserves its reputation.",bitterly funny perfectly acted,all about eve 1950 out 4 broadway star margo channing bette davis invites woman named eve anne baxter into her life because shes adoring fan but before long much older margo begins fear that younger woman wants more than friendship soon eves plans becoming star herself come out shes not going let anything get into her way all about eve was at time film that captured most oscar nominations with fourteen it eventually won six including best picture best supporting actor george sanders if youre fan movie stars directors producers or anyone that profession then all about eve is certainly must see sure perhaps it does run bit too long but theres no question that it contains one greatest ensemble acting classes that youll ever see as well as some perfect direction by joseph l mankiewicz his screenplay is bitterly sharp funny so much has been said about this film over years that i couldnt possibly add anything new what i really respect about film is fact that it really could have gone over dramatic but instead it plays out like black comedy where were dealing with some at times ugly people who get out done by couple snakes grass way mystery this eve character plays out is so flawlessly done that its impossible hate her because you see her game her goal you then start see that she probably didnt do anything that others wouldnt have done also davis gets majority credit acting department theres no doubt that shes perfect this helped rebuild second stage her career as great as she is i think she sometimes overcrowds what others film do both gary merill hugh marlow are terrific role supporting men youve got marilyn monroe early bit shes really funny here thelma ritter is always fun watch then youve got three best performances film celeste holm is simply divine so many levels here as woman who opens gate snake come baxter is simply wonderful at playing so many different sides this character there are so many adjectives used about her character actress really delivers everything you could hope then theres sanders who is perfectly delightful as rather crooked writer with his own game play all about eve contains really terrific script these great actors sink their teeth film is brutally honest funny about stardom what one will do capture their glory way film plays out is wonderfully done theres no doubt that film deserves its reputation,0.5938758040452955,0.28941778560422626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Incredible,"I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to ""act"" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying.""All About Eve"" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films ""A Face in the Crowd"". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so ""liberated"" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.",incredible,i had read comments about quality writing this film but i really had no idea what extent this would elevate experience fact is it leaves me with no other choice than give it perfect 10 unless you see this film i dont think youll have necessary frame reference with which base any expectations its incredibly engrossing moving often comedic experience but time time again what knocks you over is absolute finesse with which this script was crafted fact that acting direction are flawless surprisingly natural seeming most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem act too much only enhances it that much more with this film you can really imagine people actors are portraying all about eve shows some similarity one my other favourite 50s films face crowd both are studies fame celebrity eve shows how person will corrupt themselves order attain it whereas faces premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves spotlight both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant our celebrity obsessed culture now than when they were made interestingly eve predates face by several years possibly most interesting all is honest often raw way which women are portrayed strength their character power they wield male contingent is practically relegated back seat one might be hard pressed find movie quite so liberated today so what more can i say if you love movies you havent yet seen it youve suffered long enough dont wait another day,0.5445334757834759,0.16391051078551078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,The understudy,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz was a genius and this is his masterpiece, without a doubt! Mr. Mankiewicz's timeless tale for this film was something that paralleled the great writing of another author that knew the inside of the human race: Honore de Balzac.In this story about the theater, all the elements come together to weave a perfect movie, one that will endure the passage of time. Mr. Mankiewicz's screen play is about blind ambition and to what extremes does a person goes in order to realize that goal. The writer seems to be telling us that to Eve Harrington, her end justified the means by which she arrived at getting where she got.The cast assembled for the movie was the perfect blend of styles and acting ability. This film is dominated by Eve Harrington, who, Anne Baxter plays to perfection. We first see her as the adoring fan to Margo Channing, the star of the hit play on Broadway. She will do anything to get to where Margo Channing is. In a way, Eve is a user of the worst kind. She used Karen Richards, Margo's best friend in order to get in the theater world where she finally makes a splash.In that theatrical world, we encounter all kinds of sub species that tend to gravitate toward the limelight where others are shining brighter. They will do anything in their power in order to 'belong' to the glamour and all the things that go hand in hand in that circle.Anne Baxter was an amazing Eve Harrington. She was a young actress then, who showed a lot of talent and was perfectly cast for that role. Bette Davis makes Margo Channing come alive. Ms. Davis shows us what is to be at the top of her class and suddenly see her world begin to crumble, which in a way, it's the way of the theater. The theater and the movies are cruel to the stars that dare to age in front of our eyes. There will always be prettier and younger actresses to bask in their moment of glory in front of the adoring public, but watch out, never get old!George Sanders as the bitchy Addison Dewitt, is the maker and breaker of many a career. He has the power to destroy anyone that doesn't play by his rules. Mr. Sanders was excellent by being the cynic in a make believe land. In a way, the writer is telling us that even then, there was something rotten in theater critics that will ruin a play by just disliking it in the press. Celeste Holm is also effective as Karen Richards, a friend indeed, until she is used to give Eve her big break. Thelma Ritter is a delight to watch as Birdie, the wise maid that sees right through a phony when she sees one. Gary Merrill, George Ratoff, Hugh Marlowe and a young and fresh Marilyn Monroe complete the cast.Never before did a movie packed such an impact to reveal so much about the human comedy, as in this one. After all, that comedy, or call it tragedy, has existed since the beginning of time. All this because a brilliant Joseph L.

10.0,Possibly the smartest comedy ever to have come out of Hollywood,"They say that talk is cheap but you wouldn't believe it listening to the pearls that drip from the mouths of the characters in this, the greatest of all the dialogue-driven comedies to have come out of Hollywood, (at the time it was nominated for a then record 14 Oscar nominations and won 6). It opens with a monologue that introduces all the leading players that is at once literate and cinematic at the same time and you know instantly that his is, above all, a movie to listen to. (What film-buff doesn't quote its screenplay ad-nauseum; gay men, at least according to ""The Boys in the Band"", are said to know the script by heart). And while drag queens the world over have always based their Bette Davis imitations on the character of Margo Channing, (Davis' greatest role and her greatest performance), the film is never merely camp. The acerbic wit that runs through the film always has a ring of truth to it; the characters, overblown as they are, are always recognizably human.The acting alone is to die for. Can you believe that other actresses were once considered for the role of Margo? (Claudette Colbert?). Davis makes it her own not by acting Margo but by being Margo. I can't think of another role more indelibly suited to an actress than this. In a lesser film she might have swamped her co-stars but Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed, gives everyone equal credence.Anne Baxter was never better than as the poisonous Eve; Celeste Holm, wonderful as the clipped, sophisticated Karen; George Sanders oozing epigrams as if from every pore as the screen's most famous critic, Addison DeWitt, (what a name!). These were career-best performances and in smaller parts, Thelma Ritter's cynical, wise-cracking Dresser, Birdie, and Marilyn Monroe's vacuous Miss Caswell, ('a graduate of the Copocobana school of dramatic art'), are just as unforgettable.

,Simply the Perfect Film,"All About Eve is simply the perfect film. Fact follows fiction in the casting of Bette Davis, a star who was an incredible actress but fighting the inevitable - the passage of time. First off, Better Davis was always an incredible actress, no matter what part she took and this was the perfect part for her. Anne Baxter is tremendous in the part of Eve - she plays the part well. It's multi-faceted and challenging and she definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She's got a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is an actress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of her career, like when she was in that television show ""Promised Land."" But Addison DeWitt - takes the cake.

10.0,All About Bette,"**************this might contain spoilers**********************The movie Perfect Stranger opened today and as many critic noted the script was not up to standard. But then again one is always reading how today's script's just don't cut it. And one wonders why? Surly today's directors can draw upon previous movie scripts if no more than to see how well they are constructed. And no script was more in it's craft that Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve. I could also point out Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and a few others but All About Eve is one one Mankiewicz's best, along with A Letter to Three Wives and the charming People Will Talk. But, as many a poster knows All About Eve garnered 14 academy award nominations, winning 6. Bette Davis was robbed! Sure, Gloria Swanson was dazzling in Sunset Boulevard but she didn't have the competition Miss Davis had in All About Eve. There was Anne Baxter reprising a similar role she played in the 1944 film Guest in the House. And George Sanders playing a variation of his role in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think the academy members gave him his award for his magnificent body of work. His award was well deserved. But miss Baxter couldn't hold a candle to Miss Davis who essayed her role in 14 days. And out of sequence. The first scene filmed for the movie was Miss Davis encountering Addison De Witt in the lobby of the theatre. The producers could only get the theatre for a certain time not on it's schedule so did what it had to do. Film that scene. The interior of the theatre scene was filmed at a later date. Many people don't know that Hollywood is a very small town. And the academy award members is not a large body at all, maybe a little over two thousand. But at that time the members had long memories and since Miss Davis was no longer Queen of Hollywood let alone under a contract to a major studio they knew they had no allegiance to her. She had stepped on too many academy members toes, and some still felt the sting. Gloria Swanson, well, she just came out of retirement for this one film and so they felt no allegiance to her, either. Neither studio backed the two stars. And the award went to Judy Holliday for a very boring movie called Born Yesterday. A role that Miss Holliday had performed on Broadway many many time. It's hard to watch Born Yesterday today and you really wonder why the members didn't give the academy award to Miss Davis. All About Eve is a timeless movie, a classic and a gem and the towering performance in the entire film is by Bette Davis. To go further in the case of vendetta, the members did give Katherine Hepburn an award for her unforgettable performance in The Lion in Winter but to make sure Davis couldn't catch Hepburn she got another award for the insipid Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a role not worthy of an academy award. Still, Miss Davis somehow comes out a true winner when all one has to do is to watch All About Eve. We are her academy award.",all about bette,this might contain spoilers movie perfect stranger opened today as many critic noted script was not up standard but then again one is always reading how todays scripts just dont cut it one wonders why surly todays directors can draw upon previous movie scripts if no more than see how well they are constructed no script was more its craft that joseph l mankiewiczs all about eve i could also point out billy wilders double indemnity few others but all about eve is one one mankiewiczs best along with letter three wives charming people will talk but as many poster knows all about eve garnered 14 academy award nominations winning 6 bette davis was robbed sure gloria swanson was dazzling sunset boulevard but she didnt have competition miss davis had all about eve there was anne baxter reprising similar role she played 1944 film guest house george sanders playing variation his role picture dorian gray i think academy members gave him his award his magnificent body work his award was well deserved but miss baxter couldnt hold candle miss davis who essayed her role 14 days out sequence first scene filmed movie was miss davis encountering addison de witt lobby theatre producers could only get theatre certain time not its schedule so did what it had do film that scene interior theatre scene was filmed at later date many people dont know that hollywood is very small town academy award members is not large body at all maybe little over two thousand but at that time members had long memories since miss davis was no longer queen hollywood let alone under contract major studio they knew they had no allegiance her she had stepped too many academy members toes some still felt sting gloria swanson well she just came out retirement this one film so they felt no allegiance her either neither studio backed two stars award went judy holliday very boring movie called born yesterday role that miss holliday had performed broadway many many time its hard watch born yesterday today you really wonder why members didnt give academy award miss davis all about eve is timeless movie classic gem towering performance entire film is by bette davis go further case vendetta members did give katherine hepburn award her unforgettable performance lion winter but make sure davis couldnt catch hepburn she got another award insipid guess whos coming dinner role not worthy academy award still miss davis somehow comes out true winner when all one has do is watch all about eve we are her academy award,0.5495156695156695,0.22432844932844936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,"""You have every reason for happiness""","When I first discovered this movie, I didn't think I was going to be impressed by it. I thought that a movie with a predominantly female cast would be a recipe for disaster, since there would be no fighting, conflicts, or betrayals. As it turns out though, women are often more cruel and punishing than men when it comes to getting back at their enemies. It seems obvious now that it's a good movie, since it got 14 Oscar nominations, a record at the time, and won 6. It's also the only movie in history to have four actresses nominated for an academy award. With so many awards and positive reviews to its credit, it might seem like a stupid question, but does the movie still hold up? It is a timeless and intriguing story simply because it's very well written. The movie is about a girl named Margo played by Bette Davis. She is widely popular in the world of theatrical performance, but she's looking a little long in the tooth. She worries about how her biological aging will affect her career, and doubts it will be good. One day, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) shows up to Margo's dressing room after one of her performances and tells her how big of a fan she is to the point where Margo thinks she is a bit deranged. Even so, Margo plays nice and lets Eve be a ""friend"" of hers, and Eve eventually goes on to perform in a play that Margo was meant to perform in. A critic watching the play is Mr. DeWitt (George Sanders), and he apparently likes it. Eve and DeWitt form an alliance that is somewhat hostile to Margo, and they openly criticize her for turning a blind eye to young and talented actresses like Eve. Later, Eve takes a role in another play after Margo says she doesn't want it. Eve also wants to marry Margo's friend Lloyd because he can ensure Eve stars in good plays. DeWitt later blackmails Eve because he is convinced she is trying to control him, and insists that he's not foolish. He says he knows her real name is not Eve, but Gertrude Slescynski, and was never married. If Eve tries to marry Lloyd, he will let everybody know these things and she will be done for. At the end, the movie returns to where it started; a ceremony where Eve receives an award, and Margo is in attendance. Despite being there, she does not like Eve in the slightest. Shortly after, it turns out that Eve (now a celebrity) has her own adoring and obnoxious fan named Phoebe. I'm guessing that this ending implies that Phoebe is fated to end up the same way as Eve did when she started idolizing Margo. Eve will act coldly towards her and only pretend to like her, but the naive Phoebe will mistake this for genuine interest. Widely considered one of the best movies ever, it's just obvious after watching it why so many people have this opinion regarding this movie. Pretty much all the characters are brilliantly played, and I don't think Bette Davis needs any introduction. Margo is the type of woman that wouldn't look out of place in a noir movie, as she is ruthless, cunning, and dangerous to those that get on her bad side. Anne Baxter plays Eve, the title character for certain, but I would think Margo is the real main character here. Eve's long journey from a generic nobody to a celebrity is caused solely by Margo's influence, and in the end, Eve discovers she might not enjoy being famous after all. George Sanders plays Mr. DeWitt, who is originally shown to be a sympathetic theater critic who is willing to give the inexperienced Eve some praise, but then shows up later to threaten her with confidential information about her life. He's unapologetic and just doesn't care about her feelings, and I think we can all agree the part where he hits Eve in the face definitely wouldn't be allowed today. Although a very minor character, a young Marilyn Monroe even makes an appearance during one of Margo's parties. To summarize, All About Eve is truly one of cinema's all time classics, and its story is an example of how there is no worse feeling than being hated by someone you look up to.",you have every reason happiness,when i first discovered this movie i didnt think i was going be impressed by it i thought that movie with predominantly female cast would be recipe disaster since there would be no fighting conflicts or betrayals as it turns out though women are often more cruel punishing than men when it comes getting back at their enemies it seems obvious now that its good movie since it got 14 oscar nominations record at time won 6 its also only movie history have four actresses nominated academy award with so many awards positive reviews its credit it might seem like stupid question but does movie still hold up it is timeless intriguing story simply because its very well written movie is about girl named margo played by bette davis she is widely popular world theatrical performance but shes looking little long tooth she worries about how her biological aging will affect her career doubts it will be good one day eve harrington anne baxter shows up margos dressing room after one her performances tells her how big fan she is point where margo thinks she is bit deranged even so margo plays nice lets eve be friend hers eve eventually goes perform play that margo was meant perform critic watching play is mr dewitt george sanders he apparently likes it eve dewitt form alliance that is somewhat hostile margo they openly criticize her turning blind eye young talented actresses like eve later eve takes role another play after margo says she doesnt want it eve also wants marry margos friend lloyd because he can ensure eve stars good plays dewitt later blackmails eve because he is convinced she is trying control him insists that hes not foolish he says he knows her real name is not eve but gertrude slescynski was never married if eve tries marry lloyd he will let everybody know these things she will be done at end movie returns where it started ceremony where eve receives award margo is attendance despite being there she does not like eve slightest shortly after it turns out that eve now celebrity has her own adoring obnoxious fan named phoebe im guessing that this ending implies that phoebe is fated end up same way as eve did when she started idolizing margo eve will act coldly towards her only pretend like her but naive phoebe will mistake this genuine interest widely considered one best movies ever its just obvious after watching it why so many people have this opinion regarding this movie pretty much all characters are brilliantly played i dont think bette davis needs any introduction margo is type woman that wouldnt look out place noir movie as she is ruthless cunning dangerous those that get her bad side anne baxter plays eve title character certain but i would think margo is real main character here eves long journey generic nobody celebrity is caused solely by margos influence end eve discovers she might not enjoy being famous after all george sanders plays mr dewitt who is originally shown be sympathetic theater critic who is willing give inexperienced eve some praise but then shows up later threaten her with confidential information about her life hes unapologetic just doesnt care about her feelings i think we can all agree part where he hits eve face definitely wouldnt be allowed today although very minor character young marilyn monroe even makes appearance during one margos parties summarize all about eve is truly one cinemas all time classics its story is example how there is no worse feeling than being hated by someone you look up,0.5413194186765615,0.10412940630797778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7.0,A 'Good' Movie Is As Far As I'll Go,"I had never watched this ""Best Picture of 1950"" until a couple of years ago because it just looked like one of those 1950s melodramas (translation: soap operas) that I can't stand, and it starred an older Bette Davis, who was only appealing to me in her youth in the 1930s. However, after hearing and reading so many rave reviews of this, especially on the IMDb Classic Board, and the fact it was out on DVD, I decided to check it out.I was glad I did. I liked it, thought it was entertaining and worth the 138-minute investment. I still didn't find it as good as advertised - at least for my tastes - but it was still a pretty involving story with good acting. How it could have been up for so many Academy Awards - 14, I believe - is beyond me, however.Neverthess, it's main attribute, as advertised, is the dialog which sparkles with ""intelligence,"" as the Liberal film critic-elitists like to refer to it. It's a ""smart"" comedy, they say from their ivory towers. Make no mistake: the dialog is good, but I've heard just as good from some film noirs and other movies. Movies put more of a premium on that sort of stuff back in the days before computerized special-effects and limited attention spans took over.The best dialog came from George Sanders, playing a sharp-tongued theater critic. Davis was next, which is no surprise. Her career, thanks to her own real- life efforts to get good roles, was doted with characters that had good dialog. This role kept her Hollywood career going as it had been fading as she approached 40 years of age. She was beginning to look older than her years and many times that spelled ""death"" to an actress, but she was not the average actress.The only character in the film I couldn't stand was ""Eve,"" by Anne Baxter, not for her role but for the way she delivered her lines. Baxter didn't do this at first, but as the film went on she kept finishing sentence after sentence with a whisper. It was extremely annoying and affected. People don't talk like that!Overall, for a film dominated by dialog for almost two hours and 20 minutes, it did a great job of holding one's interest. I only found one part that really lagged. It's a good movie - a well-crafted story - but putting in almost-mythical status as one of the greatest of all times, as some have, is a bit exaggerated.",good movie is as far as ill go,i had never watched this best picture 1950 until couple years ago because it just looked like one those 1950s melodramas translation soap operas that i cant stand it starred older bette davis who was only appealing me her youth 1930s however after hearing reading so many rave reviews this especially imdb classic board fact it was out dvd i decided check it out i was glad i did i liked it thought it was entertaining worth 138 minute investment i still didnt find it as good as advertised at least my tastes but it was still pretty involving story with good acting how it could have been up so many academy awards 14 i believe is beyond me however neverthess its main attribute as advertised is dialog which sparkles with intelligence as liberal film critic elitists like refer it its smart comedy they say their ivory towers make no mistake dialog is good but ive heard just as good some film noirs other movies movies put more premium that sort stuff back days before computerized special effects limited attention spans took over best dialog came george sanders playing sharp tongued theater critic davis was next which is no surprise her career thanks her own real life efforts get good roles was doted with characters that had good dialog this role kept her hollywood career going as it had been fading as she approached 40 years age she was beginning look older than her years many times that spelled death actress but she was not average actress only character film i couldnt stand was eve by anne baxter not her role but way she delivered her lines baxter didnt do this at first but as film went she kept finishing sentence after sentence with whisper it was extremely annoying affected people dont talk like that overall film dominated by dialog almost two hours 20 minutes it did great job holding ones interest i only found one part that really lagged its good movie well crafted story but putting almost mythical status as one greatest all times as some have is bit exaggerated,0.5526428571428571,0.2898333333333332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"Here, the screenplay is the star, and the actors are the supporting cast...","Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long.Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman.Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is.Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in ""Clash By Night"".Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but ""they're only movie stars"", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing.Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with ""A Letter to Three Wives"" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.",here screenplay is star actors are supporting cast,actors are only as good as material they must memorize here that material is combination silk satin only finest cotton certainly female leads bette davis anne baxter are epitome perfection dominate everybody around them their fellow actors have nothing gripe about either hence total five acting oscar nominations every detail this movie is picture perfect even if obvious backdrop new haven one sequence is clearly stock footage final sequence drawn out be tad long davis arguably her finest film is obviously emulating tallulah bankhead no matter whom original story was based upon it is fascinating watch her go bitch saint as well as titled eve anne baxter go saint bitch daviss margo channing is extremely complex character perhaps not as drag queenish as tallulah could be you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age 40 which she expands realistically through several philosophical monologues which she reals truth about who she really is underneath all glitz glamor broadway underneath all that sardonic humor is what even eve describes her be as truly great woman starting off like drenched urchin baxter makes you pity her but soon you see where her ambition really lies how she intends utilize throw out possibly destroy others around her but along comes wait see lion type character played by george sanders you know her fall will be swift destructive no matter what happens her rising career her true character will end up being exposed manipulative passive aggressive cat she really is celeste holm has hardest job making you like her melanie wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness you can see initially why shes fooled by baxter watching her grow few claws films second half you really root her aid eves soulful destruction thelma ritter turns hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being thelma ritter marilyn monroe adds sly sensuality typical sexpot who happens have bit hidden smarts that bubble head hers it is obvious that there is something very special her it is nice see her working with davis equally as exciting as it was see her with barbara stanwyck few years later clash by night speaking stanwyck theres very funny reference by cub reporter barbara bates final scene referring her susan hayward as actresses brooklyn but theyre only movie stars reference which reflects snobbery broadway towards movie people then men this film besides bitchy sanders who deservedly won his oscar are less showy but they go out their way do more than just be masculine presence arms these colorful females this could have given film camp presence it certainly does have that but there is also thought provoking intelligence it that is mesmerizing directing his own script just as he did previous year with letter three wives which he also took home two oscars joseph mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that film is truly unforgettable delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into screenplay hall frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems even those sequences such as one where davis group all bite viciously into stalk celery as response sanders baxters presence at table near theirs everything comes up roses everybody youll cheer margo channing as she learns major lesson eves scheming responding way that truly makes her much better person,0.5083680820813175,0.09946391435362024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.4}"
7.0,"Good, but overhyped","I'm afraid I'm not going to join the gush parade for this movie.The performances are good, Eve and Margo are well-done characters, and the ending is like something out of the Twilight Zone, but the movie also has a number of shortcomings.It's very talky -- nothing but talk, hardly a moment of silence. The dialogue seems more stagey than natural. The characters don't converse so much as declaim or emote. The dialogue doesn't seem witty as some have claimed, just bitter and cynical (for the most part).The visuals aren't very visual. The shots are mostly ordinary shots of whoever's talking at the moment. There's little character movement. This could easily have been a radio play.The relationship between Margo and boyfriend seems contrived. There's no apparent reason why they should be so attached to each other. It doesn't come across. In fact, they seem quite unattached to each other initially, but the movie changes its mind abruptly in midcourse.I'll confess a bias against actors acting about acting. It's the kind of self-referential, self-reverential stuff that bugs me, like news reporters reporting on each other instead of the news, or playwrights writing plays about plays. It smacks of taking oneself far too seriously.
