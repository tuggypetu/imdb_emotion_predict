9.0,Sairat - a story that was finally told - no holds barred,"Saw the show few hours back and it was a sheer delight to watch a Marathi movie done with such elegance and crispness. Having Marathi as my mother tongue helped me understand a lot of context that gets lost in translation for non native viewers.Story : I won't go into the story as I really wish you watch the movie and be surprised with the freshness of a love story seldom told with such honesty and rooted in reality. It could have easily succumbed to being another Bollywoodish love story; shallow and melodramatic. Kudos to Nagraj Manjule for not bowing to the formulaic templates being dished out now days.Dialogues : The movies scores very high on the dialogs partly because there is no attempt made to pander to city audiences. The language is kept as close to rural Marathi from Western Maharashtra that city slickers might easily miss the clever one liners that make even an average line an attention grabber. Slang used throughout the movie adds a earthy quality. I wanted to list it here, but IMDb's language recognition treats it as a spelling mistake. :-| Music & Background score : This has to be the most significant factor to 'bring' the people to the theater. In the absence of known faces, the film depended a lot on the music to get people interested before the release and Ajay-Atul didn't disappoint! The melodies are few of the sweetest ones heard in years and they are served in varying degrees of moods too. From a dreamy melody for Parshya to the melodious fusion of rock to vocals for Archie juxtaposed with the peppy dance number 'Zing Zing Zingat' the music stands out for special mention. I get the feeling of having heard parts of the score before though. Can't pin point exactly.Recording the symphony in Sony studios, LA has made the songs more enjoyable. Personally, I would rate them very close, if not better, than soundtracks from legends like Nino Rota, Ennio Morricone, Hans Zimmer & James Horner.Direction : Nagraj Manjule proves once again that movies with a message can be entertaining without being preachy. Especially, with the kind of subject he deals with it becomes very important to make sure it doesn't slip into a rhetoric bordering on a bias. It could be disastrous for a movie to 'hurt sentiments' in India and get away with it. He treads the narrow path with elegance and yet manages to shove a bitter pill down the throat of the audience without them knowing it.All said and done, for all those who expect it to be a run of the mill love story shall be woken up for sure as the final scene unravels before them. It reminded me of the tracking shot in 'Taxi Driver'.Camera work : The camera-work is top notch. Beautiful locales and magnificent vistas are captured with an equal bias to the protagonists. The slow mo shots embellish the movie without distracting the audience. In fact the audience erupted in joy to witness such slick work in a Marathi movie.Acting : It is Archie (Rinku Rajguru) all the way. Her screen presence is without doubt impressive and difficult to believe her debut as well. Her face lends itself to many moments which would test even a seasoned actor. However, she carries all those scenes with a poise and honesty that the character demands. It is difficult to separate the character of Archie from Rinku such is the grasp of Rinku throughout the movie. Her character more of less decides the direction of the movie. Any lesser actor and the film would have been boring at 3hr length. The rest of the characters are perfectly cast as well (good job by the casting director). Every character seems to essay a real person's sketch such is the honesty in the portrayal of the actors. Especially Parshya and his two partners in crime, Pradeep (aka Langda) & Salya (Salim).Parshya (Aakash) is good looking and has carried off the somewhat sober Parshya's character with a lot of honesty. He emotes well and looks intimidating where it demands. He can definitely go a long way provided he gets similar roles in the future or he adds another dimension to his acting not demanded by Parshya's character. Pradeep Bansode (Langdya) is a surprise package who stands by his friend and adds a lot of the comic relief throughout the first half. His eagerness to help out his friend emanates from his own failure, so it seems. He even blushes on his friends behalf!Salim (Salya) is Parshya's neighbor and equally committed to the friendship. He adds the third angle to the chemistry among the three friends and is the voice of reason too. His acting evokes genuine warmth for Parshya. Final comments : Nagraj has successfully coated a bitter pill in a sweet first half and sour second half that strikes the right chord as soon as it 'hits' you in the end.*Watched again a 2nd time; heres the update*: Thank God for not reducing the length of the film. The film was equally enjoyable the second time around as well. Not to forget the masterstroke of a climax literally evoked a standing ovation from me again. Just wondering whether it was re-edited a bit.

9.0,"Beautiful, realistic, spellbinding and mind numbing !!","After a huge publicity and long wait, the expectations were already high from movie, and yet this movie delivered on every level.'Sairat' means zeal, passion or ardour. It is not a new story, we have seen similar plots on screen before. What makes this movie so special is 'Beauty in Simplicity'. A guy from lower strata of caste system falls for a rich upper class girl, then there is 'The Great Wall of Indian Caste System' standing between them. It is a story about their love, resistance, struggle and their survival. Every character feels so real and believable that I actually forgot they are just acting in front of camera. Cinematography, screenplay, music, background score, performances, direction.. all top notch !! There is a lot I can say about this movie, but it would spoil the fun for those who want to watch. The first half is totally hilarious and funny, it is like a sweet dream for all 'love birds' out there. The second half is a hell lot of reality, but that is what makes is a masterpiece.The movie is released with English Subtitles, so doesn't matter whether you are Marathi speaking or not, I recommend you go watch this movie, specially if you want to witness the life of simple yet complex village people. Of course some meaning is always lost in translation, but I am sure you won't be disappointed. Hats Off to Nagraj Sir and the entire team. If such quality cinema is produced in Marathi industry, then we don't need to go looking for that in Bollywood and Hollywood. Keep'em coming !!",beautiful realistic spellbinding mind numbing,after huge publicity long wait expectations were already high movie yet this movie delivered every level sairat means zeal passion or ardour it is not new story we have seen similar plots screen before what makes this movie so special is beauty simplicity guy lower strata caste system falls rich upper class girl then there is great wall indian caste system standing between them it is story about their love resistance struggle their survival every character feels so real believable that i actually forgot they are just acting front camera cinematography screenplay music background score performances direction all top notch there is lot i can say about this movie but it would spoil fun those who want watch first half is totally hilarious funny it is like sweet dream all love birds out there second half is hell lot reality but that is what makes is masterpiece movie is released with english subtitles so doesnt matter whether you are marathi speaking or not i recommend you go watch this movie specially if you want witness life simple yet complex village people course some meaning is always lost translation but i am sure you wont be disappointed hats off nagraj sir entire team if such quality cinema is produced marathi industry then we dont need go looking that bollywood hollywood keepem coming,0.49267982858891957,0.19286173422537053,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

He is always there whenever Parshya needs him . Suraj Pawar as prince has brief but significant role , and he is just perfect. But Tanaji Galgunde as Pradeep was my favorite. He got right under the skin of the character . He is lovable and funny .Camera work was just awesome , every scene is shot so beautifully . Cinematography is one of the best features of the movie . Though movie is quit long but not at all boring . It is very real and raw movie . Second half of the movie is executed perfectly .

9.0,Sairat - Another Marathi Film at its best!!!,"To begin with, Sairat(Wild) is a highly acclaimed movie by people and is the highest grossing Marathi film till day. Yes, its a love story between Parshya and Archie, who are madly in love with each other and irrespective of the caste system in this country, want to take their relationship to another level. The movie depicts Innocence, Rawness, Love and Simplicity. The cricket scenes, political scenario in rural areas, the shyness to express feelings, their friendship and other shots is all very moving. Kudos to the team!! The direction, cinematography and the music is highly commendable. The camera work has been terrific throughout the film. For the records, its not only the highest grossing Marathi film but it also bagged many awards including Special Mention National Award for the leading actress of the film. Also, Sairat is the first Indian film to record its songs at Hollywood. The song 'zing zing zingat' made people dance at the cinema halls like PVR and Inox in India and abroad. We need more such movies, instead of those inconsequential Bollywood item numbers and other Bollywood films which has no value at all. Sairat, also has a social message in the film against social stratification in India which has been existing since the British era.",sairat another marathi film at its best,begin with sairat wild is highly acclaimed movie by people is highest grossing marathi film till day yes its love story between parshya archie who are madly love with each other irrespective caste system this country want take their relationship another level movie depicts innocence rawness love simplicity cricket scenes political scenario rural areas shyness express feelings their friendship other shots is all very moving kudos team direction cinematography music is highly commendable camera work has been terrific throughout film records its not only highest grossing marathi film but it also bagged many awards including special mention national award leading actress film also sairat is first indian film record its songs at hollywood song zing zing zingat made people dance at cinema halls like pvr inox india abroad we need more such movies instead those inconsequential bollywood item numbers other bollywood films which has no value at all sairat also has social message film against social stratification india which has been existing since british era,0.4192650103519669,0.19212215320910972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"

There is no item number. There is no nudity. There is no cheesy comedy. Just a plain yet gripping story. Bollywood and Pakistani film makers must look at this film as an example.

Problem rises between them because the fusion of different castes is not allowed in India. What exactly caste is? It is nothing but fabricated way of dividing a population into a ""caste"". The fusion of different castes as I said is not allowed and it is the religion that supports this notion.To the people who have no idea of how caste system works - be it people who live in India or live outside of India have to remember this only - It is this - Caste System works in two forms – In its preserving form, it makes intermarriage i.e. exogamy impossible and when caste switches to its religious form, it makes Untouchability prevailing in modern times.Rest, the film will do the talking!",remember few things before watching sairat,this is not review this film it is attempt explain few things before you watch this film so that anyone without proper knowledge what exactly story wants express viewers will at least get idea what film is all about this film is about boy girl who falls love boy is one caste girl another caste problem rises between them because fusion different castes is not allowed india what exactly caste is it is nothing but fabricated way dividing population into caste fusion different castes as i said is not allowed it is religion that supports this notion people who have no idea how caste system works be it people who live india or live outside india have remember this only it is this caste system works two forms its preserving form it makes intermarriage i e exogamy impossible when caste switches its religious form it makes untouchability prevailing modern times rest film will do talking,0.41388888888888886,0.017003367003367006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Sairat - brilliant work by Sir Nagraj Manjule !,"Sairat - It took me almost a week to recover from the powerful impact of this movie. Some high points: Rinku Rajguru, the lead in this movie is just 15 years old and has received national award for the role of 'Aarchi'. Film was selected in 66th Berlin International Film Festival. Yaad Lagla is the first symphony from this movie recorded in Hollywood, CA (first of its kind for Bollywood) Magical compositions from Ajay - Atul. In just 3 weeks this movie has earned 60 crores and still counting. This movie is becoming so much popular that special shows are arranged in some places at 12 AM and 3 AM. And as per NEWS there will be remakes made in other languages including Telugu, Hindi and Gujarati.Nagraj Manjule Sir you are a brilliant director and have created yet another mind-blowing gem ! 'Aarchi' (Rinku Rajguru) is the soul of this movie and have portrayed much needed rock solid, contentful, firm and powerful lead character who is madly in love with 'Parshya'. 'Parshya' is colored beautifully by Akash Thosar, an innocent dude who falls for Aarchi. Great background scores, amazing casting (special mention for Parshya's friends and Amma), superb cinematography, a heart touching story and direction makes it a complete Marathi movie.

10.0,"Realistic, hits hard, and well worth watching","Sairat was a Bollywood style promoted Marathi movie. On Kapil Sharma's show (de rigeur promotion for all Bollywood releases), the Sairat team without any filmy airs, endeared themselves to the audience. This would have ensured viewership at least in Mumbai from a lot of people who normally do not see Marathi movies. And rightly so - Sairat should be subtitled in all Indian languages.The acting is superb, especially considering the newcomer cast without any filmy background. Hats off to Nagaraj Manjule for excellent casting and introducing this wonderful new talent.When you watch the film you feel you are watching a real life sequence of events with real people in real places. The people, the language, the village, the rural Maharashtra setting, the slums, life for the poor in a big bad city; everything is straight out of reality. The songs are the only thing that bring you back to cinema. No complaints mind you, the music is good and has in fact hit the charts.Effectively in brief, this is about a lower class - lower caste boy loves upper caste rich politically connected girl in a rural society where such relationships are taboo. They somehow elope and start a new life in a big bad city where through various ups and downs and huge lessons in harsh reality beyond the rose tinted hues of young love, they manage a reasonable family life. But fate has other plans and the ending is what the real news usually portrays of a feudal Haryana khap, light years removed from rural Maharashtra. Or is it?The last scene of the blood stained footsteps of the toddler as he leaves the house, is bloodcurdling. This is Manjule's masterstroke and a lesson to other film makers that graphic scenes have better effect in implied rather than express depiction.

But its not only about love. This movie is more what happens later. Unfortunately sometimes just loving someone is not enough. songs are beautifully pictured. Direction is exceptionally too good.

8.0,"Gutsy Attempt by Director, Film deserves 1 time Worth Watch !","SAIRAT REVIEW - Finished watching one of the most awaited Marathi flick of the year, and came out being little bit confused that how to review/rate this film? First 60 mins are freaking hilarious which are the reason to give a repeat watch to this movie. All 3 chart buster songs appears in these 60 mins then suddenly (as expected) a turn around which made it thriller for next 50 mins. Interval appears after 110 mins, quite long na? But there is no dull moment for a minute till Interval. Then 2nd half is Realistic and with zero entertaining elements, and it was expected from Director. Then a stunning climax which confused me, 50% happy with the climax and 50% unhappy. Acting- New actors but thumbs up to entire star cast. Akash Thosar as Parshya did excellent job, Rinku Rajguru has already got deserving National Award. Other co-actors were brilliant.Music- Someone please give National Award to Ajay Atul, extraordinary stuff by them. Certainly they deserves bunch of Awards for this Class Music Album. Complete marks to 'Yad Lagal', 'Sairat Zal' and 'Zingat'. 'Bawaral' is not that good compared to other songs.Screenplay- Runtime is 170 mins, 110 mins First Half and 60 Mins second half, sounds long but you won't even realise how quickly Interval Appears. Many people will say editing could have better but i don't know which scenes deserves cut cause all scenes looks mandatory. Cinematography- Excellent ! Movie has been shot beautifully, locations looks realistic. Direction- Too Good but not Excellent. But whatever movie is, its because of Nagraj Manjule. He gave us highly acclaimed classic 'Fandry' but here he learnt so much and added so many massy elements in film to get commercial success. You need guts to make movies like this and Manjule is the only one to try it. I want to ask him really, was this climax needed? Cause Fandry ended on positive, courageous note and Sairat ends on negative note. Anyways, Well Done Nagraj Manjule.Final Words- For Fandry i said its too much classy but Sairat is equally balanced for Masses and Classes both. If movie gets repeat audience then First half would be the reason and If movie fails then Climax would be the reason. Go for it for a Gutsy attempt in Marathi Industry, I hope you won't come out with a disappointing face. I am giving 8/10* stars (1 star extra for Music).",gutsy attempt by director film deserves 1 time worth watch,sairat review finished watching one most awaited marathi flick year came out being little bit confused that how review rate this film first 60 mins are freaking hilarious which are reason give repeat watch this movie all 3 chart buster songs appears these 60 mins then suddenly as expected turn around which made it thriller next 50 mins interval appears after 110 mins quite long na but there is no dull moment minute till interval then 2nd half is realistic with zero entertaining elements it was expected director then stunning climax which confused me 50 happy with climax 50 unhappy acting new actors but thumbs up entire star cast akash thosar as parshya did excellent job rinku rajguru has already got deserving national award other co actors were brilliant music someone please give national award ajay atul extraordinary stuff by them certainly they deserves bunch awards this class music album complete marks yad lagal sairat zal zingat bawaral is not that good compared other songs screenplay runtime is 170 mins 110 mins first half 60 mins second half sounds long but you wont even realise how quickly interval appears many people will say editing could have better but i dont know which scenes deserves cut cause all scenes looks mandatory cinematography excellent movie has been shot beautifully locations looks realistic direction too good but not excellent but whatever movie is its because nagraj manjule he gave us highly acclaimed classic fandry but here he learnt so much added so many massy elements film get commercial success you need guts make movies like this manjule is only one try it i want ask him really was this climax needed cause fandry ended positive courageous note sairat ends negative note anyways well done nagraj manjule final words fandry i said its too much classy but sairat is equally balanced masses classes both if movie gets repeat audience then first half would be reason if movie fails then climax would be reason go it gutsy attempt marathi industry i hope you wont come out with disappointing face i am giving 8 10 stars 1 star extra music,0.49413594470046085,0.15074605502024851,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"

As known to all Sairat is well marketed movie but it delivers what was expected from promos and from director like Nagraj.Movie starts with village environment which is realistic. Director has shown the real lifestyle of rural Maharashtra which is quite same in all rural areas in India. The execution of story is mind blowing.

You'll find first part of movie funny and entertaining, It will make you experience of love of rural India.

Background score is also nice and effective.Coming to climax of movie that confused many critics but that is the sole or 'soul' reason of making this movie.

7.0,Conveys the sad reality of honor killings!,"Well before discussing other things, I would like to say something about this movie. The movie name is 'sairat'. It has songs like 'yed laglaay' and 'Zingat'. I am a non-maharashtrian, despite that I got to understand the movie. The movie went hit but meaning of Sairat and Zingat were still unknown to me. After researching I settled Sairat for 'Ranti' (wild) and Zingat for 'stoned'.Tone, Script & Story: The story is about honor killings that happen if people with different category or caste get involved as they love each other. Yes this happens in India. Although such a thing is not that prominent with marathi's.It's sad to see the fate but till then it's an incredible ride. I mean main leads along with their family and friends. For example a guy falls for a piece of paper thrown by lady, to be a love letter.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It's a local movie with related surroundings. Whatever we are presented with is justified. Music: 'Zingat' is super hit. 'Yed laglay' is hit as well. Acting: To see the associated actors act with their roles was a treat.Final Verdict: What is conveyed is sad. The movie is scripted and pictured really well. It conveys the sad reality of honor killings.",conveys sad reality honor killings,well before discussing other things i would like say something about this movie movie name is sairat it has songs like yed laglaay zingat i am non maharashtrian despite that i got understand movie movie went hit but meaning sairat zingat were still unknown me after researching i settled sairat ranti wild zingat stoned tone script story story is about honor killings that happen if people with different category or caste get involved as they love each other yes this happens india although such thing is not that prominent with marathis its sad see fate but till then its incredible ride i mean main leads along with their family friends example guy falls piece paper thrown by lady be love letter direction screenplay cinematography its local movie with related surroundings whatever we are presented with is justified music zingat is super hit yed laglay is hit as well acting see associated actors act with their roles was treat final verdict what is conveyed is sad movie is scripted pictured really well it conveys sad reality honor killings,0.6146739130434783,0.04076086956521739,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,redefining love in 21st century,"I have come here specially to vote 10/10 to this film, i can't see IMDb rating this film only 9.1 out of 10, even if its an average score. People were never so crazy for a Marathi film like this before, watching it again and again..and this includes sophisticated workaholic people like me!I am just in love with this film, watched 3-4 times in theater, i managed it even when i was busy, because this movie gives me pleasure,immense joy about the refreshing concept of love, and how people struggle to keep it alive, till their last breath..loved the songs, the comedy scenes, and the best part of the film- Parshyaa! I am in love with Akaash Thosar, watched this movie 3-4 times only to see him on the big screen again,loved his simplicity and sweet blushing smile, he's so charming! Akaash is Cutest Marathi actor we'll ever have, good performance by everyone though, including Rinku, who got national award for this, and other supporting actors too.Hats off to director Nagraj Manjule, who made these newcomers act so naturally, making the whole movie look so convincing, bringing the best of simplicity in the film. Even the songs looks so mixed-in well in the scenes.. He is truly a talented director Marathi cinema should be really proud of. Ajay-Atul created awesome music for this film, first Indian music directors to go to Hollywood - I bow down to them for this masterpiece, forget movie, people will be crazy to go to their future concerts only to listen these songs live!There haven't been an official proof that the film reached 100 Cr, but i really wish & pray that this film do reaches it. This is a genuine film, 100 times better than Hindi commercial films (Baaghi- which released along with this film, tanked at the B.O.) I am glad realizing that people really appreciate honest talent. The dialogues, scenes, characters were so unforgettable, I bet you won't get to see such a quality-movie even in the next 5yrs ..Apart from that,Sairat has redefined quality-film making, and more so..redefining love. I'am still ready to watch it again, for Parshya , just love him! Very surprised for the fact that the Akaash looks so different than his on-screen avatar.

9.0,Awakening of Marathi Cinema for the Global Audience- A masterwork,"Sairat means ""Wild"".A love story is the midst of a contemporary issue. Kudos for Nagraj Manjule's masterwork, he indeed is efficacious in displaying an innocent love saga comprising of ecstasies and agonies of life.It is really an incredible groundwork for Marathi Cinema which has consistently been making remarkable movies but had only a limited reach, Sairat gave them the global platform and creative sovereignty.The contemporary content, laced with an acquitted love story where lovers can never think of the repercussions, the pervasiveness of the cast system, the apathy of the people to these issues, and finally the effortlessness and virtue of the lead cast (who are actually not actors), made this movie a masterwork of the director.By perceiving every frame of the movie, we can comprehend the alacrity of the director who had this vision since ""Fandry"" as it was a one sided love story, however Sairat is a full blown love story, Sairat shows the earthly matters, and it shows that there is life outside the chiffon cinema, the rural existence is a real thing and it captures the environment perfectly. The gender role reversal is the center theme of the movie which is a message of women empowerment.Performances are radical, Akash Thosar is perfectly believable as a lad who already has the establishment in his mind that he is from a low caste, Rinku Rajguru is overwhelming as an audacious girl. Arbaz Shaikh (Salim) and Tanaji Galgunde (Langdya) have played the part with innocence and grace.The camera-work is marvelous, mesmerizing tracking and drone shots, slow-motions give the authenticity to the scenes, it has mostly been shot on location (most in Nagraj's hometown Jeur, Solapur,), and the village has been shown beautifully.The back ground score and songs are astounding, hats off to Ajay−Atul, also it is a first Indian film recorded at Sony Scoring Stage in Hollywood.Sairat has been presented considerately and thoughtfully to the audience, it gives us a perspective about the mistreatment currently prevalent in India.All the best for Nagraj and we are waiting for his next production.A highly recommended movie for everyone.9/10",awakening marathi cinema global audience masterwork,sairat means wild love story is midst contemporary issue kudos nagraj manjules masterwork he indeed is efficacious displaying innocent love saga comprising ecstasies agonies life it is really incredible groundwork marathi cinema which has consistently been making remarkable movies but had only limited reach sairat gave them global platform creative sovereignty contemporary content laced with acquitted love story where lovers can never think repercussions pervasiveness cast system apathy people these issues finally effortlessness virtue lead cast who are actually not actors made this movie masterwork director by perceiving every frame movie we can comprehend alacrity director who had this vision since fandry as it was one sided love story however sairat is full blown love story sairat shows earthly matters it shows that there is life outside chiffon cinema rural existence is real thing it captures environment perfectly gender role reversal is center theme movie which is message women empowerment performances are radical akash thosar is perfectly believable as lad who already has establishment his mind that he is low caste rinku rajguru is overwhelming as audacious girl arbaz shaikh salim tanaji galgunde langdya have played part with innocence grace camera work is marvelous mesmerizing tracking drone shots slow motions give authenticity scenes it has mostly been shot location most nagrajs hometown jeur solapur village has been shown beautifully back ground score songs are astounding hats off ajay atul also it is first indian film recorded at sony scoring stage hollywood sairat has been presented considerately thoughtfully audience it gives us perspective about mistreatment currently prevalent india all best nagraj we are waiting his next production highly recommended movie everyone 9 10,0.4768176538908246,0.3078513356562137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
