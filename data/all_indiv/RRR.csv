8,"If you'd like to see an Indian movie and aren't just looking for romance, this would be a good place to start","The Cinemark near me has started to show Indian movies. Not feeling like sitting home tonight, I decided to catch this one, and luck was with me.My image of Indian movies, I confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going.There is a love story here, but it's not the focus of the film. There are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (The men's dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.)Rather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s India who, each in his own way, are fighting against the English occupiers.The English are portrayed as inhuman monsters. Very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the Germans in France during World War II, or the most rabid racists in the American South. The first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the Indians and what appear to be Black American musicians.Every time the Indians manage to take revenge on the English for their inhuman abuse of the Indians, you cheer - but at times I wondered if I would have cheered watching a parallel movie about Blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the American South, especially if I had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, I was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. Imagine Spike Lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as Blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-British colonials this movie is. It is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. Here, where Blacks are a minority of the American population. I don't want to push this comparison too far. The movie only makes the connection in one scene. But this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers.I don't speak any of the Indian languages used in the movie, but I had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. I'm sure there were cultural references I didn't catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting India as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one.The director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. There was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. Ram Charan, dressed as a ""native warrior""-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking.So, if you've even been curious about Indian movies, give this one a try. Yes, it's three hours long, but trust me, the time goes flying by. This is truly an action movie, a mixture of visual fantasy and often very graphic realism that held my interest to the end.",if youd like see indian movie arent just looking romance this would be good place start,cinemark near me has started show indian movies not feeling like sitting home tonight i decided catch this one luck was with me my image indian movies i confess was that they were mostly musicals centering around love story involving very beautiful young woman very handsome young man with lots elaborate high energy dance numbers keep things going there is love story here but its not focus film there are also few large very impressive dance numbers but only few mens dancing extremely athletic astounded me rather this movie focuses story two young men 1920s india who each his own way are fighting against english occupiers english are portrayed as inhuman monsters very often they made me think worst atrocities committed by germans france during world war ii or most rabid racists american south first time we see two male leads dancing link is indeed made between indians what appear be black american musicians every time indians manage take revenge english their inhuman abuse indians you cheer but at times i wondered if i would have cheered watching parallel movie about blacks taking revenge white racists who had mistreated them american south especially if i had been movie theater where like tonight i was only audience member who did not belong oppressed population imagine spike lee example able make movie which he did not have worry about selling tickets whites as well as blacks you have some idea how anti british colonials this movie is it is difference between society which oppressor was small minority population vs here where blacks are minority american population i dont want push this comparison too far movie only makes connection one scene but this is very definitely movie that focuses story brutally oppressed people seeking freedom inhuman oppressor rather than just series dance numbers i dont speak any indian languages used movie but i had no problem following what was going with subtitles which were almost always easy read im sure there were cultural references i didnt catch however especially at end final big dance number which seemed be presenting india as nation different regions cultures all united one director cinematographer definitely deserve praise there was one very striking visual image after next especially during battle scenes ram charan dressed as native warrior if that term means anything anymore flying through flames was breathtaking so if youve even been curious about indian movies give this one try yes its three hours long but trust me time goes flying by this is truly action movie mixture visual fantasy often very graphic realism that held my interest end,0.5089106502816181,0.13049923195084487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10,"SS Rajamouli Delivers A Power Packed Action Entertainer Once Again, Made Only For Big Screen !!!","The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fianc√© Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.RRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.",ss rajamouli delivers power packed action entertainer once again made only big screen,last time director ss rajamouli managed wow audience was 2017 with film baahubali conclusion it took him 5 long years him conceptualise his next film rrr shoot bring it silver screen pulling off multi starrer with jr ntr ram charan lead roles might seem accomplishment itself but rajamouli manages deliver even when it comes story rrr is set 1920s revolves around lives two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged armed campaign against british komaram bheem tribal gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped his people there is no historical evidence show that two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history weaves story around their meeting rrr runs relatively simple premise theres fire angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered feared by british he has done their every bidding years he is one they sic anyone they want capture yet he is one whos never given enough respect due colour his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes gond tribal who has come city rescue young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody be singing doll her mantelpiece but that is just beginning tale rajamoulis new calling cards seem be building new world because despite being based two revolutionaries history rrr has story thats completely fictional delhi 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against nizams so much so that one them finds it imperative warn british that hes not be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims delhi ramaraju might seem like well trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems have past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even bullet be wasted them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not freedom movement where you turn other cheek this is one where you use your hands as weapons first half rrr runs like clockwork theres emotional core malli theres song dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile friendship explored through dosti theres even few laughs whenever bheem tries befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as later portions half where film falters bit way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into narrative apart ram charans transformation another look also seem forced tale that was smooth sailing after way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained climax leaves more be desired good thing however is that film manages surprise you rajamouli also manages use certain tropes set up initial portions film latter portions cleverly none less rajamouli manages pull off something people have been pining commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does length also doesnt prove be hindrance thanks tight screenplay vfx certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially emotional bits his desperation find malli comes through well so does his love ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into transformations his character goes through tarak charans roles require them have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran others play their parts well olivia particular manages win your heart alison ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost film might not be everyone but he does well with bgm senthils camerawork is delight too rrr is made big screen viewing cinematography visual aesthetics paint every frame radiating manner oodles flamboyance is something one has come expect rajamouli now background score thuds with relentless urgency repetition unapologetically melodramatic quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but post interval as pace falters little pleasures dwindle too rrr is perfection by any means because after way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done better job others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing good action packed drama especially so if youre fan lead duo,0.37973599170782274,0.11224239375647828,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9,"probably the most brutally violent PG-13 in a while, plus a dance battle!","Total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a David Lean and as bloody and brutalist as Mel Gibson. It's certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it's gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi ""here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO"" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of ""f the Brits"" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns?

10,"Ravishing, Refreshing, Recommendable.","If Magadheera, Eega and the Baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what S. S. Rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker, RRR is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers, eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver: universal entertainment. RRR is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle, and experiencing it in 3D would only make it better. Ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences, RRR is epic in every sense of the word, and truly Ravishing, Refreshing and Recommendable.The film might be around three hours long, but it never actually feels like a long film. In fact, times flies by really quick while watching RRR, an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the U/A rating. The cinematography, the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film, aside from the terrific performances by Jr. NTR, Ram Charan and others. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles. One more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun. And then, we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck, which is what any action buff could ask for.Plus, director S. S. Rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his film's two heroes, giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the ""main hero"". Also, the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings. Editing is razor-sharp and the sets look grand. RRR only reinstates the fact that S. S. Rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in India and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him. I would definitely recommend watching RRR and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end, otherwise you might miss some important parts.

6,A weak writing sparkled by Rajamouli's extraordinary mass elements and Ram Charan & Jr. NTR's larger-than-life characters,"RRR (2022) : Movie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with ""Saaho"" and ""Radhe Shyam"". Let's just accept the fact that a film like ""Bahubali : The Conclusion"" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what ""mass cinema"" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while ""Naacho Naacho,"" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. ""Dosti"" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and ""Komuram Bheemudo"" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear ""Raamam Raaghavam"" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed ""Big-Screen Experience"" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and ""The Lion King"" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*",weak writing sparkled by rajamoulis extraordinary mass elements ram charan jr ntrs larger than life characters,rrr 2022 movie review high low no im not talking about akira kurosawas japanese flick 1963 but im talking about ss rajamoulis rrr actually thats best brief film i can think ss rajamouli has been making mass friendly commercial films long time but bahubali brought him pan india popularity he became household name brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant look smaller or look comparatively less because bar was set too high any filmmaker himself too same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho radhe shyam lets just accept fact that film like bahubali conclusion 2017 cant be made again again not just because it was massive blockbuster but also because kind extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it greatest commercial entertainer this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are only ones this century sell 5 crore tickets hindi belt it was acceptable see such heroic characters bahubali because film is set ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because film is set 20th century where you expect some

8,The best pan Indian film,"The first Rajamouli film I saw was Magadheera. It was a revelation at that time for me that an Indian action film can look this good. The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn't really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn't like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don't question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I'm concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called ""pan-Indian"" label.",best pan indian film,first rajamouli film i saw was magadheera it was revelation at that time me that indian action film can look this good way it combined its own version mythology made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though i had so many issues during modern times that movie but i could see that was some telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time then eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better then bahubali became national sensation but even though i liked that film i was disappointed because i felt like magadheera should have been success bahubali was other than great war scenes few things here there i didnt really like it as much as previous two films i liked bahubali 2 was even bigger disappointment as i didnt like it at all so i was going into rrr with caution but it easily became my favourite film his right start with intro ramcharan there were many things about it that defied expectations we see hero movie completely negative light impossible action setpiece scene is crafted such way that even if we know that is not possible we dont question it film is filled with so many moments like that where action setpieces blow your mind if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work entry jr ntr during action scene right before interval was another moment that was mindblowing use patriotism mythological parallels were beautifully done even wind rousing character at moment felt like it is referencing bheem hanuman name action done by that character being sons vayu wind god mythology there are lot issues film but existence this film this form itself is wonder as far as im concerned best film come out under so called pan indian label,0.49726731601731616,0.2249188311688311,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.42}"
