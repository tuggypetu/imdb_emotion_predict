8,Big things have small beginnings,"Never watched any Argentine/Spanish film before. Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film.

10,Too much fun and human darkness for one day.,"Watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.It's a compilations of 6 tales, but they don't have the same type of lenght, humor or darkness. Each one is unique.1) Airplane tale: fantastic, hilarating and surrealistic story to open the series.2) Coffee shop tale: shorter, but dark and makes you wonder what's ""freedom"" for some people.3) Road tale: excellent. A really LOT of violence and a little bit of humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.4) Human limit tale: a man that's having a couple of really bad days explode when he runs out of patiente. Great acting.5) Accident tale: 90% darkness. And the fact that could be a very possible story makes it even darker. Shocking finale.6) Wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify.

8,Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original.,"This Argentine film that found itself nominated for the 2014 Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award comes to us from director Damián Szifrón who has crafted a feature film comprised of a series of 6 vignettes/small stories about human beings from all walks of (Argentine) life who are all tested and taken to their limits ... until they finally lose control. While mostly disastrous the film is also WILDly thrilling and wholly original in its daring cheekiness ... as the film is a bitter dark comedy (with tinges of brutal drama).It is a film about a myriad group of people on a plane; a young waitress who still finds herself grieving over a family tragedy of the past; an encounter between two men from different social classes on a desolate highway; a man growing tired of the rat race of life in which we are all destined to lose; the aftermath of a horrible automobile accident; and a wedding reception like none you've ever seen before. All feature one or two characters taken to the edge ...It is how each of them handles their various situations that give us our WILD stories. Fascinatingly grim at times, the film almost always miraculously produces laughter and grins. Much of the laughter might be heavily muffled as one chuckles under his/her breath as others around them fail to see the director's (WILDly) wicked sense of humor come into play in some of the film's intense situations; but the dark tone pervades the entire film.While the film is most definitely tragic in many instances, Wild Tales is a comedy of errors about human nature and who we are. Some can watch this and most-likely not pick up even a hint of humor; but it is there ... and it is fantastically facetious.Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original.

The utmost fantasies fulfilled, the extremes of emotions, and the riot of laughter that engulfed me from all sides, I cannot remember having such a good time watching a film.

8,"Rage and Revenge, Guilty Laughter","Greetings again from the darkness. Do you often get accused of having a slightly demented sense of humor? Do you have secret crazy thoughts of seeking revenge on those who have wronged you? If so, writer/director Damian Szifron has a collection of short stories just for you!Nominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar, Argentina's entry is just now opening in the Dallas market where I live. To say Wild Tales is a wild ride would be quite an understatement. There are six short stories blended together, and while you may not recognize the theme immediately, it doesn't take long before rage and retribution jump to the forefront in these seemingly typical slices of everyday life.The best short stories make a quick grab for attention, and manage to convey character and setting from the beginning. The writing is crucial and can easily collapse in the hands of a less-proficient short story writer. But when it works, it's fascinating to watch, and Mr. Szifron has a real talent for making us laugh in the midst of truly awful situations.Not to give away any details, but the six stories involve: a remarkable ""coincidence"" on a flight, an unwelcome customer at a local diner, a close-quarters brawl at a bridge, the frustration of dealing with ""the system"", misguided parental instincts in protecting their kid, and the most wheels-off wedding reception ever filmed.If you are ever searching for an example of a dark comedy, this one will provide clarity. The seemingly unrelated stories are woven together through payback, though the price is often pretty high. Mr. Szifron's stories remind us that life is not fair, but when it's happening to someone else, we can still laugh about it.",rage revenge guilty laughter,greetings again darkness do you often get accused having slightly demented sense humor do you have secret crazy thoughts seeking revenge those who have wronged you if so writer director damian szifron has collection short stories just you nominated best foreign language oscar argentinas entry is just now opening dallas market where i live say wild tales is wild ride would be quite understatement there are six short stories blended together while you may not recognize theme immediately it doesnt take long before rage retribution jump forefront these seemingly typical slices everyday life best short stories make quick grab attention manage convey character setting beginning writing is crucial can easily collapse hands less proficient short story writer but when it works its fascinating watch mr szifron has real talent making us laugh midst truly awful situations not give away any details but six stories involve remarkable coincidence flight unwelcome customer at local diner close quarters brawl at bridge frustration dealing with system misguided parental instincts protecting their kid most wheels off wedding reception ever filmed if you are ever searching example dark comedy this one will provide clarity seemingly unrelated stories are woven together through payback though price is often pretty high mr szifrons stories remind us that life is not fair but when its happening someone else we can still laugh about it,0.4948989898989899,0.07236455463728192,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10,Six stories of frustration leading to joyous revenge,"The Spanish title is more apt: Savage Tales. Six short stories show various ways in which savagery persists in the highest levels of civilization. The titles appear against a montage of wild animals. The twist is that here the savagery is celebrated not rued. Where civilization was supposed to free us from savagery, as in the American Western, here the savagery liberates the characters from their civilization. As director Damian Szifron told the Palm Springs festival audience, ""The theme is the pleasure of losing control. Releasing the beast.""In each story a modern frustration wells up until the character erupts. All the stories involve a furious revenge, with a broadening range of characters. To convey the tensions in modern life, ordinary sounds are amplified, like the luggage wheels in the opening shot. In the pre-credit tale, the pilot turns out to be a lifelong failure who has collected the various teachers, friends, psychiatrist, who have thwarted him, on a flight he will crash into his parents. In a diner the waitress recognizes a customer as the smalltown gangster who drove her father into bankruptcy and suicide. Now running for mayor, he is rude and abusive. As her anger and conscience struggle the cook takes over and kills him. She's content to return to the security and comfort of jail.An Audi driver rages at a redneck who blocks his way. When the rich guy stops to fix a flat tire his nemesis stops and assaults him. The road rage turns into class warfare. Ironically, when they're found burned alive their clutch suggests it was a crime passionel.When an explosives expert gets his car towed for an unjustified parking ticket his angry campaign for justice blows up his marriage, job, career and even shared custody of his daughter. When he blows up the tower's yard he becomes a local hero, Mr Dynamite. In jail his wife and daughter bring him a birthday cake and all the inmates and guards celebrate his day. His last act is blowing out the candles. Terrorism works.A spoiled teenager's fatal hit and run accident leads to a steadily expanding chain of corruption as his wealthy father tries to get the family groundskeeper to take the rap for him. As the bribery balloons no-one is innocent. Even the humble groundskeeper raises his demands. When the father decides not to pay to save his spoiled son, his lawyer says it would be dishonourable for him to renege on his bribery of the the public prosecutor. When the boy decides to confess the greedy renegotiate their scheme. As the fall guy is led away an angry citizen kills him. Amid all the bribes and false honour the poor worker pays the price.In the climax, a rich Jewish family's wedding, the bride explodes after the groom admits he had sex with a colleague who's a guest. The demure bride turns into a vengeful virago wreaking massive destruction, reducing the groom to tears, the ceremony to chaos, and her rival to a bloodied mess. When the newlyweds reconnect — making passionate love amid the ruins of the cake — their union feels more honest than the initial smiles and formality. Now their union expresses more passion than manners. The chaotic wedding is more honest than the ceremonial ritual was. The anthology structure hearkens back to Italian neorealism, where separate short stories provided a wide-ranging survey of social issues. Apt for a celebration of the unruly, the film is exuberantly comic but with a black undercurrent. As its initial frustrations are so common, the film provides its audience with a greater catharsis than most comedies or tragedies. We're left calm of mind, frustrations spent.",six stories frustration leading joyous revenge,spanish title is more apt savage tales six short stories show various ways which savagery persists highest levels civilization titles appear against montage wild animals twist is that here savagery is celebrated not rued where civilization was supposed free us savagery as american western here savagery liberates characters their civilization as director damian szifron told palm springs festival audience theme is pleasure losing control releasing beast each story modern frustration wells up until character erupts all stories involve furious revenge with broadening range characters convey tensions modern life ordinary sounds are amplified like luggage wheels opening shot pre credit tale pilot turns out be lifelong failure who has collected various teachers friends psychiatrist who have thwarted him flight he will crash into his parents diner waitress recognizes customer as smalltown gangster who drove her father into bankruptcy suicide now running mayor he is rude abusive as her anger conscience struggle cook takes over kills him shes content return security comfort jail audi driver rages at redneck who blocks his way when rich guy stops fix flat tire his nemesis stops assaults him road rage turns into class warfare ironically when theyre found burned alive their clutch suggests it was crime passionel when explosives expert gets his car towed unjustified parking ticket his angry campaign justice blows up his marriage job career even shared custody his daughter when he blows up towers yard he becomes local hero mr dynamite jail his wife daughter bring him birthday cake all inmates guards celebrate his day his last act is blowing out candles terrorism works spoiled teenagers fatal hit run accident leads steadily expanding chain corruption as his wealthy father tries get family groundskeeper take rap him as bribery balloons no one is innocent even humble groundskeeper raises his demands when father decides not pay save his spoiled son his lawyer says it would be dishonourable him renege his bribery public prosecutor when boy decides confess greedy renegotiate their scheme as fall guy is led away angry citizen kills him amid all bribes false honour poor worker pays price climax rich jewish familys wedding bride explodes after groom admits he had sex with colleague whos guest demure bride turns into vengeful virago wreaking massive destruction reducing groom tears ceremony chaos her rival bloodied mess when newlyweds reconnect making passionate love amid ruins cake their union feels more honest than initial smiles formality now their union expresses more passion than manners chaotic wedding is more honest than ceremonial ritual was anthology structure hearkens back italian neorealism where separate short stories provided wide ranging survey social issues apt celebration unruly film is exuberantly comic but with black undercurrent as its initial frustrations are so common film provides its audience with greater catharsis than most comedies or tragedies were left calm mind frustrations spent,0.42864583333333334,0.07447916666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
7,Six Black Comedies,"""Relatos Salvajes"" is a black comedy film divided in six segments. (1) ""Pasternak"": one model and a music critic in a plane find that they have a common acquaintance called Pasternak. Soon they discover that every passenger and crew on board know Pasternak. Cosmic coincidence? (2) ""The Rats"": a waitress of a diner recognizes her client as the loan shark that caused a tragedy in her family. The cook suggests mixing rat poison in his food, but she refuses. But the cook decides to proceed in her plan. When his son arrives, the waitress tries to fix the situation.(3) ""The Strongest"": Two drivers on a lone highway have an argument with tragic consequences. (4) ""Little Bomb"": The demolition engineer has his car towed by a truck for parking in a wrong place and he has an argument with the employee of the towing company.

He wakes up his parents and his father calls the lawyer. They propose to pay the groundkeeper to take the blame.

What will be his decision?(6) ""Until Death Do Us Apart"": During the wedding party, the wife discovers that her husband has cheated her with one of the guests and decides to payback. ""Relatos Salvajes"" is an insane and funny comedy, with great critic to the corruption of the public services in Argentina (but could be in most of the South American countries); to the corrupt elite and police; to the lack of justice.

10,What a Ride,"I had an idea from the opening credits that Damian Szifron's WILD TALES, was going to be fun. Images of animals with the actors' names as counterpart, preparing the audience for the animalistic behavior about to come.The film is comprised of six separate vignettes, short stories, if you will. These vignettes all begin innocently enough, passengers boarding a plane, a man driving through the desert, a restaurant on a stormy night, a wedding, everyday slices of modern day life. Something occurs to break the routine, the main character responds, then the scene escalates, and escalates, and when you think you've reached the peak, it escalates even more, and finally in the end reaches a perfect balance of comedy and tragedy. The tales are all perfectly relatable and escalate logically and realistically, nothing comes out from left field. All the characters, each flawed in so many ways, remind us so much of ourselves, both at our best and at our worst... and make us laugh and feel in recognition.Great Movie.",what ride,i had idea opening credits that damian szifrons wild tales was going be fun images animals with actors names as counterpart preparing audience animalistic behavior about come film is comprised six separate vignettes short stories if you will these vignettes all begin innocently enough passengers boarding plane man driving through desert restaurant stormy night wedding everyday slices modern day life something occurs break routine main character responds then scene escalates escalates when you think youve reached peak it escalates even more finally end reaches perfect balance comedy tragedy tales are all perfectly relatable escalate logically realistically nothing comes out left field all characters each flawed so many ways remind us so much ourselves both at our best at our worst make us laugh feel recognition great movie,0.48666666666666664,0.2308333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9,"Wildly crazy, witty, entertaining...","I was recommended to watch Relatos salvajes some time ago, but was busy with some series and postponed it, plus I had no clear idea what it was about and how was it structured.

9,"4.5 stars... Revenge, Argentine style.","""Wild Tales"" (2014 release from Argentina; 122 min.) is a collection of 6 seemingly unrelated tales which all bear the same theme: revenge. The opening (pre-movie credits) tale is a classic: a woman strikes up a conversation with another airplane passenger and they find out that by complete coincidence (or not?) they are both acquainted with the same person. Then it emerges that several other passengers also know that person... No worries, I'm not going to spoil anything. This first (and short) story sets the mood for the movie perfectly, as we get five more vignettes that are all one better than the other. I can't decide which is my favorite, to be honest.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Argentine writer-director Damian Szifron, and what a beauty he delivers with this movie. When I say ""beauty"", I certainly don't mean it in a sugary way, as in fact Szifron's film can be seen as a brutal assessment of the human condition. Check out the tale of the driver who gets tangled up with a 'left lane bandit' only then to suffer a flat tire and suffer the consequences... Or, even worse (should I say better?), check out the tale of the frustrated guy whose car gets towed without reason (according to the guy, of course), and wants to file a complaint... (this story reminded me of that Michael Douglas film ""Falling Down""). The movie is also a blistering indictment of Argentina's judicial system (check out the story where a well-off family's son kills a pregnant woman in a hit-and-run). The very last story (about a wedding reception that goes horribly wrong) is also the longest (close to 30 min.), and capsules the movie's spirit perfectly. It is no wonder that ""Wild Tales"" was a nominee for Best Foreign Language Movies at this year's Oscars. I've now seen 4 of the 5 nominated films and honestly they are all worthy in their own right, and then some.""Wild Tales"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not super, which is a shame. I had high expectations for ""Wild Tales"" and they were met, and then some. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this.

9,So Brilliant Even The Opening Credits Is A Masterpiece. ♦ 85%,"This is my first Argentine movie and I am blown away.With an amazing opening sequence, Wild Tales is a collection of six short, unrelated live action tales that depict human nature in its purest form. The stories speak volumes about the types of lives we all live. A conversation at the beginning turns into a startling revelation at the end of the first short, which is as great as the remaining five. However, the final short is slightly dull compared to what the first five have to offer.Black comedy is the perfect genre this would fall in because the short tales are about ordinary people finding themselves in ordinary situations. The only factor that distinguishes it from the rest is that it goes ahead turning the ordinary into something wicked and super. It is a mix of drama and quirkiness that we all are accustomed to. And the best part is that the stories are to the point.Definitely the film is for people who have an eye for humor and cinematic art. You will love and cherish this and yearn to re-watch it. Excellent photography, backed by good writing and appropriate music. The score is so supportive, one awaits it in the screenplay. With some great performances and direction, Wild Tales is an appealing drama which will appeal even if you do not understand Spanish. BOTTOM LINE: Wild Tales is a masterpiece and once you watch it, you will be asking your friends to watch it just so you can discuss it with them. 9/10 - brilliant!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

10,Simon: What Violence?,"Wild Tales is an exceptionally written foreign film, realistic and funny. It's realistic, in the sense that it's human nature taken to the extreme, pushed to the point of just losing it!The question remains though, is it a film?

I asked myself, would I watch this if it were a television series if it maintained this level of quality and the answer is assuredly yes, but it's highly unlikely that it could maintain it, as much as I'm surprised I liked each segment here. The third segment with the two blokes fighting and the final wedding segment my favourites, the ending adds the heart.

9,"Wow, Anger is really a powerful emotion!","Great movie telling stories I would label centering around anger. I realized how powerful anger emotion is and how quickly it can ruin your life for good.1) Airplane: It was developed beautifully and gratz to the pilot for determination.2) Restaurant: The douche bag of a guy basically kills the girls father, girl thinks about confronting him and the chef lady thinks confronting him is not enough at all. 3) Car: Need to be careful about road rage, you don't know who is the guy in the other car. I think this goes for any rage. I think I can conclude that we shouldn't rage.4) Tow away: Really good criticism of government and it's fines. There should be a better method to determine which fine is just. Also I agree that most government workers are really annoying, they don't enjoy their job at all and the mind set ""I am just trying to do my job"" is absolutely true.5) Hit and run: Really good visualization of what money can make people do. Basically if you have enough money, you carry a get out jail card with you. The twist in the end was really awesome, poor gardener.6) Wedding: This was my favorite story by far. It shows that how things can escalate quickly out of hand. Also it is easy to make bad decisions while under so much pressure like a wedding ceremony. I must say bride was really good and very nice acting.

10,Wild Tales indeed,"I went in this completely unprepared (as I like to do in general) having not read a single thing.

It starts off slow, but once you get the drift of it (no pun intended) you know what this will be about. And it still is able to surprise you. What is not to love here?

8,"Six tales of ""Revenge""","With Pedro Almodóvar's name credited manifestly as one of the producers, viewers will not be too surprised that this portmanteau film from Argentinian director/writer Damián Szifrón is ripe with Almodóvaresque touch - six short, surreal, dark comedies, (most of them are) deeply rooted in the injustice presented in the current Argentinian society (however, it can be feasibly comprehended elsewhere since the situations are all the same), with a recurrent theme of vengeance flows through all of its components, as the pre-credit prologue named ""Pasternak"" glaringly sets the tone from an all-inclusive reprisal from an unknown man towards every single person who mistreats him in his life, it is absurdly implausible to effectuate such a scheme (too many variations are involved), but as the opening gambit and the shortest one, it effectively kick-starts the film with an offbeat grin beckons an unconventional wild-ride sinisterly awaits the audience, also it tells us revenge has no mercy at all.The opening credits furthermore impress with designs of different animals for the film's protagonists and the crew. Then the second story is ""The Rats"", confined in a small restaurant near the highway with minimal characters (two customers, one waitress and a cook) to play out a morally righteous murder starts with expired rat poisons to the appalling backstabbing, Rita Cortese as the experienced cook, is fearlessly ruthless to eradicate any excrescence of the society within her limited power, plainly because there is no other efficacious way to deter the evil ones ascending in the societal hierarchy. This time revenge is all for a good cause. Next chapter is called ""The Strongest"", a road rage clash between the posh car driver Diego (Sbaraglia) and a churlish imbecile Mario (Donado), one might recall Steven Spielberg's DUEL (1971, 7/10), but here there is no ominous car-chasing, due to a flat tyre, Diego has to pay for his stupidity to offend a low-class boor, and is driven by revenge when he has the chance to flee the scene, it is so naturalistic that the intention of killing has been induced even viewers in some level subconsciously concur with Diego's motivation, but the payoff is both ludicrous and horrendous, so revenge can be a crime of passion. The fourth one ""Little Bomb"" stars Ricardo Darin as a demolition expert, whose automobile has been towed by DMV when he is buying a birthday cake for his daughter, the next day he tries to reason with the clerks when he is coerced to pay the fine, but loses his temper and attack the partition with all the bureaucracy poppycock. Soon, the aftereffects cost his job and marriage, while his car still being towed again and again. Finally, he loads his car with explosives and the final towing blows up the towed-car lot. But Szifrón prepares a happy-ish ending for the tale, as the explosion is accurately calculated to avoid any casualties, and his bold behaviour is regarded as a potent testimony to decry DMV's money-extorting towing policy, he becomes an urban hero thanks to the social media, he gets the sobriquet ""Dynamite"", his wife and daughter visit him in prison for his birthday with all the inmates and prison guards hailing for him. Darin is so compelling as the good-gone- bad stereotype pushed to his limit by a despondent reality. The final revelation is a bit far- fetched and too much a wishful thinking, but it educates us, revenge needs meticulous calculation. The fifth story is ""The Proposal"", a rich kid cries for help from his parents after a hit-and-run accident leaving a pregnant woman died, the father (Martínez) buys off his gardener (de Silva) to bear the blame, but when a greedy lawyer (Núñez) and a police prosecutor (Velázquez) are involved, it evolves into a game of shameless blackmail, when those three all up their profits, the canny father abruptly turns the table and uses this case as a bargaining chip to regain the initiative (this smart move shows how Szifrón is a sharp observer and an acute thinker in his storytelling), but no one can predict an unexpected denouement. This is my favourite one, it purposefully blurs the line between the opposing sides of rich and poor, and when facing a windfall, human's avariciousness is impartially triggered albeit of their different backgrounds and social status, someone is more adroit at it, and for someone it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, alas, it is the most detrimental original sin in us and we should all constantly being reminded to overcome it. In this chapter, we learn that revenge can be achieved even one is at the apparent disadvantage. Last but not the least, the grand finale is ""Until Death Do Us Apart"", it is at the wedding banquet of Romina (Rivas) and Ariel (Gentile), they seem to be a perfect couple, until Romina's one unintentional glance prompts the most sensitive antenna - a woman's sixth sense, she finds out that Ariel has cheated on her with one of the wedding guest. Subsequently, she vents her ire and dismay by having sex with a random staff in the kitchen as a requital, which is witnessed by Ariel, afterwards, the wedding descends into a madcap buffoonery, yet no one can expect, all the mess actually hones up to a perfect foreplay for the pair, the story ends when the two engage into a passionate sexual intercourse in front of all the guests. Rivas is blazingly radiant in the wedding dress, with her tear-tainted make- up, she refuses to be a runaway bride, instead, she fights back to get even.

8,Creepily effective black comedy,"If you've been feeling a mite cocky about where your life is headed of late, you might want to take a gander at ""Wild Tales"" for a much needed reality check. This omnibus Spanish feature, sharply written and directed by Damian Szifron, offers a series of very dark, very disturbing and sometimes very humorous vignettes, all centered on chance (and not so chance) encounters that go awry in unexpected and often tragic ways. The movie makes it clear that, while you may think you have control over your life, in the grand scheme of things, you're really just a pawn subject to the whims of other individuals, a soulless bureaucracy or, most chillingly, a cruel and mocking Fate. However, in two of the cases, the participants do manage to wrest control back from the outside forces and determine the course of their lives - to some extent, at least.As is often the case with these kinds of morality tales, most of the scenarios rely heavily on situational irony to get their points across. I won't detail the various stories (you really need to experience them for yourself), but I will note that the first one, involving an airliner, comes uncomfortably close to an actual event that occurred after the movie was released. Segments one and three contain the most visceral impact, while others cut deeper psychologically. Even the tones vary from one storyline to another. For instance, the final story, about a wedding that turns into a surrealistic nightmare, is shot through with pitch-dark humor. Replete with sharp performances from a talented cast, the movie touches on such universal human themes as revenge, road rage, class privilege, all tied to the sense of powerlessness one feels when confronted with forces bigger than oneself. In its own subtle, quiet way, the movie has a remarkable ability to keep the audience on the edge of its seat, filled with a kind of gnawing dread as we await the catastrophe we sense is just over the horizon. As with all the best horror tales, Szifron understands that the anticipation is often more terrifying than the actual event when it finally arrives. The movie as a whole has a way of unnerving us while it drives home some unpleasant and uncomfortable truths about what it means to be human.",creepily effective black comedy,if youve been feeling mite cocky about where your life is headed late you might want take gander at wild tales much needed reality check this omnibus spanish feature sharply written directed by damian szifron offers series very dark very disturbing sometimes very humorous vignettes all centered chance not so chance encounters that go awry unexpected often tragic ways movie makes it clear that while you may think you have control over your life grand scheme things youre really just pawn subject whims other individuals soulless bureaucracy or most chillingly cruel mocking fate however two cases participants do manage wrest control back outside forces determine course their lives some extent at least as is often case with these kinds morality tales most scenarios rely heavily situational irony get their points across i wont detail various stories you really need experience them yourself but i will note that first one involving airliner comes uncomfortably close actual event that occurred after movie was released segments one three contain most visceral impact while others cut deeper psychologically even tones vary one storyline another instance final story about wedding that turns into surrealistic nightmare is shot through with pitch dark humor replete with sharp performances talented cast movie touches such universal human themes as revenge road rage class privilege all tied sense powerlessness one feels when confronted with forces bigger than oneself its own subtle quiet way movie has remarkable ability keep audience edge its seat filled with kind gnawing dread as we await catastrophe we sense is just over horizon as with all best horror tales szifron understands that anticipation is often more terrifying than actual event when it finally arrives movie as whole has way unnerving us while it drives home some unpleasant uncomfortable truths about what it means be human,0.5394940476190475,0.032380952380952385,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
