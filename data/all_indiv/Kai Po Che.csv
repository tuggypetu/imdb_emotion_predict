9,"Cricket, Love, Friendship, Passion, Politics.... phew... what a film!","Before watching ""Kai Po Che!"":Me: Hey! Let's watch Kai Po Che.. A movie about Friendship, Forgiveness, Passion and..Bro: wait.. yet another movie on 'friendship'! Another 3 idiots! Another Zindagi na milegi dobara... Come on! Don't you get tired of watching movies about same old stuff.. Can't we watch 'Die Hard'..? Yippee ki yay!Me: No.. 'Die Hard' got bad reviews.. And seriously? Choosing 'Die Hard' over 'Kai Po Che' is the dumbest thing that must have ever come to your mind. Nopiee ki nay!Bro: OK then.. let's go.. But we will watch Die hard after we are done with Kai Po Che.. OK?Me: OK. Cool.The film:The film title Kai Po Che is originally a Gujarati phrase that means ""I have cut the kite"" which refers to a kite competition where one of the competitors uses his kite to cut off another competitors kite and yells ""Kai Po Che!""Adapted from ""The 3 Mistakes of my Life""(Chetan Bhagat) and Directed by Abhishek Kapoor (Rock On!!) this is a character driven film about friendship, forgiveness, passion, love.. all in the backdrop of some real events. The story mainly revolves around three friends, Ishaan played by Sushant Singh Rajput, Govind played by Raj Kumar Yadav and Omi played by Amit Sadh, who set out to open a sports training academy.The Good:A film about friendship is not a new thing in Bollywood. We have already witnessed ""3 Idiots"", ""Rock On"", ""ZNMD"", ""Dil Chahta Hai"". ""Kai Po Che"" looks similar at first but peel off the layers and it's much more.Adapted from a book titled ""3 mistakes of my Life"" this film is a tightly scripted and crisply edited drama that never bogs down or dumbs down for its audience and instead resorts to subtlety.Playing with themes like dreams and aspirations, friendship standing test of time, a commentary of our education system is not an easy task and the director does an incredible job of weaving everything together.Cinematographer Anay Goswamy has made look Gujrat so beautiful that I feel like taking a vacation and running off to that place for the Kite festival. Also, music given by ""Amit Trivedi"" is refreshing especially the song ""Manjha"".But it's the characters that drive this film and the three leads are a revelation here. Rajkumar Yadav, Amit Sadh and Sushant Singh Rajput not only have a good screen presence but they can actually ACT! (Sorry about me shouting and all.. but can't control my emotions right now) The actors have such great chemistry that it reminded me of my college days. These guys are not actors in this film. They ARE Govind Patel, Omkar Shastri and Ishaan Bhatt. And this is where this film hits it out of the park.A capitalist money minded friend. A political friend. An emotional/day dreamer friend. These are people whom we have met somewhere at some point in our lives. These are people whom we can relate to and care about.The Bad: Not applicable.Final verdict: Cricket, Love, Friendship, Passion, Politics.. It's all what India is about and it's something that any sane minded Indian wouldn't and shouldn't miss.After watching ""Kai Po Che!"":Bro: Damn you (sniff)Me: What! You didn't like it? (sniff)Bro: My eyes are watery. It's so embarrassing! F***ing friendship movies (sniff)Me: Oh come on now! Since when did you start crying for a film (sniff)Bro: Oh and why is there a bubble under your nose? Me: I.. I got cold. (sniff..) OK.. So next Die Hard.. I'll go buy the tickets and then..Bro: F*** Die Hard. Let's watch this again.

This is the second Chetan Bhagat's novel adapted for the silver screen after ""Five points someone"" (made a block buster in World cinemas list as ""3-Idiots"" directed by Rajkumar Hirani). Many people don't know what happened in Gujarat including me. Gothra train incident, election incident etc. Chetan Bhagat wrote this story in 2008. He is also one of the Screenplay writer for this movie. Directed by ""ROCK ON"" Abhishek Kapoor. Screenplay is really good. They have connected each and every incidents very well: Friendship, Love, Passion, and Revenge. Good casting also: Omi, Ish, Govi, Vidhya and Ali.

10,"Kai Po Che defines ""Good Cinema"".","Believe me when I tell you this, almost anybody can write a book as long as you have a pen and paper and the thought of it. But to read a book like ""Three mistakes of my life"" makes you kill yourself and to even make a movie from that book, that takes more than a set of balls. I have many friends who are simply mad behind Hollywood movies, who say that it's just amazing. But when I ask them about Bollywood movies they just say one thing, ""its not good cinema"". Well, here's your answer, Kai Po Che is what truly defines good cinema. It's just beginning of the year 2013 and we already have a film which is well acted, has as much as comic feel and emotional reel and a big story behind it. Direction is very raw, which is something I like. The movie has a Desi feel to it which I believe everyone likes. The most important is that the Film music consist of only three songs, which is very well written and perfectly sung. If you haven't seen this movie than I will definitely recommend you to do that.Kai Po Che in Tamil means ""Lost my hands"" which will probably happen to you when you will be applauding to this movie.",kai po che defines good cinema,believe me when i tell you this almost anybody can write book as long as you have pen paper thought it but read book like three mistakes my life makes you kill yourself even make movie that book that takes more than set balls i have many friends who are simply mad behind hollywood movies who say that its just amazing but when i ask them about bollywood movies they just say one thing its not good cinema well heres your answer kai po che is what truly defines good cinema its just beginning year 2013 we already have film which is well acted has as much as comic feel emotional reel big story behind it direction is very raw which is something i like movie has desi feel it which i believe everyone likes most important is that film music consist only three songs which is very well written perfectly sung if you havent seen this movie than i will definitely recommend you do that kai po che tamil means lost my hands which will probably happen you when you will be applauding this movie,0.6325000000000001,0.16125000000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9,My oh My!!!!,"This movie exceeded my expectations.Kai Po Che! does not redefines Indian cinema and brings nothing new to the table but still it ranks among the best films made in recent times just because it gets the essentials right.The acting by all lead stars and the supporting cast is excellent,editing is good ,direction is commendable and so is the story(much much better than the novel). Speaking of acting Sushant Singh deserves all the praise but one has to agree his role was the most likable of the three.Amit and Raj's role was challenging as well which they have played with due diligence.Even the support cast of Omi's ""mama"" and Vidya were brilliant and did justice to their role.But the real beauty of this movie lies in its simplicity.I never felt a scene overdone in the movie.The fight scenes (among the friend and riots)specially don't look pacified as in most of the Hindi movies for censor certificates.There is enough use of abuse in the movie but it never looks overdone and out of context.At the end of the day Kai Po Che! makes you feel nostalgic ,gives you heartwarming moments and heart breaking moments as well but then you realize that good cinema does not necessarily needs to be ground breaking,you can make a good movie just by following simple rule of good story,good acting and good direction.",my oh my,this movie exceeded my expectations kai po che does not redefines indian cinema brings nothing new table but still it ranks among best films made recent times just because it gets essentials right acting by all lead stars supporting cast is excellent editing is good direction is commendable so is story much much better than novel speaking acting sushant singh deserves all praise but one has agree his role was most likable three amit rajs role was challenging as well which they have played with due diligence even support cast omis mama vidya were brilliant did justice their role but real beauty this movie lies its simplicity i never felt scene overdone movie fight scenes among friend riots specially dont look pacified as most hindi movies censor certificates there is enough use abuse movie but it never looks overdone out context at end day kai po che makes you feel nostalgic gives you heartwarming moments heart breaking moments as well but then you realize that good cinema does not necessarily needs be ground breaking you can make good movie just by following simple rule good story good acting good direction,0.5032355575459023,0.35186968204209573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7,"Brimming Niceties, Fantastic Performances & A Scintillating Ode To Friendship (& Its Destruction)!","Kai Po Che, thus gives Bollywood a new wave of actors. Sushanth is a charmer. Amit Sadh is elegant and genuine. Yadav is creepy but portrays his role fantastically. The supporting cast is bold with Manav Kaul getting my uninterrupted attention. The music goes haywire sometimes, but the direction compensates it. Cinematography, I perceive has been a copy of Dil Chahta Hai while screenplay is non-linear & appreciable. The climax is different from the book & adds up little emotion to the film. Even if you haven't read the book, this one will give you a total feel of it.""I took the pains of making 3 Rock Ons!! for this,"" Anhishek Kapoor was himself quoted saying. And I second that. The glory of this adaptation is its screenplay, run time (135 minutes) & the audacity of film-making as a whole.Yes, there are some ennui-inducing sequences specially the romance thing which might... MIGHT annoy at times, but that is passable. Not much of dilly-dallying or item songs or stereotype ridden script or dialogs, this one. Indeed, KPC is a victory in itself! Yes, Gujarati people say it after achieving victory over kite flying, but after watching this, I too can say pretty much the same phrase with oomph. Except that the political hue was necessary, but the gore & violence made it look cranky. 7/10 for compressing such a magnificent book into a short film.BOTTOM LINE: Kai Po Che! is a pretty good film; a must watch this weekend (compared to Zilla Ghaziabad), but talking it with the likes of Dil Chahta Hai or Rock On!! would be mild disgrace to the latter because KPC doesn't talk more about friendship than it talks about its destruction. KPC will make you think, but it is not a GREAT* film as it tries very hard to achieve but still gets a cold spot.WATCH OUT FOR: Sushanth Singh Rajput, Manav Kaul, Amit Sadh & some tit- bits.*refers to actual meaning in the dictionary with in celluloid context.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

9,"Spellbinding, Enthralling, Amazing and So On...","There were times when our master storyteller Jeetendra's nephew Abhishek Kapoor was keen to make a dynamic debut as a hero in Bollywood. Sadly that potential got beaten up badly. But what really worked wonders was rise of a dynamic director and storyteller Abhishek Kapoor through his luminous work ""ROCK ON!"". It was no less than a masterpiece and also one of the best movies based on friendship in ages. 'KAI PO CHE' is also another friendship movie where behind the story and script is none other than Chetan Bhagat, one of the most exceptional young writers in ages. Though 'Hello', adapted from Bhagat's 'One Night @ The Call Center' didn't cast any magic on box-office, following one '3 Idiots', adapted from his 'Five point Someone' is the highest grossing movie on box- office till date and most favorite to numerous people. Which shows well- handled direction can work more than wonders if a superb script is given. And, Chetan Bhagat novels are so distinguished that an imposing script can be easily extracted from them. Though Hirani in 3 Idiots added more humor and his own creativity, Abhishek Kapoor follows the theme entirely of Bhagat's 'The 3 Mistakes Of My Life' and illustrates beautifully on screen as per demands of the script.Though 'The 3 Mistakes Of My Life' is the most diverse story inked on novel among other works by Bhagat, Abhishek Kapoor skillfully adds many stereotypical dimensions in the film which makes it even more beautiful than the novel itself. Friendship is such a wonderful genre that if you can present it beautifully that one can't stop praising it. DIL CHAHTA HAI, RANG DE BASANTI, ROCK ON! to ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA have been remarkable journeys so far. KAI PO CHE ushers itself in this wing. But KAI PO CHE doesn't hold its boundary only around FRIENDSHIP. It's a tale of unconditional friendship, endless love among themselves as if they hold under some brotherhood, it elucidates politics and portraits the illimitable passion for sports. But the movie depicts an unforgettable tale based on three real-life events that changed the main three protagonist's lives forever - a conducive cricket match between India & Australia, Gujarat Earthquake and Godhra Massacre and Riots based on that. I'm just amazed at how a marvelous story is woven under these three real-life events and based on the story, the screenplay is so well handled and composed by Pubali Chaudhuri, Supratik Sen, Abhishek Kapoor & Chetan Bhagat himself.Kai Po Che is the story of three friends Govind (Rajkumar Yadav), Omi (Amit Sadh) & Ishaan (Sushant Singh Rajput). Govind aspires to become a big businessman one day, so he along with his two friends, encouraging their passion, opens a cricket goods and training shop. Everything was going fine till the events that transpire against the backdrop of all that occurred in the city during that time change the lives of each of the friends in very different ways. Director Abhishek Kapoor yet again proves that he is a pedagogue storyteller. His previous work ROCK ON! and KAI PO CHE may be harmonious is some shades but KAI PO CHE is much more emotional, has too many layers and strikes a chord among the middle class youngsters out there which is very hard to commit to. KAI PO CHE is not only just a simple story of three friends, it's a perfect depiction of the role of society on the lives of the people living in outskirts. Plus, Abhishek Kapoor's brilliant storytelling completes it.Amit Trivedi's short and soulful music adds special charm. ""MANZA"" and ""MEETHI BOLIYAAN"" are delightful to listen to even the film could have easily worked without any song. But the songs gleam the spirit of the movie in a very melodious way. Anay Goswami's cinematography is first- rate. The three focal portions of the movie are exquisitely carried away by the three youngsters. It's amazing that Abhishek took a risk by choosing newcomers on such a introvert script but his clarity of vision helped him make a superb decision by choosing them.Sushant Singh Rajput's amazing potential, timing, acting skills and screen presence astonishes me completely. He already has YRF and Raju Hirani project in his pockets and no wonder why. Here rises an upcoming hugely successful star, that can be clearly seen. Amit Sadh enacts his part perfect. He can now come on focus of many talent seekers. Rajkumar Yadav enacts deliberately just like he did in his previous works. His role in every movie has different shades but this talented actor carries out skillfully every time.Rest of the cast do their jobs perfectly. Amrita Puri, the lone leading lady character in the movie aloof carries out her role amazingly. Manav Kaul & Asif Basra are excellent. Digvijay Deshmukh aka Ali is magnificent. Wish to see him in future more frequently.There can be no end of praising KAI PO CHE. Throughout this whole review, I failed to point out a single blemish in this fine piece of work. Every shot, every character, every moment in this movie is so flawless that one can't help being amazed at times. Films like KAI PO CHE are as hard to make as hard not be flabbergasted at. It's an incandescent saga of friendship that transcends the boundaries of penchant. Best Movie Of This Year So far. Strictly Recommended.",spellbinding enthralling amazing so,there were times when our master storyteller jeetendras nephew abhishek kapoor was keen make dynamic debut as hero bollywood sadly that potential got beaten up badly but what really worked wonders was rise dynamic director storyteller abhishek kapoor through his luminous work rock it was no less than masterpiece also one best movies based friendship ages kai po che is also another friendship movie where behind story script is none other than chetan bhagat one most exceptional young writers ages though hello adapted bhagats one night call center didnt cast any magic box office following one 3 idiots adapted his five point someone is highest grossing movie box office till date most favorite numerous people which shows well handled direction can work more than wonders if superb script is given chetan bhagat novels are so distinguished that imposing script can be easily extracted them though hirani 3 idiots added more humor his own creativity abhishek kapoor follows theme entirely bhagats 3 mistakes my life illustrates beautifully screen as per demands script though 3 mistakes my life is most diverse story inked novel among other works by bhagat abhishek kapoor skillfully adds many stereotypical dimensions film which makes it even more beautiful than novel itself friendship is such wonderful genre that if you can present it beautifully that one cant stop praising it dil chahta hai rang de basanti rock zindagi na milegi dobara have been remarkable journeys so far kai po che ushers itself this wing but kai po che doesnt hold its boundary only around friendship its tale unconditional friendship endless love among themselves as if they hold under some brotherhood it elucidates politics portraits illimitable passion sports but movie depicts unforgettable tale based three real life events that changed main three protagonists lives forever conducive cricket match between india australia gujarat earthquake godhra massacre riots based that im just amazed at how marvelous story is woven under these three real life events based story screenplay is so well handled composed by pubali chaudhuri supratik sen abhishek kapoor chetan bhagat himself kai po che is story three friends govind rajkumar yadav omi amit sadh ishaan sushant singh rajput govind aspires become big businessman one day so he along with his two friends encouraging their passion opens cricket goods training shop everything was going fine till events that transpire against backdrop all that occurred city during that time change lives each friends very different ways director abhishek kapoor yet again proves that he is pedagogue storyteller his previous work rock kai po che may be harmonious is some shades but kai po che is much more emotional has too many layers strikes chord among middle class youngsters out there which is very hard commit kai po che is not only just simple story three friends its perfect depiction role society lives people living outskirts plus abhishek kapoors brilliant storytelling completes it amit trivedis short soulful music adds special charm manza meethi boliyaan are delightful listen even film could have easily worked without any song but songs gleam spirit movie very melodious way anay goswamis cinematography is first rate three focal portions movie are exquisitely carried away by three youngsters its amazing that abhishek took risk by choosing newcomers such introvert script but his clarity vision helped him make superb decision by choosing them sushant singh rajputs amazing potential timing acting skills screen presence astonishes me completely he already has yrf raju hirani project his pockets no wonder why here rises upcoming hugely successful star that can be clearly seen amit sadh enacts his part perfect he can now come focus many talent seekers rajkumar yadav enacts deliberately just like he did his previous works his role every movie has different shades but this talented actor carries out skillfully every time rest cast do their jobs perfectly amrita puri lone leading lady character movie aloof carries out her role amazingly manav kaul asif basra are excellent digvijay deshmukh aka ali is magnificent wish see him future more frequently there can be no end praising kai po che throughout this whole review i failed point out single blemish this fine piece work every shot every character every moment this movie is so flawless that one cant help being amazed at times films like kai po che are as hard make as hard not be flabbergasted at its incandescent saga friendship that transcends boundaries penchant best movie this year so far strictly recommended,0.6152702380952378,0.29531547619047627,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8,"Watch it for the direction, intensity and simplicity! A treat.","Kai Po Che- Magnificent direction and excellent performance by each one of the cast member, you will find it hard to get a loophole there. The film is based on 'The Three Mistakes of My Life', more than the story it is the execution that sets this film apart. On account of direction this movie has set some high standards, it's a through and through professional job; priorities, preferences, perspectives and lives of people are so beautifully gelled that it is a treat to the senses. Music has been used to touch this movie just enough to keep it untouched, yet it has provided the desired effect- may be a notch less you can say This is mostly a single paced film, that in no way means that it is on a lower level; actually whole film has been set up on a higher platform. It is not an outright feel-good thing like DCH or RDB, and it is intense even in it's lightest of moments. The climax is short, fitting and crisp - a message has been delivered without going in disputed territories So, don't go in with any presumptions and watch it for some exceptional stuff but at the same time there is no guarantee for everyone's satisfaction",watch it direction intensity simplicity treat,kai po che magnificent direction excellent performance by each one cast member you will find it hard get loophole there film is based three mistakes my life more than story it is execution that sets this film apart account direction this movie has set some high standards its through through professional job priorities preferences perspectives lives people are so beautifully gelled that it is treat senses music has been used touch this movie just enough keep it untouched yet it has provided desired effect may be notch less you can say this is mostly single paced film that no way means that it is lower level actually whole film has been set up higher platform it is not outright feel good thing like dch or rdb it is intense even its lightest moments climax is short fitting crisp message has been delivered without going disputed territories so dont go with any presumptions watch it some exceptional stuff but at same time there is no guarantee everyones satisfaction,0.5423308270676692,0.30773182957393486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8,Superb adaptation,"Chetan Bhagat's novel 3 Mistakes of My Life(2008) was a great hit, after remaking Five Point Someone into 3 Idiots, and a disastrous adaptation of One Night @ A Call Center into Hello, Yet again Chetan Bhagat's novel has been adapted for the big screen and this time one of the adapters include Chetan Bhagat himself. The film sticks to the novel though and only in some places there are some changes. The film starts off in present day when one of the friend is released from jail and then goes into a flashback mode, 10 years back. The friendship, ambitions of the leads, all characters are well treated just like the novel. There are several one liners to keep you entertained.The interval point too is superbly handled. The second half gets more serious and intense and there are superbly handled scenes like the confrontation between Ishaan and Omi, the cricket match scene, the twists and turns towards the end. The writers do have deviated from the novel towards the end but yet the end is superb. Though it does rob of the intensity of the novel. Thankfully the Godhra riots isn't shown in a preachy manner nor is it too in your face.Direction by Abhishek Kapoor is superb Music is good, Meethi Boliyan is fantastic, while the other 2 songs Manja and the other song is superbAmongst actors, boasting of non stars but talented actors Rajkumar(his name is spelt without his surname Yadav) is superb, after a small role in Talaash he returns back with a bang and handles his role superbly without going overboard. Amit Sadh who had a role in Maximum is superb and does a great job in his role, his expressions towards the end take you by surprise but the real find is TV Actor Sushant Singh Rajput, he has great screen presence but captivated you with his superb performance, he is one of the best debutantes off recent. Amrita Puri is good in her part. Digvijay Deshmukh as young Ali is superb and confident. Manav Kaul as Bittu Mama is superb in his negative role(in the novel though the character is shown older).

9,The Best Movie Of The Year So Far..,"Set against the backdrop of the Gujarat riots of a decade ago, Kai Po Che tells the story of three best friends - Ishaan Bhatt (Sushant Singh Rajput), Omkar Shastri (Amit Sadh) and Govind Patel (Rajkumar Yadav), who are trying to chase their dreams in the advent of the new millennium. This was a time when India's nuclear power was ostensibly shining - a perfect place for the three Ahmedabad boys to start a business that could be their ticket to fame and riches.In a country like that of ours, where cricket is a religion, they hit upon a brilliant plan to start a training academy that could produce India's next sporting superstars. But, destiny plays cruel joke in the lives of three boys whose equations with each other are thrown into severe turmoil by calamitous event of the Godhra riots. This is when Ishaan, Omi and Govind struggle to keep their friendship intact, but on the other hand, their dreams are shattered as it pushes their grand plan of building a sports academy off the rails.Positives : Kai Po Che is a refreshing tale of friendship, dreams and passion that might leave you with a mild dose of reality.

8,You won't make a mistak !,"This week has basically two releases for 'Bollywood' and I opted for 'Kai Po Che'. The reason behind my choice is crystal clear that's one and only for 'Abhishek Kapoor' – the man who delivered the best musical film of 'Bollywood'. So now an inevitable question rises that – Did Abhishek really succeed again with his adaption of a book which I felt was filled with many potholes and flaws like 'Ali swashbuckling the deliveries of the Aussies'. Did Abhishek again sensitively handle the newly derived success formula of 'Bollywood'- male bonding ?? STORY - As most of us know that it is an adaption of 'Chetan Bhagat's' novel – 'The Three Mistakes Of my Life', sorry I have to correct myself 'It is an successful adaption'. Yes my friends this flick is really enjoyable. The director has handled with care every genre that passes along this movie and gives it a nice 'Bollywood' touch. The central theme that is bro-mance is one of the best. It reminds me of '3-idiots' but it would be quite daring to say that it outranks '3-idiots' in that field. From the cryptic trailers everyone would have got a silhouette of the movie but don't go with your intuition. Because the movie demands a watch. Unlike other directors this one has not spread himself too thin in an attempt to please the audience. For instance the seduction by Vidya to Govind isn't stretched to an obscene amount. The setting of the story in 'Gujarat' is one of the big highlights of this movie as you will love the cinematography. This movie plays and reflects the stereotypes of this so-called 'Modern India'. The movie's character are from middle class so it does play a staple dish .PERFORMANCES -'Raj Kumar Yadav' excels and 'Amit Sadh' too but the man of the movie award goes to 'Sushant Singh Rajput'. It's no doubt that the three of them were good but at the end of the day someone is best.'Vidya' played by ' Amrita Puri' is cute with a tinge of joviality and naughtiness . She is a perfect sister and a lover. Little 'Ali' does look strong and playful. Others are good. I can't through the whole list in one word I will label the cast 'very good'. The transition made by the three lead characters seems like a facile victory. I won't dig enough cause I don't want to spoil it for you. MUSIC- 'Gujarat' means 'Garba' and thus means 'beautiful'. The songs are good . Unlike the previous venture 'Rock On' this one is a bit traditional and you will love it. If I will go for the best song I will vote for 'Shubharambh'. God! You will love it. Music is too good. OTHER ASPECTS -The cinematography is really fitting. You will surely succumb to the depth of 'Gujaratiness'.Editing is good and I'm not that kind of aficionado in film-making so I did like the other aspects too like camera work , editing and blah,blah,blah. FINAL VERDICT -Go for it. You won't make a mistake.",you wont make mistak,this week has basically two releases bollywood i opted kai po che reason behind my choice is crystal clear thats one only abhishek kapoor man who delivered best musical film bollywood so now inevitable question rises that did abhishek really succeed again with his adaption book which i felt was filled with many potholes flaws like ali swashbuckling deliveries aussies did abhishek again sensitively handle newly derived success formula bollywood male bonding story as most us know that it is adaption chetan bhagats novel three mistakes my life sorry i have correct myself it is successful adaption yes my friends this flick is really enjoyable director has handled with care every genre that passes along this movie gives it nice bollywood touch central theme that is bro mance is one best it reminds me 3 idiots but it would be quite daring say that it outranks 3 idiots that field cryptic trailers everyone would have got silhouette movie but dont go with your intuition because movie demands watch unlike other directors this one has not spread himself too thin attempt please audience instance seduction by vidya govind isnt stretched obscene amount setting story gujarat is one big highlights this movie as you will love cinematography this movie plays reflects stereotypes this so called modern india movies character are middle class so it does play staple dish performances raj kumar yadav excels amit sadh too but man movie award goes sushant singh rajput its no doubt that three them were good but at end day someone is best vidya played by amrita puri is cute with tinge joviality naughtiness she is perfect sister lover little ali does look strong playful others are good i cant through whole list one word i will label cast very good transition made by three lead characters seems like facile victory i wont dig enough cause i dont want spoil it you music gujarat means garba thus means beautiful songs are good unlike previous venture rock this one is bit traditional you will love it if i will go best song i will vote shubharambh god you will love it music is too good other aspects cinematography is really fitting you will surely succumb depth gujaratiness editing is good im not that kind aficionado film making so i did like other aspects too like camera work editing blah blah blah final verdict go it you wont make mistake,0.5654031051253275,0.2796394500561167,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

7,Must watch for a well told story and great editing,"Chetan Bhagat should be one happy man! This is the third of his books to make it to the big screen, after 'One Night @ the Call Center' turned into 'Hello' and 'Five Point Someone' lit the screens as '3 idiots'. This time it is 'The 3 Mistakes of My Life'. The film begins in the present day setting where Govind Patel (Raj Kumar Yadav) makes a slick presentation on his academy 'Sabarmati Sports'. He then picks up Omi Shastri (Amit Sadh) from a prison and they drive towards a stadium. On the way, the film cuts back to 10 years in the past, to a story of three friends, the third one being cricket freak and otherwise lazy Ishaan Bhatt (Sushant Singh Rajput). The trio, who are otherwise not gainfully employed full-time, start off a business. While Govind is the more calculative businessman, Omi brings in the bucks by way of support from a doting uncle Bittu Mama who is a local politician and is keen to see Omi joining the party. Ishaan is the emotionally driven one and coaches cricket, something he loves most and from his experience as a district level player. The business takes wings quickly and they are about to expand too. In the meantime, Ishaan has identified a local talent Ali, a shy boy and the son of Omi's uncle's political rival. And with Govind teaching Maths to Ishaan's sister Vidya (Amrita Puri), sparks fly between them and a new romance develops, unbeknownst to Ishaan. Suddenly, things are set to change when an earthquake strikes and riots happen!'Kai Po Che' which stands for a cry when a rival's kite is cut in a kite festival, has a very earthly charm with realistic characters. In a way, not having star power for its lead actors works well in the film's favor allowing the script to prevail. While its lead actors and especially Raj Kumar Yadav & Sushant Singh Rajput do well, probably the most powerful performance comes from Manav Kaul as Bittu Mama.Edited with precision mostly seen in Hollywood, 'Kai Po Che' has a runtime of hardly over two hours and manages to capture a whole gamut of events, transformation of characters and still managing to leave an overwhelmingly heavy feeling in the end. Nowhere is time lost for songs as Amit Trivedi's soundtracks blend into the setting and the story. The song 'Manjha' is already popular and works as its soul. Real life events, the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2002 riots that happened in the aftermath of the inhuman burning of pilgrims at Godhra where one of the key characters is shown to have lost his family in the fateful coach that was burnt. In what could be described as controversial, the film takes the liberty to portray one religious community as an aggressor and the other, mostly as a victim, thus playing it safe. To sum up, 'Kai Po Che' is definitely recommended, irrespective of whether you watch it with friends or family. Let the hype around the movie not raise your expectations beyond what the movie can deliver. All that it has to offer is a drama that dwells on the lives of three friends and some events that seem to change their lives forever.",must watch well told story great editing,chetan bhagat should be one happy man this is third his books make it big screen after one night call center turned into hello five point someone lit screens as 3 idiots this time it is 3 mistakes my life film begins present day setting where govind patel raj kumar yadav makes slick presentation his academy sabarmati sports he then picks up omi shastri amit sadh prison they drive towards stadium way film cuts back 10 years past story three friends third one being cricket freak otherwise lazy ishaan bhatt sushant singh rajput trio who are otherwise not gainfully employed full time start off business while govind is more calculative businessman omi brings bucks by way support doting uncle bittu mama who is local politician is keen see omi joining party ishaan is emotionally driven one coaches cricket something he loves most his experience as district level player business takes wings quickly they are about expand too meantime ishaan has identified local talent ali shy boy son omis uncles political rival with govind teaching maths ishaans sister vidya amrita puri sparks fly between them new romance develops unbeknownst ishaan suddenly things are set change when earthquake strikes riots happen kai po che which stands cry when rivals kite is cut kite festival has very earthly charm with realistic characters way not having star power its lead actors works well films favor allowing script prevail while its lead actors especially raj kumar yadav sushant singh rajput do well probably most powerful performance comes manav kaul as bittu mama edited with precision mostly seen hollywood kai po che has runtime hardly over two hours manages capture whole gamut events transformation characters still managing leave overwhelmingly heavy feeling end nowhere is time lost songs as amit trivedis soundtracks blend into setting story song manjha is already popular works as its soul real life events 2001 gujarat earthquake 2002 riots that happened aftermath inhuman burning pilgrims at godhra where one key characters is shown have lost his family fateful coach that was burnt what could be described as controversial film takes liberty portray one religious community as aggressor other mostly as victim thus playing it safe sum up kai po che is definitely recommended irrespective whether you watch it with friends or family let hype around movie not raise your expectations beyond what movie can deliver all that it has offer is drama that dwells lives three friends some events that seem change their lives forever,0.46260822510822514,0.12130230880230879,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8,Blender's price,"Blender's Pride is a premium whiskey and hence, before I start reviewing the newly released movie - Kai Po Che, let me put forth a disclaimer that I do not promote consumption of alcoholic drinks and this review has nothing to do with that whiskey. I have titled the review as such because this movie is a rare blend of Cricket, sentiments, friendly bonds, communal tensions and biased politics in Gujarat and above all, the passion of three youths to move ahead in life on the basis of their love for sports, turning this love of theirs only into their profession. All these ingredients have been blended so well in the narrative that it is difficult to segregate any one of them from the others. That's why I term this movie as a blender's pride.Cricket is no less than a religion in our country. The craze for this sport transcends all the bounds viz. caste, creed, religion, gender, age, province, language, class, profession etc. etc. etc. Many movies have been made taking this sport as the subject matter but only Patiala House (2011) blends it pretty well with and makes it an inseparable part of the theme which is different. Kai Po Che is another one and the filmmaker has done this job with perfection. Unlike Patiala House whose protagonist is a Cricketer himself, the protagonists of this movie are Cricket lovers who live this game.I have not read Chetan Bhagat's novel - The 3 Mistakes of My Life which this movie is said to be based upon. However I feel that this extremely well made movie must be an improvement on the novel. The narrative grips the spectator from the word 'go' and thereafter that grip does not get loosened anywhere till the final shot.The three protagonists of this movie are Govind (Rajkumar Yadav), Ishaan (Sushant Singh Rajput) and Omi (Amit Sadh) who love sports, especially Cricket and dream to make it big in life by following their passion and running a business of sports materials and a sports academy combined together. How their dreams take shape amidst the financial and practical troubles, how they keep their friendship intact despite differences in views and nature, how they face the natural and man-made calamities and finally the communal riots after the painful Godhra train-coach burning incident, everything has been presented on the screen in the most appealing manner. And amidst all these phenomena, there is Cricket and their love for it just like the love of the millions of Indian commoners. This love blended with their mutual love, works as the adhesive between them, not allowing them to get separated, come what may.Every year, on the Makar Sankranti day (14th January), the world famous kite festival takes place in Jaipur and nearby areas when the kite fliers fill the sky with colourful kites and go for knocking the kites of others (such fights of kites are called PECH in North India). And when someone is able to knock the kite of someone else with his, then the surroundings reverberate with the victory shout - Woh Kaata (I have cut it). The same victory shout is known as Kai Po Che in Gujarati. This joyful roar is symbolic of the small victories gained by the protagonists in the battle of life.Another very significant thing about this movie is the emotional bonding between males. Ishaan's passion for Cricket and exasperating the talent hidden in a young boy of a modest Muslim family is unique but his two comrades are also crazy for Cricket. The best scene in this regard is the watching of India's historic victory over Australia in the Kolkata test match in 2001 by Omi on TV and thereafter his craving to share his abundant joy with his pals. An unfortunate incident post the earthquake in Gujarat had created a rift between him and Ishaan. But when he runs out of his house to find someone to share his joy, he finds Ishaan coming to him with open arms and they embrace each other, forgetting the past things. That scene is able to leave an indelible imprint on the heart of anybody who puts a premium on friendship and camaraderie.The only superfluous and irritating thing I found in this movie is the romantic track of Ishaan's sister Vidya (Amrita Puri) and Govind. Since I have not read the novel, may be this track is on the lines of the novel but it disturbs the flow of the movie and not in sync with its overall mood. Over-enthusiastic Vidya's advances towards submissive and meek Govind might be appealing to the romantic female audience but to me, they appeared as unnatural and unduly imposed, diluting the otherwise high quality of the movie.All the three heroes have delivered mindblowing performances. Sushant Singh Rajput has entered the skin of the character of the greatly humanistic and utterly sensitive Ishaan quite effortlessly. It's very difficult to imagine some other actor in that role. Rajkumar Yadav and Amit Sadh are not far behind. Among others, the one who truly stands out is Manav Kaul playing Omi's politically biased maternal uncle. Child artist Digvijay Deshmukh playing the young Muslim child - Ali whom Ishaan aspires to develop into a great Cricketer, also leaves his mark.Technically, the movie is just outstanding with the Gujarat of ten years ago coming alive on the screen. Length is apt. Editing is praiseworthy. Music prepared by the team of composer Amit Trivedi and lyricist Swanand Kirkire deserves high accolades. Suljha Lenge Uljhe Rishton Ka Maanjha is definitely the best song but the others songs are also praiseworthy.After Rock On (2008), Abhishek Kapoor has proved once again that he knows his work very well and is able to make heart-winning movies. As said in the opening para, it's definitely Blender's Pride, very intoxicating and leaving a long lasting impact on the consumer (that is, the viewer).",blenders price,blenders pride is premium whiskey hence before i start reviewing newly released movie kai po che let me put forth disclaimer that i do not promote consumption alcoholic drinks this review has nothing do with that whiskey i have titled review as such because this movie is rare blend cricket sentiments friendly bonds communal tensions biased politics gujarat above all passion three youths move ahead life basis their love sports turning this love theirs only into their profession all these ingredients have been blended so well narrative that it is difficult segregate any one them others thats why i term this movie as blenders pride cricket is no less than religion our country craze this sport transcends all bounds viz caste creed religion gender age province language class profession etc etc etc many movies have been made taking this sport as subject matter but only patiala house 2011 blends it pretty well with makes it inseparable part theme which is different kai po che is another one filmmaker has done this job with perfection unlike patiala house whose protagonist is cricketer himself protagonists this movie are cricket lovers who live this game i have not read chetan bhagats novel 3 mistakes my life which this movie is said be based upon however i feel that this extremely well made movie must be improvement novel narrative grips spectator word go thereafter that grip does not get loosened anywhere till final shot three protagonists this movie are govind rajkumar yadav ishaan sushant singh rajput omi amit sadh who love sports especially cricket dream make it big life by following their passion running business sports materials sports academy combined together how their dreams take shape amidst financial practical troubles how they keep their friendship intact despite differences views nature how they face natural man made calamities finally communal riots after painful godhra train coach burning incident everything has been presented screen most appealing manner amidst all these phenomena there is cricket their love it just like love millions indian commoners this love blended with their mutual love works as adhesive between them not allowing them get separated come what may every year makar sankranti day 14th january world famous kite festival takes place jaipur nearby areas when kite fliers fill sky with colourful kites go knocking kites others such fights kites are called pech north india when someone is able knock kite someone else with his then surroundings reverberate with victory shout woh kaata i have cut it same victory shout is known as kai po che gujarati this joyful roar is symbolic small victories gained by protagonists battle life another very significant thing about this movie is emotional bonding between males ishaans passion cricket exasperating talent hidden young boy modest muslim family is unique but his two comrades are also crazy cricket best scene this regard is watching indias historic victory over australia kolkata test match 2001 by omi tv thereafter his craving share his abundant joy with his pals unfortunate incident post earthquake gujarat had created rift between him ishaan but when he runs out his house find someone share his joy he finds ishaan coming him with open arms they embrace each other forgetting past things that scene is able leave indelible imprint heart anybody who puts premium friendship camaraderie only superfluous irritating thing i found this movie is romantic track ishaans sister vidya amrita puri govind since i have not read novel may be this track is lines novel but it disturbs

8,Meticulously crafted crowd-pleaser,"Kai Po Che is a winner all the way. Meticulously crafted, it's neither a spellbinding celluloid marvel nor a half-baked Bollywood potboiler. The story of friendship, heartbreak and redemption through a stormy ride of betrayal by fate and history transforms Chetan Bhagat's mediocre work into an honest and heartwarming crowd-pleaser. The three towering aspects of the film are - the casting, cinematography and music. Anay Goswami does a terrific job with the camera. Amit Trivedi, yet again, vindicates his position as the most consistent and bankable music director in the industry. If A.R.Rahman is the Sachin Tendulkar of Bollywood, Amit Trivedi surely is Michael Clarke. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers a stellar performance as Ishan who is mercurial and temperamental, infectiously warm and gullible, trapped in a bubble of naivety. Amit Sadh as Omi is a knockout too, bringing out the complex nuances of his character with a steady transformation from unwavering loyalty towards his friends to a gradual, stuttering descent into murkiness. But, Raj Kumar Yadav as Govind, eclipses his other two equally brilliant co-stars. Ambitious and miserly, hesitant and calculative, yet a quiet intensity amidst the incoherent traits of minimalism adds many shades to his character, and he plays out his role with mathematical precision, complementing and acting as a perfect foil to Ishan's volatility and Omi's vulnerability. With GoW, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has taken the elevator-route to capture the imagination of cinephiles and critics. LSD, Shaitan, Shahid and Kai Po Che - Raj Kumar Yadav prefers a ladder instead, taking slow and assured steps to the rightful place where he belongs.",meticulously crafted crowd pleaser,kai po che is winner all way meticulously crafted its neither spellbinding celluloid marvel nor half baked bollywood potboiler story friendship heartbreak redemption through stormy ride betrayal by fate history transforms chetan bhagats mediocre work into honest heartwarming crowd pleaser three towering aspects film are casting cinematography music anay goswami does terrific job with camera amit trivedi yet again vindicates his position as most consistent bankable music director industry if r rahman is sachin tendulkar bollywood amit trivedi surely is michael clarke sushant singh rajput delivers stellar performance as ishan who is mercurial temperamental infectiously warm gullible trapped bubble naivety amit sadh as omi is knockout too bringing out complex nuances his character with steady transformation unwavering loyalty towards his friends gradual stuttering descent into murkiness but raj kumar yadav as govind eclipses his other two equally brilliant co stars ambitious miserly hesitant calculative yet quiet intensity amidst incoherent traits minimalism adds many shades his character he plays out his role with mathematical precision complementing acting as perfect foil ishans volatility omis vulnerability with gow nawazuddin siddiqui has taken elevator route capture imagination cinephiles critics lsd shaitan shahid kai po che raj kumar yadav prefers ladder instead taking slow assured steps rightful place where he belongs,0.4991161616161616,0.16931818181818184,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.41}"
7,"Abhishek Kapoor's Skillful Adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's Prosaic Novel Makes Kai Po Che A Rich And Engaging Experience Overall, However The First Half Is A Tad Predictable","Usually, I would not recommend a Chetan Bhagat novel to anyone. My lack of love for the author stemmed after reading 'The Three Mistakes of My Life', his only work I've read. Finding his writing style prosaic and his characters' world uninteresting, I could not push myself to touch any of his other books though I own all his earlier works (birthday gifts). But now, I think I have some people whom I would surely recommend his novels to: while anybody who reads great English works will not generally waste his or her time with a Chetan Bhagat book, I believe any talented scriptwriter or director should get his hands on a Chetan Bhagat book, which have proved to become great film adaptations, and turn it into a fine film with the help of a talented crew who rise above expectations, breathing some vitality and maturity into the stale characters penned by the author in his works.In fact, Bhagat can change his profession by entering screen writing or start pitching good ideas for cinema. Take Three Idiots for example, which was based partially on '5 Point Someone' and proved to be one of the most watched films of the year and though 'Hello' which was adapted from 'One Night At A Call Center' tanked, Kai Po Che is the second time a Chetan Bhagat novel has proved to work as a great adaptation. Abhishek Kapoor, the film's director and scriptwriter is able to visually present with great effect the motifs in the novel, and while his approach is safer and more faithful to the novel than 3 Idiots, KPC is very absorbing nevertheless thanks to the arresting background score and honest, understated performances. The motif working best in KPC is that of the television which repeatedly appears to influence the lives of the film's characters. When the film begins, the television appears first when Omi (Amit Sadh), just out of jail is taken by his close friend Govind (Raj Kumar Yadav) to a café/restaurant where people are watching a cricket match. In the next shot, an Indian batsman who is to play in that very match is seen watching the game. Then moment cuts to flashback where a young Omi is watching the game with his best buddy Ishaan (Sushant Singh). And as the movie progresses, taking us through the lives of the three men with differing attitudes and ambitions, the television motif recur, appearing as news presentations during the Gujarat earthquake and more importantly the riot segments. And with each appearance, something in their lives and kinship changes and Abhishek Kapoor is able to film his characters' personal struggles rising from conflict internalization skillfully. It shows that the director has a good idea about the difference such motifs can create in transcending a simplistic plot to a rich and engaging experience. The plot is simple and, if not for the tragedies struck in the second half, quite predictable. Ishaan is an ex-cricket player who opens a sports shop cum tuition center along with his buddies Omi and Govind, using Omi's uncle's money. So while Govind runs his mathematics classes, Omi handles the shop and Ishaan trains the youngsters in the sport of cricket. Ishaan sees a great potential in young Ali, who hits sixes on the leg-side in almost every ball but does not have enough stamina to last more than a few overs and also never plays off-side, and he decides to train the kid so he can play in major tournaments and fulfill (vicariously) Ishaan's own unrealized dream of representing the Indian team. Omi meanwhile tries to extricate himself from his uncle's repeated insistence on joining his political party until later in the movie. Govind on the other hand dreams of shifting their business inside a mall, which he believes has a great possibility to flourish in the future (remember, the movie is mostly told through flashbacks and the time period is still the early 90s). Under Ishaan's insistence, he teacher mathematics to Ishaan's younger sister Vidya but their classes soon turns into romantic dates and the two soon fall in love. The first tragedy in the form of Gujarat earthquake hits just before the interval, while the second, the Gujarat riots, strikes just when everything slowly starts turning to normalcy for the characters. Before interval, I heard a number of members in the crowd grumble that the movie was slow. It would rather say that everything until the earthquake segment felt like something we'd seen many times before. Actually, almost all the youth-centric films in India seem to progress in a similar patters: introduction of characters and their inter- relationships, one main romantic subplot, happy moments where the lead characters take long drives, drink and rejoice, all shot brilliantly (so in a majority of the movies, I find the cinematography flawless) but also quite predictably. The predictability of dialogs is another thing hampering almost every Indian film, and I believe that's because the range and skill of improvisation in many Indian actors/directors is underdeveloped. Post interval, things are set right when the trust and common ambition among the lead characters unravel with changing and worsening times. All three male leads are all right, but I found that they did as the script told them without the extra factor that lends complexity to their characters. For example, Sushant could've worked more on the plot involving his desire to see Ishaan in the Indian team, a desire he himself couldn't fulfill; this is actually a condition in psychology and had Sushant conveyed this more through his gestures and expressions to the audience, it would've added depth to his role. It is Amrita Puri who gives the best shot, sounding more convincing as a Gujarati (Sushant's accent slips a lot) girl who is spirited, charming and optimistic.Most impressive attention-to-detail segment: Omi outside theater in queue for Basic Instinct, a film released in the 90s.",abhishek kapoors skillful adaptation chetan bhagats prosaic novel makes kai po che rich engaging experience

9,One of the best for 2013,"This can be put in the category where bollywood and parallel cinema ends can meet. Director Abhishek Kapoor has done what any director dreams about . A tightly bind script, best possible actors(not super stars), no item dance yet pleasureful bollywood movie. Based on Chetan Bhagat's ""3 mistakes of my life"", it is about dreams of modern Indian youth, their relations, real world mishaps. Went for the movie without any expectation and thinking but when i came out of the hall, it was like one of the best experience one can ever have in cinema hall. On Acting: Shushant, Rajkumar and Amit have done complete justice with their roles. Every one of them has got their fare share on screen and executed it beautifully. Amrita has got lesser chance but she is charming, refreshing yet caring girl in the role. Must watch for everyone, be it a teenager or young professional.",one best 2013,this can be put category where bollywood parallel cinema ends can meet director abhishek kapoor has done what any director dreams about tightly bind script best possible actors not super stars no item dance yet pleasureful bollywood movie based chetan bhagats 3 mistakes my life it is about dreams modern indian youth their relations real world mishaps went movie without any expectation thinking but when i came out hall it was like one best experience one can ever have cinema hall acting shushant rajkumar amit have done complete justice with their roles every one them has got their fare share screen executed it beautifully amrita has got lesser chance but she is charming refreshing yet caring girl role must watch everyone be it teenager or young professional,0.4619047619047618,0.3179271708683473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
