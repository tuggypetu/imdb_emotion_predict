10.0,A heart wrenching and very realistic drama.,"Having just returned from an extended trip to India I was keen to see a quality Indian film (not bollywood drival)and I have come across one of the most realistic and moving films I have ever seen. Having been involved in helping street kids in India I was pleased to come across this film which so accurately depicts life, love and death around a group of street boys in Bombay.SALAAM BOMBAY is the story of a 12-year-old street boy surviving and etching out an existence on the squalled streets of Bombay. The interactions these kids have with each other made me feel I was watching a doco. The kids in India are so much like Chipau and the others depicted in Salaam Bombay its amazing. They all have there individual lives and dreams like us all but are burdened with extreame poverty.The story lines in the film are about the prostitution business, drug addiction and homeless children. All these elements combine so as we see the people and lives behind them. These issues are rarely dealt with on such a personal and emotional level as we see in this film. This ain't Hollywood and it sure ain't Bollywood.For me my favorite all time film. You may have difficulty in finding this film at your local video library but it truly is worth viewing.Recently we showed this film to a group of street kids in Pune, India. They were amazed at its realism. All thought they were watching real people not actors,(These kids have grown up watching Bollywood films). This same group would have watched this film 5 times now. And all could identify with the characters.",heart wrenching very realistic drama,having just returned extended trip india i was keen see quality indian film not bollywood drival i have come across one most realistic moving films i have ever seen having been involved helping street kids india i was pleased come across this film which so accurately depicts life love death around group street boys bombay salaam bombay is story 12 year old street boy surviving etching out existence squalled streets bombay interactions these kids have with each other made me feel i was watching doco kids india are so much like chipau others depicted salaam bombay its amazing they all have there individual lives dreams like us all but are burdened with extreame poverty story lines film are about prostitution business drug addiction homeless children all these elements combine so as we see people lives behind them these issues are rarely dealt with such personal emotional level as we see this film this aint hollywood it sure aint bollywood me my favorite all time film you may have difficulty finding this film at your local video library but it truly is worth viewing recently we showed this film group street kids pune india they were amazed at its realism all thought they were watching real people not actors these kids have grown up watching bollywood films this same group would have watched this film 5 times now all could identify with characters,0.49082125603864746,0.19384057971014496,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"

8.0,Greetings from the Streets of Bombay,"The boy Krishna (Shafiq Syed) is abandoned by his mother at the Apollo Circus and she tells him that he can only return home when he can afford 500 rupees to pay for the bicycle of his brother that he had trashed. Krishna is left behind by the circus and he takes a train to Bombay. Krishna is called Chaipau by the street children of Bombay and he works delivering and selling tea for Chacha (Irshad Hashmi), who owns a street bar. Krishna befriends the heroin addicted Chillum (Raghubir Yadav) that sells drugs for the drug dealer and caftan Baba Golub (Nana Patekar), and the girl Manju Golub (Hansa Vithal), who is the daughter of Baba with the prostitute Rekha Golub (Aneeta Kanwar). Krishna dreams on saving 500 rupees to return home, but the life on the streets of Bombay is not easy.""Salaam Bombay!"" is the first feature by the Indian director Mira Nair, who became famous in Brazil with the also excellent ""Monsoon Wedding"". The heartbreaking story follows the saga and the lost of the innocence of the boy Krishna on the streets of Bombay and is very similar to the one of Pedro (""Los Olvidados"" - 1950) on the streets of Mexico City; or Pixote (""Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco"" – 1981) on the streets of São Paulo; or the anonymous street kids (""Ali Zaoua, Prince de la Rue"" – 2000) on the streets of Casablanca. The documentary style is impressive but easy to understand based on the previous career of Mira Nair.The problem with abandoned children of Third World countries is a sad reality along decades and shameful governments usually transfer the money that could solve or at least improve this social problem to corruption.

,Moving Work,"Writer/Director Mira Nair presents the tribulations of life on the streets of Bombay, India through the eyes of a young, homeless boy.

9.0,Haunting Movie Debut.,"The film is about a 12-year-old street boy, Chipau, played by an actual street child, Shahiq Syed, who through some appalling circumstances comes to Bombay and finds himself among the street children eking out a meagre existence on the filthy, squalid streets of the city.Writer/Director Mira Nair, in her movie debut, did the extraordinary in preparing for this film. For one, she held workshops for street children so they could ""unlearn"" the Bollywood type acting they had learned at the cinema and she taught them to just be themselves. The viewer is left totally engrossed, repelled, appalled and sympathetic, all in turn, repeatedly. The film has the feel and rawness of a documentary. We are ""in"" the brothel, we are ""with"" one of the characters when he spins out when withdrawing from his drug. We are with the mother who loses her child to the orphanage - a far more soulless place than the brothel from which the child was removed.There are many stories intertwining in this film even as the characters' lives entwine. The emotions of the viewer are engaged at all times. Some of the scenes come close to unbearable.All the children have dreams and develop a companionship with each other, the human spirit wins out, even at the very end when the gutsy and creative Chipau is left alone, just like we saw him in the beginning. A complete cycle of life lived before he reaches another birthday. Desperate, hopeless and desolated. One can only hope that Chipau triumphs in the end. A movie that haunts long after other movies have come and gone. 9 out of 10.

8.0,A story of lost innocence,"Like the 'Square Circle' which came after it, Mira Nair's film is a wonderful counterpoint to traditional Bollywood cinema, depicting issues that many in India would like conveniently swept under the carpet. Filled with humanity and compassion, the film does have a parallel with Bollywood dramas as it too is about 'escapism'. However, the story shows how these dreams are illusory; the silent 'Sweet Sixteen' showing her romantic photograph - a pretence - as her brothel madam hawks her virginity to a prospective buyer; Krishna's hopes of being forgiven and returning home to his family; the prostitute Rekha's hopes of a 'family life' with the pimp Baba. I particularly liked the way Nair paralleled childhood innocence with adult cynicism and cruelty. The final scene where Krishna the teaboy weeps for his lost innocence and at what he has become is very moving; like the drug-addict Chillum, he has 'forgotten' how he first came to Bombay and now only sees a life of despair and suffering.",story lost innocence,like square circle which came after it mira nairs film is wonderful counterpoint traditional bollywood cinema depicting issues that many india would like conveniently swept under carpet filled with humanity compassion film does have parallel with bollywood dramas as it too is about escapism however story shows how these dreams are illusory silent sweet sixteen showing her romantic photograph pretence as her brothel madam hawks her virginity prospective buyer krishnas hopes being forgiven returning home his family prostitute rekhas hopes family life with pimp baba i particularly liked way nair paralleled childhood innocence with adult cynicism cruelty final scene where krishna teaboy weeps his lost innocence at what he has become is very moving like drug addict chillum he has forgotten how he first came bombay now only sees life despair suffering,0.5809523809523809,0.24285714285714288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Lost Childhoods,"A brilliant but sad film in which we follow abandoned Krishna on his quest to make enough money to return to his village. Along the way we meet the street kids, prostitutes, pimps and dealers he shares everyday life with.An amazing aspect is that all the child actors in the film are real street kids picked after attending workshops run by Nair and friends. In particular the central performances of Krishna, Manju and Coalpiece (his songs!) are superb. Despite their hardships there are some great moments when you see glimpses of the playful kids within.The film never wanders into over-sentimentality and at times its hard to believe you're not watching a documentary. Hindi-film music and escapism seeps into everyday life, actors mingle with ordinary people and the whole film is shot in real locations around Mumbai that just drip with atmosphere. This sadly includes the chiller room which was filmed as they found it along with the soul-crushing 'Flowers that never bloom' prayer.The story wanders and can be slow but this only serves to draw you into their world and leave you sad and angry at the end - at the loss of childhood for these kids and countless others.

10.0,A masterpiece.,"The story of Chaipu, a youngster thrown on the streets of Bombay, and his struggle to keep it all together. Excellent performances all around. I especially liked Chanda Sharma as 'Solasaal' and Hansa Vithal as her daughter 'Manju'.This film gives the creepy feeling you aren't watching actors but a movie made of people going about their daily life.Even if you don't like the story the cinematography is stunning. Filmed on location in Bombay the movie gives an unvarnished glimpse of many places you'd be unlikely to visit on a vacation there.The credits state 43 locations in 43 days.I've seen this movie so many times I don't need to read the sub-titles anymore as I know the dialogue by heart.A masterpiece.

8.0,Absolutely Brilliant,"A superb portrayal of the homeless in the streets of Bombay through the eyes of a young kid. Bombay with its conglomeration of people becomes a character in the movie. The cinematography was excellent as it leaves a lasting impact on the viewers. Few movies handle such a difficult subject and I must say that Mira Nair and Sooni Taraporevala have done an excellent job. The music of L. Subramaniam has an haunting effect (sound track available under the same name), especially the movie theme and chillum's theme when he dies. Top jazz guitarists like Larry Correl have played for subramaniam, probably difficult to notice in the movie, so check the soundtrack.

8.0,Surviving the Streets of India,"This was the very first Indian movie I've ever seen, unless you count Mississippi Masala. My vision of all Indian movies was music and dancing in gaudy costumes. This was anything but.A boy named Krishna/Chaipu (Shafiq Syed) was left by the circus he worked for. Not knowing what to do next he bought a ticket to the nearest big city which was Bombay. In Bombay he was a street urchin who worked delivering tea. His life was a series of ups and downs with mostly downs as he tried desperately to save 500 rupees to buy his way home.Eventually I had to look up just what 500 rupees is worth in U.S. dollars because it was taking him so long. As of today 500 rupees equals $7.06. That just astounds me. As much as Krishna worked and scrimped and saved he couldn't even save $7.06.This movie was bleak, depressing, and joyless. From the abject poverty, to the child prostitution, to the oppressive police, it was a heart wrenching movie. That's not to say the movie wasn't good, because it was, just don't expect many smiles.",surviving streets india,this was very first indian movie ive ever seen unless you count mississippi masala my vision all indian movies was music dancing gaudy costumes this was anything but boy named krishna chaipu shafiq syed was left by circus he worked not knowing what do next he bought ticket nearest big city which was bombay bombay he was street urchin who worked delivering tea his life was series ups downs with mostly downs as he tried desperately save 500 rupees buy his way home eventually i had look up just what 500 rupees is worth u s dollars because it was taking him so long as today 500 rupees equals 7 06 that just astounds me as much as krishna worked scrimped saved he couldnt even save 7 06 this movie was bleak depressing joyless abject poverty child prostitution oppressive police it was heart wrenching movie thats not say movie wasnt good because it was just dont expect many smiles,0.4410256410256411,0.021153846153846148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Extracts an emotional price,"This is the story of eleven-year-old Krishna, left by his mother to work for a circus until he could earn 500 rupees to pay off his brother (who had lied about the debt). But Krishna is soon severed from the circus and goes to the local train station and asks for a ticket to the nearest big city. That city turns out to be Bombay. Once there, Krishna falls in with a band of homeless children who live on the streets. He ekes out a living by taking odd jobs like delivering tea to some locals, plucking chickens, and being a server at a wedding.Given Krishna's situation, he winds up in the less savory part of the city and in the course of his peregrinations his life becomes entangled with pimps, prostitutes, drug addicts, petty thieves, and others of dubious moral quality. We come to know and understand many of these characters in more than a superficial way.All of this may sound a bit depressing and I found it to be so. This film extracts an emotional price and one has to ask if it is worth it and I would say that it is. The movie has the feel of a documentary and, as such, I felt exposed to a world that I would have never encountered in any other way. If we are to understand the world we live in, then every insight into the lives of others is of value.In spite of its rather downbeat tone, there is inspiration to be had here. Krishna is ultimately collared by the law and sent to an institution for homeless kids that is regimented and repressive. In short order he makes a dramatic getaway and the scenes of his running down the streets after his escape are a joyous celebration of his freedom and his independence of spirit. Overall Krishna's reactions to his predicament are a testament to his resourcefulness and will to live. If asked, would Krishna admit to a hard life? Is that a question that would occur to him to ask, or a question more likely to be asked by a Westerner? For an even more gut-wrenching story along the same lines read Rohinton Mistry's novel ""A Fine Balance"" that takes place some twelve years prior to the time of this movie, during the days of the Indian ""Emergency"" of Indira Ghandi.When on the way to the institution in the police van, an older riding companion reaches over and touches Krishna's hair and says, ""It'll be all right. One day ... in our India, things will be all right.""

8.0,Salaam Mira Nair for making India's Best Artistic Chance at Oscars..,"Salaam Bombay (1988) : Brief Review -Salaam Mira Nair for making India's Best Artistic Chance at Oscars. Salaam Bombay was India's 2nd film to recieve Oscar Nomination after Mother India, 1957 (Third was Lagaan in 2001) and undoubtedly it was the only Artistic form which could have made out best shot. Comparatively, Salaam Bombay is much more realistic and hard-hitting than Mother India and Lagaan which walked on commercial filmmaking path (that doesn't make them bad films and i am not referring to anything like that). It is purely a realitic story of One Kid living and struggling in slums, other kids of his age living similar life and some adults who are quite experienced in this low grade world. I tried to think and search for loopholes and goofs in the story but i couldn't find anything. Everything was going so smooth as if it was written in heaven.. So accurate i mean. From costumes to body language and to accent every character is perfectly showcased and presented. Natural act lovers are going to have a blast while watching Salaam Bombay. Nana Patekar, Shafiq Syed, Raghuvir Yadav, Anita Kanwar and rest of the cast along with child artists does something outstanding and natural like rarely before. Background score during the important scenes lifts the impact and somewhere make you think about the philosophy of artistic execution. Dialogues are also damn too realistic, brutal, and hard-hitting. Mira Nair makes a Gem. I don't see any faults to bash her i mean how can she be so perfect with her debut feature film? Salaam Bombay defines the true meaning of Art cinema hence, becomes a Must See for Art Lovers. I thought it would be a slow film cause usually an art film takes time and lacks entertainment but Salaam Bombay is very engaging film. It has some hilarious moments and quotes so even those who are not from Art Lovers category can give it a watch.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",salaam mira nair making indias best artistic chance at oscars,salaam bombay 1988 brief review salaam mira nair making indias best artistic chance at oscars salaam bombay was indias 2nd film recieve oscar nomination after mother india 1957 third was lagaan 2001 undoubtedly it was only artistic form which could have made out best shot comparatively salaam bombay is much more realistic hard hitting than mother india lagaan which walked commercial filmmaking path that doesnt make them bad films i am not referring anything like that it is purely realitic story one kid living struggling slums other kids his age living similar life some adults who are quite experienced this low grade world i tried think search loopholes goofs story but i couldnt find anything everything was going so smooth as if it was written heaven so accurate i mean costumes body language accent every character is perfectly showcased presented natural act lovers are going have blast while watching salaam bombay nana patekar shafiq syed raghuvir yadav anita kanwar rest cast along with child artists does something outstanding natural like rarely before background score during important scenes lifts impact somewhere make you think about philosophy artistic execution dialogues are also damn too realistic brutal hard hitting mira nair makes gem i dont see any faults bash her i mean how can she be so perfect with her debut feature film salaam bombay defines true meaning art cinema hence becomes must see art lovers i thought it would be slow film cause usually art film takes time lacks entertainment but salaam bombay is very engaging film it has some hilarious moments quotes so even those who are not art lovers category can give it watch rating 8 10 by,0.5979583333333334,0.20731547619047622,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,one of the best about India - from India...watch it.,"i have been late in watching it, but after watching it u feel that you can never be late in watching such a movie. The movie is excellent. Perhaps Mira Nair's best. I was particularly moved by the story and the picturization. you see the striking poverty and its madness, but Mira has been brilliant to show life in it. a lost boy in a big city with a dream to get back home, keeps himself in control, while everything around him is so much polluted with drugs, and prostitution. Poverty is never neat, in the movie also it is validly not shown as such. But the innocence and strength of children, and them growing up in such conditions, makes them more enduring than adults. to say the least the movie is all about life. it is there to show that no matter how hard it is, life exists in slums, in poverty, and people are living it. the movie is a collectors item. one of the best about India - from India...watch it.

10.0,Impossibly Real!,"The most striking feature of Salaam Bombay is how real it is. Its hard to imagine how Mira Nair got those street children to act. Every scene in the movie, including the railway platforms and streets, is as real as it can get. This movie is in-your-face lower class India. Although the theme is depressing, Nair boldly presented what actually happens on the streets of Bombay. Any difficulties that you may face in life will seem minuscule in comparison to the unsurmountable challenges faced by Bombay's street children. 'Haunting' is the word that best describes this film. The background score adds very much to the its strength. Think of it as India's Schindler's List; only, this happens everyday in Bombay.

8.0,tough raw poverty,Krishna is abandoned by his mother to work at the circus. She tells him that he can return only after paying 500 rupees for destroying his brother's bike.

He also befriends prostitute Rekha and her daughter Manju. Her husband Baba is a drug dealer and keeps Rekha working. Krishna takes a liking to virginal Sola Saal who is brought in and enticed into prostitution by Baba. There is a raw authenticity to the film. It's unflinging.

10.0,The Slums Of Bombay.,"Whilst recently reading a discussion about Bollywood films that take a serious look at drug abuse,I was excited to find details about a film which seemed to tear all of the Bolltwood glitz & glamour apart,so that it could put a mirror up to the harsh reality behind the shining lights.As I began to read more details about what co-story writer,producer and director Mira Nair had created,I started to hope that I was about to watch something truly special,the I would not forget for a very long time.. The plot:After having a huge falling out with his mother and brother,an 11 year old boy called Krishna is taken to a travailing circus where he is told that until he raises enough money to sort out all the damage that he has done,he must stay away from home and become a worker at a travailing circus.Hoping to raise the cash as fast as possible, Krishna becomes a part of the circus,until one day,after having done an errand, Krishna discovers that the circus has moved on and left him behind.Being left stranded and desperate to raise the cash that he so desperately needs, Krishna uses every penny he's got to get a train ticket to Bombay,in the hope of finding a job that will give him a good wage.Shortly after getting off the train, Krishna runs into a group of street thieves and drug dealers who live near by the cities red light area.Desperate not to be on his own in the extremely intimidating city, Krishna attempts to befriend a gang of kids who are partly being used to sell drugs on the streets for a notorious drug lord/ pimp called Baba Golub.Despite the gang members originally having some doubts over how much they can trust him, Krishna is soon welcomed into the group,thanks to being given a new nickname (Chaipau) and also due to having developed a close bond with an ""elder"" of the gang called Chillum,who along with being a dealer for Golub,is also a drug abuser himself.Wanting to help his new friend to achieve his goal,Chillum helps Krishna to get a job as a low paid-ed tea deliver.Feeling that his luck is finally changing,Krishana sets his eyes on the most beautiful girl that he has ever seen.who he nicknames as ""Sweet Sixteen"".Unknown to Krishna,""Sweet Sixteen"" is actually a girl who has suffered the horror of being trafficked to Bombay,due to Baba Golub and a madam of his suspecting that someone will pay a high price to take the innocent's of the girl away forever.View on the film: Having a quick listen to the DVD commentary for this movie,I was surprised to hear Mira Nair say that she wanted a sense of hope to be always in the background of this tremendous film,so that the movie would not become completely depressing and bleak.Whilst the sparingly used,melodic score by L.Subramiam does allow a sliver of light to occasionally appear,I have to admit that I found the rest of this unforgettable movie to be one of the most depressing films that I have seen in years!.Using her documentary past as a major influence on this particular work,Nair directs the film with an astonishing attention to detail,as she allows the camera to clearly focus on all of the real chaos taking place in the various drug dens and red light areas used as locations in the movie,whilst always making sure that the events that the films characters battle with are always in the centre of the movie.Despite the film having to attempt in drawing the viewer into a new ""world"" and its cast of outcasts in less than 2 hours,the elegant screenplay by Sooni Taraporevala does a fantastic balancing act of moving at a surprising pace whilst also making sure to pause and make each character a distinct individual who's despair and flaws can be seen engulfing their entire lives.Checking for any trivia about the movie on IMDb,I was shocked to discover,that although the film features ""professional"" actors in the lead adult roles, (such as a terrificly menacing performance from Nana Patekar, as the ruthless and cunning Baba Golub)the entire,wonderful child cast of the film was played by street children who Nair had worked with in a number of ""acting workshops"".For the girl who gets Krishna's heart Chanda Sharma gives a mesmerising performance as ""Sweet Sixteen"",who despite having hardly any dialogue is able to show how fragile the girl is,as her innocents gets closer to being shattered into a thousand pieces.Being featured in almost every scene of the film,lead actor Shafiq Syed, (who on the DVD interview,seems to have at last found some happiness in his life,after having sadly attempted suicide a number of times in the past) gives a performance that most ""adult"" actors could only dream of.In the scenes that Syed shares with Krishna's only friend in Bombay,Chillum (played by an amazing Raghuvir Yadav.)Syed displays the perfect mix of being desperate to save his friend from his addictions,whilst also trying his best to not fall into the same nightmare that Chillum has.Nearing the conclusion to this film,Nair brilliantly uses the final moments to solely focus on Syed,With the last shot being completely still,Syed gives the film its devastating knock out blow,as Krishna begins to think about everything that he has lost. Final view on the film:One of the most depressing and most unforgettable films that I have ever seen.",slums bombay,whilst recently reading discussion about bollywood films that take serious look at drug abuse i was excited find details about film which seemed tear all bolltwood glitz glamour apart so that it could put mirror up harsh reality behind shining lights as i began read more details about what co story writer producer director mira nair had created i started hope that i was about watch something truly special i would not forget very long time plot after having huge falling out with his mother brother 11 year old boy called krishna is taken travailing circus where he is told that until he raises enough money sort out all damage that he has done he must stay away home become worker at travailing circus hoping raise cash as fast as possible krishna becomes part circus until one day after having done errand krishna discovers that circus has moved left him behind being left stranded desperate raise cash that he so desperately needs krishna uses every penny hes got get train ticket bombay hope finding job that will give him good wage shortly after getting off train krishna runs into group street thieves drug dealers who live near by cities red light area desperate not be his own extremely intimidating city krishna attempts befriend gang kids who are partly being used sell drugs streets notorious drug lord pimp called baba golub despite gang members originally having some doubts over how much they can trust him krishna is soon welcomed into group thanks being given new nickname chaipau also due having developed close bond with elder gang called chillum who along with being dealer golub is also drug abuser himself wanting help his new friend achieve his goal chillum helps krishna get job as low paid ed tea deliver feeling that his luck is finally changing krishana sets his eyes most beautiful girl that he has ever seen who he nicknames as sweet sixteen unknown krishna sweet sixteen is actually girl who has suffered horror being trafficked bombay due baba golub madam his suspecting that someone will pay high price take innocents girl away forever view film having quick listen dvd commentary this movie i was surprised hear mira nair say that she wanted sense hope be always background this tremendous film so that movie would not become completely depressing bleak whilst sparingly used melodic score by l subramiam does allow sliver light occasionally appear i have admit that i found rest this unforgettable movie be one most depressing films that i have seen years using her documentary past as major influence this particular work nair directs film with astonishing attention detail as she allows camera clearly focus all real chaos taking place various drug dens red light areas used as locations movie whilst always making sure that events that films characters battle with are always centre movie despite film having attempt drawing viewer into new world its cast outcasts less than 2 hours elegant screenplay by sooni taraporevala does fantastic balancing act moving at surprising pace whilst also making sure pause make each character distinct individual whos despair flaws can be seen engulfing their entire lives checking any trivia about movie imdb i was shocked discover that although film features professional actors lead adult roles such as terrificly menacing performance nana patekar as ruthless cunning baba golub entire wonderful child cast film was played by street children who nair had worked with number acting workshops girl who gets krishnas heart chanda sharma gives mesmerising performance as sweet sixteen who despite having hardly any dialogue is able show how fragile girl is as her innocents gets closer being shattered into thousand pieces being featured almost every scene film lead actor shafiq syed who dvd interview seems have at last found some happiness his life after having sadly attempted suicide number times past gives performance that most adult actors could only dream scenes that syed shares with krishnas only friend bombay chillum played by amazing raghuvir yadav syed displays perfect mix being desperate save his friend his addictions whilst also trying his best not fall into same nightmare that chillum has nearing conclusion this film nair brilliantly uses final moments solely focus syed with last shot being completely still syed gives film its devastating knock out blow as krishna begins think about everything that he has lost final view film one most depressing most unforgettable films that i have ever seen,0.5889445289445288,0.09618706368706369,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,A Triple Sundae of Punch in the Guts,"One of the 3 Indian movies to be nominated for an Oscar in over 50 years since the 'Best Foreign Film' category was created, this movie stands out as a tribute to the city of Bombay that houses Bollywood. Brilliantly shot, on a shoe string budget it brings together the 3 aspects of the city we all love and admire - its colors, its chaos and its children.Brilliant camera-work, direction and cinematography clubbed with heart rendering performances from Nana Patekar, Shafiq Syed and Raghuvir Yadav make the movie a 'must-watch' for me. The decrepitude of the city with drugs, prostitution, lawlessness, corruption and apathy of the society towards the kids comes out brilliantly in the film.Shafiq's near flawless portrayal of young Krishna / Chaipau showcases the determination of innocence.The film could have done with some editing and retakes. There are a couple of poorly shot, distracting scenes in which the young actors accidentally stare into the camera, but that is a minor and pardonable flaw, in my eye.The only problem that I see is that it labors a lot to set up the universe and does not move the story forward too much. This is more than made up for by the fantastic setting up of the universe. Another point I would like to make is that it tries to address too many minor themes, which does not do as much justice to the themes as one would have liked. The movie is Hugo, Requiem for a dream, Kaalia (1981) and much more wrapped into one.Mira, however, does not let you lose sight of Krishna and his struggle to get back to his ""mulak"", which to me is a testament to her film making abilities.",triple sundae punch guts,one 3 indian movies be nominated oscar over 50 years since best foreign film category was created this movie stands out as tribute city bombay that houses bollywood brilliantly shot shoe string budget it brings together 3 aspects city we all love admire its colors its chaos its children brilliant camera work direction cinematography clubbed with heart rendering performances nana patekar shafiq syed raghuvir yadav make movie must watch me decrepitude city with drugs prostitution lawlessness corruption apathy society towards kids comes out brilliantly film shafiqs near flawless portrayal young krishna chaipau showcases determination innocence film could have done with some editing retakes there are couple poorly shot distracting scenes which young actors accidentally stare into camera but that is minor pardonable flaw my eye only problem that i see is that it labors lot set up universe does not move story forward too much this is more than made up by fantastic setting up universe another point i would like make is that it tries address too many minor themes which does not do as much justice themes as one would have liked movie is hugo requiem dream kaalia 1981 much more wrapped into one mira however does not let you lose sight krishna his struggle get back his mulak which me is testament her film making abilities,0.5315217391304349,0.33369565217391306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Probably my all-time international favorite!,"This film has haunted me since I saw it in 1988. Mira Nair's production is all-enveloping and makes you feel as though you live within what is for me a completely different lifestyle and place. The saturated colors of the sets alone would have stayed with me these 12 years, but I find that so has the plot, the movement of the camera, and the overall tenor of the work. Probably the only other film that has stayed with me in such detail and with such power is Wim Wenders's _Wings of Desire_, a completely different kind of work.

9.0,"the 400 Blows, Bombay style","The debut feature by Indian filmmaker Mira Nair is a near-seamless blend of social documentary and coming-of-age dramatics, with the uncompromising honesty of the former combined to all the creative emotion of the latter. In this case the end of innocence doesn't present an easy rite of passage for Nair's young protagonist: a resourceful, homeless adolescent forced to grow old before his time in the mean streets and back alleys of modern Bombay. Every scene was shot on location, and the children in the film are actual homeless kids, all of them coached into remarkably natural performances alongside the few professional actors. The result is an unsentimental look at the bitter cycle of poverty and crime in a city where life is given a rare vitality by its dubious worth. Within the community of thieves, junkies, prostitutes, and pimps is a measure of compassion equal to their misery, and Nair is able to convey the stubborn spark of hope clinging to even the most tragic victims of circumstance.
