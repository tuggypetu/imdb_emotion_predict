10.0,My favorite film from Pixar in over five years- Bird and company produce a triumph of a family film,"Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again.",my favorite film pixar over five years bird company produce triumph family film,writer director brad bird here has something that i was caught off guard by just bit i always expect pixar films be above par family entertainment kinds films that can have appeal adults satirical jab side effect by having characters reacting each other as they would film with higher rating whilst giving bright colors action silliness that appeals kids watching incredibles their sixth feature length offering i wasnt so entertained amused since their 98 film bugs life it almost brought me back emotional impact i felt when theater first time getting toy story into my system its film that takes type society that we all know well past theyve done toys bugs monsters undersea life now comic book archetypes transforms it superbly imaginative computer animated landscape this is also credit due brad bird who proved five years ago with his sleeper iron giant that he could transcend genre appeal with heart vigor almost every age bracket so what little touches make incredibles so appealing how it starts deconstruct idea superhero perhaps as well as how family unit is shown usual conventions under unusual funny circumstances as example one our heroes mr incredible k bob parr voiced wonderfully by craig t nelson goes visit woman who fixes creates uniforms superheroes one scene she explains why cape is not good idea this is kind scene that might not make it into most hollywood movies would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too smart kids get but by appealing kind level late teens adults can relate it reaches higher far more intelligent plane fact many best scenes film take what we all know films displaying family unit morph it with power imagination superheroes i wont go too much into plot as some may already have except say that what makes story itself appealing is how it is fully formed story doesnt try sell itself short like other animated films i e sharktale example it also uses its pg rating perimeter wisely bird company create action sequences that are as exciting if not more so than action films that have been released this year fact some scenes climax my money could rival couple those spider man 2 by setting up right emotional bases with characters bob his wife elasti girl holly hunter their kids with supporting characters voiced finitely by likes samuel l jackson jason lee by time high charged internally fantasy scenes take off they take off with great conviction excitement overall incredibles is film that is way what audiences wish they could get rarely do its film with wit observance kind video game where results are not as expectable as can be some kids may not get it as much as adults might which is just as well as it sometimes operates level like antz did only through sphere disney other words if you say teaser trailer which involved out shape mr incredible trying with all his might buckle his tights youll know what film could bring personally i cant wait see it again,0.5457224958949096,0.2409051724137931,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,One of the best films ever made,"17 years after incredibles was released, it continues to be a compelling, entertaining, funny, smart, ambitious, original, mature and just simply enjoyable movie. The dialogue is exceptional and the animation holds up surprisingly well. The characters are well written and very fleshed out. It is an animated film about superheroes and yet the chatacters and world feel so real.It is my favourite pixar film and probably always will be. If you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, stop reading this review and go watch it right now. Infact, even if you've seen it before, just watch it right now.

,"A Truly, Pardon the Pun, Incredible Movie","This is one of the finest animated films I have ever seen. Not only is it a fine animated film, it is a great film period. The film obviously takes its cue from several real life super hero comic books, especially The Fantastic Four and the Justice Society of America. The Fantastic Four comparison is obvious due to the fact that Elatigirl and Violet were obviously inspired by Mr. Fantastic (aka. Reed Richards) and the Invisible Woman (aka. Sue Storm Richards) respectively. The J.S.A. influence is a little more obscure. Several years ago, DC Comics issued a mini-series that attempted to explain the demise of the Justice Society by claiming that the group was forced to disband after their loyalty to America was questioned during the 1950's. In this film, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation.",truly pardon pun incredible movie,this is one finest animated films i have ever seen not only is it fine animated film it is great film period film obviously takes its cue several real life super hero comic books especially fantastic four justice society america fantastic four comparison is obvious due fact that elatigirl violet were obviously inspired by mr fantastic aka reed richards invisible woman aka sue storm richards respectively j s influence is little more obscure several years ago dc comics issued mini series that attempted explain demise justice society by claiming that group was forced disband after their loyalty america was questioned during 1950s this film all heroes were forced into hiding after government refused pay wrongful legal claims brought against super heroes this film also there are many jokes that casual viewer might not get but that made it enjoyable comic book fans this island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many series produced by gerry anderson 1960s eg thunderbirds captain scarlet another thing that made this film unique was its look if you notice city where story takes place looks like fairly modern metropolis however if you look at cars film most them look as if they would have been more at home mid late 1960s also way that many characters were dressed also could have put them that time however thing that i really loved about this film was fact that even though it was geared primarily children it was dark enough theme appeal adults fact there are couple scenes that you wouldnt normally associate with film geared towards children this film is definitely classic animation once again pixar shows why they are masters computer animation,0.5132113821138211,0.21737804878048783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.22}"
9.0,Charming and fun,"Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars",charming fun,shortly after dreamworks screwed up with uninspired shark tale pixar contains its remarkably success story with incredibles while i have say that i liked finding nemo bit better incredibles is still amazing movie first all this is because its funny its not so funny that youre constantly laughing out loud but there are more than enough good jokes movie keep you entertained its full good observations about superhero movies note all ridiculous superhero villain names references other movies its also brilliant james bond spoof homage containing all gadgets secret island bases crazy schemes that made early bond movies so much fun secondly this movie has heart charm droves its full memorably likable characters you can really identify with care about characters like edna are instant classics voice acting is universally excellent but holly hunter steals show as elastigirl this is movie that doesnt need toilet humor characters modeled like celebrities or hip soundtrack it easily succeeds charm style alone also i found it be surprisingly good action movie plentiful action sequences are full energy extremely fast paced exciting put many live action movie shame finally i also liked tone message movie incredibles basically makes plea against mediocrity breaking with politically correct idea that everybody is special thus nobody really is encouraging people use talents they have been given i think this couldnt be more true not all people are equally talented just compare pixar dreamworks but this is no reason keep talented people not reaching their full potential just because it makes less talented ones feel bad incredibles while maybe not as hilarious as i had hoped though its still very funny is nonetheless extremely entertaining movie that manages charm you wit its combination great characters lots style tongue cheek attitude good message highly recommended 1 2 stars,0.5546630036630039,0.26031035631035626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,"Wonderful, beautiful to watch, all in all, incredible.","WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying ""That's the Incredibles movie"" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible.",wonderful beautiful watch all all incredible,wow what movie i can honestly say this is my top ten movies all time how do pixar continue out do themselves at every movie release incredibles is fantastic story wonderfully scripted with most stunning animation you have ever seen it provides perfectly rounded story with plenty action laughs almost tears basically this is story man encountering mid life crisis leaping headlong into it without care or thought his family proving exceedingly selfish failing see good his life meanwhile wife is left try look after family really thats story now what pixar have done is drop idea that parents are superheroes banned being super many years previously by government people trying live normal life add mix that some their children have inherited their own powers that super villains are planning comeback you have this wonderful movie i cant begin convey how wonderful animation is its perfect i mean youll always be looking at it knowing its animation but when story takes you along youll suddenly realize youre still watching animation subtle difference is that you forget there are parts instance when father is cheering his son during race that you actually think it is real effects water fire two hardest things recreate animation lava are wonderful watch caught me drawing breath when i first saw them characters acting are wonderful you will find yourself caring about them as real people at some points i could feel big swallow coming up wavering adams apple obviously due food earlier nothing do with movie i often find that movies arent paced well that they either have too long or too short introduction characters or events that lead up pivotal point movie are unbalanced against climax all sorts combinations not here this move is perfect well balanced story takes you along just when you are ready there were no points where i wished we could move or something could happen quicker my only frustration were at kids this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would it was interesting see comparisons links other famous superheroes through comic lore definitely with nods fantastic four silver surfer huge nods watchmen my only concern is that there is so much similarity watchmen that those who havent read graphic novel will be saying thats incredibles movie when watchmen finally comes fruition short film showing before this was wonderful itself had audience laughing out loud loads excellent once again outdoes every short that theyve produced before boundin was beautifully animated wonderfully told guaranteed bring huge big smile your face all all i think this movie is perfect truly incredible,0.6308449074074073,0.3491740319865319,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,"Dahling, dahling, dahling.... this movie is incredible","I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, ""The Iron Giant"", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.RATING: ***** out of *****.",dahling dahling dahling this movie is incredible,i hope that this movie does really well because this has be one best animated movies i have ever seen story is really cool its obvious that there is lot respect here source superheroes whether it be comic books serial flicks or saturday morning cartoons movie has undeniably cool retro feel it it shows not only design picture but also music which definitely sounds like something out 60s 007 flick it is also unusually dark especially pixar flick im not saying its dark where people are getting their heads delivered someone box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where i found myself wondering if little kid might be able deal with intensity what was going screen maybe it was fact that heroes were very real danger most time bad guys werent out catch them as much as they were out kill them when you discover who films villain is you can literally feel his anger coming off screen i may be over exaggerating bit but then again it really is films credit that it deals with human emotions way that it does even though you are watching film that is populated by cgi characters emotions they convey what they say do come across as purely believable whether watching bob parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true me just feeling it everything about this movie has very concrete feel it even while looking like something youd see comic book computer graphics general were absolutely amazing voice acting is excellent across board so good fact that i really cant pick favorite entire cast i have say that craig t nelson holly hunter were very good as mr incredible elastigirl respectively they had moment near end film that actually touched me but you can see that yourselves samuel l jackson was hilarious thankfully he wasnt overused dash violet were realized so well that every time they came up screen i loved every minute it dash particular was one funniest characters movie jason lee made formidable villain as syndrome i loved fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware conventions surrounding such role like when he chides himself monologuing he was also one ruthless bastard ill give him that even bit part characters were hilarious there was kid tricycle this movie who comes out twice made me laugh out loud both times fact this movie reminds me why i like finding nemo over monsters inc finding nemo not only are main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind impression you remember all characters that marlin dory ran into their adventures together course you do whether it was that crazy pelican with australian accent willem dafoe as gill leader fishtank crew or bruce shark you remember them after all is said done it makes viewing experience that much richer thats exactly how incredibles is every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you some way i have admit that i was laughing myself throughout entire movie especially with character edna mode who almost steals movie man even end credits are awesome i have give director brad bird big thumbs up this one he pulled it off hopefully this will attract attention his other animated film iron giant which was sadly overlooked when it was released is also really great film all all i cant recommend this movie enough i left very satisfied felt no need compare this rest pixars movies this one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year rightfully deserves its place among best animated movies all time rating out,0.5515570175438597,0.2005811403508772,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Truly Incredible,"I finally saw Pixar/Disney's ""The Incredibles"" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow ""Supers"" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.We catch up 15 years later with Mr. Incredible, now just Bob Parr, insurance claim adjuster. He is suffering. His wife Helen, the former Elasticgirl, is busy getting settled in their new home with their kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and little Jack Jack. Violet and Dash have super powers, and Jack Jack is not yet toilet trained. Bob is totally frustrated by his job, and really the lie he is forced to live. Every week he and fellow Super, Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), on their ""bowling"" night, listen to the police radio band so that they can save people in danger. Mild mannered life is killing Bob. He tells Helen regarding Dash's 4th grade graduation, that they keep ""creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity"".One day Bob is contacted by the mysterious, Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), enlisting his super powers for an undisclosed benefactor. Bob, still super strong, no longer has the six pack abdominals. He proceeds to train and trim the waistline. He sees his suit designer, Edna 'E' Mode (Brad Bird), to fix his super suit. In a hilarious exchange, E enrolls Mr. Incredible in a new suit, sans cape. It is disclosed that the benefactor is villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee). Turns out that Mr. Incredible was the one responsible for Syndrome's genesis when he invalidated the young Syndrome 15 years ago. Thus, we have the classic Superhero tale of conflict and revenge.What also distinguishes ""The Incredibles"" along with the story about reclaiming greatness, is that it is about family. In a very touching scene when Mr. Incredible is about to do battle with the seemingly invincible Omnidroid, he admits to Helen ""...I'm not strong enough..."" Having super powers is great. Having the love of family is truly powerful. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. He is bold, funny, and endearingly vulnerable. Holly Hunter is solid and folksy as Helen, who also projects a quiet power. Jason Lee is at his annoying best as Syndrome. Brad Bird as 'E' steals every scene that she is in. Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is amazing to look at, and also has something special and touching to say.",truly incredible,i finally saw pixar disneys incredibles after several scheduling glitches writer director brad birds incredibles is truly incredible it is one best movies year cgi animation is both cutting edge simply stunning like all pixar projects it has solid story as its foundation bird uses superhero mythology tell funny poignant story that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness we are not being true ourselves more importantly it is disservice those around us as story begins mr incredible craig t nelson was superheros superhero as voiced by nelson mr incredible is very confident verge cocky he uses his super strength powers good he marries super elasticgirl holly hunter however mr incredible soon falls victim like his fellow supers plight our litigious society people they save are suing them instead getting malpractice insurance which would have been different movie persecuted prosecuted supers assume their secret identities covert government relocation program they also promise never use their powers again even good we catch up 15 years later with mr incredible now just bob parr insurance claim adjuster he is suffering his wife helen former elasticgirl is busy getting settled their new home with their kids violet sarah vowell dash spencer fox little jack jack violet dash have super powers jack jack is not yet toilet trained bob is totally frustrated by his job really lie he is forced live every week he fellow super lucius best aka frozone samuel l jackson their bowling night listen police radio band so that they can save people danger mild mannered life is killing bob he tells helen regarding dashs 4th grade graduation that they keep creating new ways celebrate mediocrity one day bob is contacted by mysterious mirage elizabeth pena enlisting his super powers undisclosed benefactor bob still super strong no longer has six pack abdominals he proceeds train trim waistline he sees his suit designer edna e mode brad bird fix his super suit hilarious exchange e enrolls mr incredible new suit sans cape it is disclosed that benefactor is villain syndrome jason lee turns out that mr incredible was one responsible syndromes genesis when he invalidated young syndrome 15 years ago thus we have classic superhero tale conflict revenge what also distinguishes incredibles along with story about reclaiming greatness is that it is about family very touching scene when mr incredible is about do battle with seemingly invincible omnidroid he admits helen im not strong enough having super powers is great having love family is truly powerful craig t nelson is perfect as mr incredible he is bold funny endearingly vulnerable holly hunter is solid folksy as helen who also projects quiet power jason lee is at his annoying best as syndrome brad bird as e steals every scene that she is director brad birds incredibles is amazing look at also has something special touching say,0.606104481104481,0.30234365859365864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8.0,Good Entertainemt For About Any Age,"This was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004. Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it.

10.0,"Very predictable, but very lovable at the same time","Yes, I've seen this story a million times. I'm also not a very big fan of Disney and Pixar together, but this time they got me hooked. After fearing to rent this, many of my friends convinced me that I should take a look at it. So, I did and feel in love with it.The effects, I feel like today, there are way too many fancy computer effect movies. But it works with ""The Incredibles"" because that's half the humor with it. There are some very reconizable voices in there that you know very well.Is this just a kid's movie? No, it does contain some adult humor. I can see with parents taking their kids to the theater, it has to be somewhat enjoyable to adults too. So as a family or whether you have children or little relatives, I would recommend this movie for you guys. It is very enjoyable and fun to watch.10/10",very predictable but very lovable at same time,yes ive seen this story million times im also not very big fan disney pixar together but this time they got me hooked after fearing rent this many my friends convinced me that i should take look at it so i did feel love with it effects i feel like today there are way too many fancy computer effect movies but it works with incredibles because thats half humor with it there are some very reconizable voices there that you know very well is this just kids movie no it does contain some adult humor i can see with parents taking their kids theater it has be somewhat enjoyable adults too so as family or whether you have children or little relatives i would recommend this movie you guys it is very enjoyable fun watch 10 10,0.41657264957264956,0.2323888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,"Pixar's most ""epic"" animated film since ""Toy Story.""","Although ""The Incredibles"" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995's ""Toy Story,"" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see ""Toy Story"" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as ""Terminator 2"": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.""Monsters, Inc."" wasn't quite as epic. It was a great movie, just as good as ""Toy Story,"" but it didn't have the same style per se. ""Finding Nemo"" was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as ""Toy Story."" (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just different.) ""The Incredibles"" seemed to. I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop, the laughs aplenty, and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous. For this reason, somehow, it reminded me very much of ""Toy Story."" It seemed like older Pixar, rather than some of their newer stuff (all of which is great as well). Pixar has yet to make a bad movie. Even their worst -- ""A Bug's Life"" -- was better than most animated films.""The Incredibles"" also returns to the spoof roots of ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Toy Story"" (something ""Finding Nemo"" did but not as often) -- it parodies cultural references. (Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure.) Although this is a family film, it is NOT a ""children's film."" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in ""The Incredibles"" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he ""didn't want to be saved."" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day. (Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot. A true story!) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but ""The Incredibles"" does.Similarly, using superheroes, Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals. (Such as eating at the dinner table -- the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do, only because she has superpowers, it's a bit... different.) All in all ""The Incredibles"" really is a great animated film. I enjoyed it more than ""Finding Nemo"" (which I didn't expect to as I loved ""Nemo"") and just as much as ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making -- the cultural parody animated film -- and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as ""Shrek"" and ""Shark Tale"" (which featured many cultural references as well).All in all ""The Incredibles"" is incredibly fun. And funny.",pixars most epic animated film since toy story,although incredibles is not best film pixar has released via disney since 1995s toy story i felt it is most epic when i went go see toy story 1995 epic scale picture non stop frantic pace action sequences etc were all so breathtaking that it contained same tour de force attitude as believe it or not blockbuster such as terminator 2 crowd pleasing overwhelming picture monsters inc wasnt quite as epic it was great movie just as good as toy story but it didnt have same style per se finding nemo was very good as well but still didnt capture same epic scale as toy story im not saying thats bad thing just different incredibles seemed i saw it dvd beginning end action is non stop laughs aplenty exotic locations action hero references continuous this reason somehow it reminded me very much toy story it seemed like older pixar rather than some their newer stuff all which is great as well pixar has yet make bad movie even their worst bugs life was better than most animated films incredibles also returns spoof roots monsters inc toy story something finding nemo did but not as often it parodies cultural references something hard do underwater sea adventure although this is family film it is not childrens film that is evident beginning when fake news reel incredibles features articles about suicidal man suing superheroes because he didnt want be saved this is clearly tongue cheek criticism shameless legal standards day such as woman who sued mcdonalds because her coffee was too hot true story another film might not be clever enough integrate iconic cultural references into itself but incredibles does similarly using superheroes pixar examines at home relationship family spoofs our own rituals such as eating at dinner table mom tries stop squabbling kids just like we do only because she has superpowers its bit different all all incredibles really is great animated film i enjoyed it more than finding nemo which i didnt expect as i loved nemo just as much as toy story monsters inc pixar has solidified new style family film making cultural parody animated film evidence this can be seen such take offs formula as shrek shark tale which featured many cultural references as well all all incredibles is incredibly fun funny,0.5031378299120234,0.1814198435972629,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Amazing! Brilliant! Fabulous! Wonderful! Astonishing! I'm not avoiding using a certain word!,"The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.9/10",amazing brilliant fabulous wonderful astonishing im not avoiding using certain word,incredibles is great film probably my favourite pixar picture toy story is best but thats different favourite it takes while properly get into action but when it does it delivers it spades thats exactly it i would actually call incredibles animated action film because be honest i dont think there was enough comedy call it animated action comedy film there are quite few funny moments but gags dont come as fast as finding nemo or toy story that being said it does have truly amazing action set pieces brilliant voice acting fabulous script wonderful characters animation is simply well incredible music is definitely stand out it actually made me smile with its jazzy tones james bond type scores one greatest things about incredibles is that its not kiddies film its completely different all other pixar films they bring out tommy guns second scene crying out loud if you want see more adult animated film then go see incredibles enjoy every minute but i wouldnt bring someone younger than 4 maybe because it isnt really aimed at them they probably would find it quite scary this is great film one best 2004 my opinion if it just had slightly higher gag rate than this would be absolutely perfect picture 9 10,0.539437689969605,0.33062310030395137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Another Smash Hit for Pixar,"It's tough to be a superhero and not be allowed to manifest your prowess due to a lawsuit which has made you go into a ""superhero protection program"" and live the life of an Average Joe.This is the case of Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible as he is also known. Living in marital complacency in suburbia with his wife Helen, also known as Elastigirl and his three kids, he works as a mindless office drone who needs to support his family and occasionally gets together with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone and tries to fight small crime.Until one day when he gets called on a special assignment in a remote location which leads him smack into the lair of a former fan, now turned arch-nemesis, Syndrome, who has an interest in destroying the world and also destroying his family.What could have been a by-the-numbers story is enhanced by much of the ""performances"", or rather, the way the characters are made to interact to one another as per the screenplay. Bob and Helen are clearly in love even though their glory years as superheros (they believe) are over. Bob frets that he's become this paunchy bear of a man, Helen now has to multi-task since she is raising three children, each with a personality of their own, each with superpowers of their own.I find it interesting to see how their kids also are given distinct personalities: Dash has the restless spark that his superpowers will require him to have and Violet is as close to channeling Lydia Dietz from Beetlejuice as possible -- shy, goth, and starting to develop her powers of invisibility and create force fields but beset by feelings of insecurity. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, has his moments, mainly caused by typical baby tantrums and in a crucial point, sheer fear. And this is where the script works: it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers and would treat them as any kid would.Brad Bird has in his hands an excellent, humanized tale of superheroes that borrows liberally from the Fantastic Four and takes it into an Ozzie and Harriet setting. He's created a movie that is tricky: while animated, it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable for children, such as Bob Parr going through his identity crisis, for example. At the same time, this is the first time that a film has broken grounds in its background animation. While the people are seen as cartoons, the locations are something else and have the look and feel of actual scenery. It's the first time water looks like water; that made me almost feel like reach out and touching the screen.Much of the credit in establishing the characters are the voices used. Craig T. Nelson brings a beautiful masculinity to Bob Parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder Jeramy Freeman. Holly Hunter's voice makes Helen spunky, resourceful, feminist but devoted at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson brings his own star power into Lucius Best and the scenes involving his wife at a tense moment is side-splitting and cheerfully stereotypical. And what Bird himself does with his own rendition of Edith Head is nothing short of camp heaven.In short, excellent family entertainment with a smart spin on what becomes of superheros once their fifteen minutes of fame are over.",another smash hit pixar,its tough be superhero not be allowed manifest your prowess due lawsuit which has made you go into superhero protection program live life average joe this is case bob parr mr incredible as he is also known living marital complacency suburbia with his wife helen also known as elastigirl his three kids he works as mindless office drone who needs support his family occasionally gets together with his buddy lucius best frozone tries fight small crime until one day when he gets called special assignment remote location which leads him smack into lair former fan now turned arch nemesis syndrome who has interest destroying world also destroying his family what could have been by numbers story is enhanced by much performances or rather way characters are made interact one another as per screenplay bob helen are clearly love even though their glory years as superheros they believe are over bob frets that hes become this paunchy bear man helen now has multi task since she is raising three children each with personality their own each with superpowers their own i find it interesting see how their kids also are given distinct personalities dash has restless spark that his superpowers will require him have violet is as close channeling lydia dietz beetlejuice as possible shy goth starting develop her powers invisibility create force fields but beset by feelings insecurity even jack jack baby has his moments mainly caused by typical baby tantrums crucial point sheer fear this is where script works it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers would treat them as any kid would brad bird has his hands excellent humanized tale superheroes that borrows liberally fantastic four takes it into ozzie harriet setting hes created movie that is tricky while animated it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable children such as bob parr going through his identity crisis example at same time this is first time that film has broken grounds its background animation while people are seen as cartoons locations are something else have look feel actual scenery its first time water looks like water that made me almost feel like reach out touching screen much credit establishing characters are voices used craig t nelson brings beautiful masculinity bob parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder jeramy freeman holly hunters voice makes helen spunky resourceful feminist but devoted at same time samuel l jackson brings his own star power into lucius best scenes involving his wife at tense moment is side splitting cheerfully stereotypical what bird himself does with his own rendition edith head is nothing short camp heaven short excellent family entertainment with smart spin what becomes superheros once their fifteen minutes fame are over,0.5230311355311354,0.185780192030192,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,It really is incredible.,"'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived.

8.0,"Excellent Pixar film, not the best one, but still very good!","I wasn't expecting The Incredibles to be as good as it was, it was inventive, funny and original, all the things that I look for in an animated film. I don't think it is Pixar's best, that's Toy Story, but it's certainly not the weakest, that's Cars though that was a worthy film as well. The animation is spot on, and just adds to the inventive feel of the film, and is helped enormously by an innovative plot that is the source of the film's originality. The story is very fast-paced, if perhaps a little slow to begin with, and the script is filled with humour to satisfy even the fussiest child. The characters are very well-done, thanks to the excellent voice cast, standouts are Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, and My Name is Earl's Jason Lee is a big surprise as the villain Syndrome. Brad Bird's Edna was a hoot too. The film however, does have two flaws, it is overlong and sometimes drags consequently, and it is a little too violent at times, the last half-hour especially. Overall, an excellent family film, not perfect, but anybody who's seen some of the Disney direct to video sequels, save one or two exceptions will agree that the Incredibles does a much better job at entertaining than they did. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",excellent pixar film not best one but still very good,i wasnt expecting incredibles be as good as it was it was inventive funny original all things that i look animated film i dont think it is pixars best thats toy story but its certainly not weakest thats cars though that was worthy film as well animation is spot just adds inventive feel film is helped enormously by innovative plot that is source films originality story is very fast paced if perhaps little slow begin with script is filled with humour satisfy even fussiest child characters are very well done thanks excellent voice cast standouts are craig t nelson holly hunter my name is earls jason lee is big surprise as villain syndrome brad birds edna was hoot too film however does have two flaws it is overlong sometimes drags consequently it is little too violent at times last half hour especially overall excellent family film not perfect but anybody whos seen some disney direct video sequels save one or two exceptions will agree that incredibles does much better job at entertaining than they did 8 10 bethany cox,0.6271587301587299,0.2493174603174603,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,An Amazing Message Over Looked,"I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply ""too grown up"" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it's suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn't do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don't feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don't believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop's Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don't cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don't trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.The Incredibles does not shy away from being real; it has an amazing message for both adults and children. The message I saw over and over again in the movie but could not find in a single review was how society was oppressing people to be no better than someone else. We seem to be headed towards embracing mediocrity, Harrison Bergeron, the short story by Kurt Vonnegut that was later turned into a film with Sean Astin, is the perfect example of someone smart being held back because it would hurt the dumb kids feelings to know there was someone better than them. The Incredible's attacks this head on, in one scene the villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who has no real super powers but invents rocket shoes and remote controlled robots, tells Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) that he plans on killing all the truly empowered people and, using his inventions, become the only super hero until he's had his fun, at which time he will sell his inventions allowing everyone to become special ""which of course means no one will be"".Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have three children. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) can make herself invisible but only uses it to hide from a boy she likes, she's been broken down in spirit to feel like there is something horribly wrong with her and that she should be ashamed for being empowered with this amazing gift, to her it is a curse. Violet's younger brother Dash (Spencer Fox) on the other hand is angry with not being allowed to play in sports, because of his super speed, even though he promises not to show off. Their character development is some of the most in depth I've seen for ""children"" in a film, in part because it's real, they face death and failure and they rise above their shame and anger to become real heroes.This movie is funny, it was honest, and it was one of the best films of the year. There is real development, there are real issues and real messages and at the end of the film I wanted to find the super hero in myself. I don't see why we should deny younger people, our children, the right to see something that is so beautiful just because of its honesty.",amazing message over looked,i am tired reading reviews about how animated film is too violent children deals with mature issues like segregation or death or is simply too grown up small children since when did we decide water down truth children when exactly are they old enough certain issues why is it animation means its suppose be children animation has allowed movie makers break molds has allowed them do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations we use cgi accomplish effects we otherwise couldnt do why is art illustration not considered same level as art computer graphics i dont feel that just because something is made children it should be dumbed down i dont believe that adult is too superior watching something that is animated stories geared toward children such as aesops fables or fairy tales brothers grimm hans christian anderson were told teach life lessons dont cry wolf be happy with what you have dont trust strangers these are lessons stories that were not watered down that showed what evil depths greed slothfulness envy just name few could take hold person incredibles does not shy away being real it has amazing message both adults children message i saw over over again movie but could not find single review was how society was oppressing people be no better than someone else we seem be headed towards embracing mediocrity harrison bergeron short story by kurt vonnegut that was later turned into film with sean astin is perfect example someone smart being held back because it would hurt dumb kids feelings know there was someone better than them incredibles attacks this head one scene villain syndrome voiced by jason lee who has no real super powers but invents rocket shoes remote controlled robots tells mr incredible craig t nelson that he plans killing all truly empowered people using his inventions become only super hero until hes had his fun at which time he will sell his inventions allowing everyone become special which course means no one will be mr incredible his wife elastigirl holly hunter have three children daughter violet sarah vowell can make herself invisible but only uses it hide boy she likes shes been broken down spirit feel like there is something horribly wrong with her that she should be ashamed being empowered with this amazing gift her it is curse violets younger brother dash spencer fox other hand is angry with not being allowed play sports because his super speed even though he promises not show off their character development is some most depth ive seen children film part because its real they face death failure they rise above their shame anger become real heroes this movie is funny it was honest it was one best films year there is real development there are real issues real messages at end film i wanted find super hero myself i dont see why we should deny younger people our children right see something that is so beautiful just because its honesty,0.4826438267614738,0.10661764705882353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Incredible in every sense of it!,"""The Incredibles"" is by far and away the most mature and engaging Pixar film to date. This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant""). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, ""The Incredibles"" is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama. However, the aspect most evident in ""The Incredibles"" that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a ""normal"" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterization. ""The Incredibles"" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film.

The dad is supper strong, the mother can stretch like taffy, and the teenage girl can become invisible and throw up force fields and the 10 year old is lightening fast, which is quiet lucky when they must come up against the rich, genius of the villainous Syndrome, who seeks to destroy the hero he once worshipped in Mr. Incredible and an the whole city along with him. Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable.

10.0,Lives up to its name,"On the face of it this may look like it is very much a film for children that will have little appeal to adults unless they are watching it with their children; this however would be a mistake as it has a good story that adults can enjoy too. Some aspects are clearly aimed at the adult viewer such as obvious references to James Bond, these are done in a way that people who don't see the reference won't get the impression that they are missing something.The film opens fifteen years ago in a world where superheroes routinely fight crime and protect the population... until the population is fed up with paying to repair all the damage they do while fighting crime. Banned from using their powers they are forced to hie their super powers and live regular lives. Back in the present Mr Incredible is working in an insurance office by day and sneaking off with his old friend Frozone to fight crime by night... while his wife Helen, formally Elastigirl believes he is just bowling. After one such outing he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who offers him a chance to use his powers again in service of the government. He thinks he can hide this from his wife but she spots that his costume has been repaired and contacts the designer Edna 'E' Mode who tells her that not only did she repair it but also made him another. Helen goes to see her and while there learns that her husband has been captured; she must go to his rescue, accompanied by their two children who stowed away on her plane... luckily they have powers that will help rescue their father from Syndrome, his former number one fan who has gone somewhat insane and makes up for his own lack of powers with an array of gadgets.Pixar did a great job making this film, making the characters feel believable even though they are animated superheroes. The story was fairly gripping and there was a sense of danger... we were shown that Syndrome had already killed several other ""Supers"". Some parents might not be too keen on the fact that some people die, including a few in an amusing scene about the dangers of wearing a cape, none of these deaths are likely to scare children though. I would certainly recommend this film to anybody wanting to see a well made film with a good story and nothing to offend.",lives up its name,face it this may look like it is very much film children that will have little appeal adults unless they are watching it with their children this however would be mistake as it has good story that adults can enjoy too some aspects are clearly aimed at adult viewer such as obvious references james bond these are done way that people who dont see reference wont get impression that they are missing something film opens fifteen years ago world where superheroes routinely fight crime protect population until population is fed up with paying repair all damage they do while fighting crime banned using their powers they are forced hie their super powers live regular lives back present mr incredible is working insurance office by day sneaking off with his old friend frozone fight crime by night while his wife helen formally elastigirl believes he is just bowling after one such outing he is contacted by mysterious mirage who offers him chance use his powers again service government he thinks he can hide this his wife but she spots that his costume has been repaired contacts designer edna e mode who tells her that not only did she repair it but also made him another helen goes see her while there learns that her husband has been captured she must go his rescue accompanied by their two children who stowed away her plane luckily they have powers that will help rescue their father syndrome his former number one fan who has gone somewhat insane makes up his own lack powers with array gadgets pixar did great job making this film making characters feel believable even though they are animated superheroes story was fairly gripping there was sense danger we were shown that syndrome had already killed several other supers some parents might not be too keen fact that some people die including few amusing scene about dangers wearing cape none these deaths are likely scare children though i would certainly recommend this film anybody wanting see well made film with good story nothing offend,0.4824079161579163,0.1434671115921116,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,"Pixar's second best movie, but only just...","Nemo just slightly edges this out for me, but this movie is great just the same. It is filled with the kind of things that makes a life long superhero nerd smile and laugh. This is the story of a family of superheros that have adapted to civilian life. The reason for this? As the world became more litigious, people that were hurt collaterally by superheros started to sue for their injuries. This plot device is genius because it is so very believable. After years in retirement Bob Parr, AKA Mr. Incredible gets recruited for a mission by a mysterious person. Of course the person that recruits Bob has nefarious intentions, and unleashes a seemingly indestructible machine on the world. It is us the the Parrs, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, along with the family friend Frozone to save the day. I love that they cast Sam Jackson in the role as Frozone, because his super power is making ice, and Sam Jackson is the coolest MF out there.

8.0,"Puts the ""in"" credible.","In every review of *The Incredibles*, it has become a refrain: ""This movie could have worked as well in real life."" Big Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is a cone-shaped mountain of a guy, an ex-superhero doing time as a layperson in a world gone small  from his office cubicle to his aspirations. Married to superheroine, Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), like every husband, he sneaks out at night occasionally to hang with the boys  in Bob's case, to fight crime as Mr. Incredible with his former teammate, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).Bob's two kids have inherited superpowers as well: son, Dash, super speed and daughter, Violet, telepathy and invisibility (think Phoenix from the X-Men). (A discussion on how the genetic combination of super-strength and elasticity in the parents would yield super-speed and invisibility in the offspring would get us nowhere.) This 3D-animation marvel is separated from its peers by its thematic thunder - sure, it gives us the usual ""familial values,"" but digs deeper by making the characters smart enough to ponder their roles as super beings in a mediocre world. The parents know that provincialism denotes they must keep their powers/identities hidden and their children sheltered, but the kids don't understand why, raising Socratic questions about herd mentality and the conundrum of being ""created equal"" yet more gifted. Mom tells Dash, ""Everyone's special"" (which is its own special form of condescension) and Dash, instead of taking it like a Disney knockout punch  as most kids in these ""family"" movies are inculcated to accept  retorts (quite logically), ""Which is another way of saying that nobody is."" And when the action comes, it delivers in ways that even some live-action superhero movies do not. And by this I mean, the whole group uses their powers efficiently and intelligently, working together to combat their threats, rather than getting taken down by some inane plot point which they could have easily escaped simply by being themselves.And of course, there is the mandatory Group Hero Pose, perfected so gaily by N'Sync during their two-month heyday. (Apologies to my more sensitive readers for using the ""N-word."") Jason Lee voices the villain, Syndrome, whom the family team must combat to Save The Day.Written and directed by Brad Bird (who does triple duty as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for the hero-conscious), the humor is wit, rather than slapstick, the heroism is moral rather than muscle-bound and the whole outlook is adult rather than kiddie - *The Incredibles* is as real a movie as a cartoon gets.",puts credible,every review incredibles it has become refrain this movie could have worked as well real life big bob parr voice craig t nelson is cone shaped mountain guy ex superhero doing time as layperson world gone small his office cubicle his aspirations married superheroine elastigirl voice holly hunter like every husband he sneaks out at night occasionally hang with boys bobs case fight crime as mr incredible with his former teammate frozone samuel l jackson bobs two kids have inherited superpowers as well son dash super speed daughter violet telepathy invisibility think phoenix x men discussion how genetic combination super strength elasticity parents would yield super speed invisibility offspring would get us nowhere this 3d animation marvel is separated its peers by its thematic thunder sure it gives us usual familial values but digs deeper by making characters smart enough ponder their roles as super beings mediocre world parents know that provincialism denotes they must keep their powers identities hidden their children sheltered but kids dont understand why raising socratic questions about herd mentality conundrum being created equal yet more gifted mom tells dash everyones special which is its own special form condescension dash instead taking it like disney knockout punch as most kids these family movies are inculcated accept retorts quite logically which is another way saying that nobody is when action comes it delivers ways that even some live action superhero movies do not by this i mean whole group uses their powers efficiently intelligently working together combat their threats rather than getting taken down by some inane plot point which they could have easily escaped simply by being themselves course there is mandatory group hero pose perfected so gaily by nsync during their two month heyday apologies my more sensitive readers using n word jason lee voices villain syndrome whom family team must combat save day written directed by brad bird who does triple duty as edna mode fashion designer hero conscious humor is wit rather than slapstick heroism is moral rather than muscle bound whole outlook is adult rather than kiddie incredibles is as real movie as cartoon gets,0.49090458152958144,0.19576241309195852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,INCREDIBLY!!!! Creative!!,"This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term ""entertaining"" in it's most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male's eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible's best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero's lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in ""The Incredibles"" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since ""The Simpsons"". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! ""The Incredibles"" is not just a kid's film, or an overgrown adolescent's film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!",incredibly creative,this website has ranked this film be one top 250 films ever made you want know something i totally agree with this verdict this high definition surreal film by master animation walt disney evoked successful culmination cinematic brilliance myriad artistic production levels accomplishment like this epitomizes term entertaining its most resounding form evaluating initial premise this film it compounds dilemma proverbial glory days being thing past guy who was football hero his school days whereby it was routine score four touchdowns game eventually it fades due knee injury or being out shape or something this signifies that his best days are over when former head cheerleader who was starlight every males eye who counted her good looks she loses them her best days are over as well so too is case family superheroes who leaped through buildings at single bound vigilante crusade capture nefarious criminals ultimately their vicarious damage buildings citizens meant that municipality had insulate itself any further pecuniary culpability relocate them this would seemingly suggest that incredibles best days are behind them also as is case with so many has beens end result winds up being case breadwinner getting relegated monotonous plight inane job such as insurance salesman such mediocrity reduces mr mrs state being sedentary overly mortgaged this movie depicts how even family manufactured stick people representing world fantasy cannot hide afflictions mid life crises ultimate undoing these superheros lives are non visceral elements banality such as indemnity forms traffic jams paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust just as someone wants be star football player or head cheerleader all over again these incredibles wish return their exciting lives as superheroes who took capital crime such plot is very innovative writing this dressed up doggerel entertainment was remarkable this movie has succinctly homogeneous blend voices which induce appropriately heinous cacophony emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance despair sound effects were outstanding this movie cinematography incredibles was superb middle class hang ups have been injected into teenage movies television ever since simpsons this trademark domestic rancor is purposes appealing broader audience range i found this film be ingenious use satire while mastering digitalized analog intelligent caricatures incredibles is not just kids film or overgrown adolescents film it is everybody family was called incredibles movie is called fantastic,0.5313392857142857,0.2718105158730159,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
