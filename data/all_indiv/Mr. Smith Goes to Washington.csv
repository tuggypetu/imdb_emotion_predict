10.0,A National Treasure,"James Stewart and Frank Capra. One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film. Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na√Øve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies. He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions. When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp. When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft. This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways. The story is a classic struggle between good and evil. In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope. He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds. I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity. This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history. The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power. Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies. Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency. He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure. It is in my top 50 list of all time. The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

,Want to Get Your View Across? Why Not Filibuster?,"The media and those in Washington, D.C. cringed in 1939 when Frank Capra (Oscar-nominated for directing) come out with ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Capra, fresh off amazing successes like ""Lady for a Day"", ""It Happened One Night"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""Lost Horizon"" and ""You Can't Take It With You"", used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful medium---the motion picture. The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians, but cheers from critics and the audience. As with society, the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way. A U.S. Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma. Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart (Oscar-nominated) is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he won't rock the boat. Stewart, the leader of the Boy Rangers (a local camp association for youngsters), gets blind-sided by many high-ranking officials who have alterior motives (Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular) when his idea for a national boys' camp goes by the wayside. Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own game---creating a filibuster (a never-ending governmental argument for his cause). Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters (love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players) are all terrific throughout. The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5.",want get your view across why not filibuster,media those washington d c cringed 1939 when frank capra oscar nominated directing come out with mr smith goes washington capra fresh off amazing successes like lady day it happened one night mr deeds goes town lost horizon you cant take it with you used his power slap some bigwigs face with powerful medium motion picture result was immediate backlash by publications politicians but cheers critics audience as with society critics masses won out as movie is masterpiece every way u s senate vacancy leads dilemma who should be put office everyone believes apparently naive gullible james stewart oscar nominated is logical choice because he will be easy manipulate he wont rock boat stewart leader boy rangers local camp association youngsters gets blind sided by many high ranking officials who have alterior motives oscar nominees harry carey claude rains particular when his idea national boys camp goes by wayside thus only thing left stewart is beat those charge by beating them at their own game creating filibuster never ending governmental argument his cause stewart is solid as always here supporters love interest reporter jean arthur drunk newspaper man thomas mitchell included with aforementioned players are all terrific throughout oscar winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent capra just had uncanny ability mix comedy drama interpersonal characterizations together make consistently wonderful american film experiences 5 stars out 5,0.5947222222222223,0.18375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,Shining a light on corruption,"Frank Capra was an idealist for sure, but he certainly was clear-eyed in seeing some of the darkest problems with humanity and its institutions. At the beginning of this film, he shows us politicians who are firmly in the pocket of special interests, the degree to which is startling. A state governor (Guy Kibbee) is in charge of picking a new senator after one of the two serving for his state has passed away, but it's immediately clear that he operates as a puppet for a big businessman (Edward Arnold), a guy whose clout got the governor his position, and now who expects to call the shots as payback. We see it as one of the fundamental problems of representative government in 1939, just as it is today, so the film is highly, highly relevant.Now it's laughable that the governor would go rogue and put the head of the Boy Rangers, Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart), in there instead, based on the pleading of his children and a coin flip that lands on its edge, but that's the premise of the film. It's an obvious call to clean up Washington, and get decent, upright people in there as representatives, and in delivering this message, Capra does not attempt subtlety or realism. And I may as well say it now before I blab on, it's laughable how the kids play the role they do later in the film too, and how the other senator (Claude Rains) behaves in the end. Maybe the film is pointing out that progress will always depend more on the next generation, and that ultimately it will require those in power to summon their sense of decency and stand up for what's right.One thing I love is just how reverentially Smith treats the job he's about to undertake. First of all, he knows it's not about him. He's also not sure how well he'll do, but says ""I can promise you one thing: I'll do nothing to disgrace the office of United States Senator."" After dropping off his crateful of pigeons (lol), we then see him wide-eyed as he tours the landmarks of Washington DC. The shot Capra gets of him beneath the giant statue of Lincoln perfectly captures his humility, and others the deep respect he has for the institution he's going to serve. We get a heavy dose of the ideals the country aspires to, with shots of Lincoln's second inaugural address (""With malice toward none, with charity for all"") and a recitation of a part of the Gettysburg address by a young boy, while his grandfather and an African-American man look on. It's quite flowery and may have the lip curling of every cynic who sees the film, thinking of all of the times America has done evil in the world, but just about to head into WWII was not one of those times, and regardless, I can't help but admire this scene. If only all of America's representatives went with a reverence for these ideals, respected the institutions from their hearts, and felt real humility and a need to not let down his or her constituents, or the leaders who came before them.Everyone else is aware of how the system in Washington actually works though, including the other senator (Rains), his handler (Eugene Pallette), and his secretary (Jean Arthur). Heck, even the young page who shows him to his seat is savvier. Smith says to the boy, ""I'm just going to sit around and listen,"" meaning that he feels he has a lot to learn and shouldn't go in with guns blazing. The kid answers ""That's the way to get re-elected,"" reflecting how deep the cynicism of the process runs. Later it's parenthetically said that ""You can't count on people voting. Half the time they don't vote."" These little bits are pointing out the same thing, that while we may decry the state of government, at the same time, to make it better we need to be active participants in it.Stewart is fantastic in the film, with lots of memorable moments, such as when he nervously reads his proposal for a boys camp on the senate floor, and then later when his eyes are opened to deep corruption, which includes his father's friend and mentor, Rains's character. When he takes the Senate floor to filibuster and angrily yells ""No, sir, I will not yield!"" it's a fine, fiery moment, with palpable tension between the two men. I also love the softer scene with Arthur where he channels Walt Whitman in quoting his father, a man who died fighting for the little guy and the free press: ""My dad had the right idea. He had it all worked out. He said: 'Son, don't miss the wonders that surround you. Every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star is filled with the wonders of nature.' He said, 'Have you ever noticed how grateful you are to see daylight after coming through a long dark tunnel? Well,' he said, 'always try to see life as if you'd just come out of a tunnel.'""Arthur turns in a solid performance with her character, who is also inspiring. She knows how congress operates, giving Stewart (and the viewer) a little tutorial, and then coaching him from the balcony. We see that her character is jaded, but that there is still a glimmer of idealism in her, and also a healthy amount of disgust for politics. ""You're half-way decent, you don't belong here,"" she tells Stewart. We see both of these characters go through the inevitable response to the ugliness of politics - considering leaving the aggravation and frustration of it all, because it's the fight of an underdog to try to change it, or to stay and fight, because that's the only way anything will ever change, and what great leaders have had to do too as well. As this is a Capra film, you can guess which one of these paths they take.It's certainly an arduous path, as the political boss is incredibly powerful. There is real evil, greed, and corruption here, and Arnold plays his part perfectly. The scene where he tries to get Smith to play ball is reminiscent of Potter calling George Bailey into his office in 'It's a Wonderful Life,' and has a similar outcome. When Smith stands up in revulsion, the boss immediately turns to Plan B, which is crush him. He does what corrupt and deceitful people in politics have always done - he drums up charges of the very same things he is guilty of against those who oppose them. He also uses his power over the press to wage a misinformation and propaganda war. Maybe you'll recognize these patterns from the present day.The ending is a little messy, and I would have liked it more had Smith somehow been shown swaying the other senators with arguments and reason. How does one reach across the aisle and bridge such a gap of disagreement and entrenched special interests? However, I have to give the film credit for shining a light on corruption in politics, and I loved how its truthful message was so powerful that many offended politicians branded the film as communist propaganda. As Smith says, what's needed in politics is ""plain, ordinary, everyday kindness. And a little looking out for the other fellow too."" Indeed.",shining light corruption,frank capra was idealist sure but he certainly was clear eyed seeing some darkest problems with humanity its institutions at beginning this film he shows us

,Capra & Stewart Make It Work Very Well,"Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite, and making it into a satisfying, worthwhile movie. In ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"", they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold. It's not quite on the level of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but it is as good as almost anything else of its kind.Stewart's performance is important right from the beginning - hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure. Even his wide-eyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably. As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further, Stewart is even better.The secondary characters are also important, because the story itself is a rather stylized, though still worthwhile, statement about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart's troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well. Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship, keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation.",capra stewart make it work very well,frank capra james stewart were nearly unsurpassed at task taking kind story that is optimistic but that borders being trite making it into satisfying worthwhile movie mr smith goes washington they accomplish this with little help jean arthur claude rains edward arnold its not quite level its wonderful life but it is as good as almost anything else its kind stewarts performance is important right beginning hardly anyone else could have been believable as earnest unknown who suddenly becomes important political figure even his wide eyed appreciation what he sees washington comes across believably as story gets more complicated his character is developed further stewart is even better secondary characters are also important because story itself is rather stylized though still worthwhile statement about politics characters are more believable than are many plot developments rains contributes lot as stewarts troubled colleague jean arthur is natural this kind role arnold plays his devious character well capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship keeping story track getting most out situation,0.6081582633053221,0.2648984593837535,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,drifts in and out of comedy and sincerity with the greatest of ease,"It was a lot of fun watching Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously. And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it, in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due (though according to the trivia, it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy ""works""). But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie, of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8-to-80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout, particularly in that climactic, rousing twenty-minute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant, un-faltering filibuster, is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done, to an extreme perhaps, in getting things done in government. But at the same time, Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony, keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. ""Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!"" This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time, or even after, could have pulled off.The rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young, new-in-town senator. It's also a witty, more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically, the core of the story is the fish-out-of-water type, where Stewart's Jefferson Smith (one of his better Hollywood performances), leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator (Claude Rains, terrific as always). And there's even a woman (Jean Arthur) in the mix that's growing an interest in him, at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold, as skilled a character actor as could be asked for), Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster, which includes a reading from the Constitution, in-and-out cheers from the Boy Rangers, and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words, it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in, and even at its cheesiest and sometimes most-dated moments, it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equal-opportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical, and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course.",drifts out comedy sincerity with greatest ease,it was lot fun watching mr smith goes washington class where professor noted how this was sort film that was historical importance while not taking itself too seriously i think thats way frank capra wanted it sense perhaps time 1939 america this film was seen as being merit american governments due though according trivia it was denounced at showing corruption even banned showing how democracy works but director is also wanting make entertaining movie kind hollywood appeal that brings 8 80 years olds attendance what had me interested throughout particularly that climactic rousing twenty minute sequence senate with jimmy stewarts constant un faltering filibuster is how it really is patriotic kind bravura be shown screen here is how it should be done extreme perhaps getting things done government but at same time capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group kids up balcony keeping audience laughing smiling all way through great lines that stewart says great principles dont get lost once they come light theyre right here you just have see them again this is kind talent that im sure few other filmmakers at time or even after could have pulled off rest film isnt just stewarts struggle be heard as young new town senator its also witty more often than not true look how government tends really work as opposed how it should basically core story is fish out water type where stewarts jefferson smith one his better hollywood performances leader boy rangers is called be senator his state he has childhood hero town form senior senator claude rains terrific as always theres even woman jean arthur mix thats growing interest him at first dubious but despite corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by jim taylor edward arnold as skilled character actor as could be asked smith fights it all way his final filibuster which includes reading constitution out cheers boy rangers general guffaws other senators other words its really much that pure spirit frank capra that mr smith is working even at its cheesiest sometimes most dated moments its very successful picture what it wants do its really equal opportunity kind film about people politics that should be able decades later appeal both hopeful cynical it works as good as it does comedy as it does piece show history film or american government course,0.5258983391336333,0.2214646464646464,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"

9.0,"Sure It's Cheesy, But Also Oh So Aspirational","Critics of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can't call those critiques ""wrong"". But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I'm always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.For a very basic overview, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn't just going to ""tow the party line"".This movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn't quite as perfect as Capra's more famous ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn't ""politics as it is"", but rather ""politics as we want it to be"", and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.Of course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I'm not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, ""golly gee whiz"" routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda's in ""12 Angry Men"". It's what we all wish we could be like--but know we'll probably never quite get there.The only reason I can't give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn't really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.Overall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn't out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature.",sure its cheesy but also oh so aspirational,critics mr smith goes washington will call it cheesy saccharine over top its character portrayals truth be told i really cant call those critiques wrong but thing is this is such endearing aspirational film that im always able look past cheese factor enjoy performances overall message very basic overview mr smith goes washington tells story jefferson smith james stewart wide eyed aww shucks country boy rube who gets nominated u s senate seat large part be straight ticket voter political machine senator joseph paine claude rains once washington however both get rude awakening smith discovers graft politics while paine begins realize his horror that smith isnt just going tow party line this movie remains all time classic me because earnestness its message it isnt quite as perfect as capras more famous its wonderful life but i do see similarities between two pictures here story strikes such simple yet highly emotional chord though deep down i think we all realize that corruption compromise are likely unavoidable aspects politics we like cling ideals honesty supreme integrity that is precisely journey that smith takes viewers this isnt politics as it is but rather politics as we want it be i think there is equal room both politically minded films course casting stewart is cherry top all this im not sure there has been better individual born play jefferson smith role his stuttering stammering golly gee whiz routine is perfect yet when chips are down he delivers filibuster monologue almost guaranteed have you tears rains is fine as corrupt senator jean arthur has nice sidekick supporting role but mr smith goes washington is memorable because stewart i very much liken his performance here that henry fondas 12 angry men its what we all wish we could be like but know well probably never quite get there only reason i cant give this full 10 stars it was made 1939 or back when hollywood didnt really know how properly end movies other than emotional flourish fade black with less rushed more nuanced endgame this one could have ascended even higher overall though i consider this be one my favorite political films all time make all gritty tough governmental thrillers you want i love some those too but i hold steady that more aspirational positive minded effort like this isnt out date or irrelevant simply because that nature,0.5443583418215772,0.13298860453272213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Brilliant,"Through a series of fortunate, and unfortunate, events, an unsophisticated local hero, Jefferson Smith, is appointed a US Senator. The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans, some of which aren't entirely ethical, or legal. However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.Brilliant movie from Frank Capra. While Capra also gave us such great movies as It's A Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night, this is his greatest work. A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted, told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism. Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.Clever, engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second. Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.Add in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.In all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay.

10.0,"It works in a way no other movie could, THERE IS PROOF","Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films. There is a warmth, idealism, and kinda simple feeling of hope, that makes one believe that things will work out in the end. Capra knew exactly what he wanted, and it shines. Jimmy Stewart, in the role of his life, makes us believe, what we know is almost impossible in todays crass world.Claude Rains is incredible as Senator Smith's evil mentor. Jean Arthur, as his confidant, plays the part so well,that we just want her to save the day.The final scene, where the filibuster is taking place, is among the greatest ever made.BUT THE PROOF, YOU ASK?In the early 80s, I showed this film, over three days, to a group of 15 year old inner city teenagers. I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago. It was a new class, and not all of the ""best"" students took it.I decided to show this film at the end of the year, just to see how long I could keep the students attention. I didn't expect much. Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span, and it was at the end of the day, 2:30 -3:15 pm. which made things worse. As the film began, there was rustling in the seats, boredom, that famous oh what a waste of time look...Mind you, this is 43 year old film, about a white Senator, in those ""old"" days, and being shown to a totally Afro-American crowd of 15 year olds, late in the day, (over a three day period, which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on. ..By the end of the third day, Capra had worked his magic, and the entire class was spellbound by this film. They were there till the very end, and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film, that they wouldn't have looked at in a thousand years..Comments were wonderful. Any film that could accomplish this, more than 40 years after its conception, to a crowd that no one would believe would have any interest in, deserves to be truly called a ""great film.""",it works way no other movie could there is proof,now i must admit that this is one my top five favorite films there is warmth idealism kinda simple feeling hope that makes one believe that things will work out end capra knew exactly what he wanted it shines jimmy stewart role his life makes us believe what we know is almost impossible todays crass world claude rains is incredible as senator smiths evil mentor jean arthur as his confidant plays part so well that we just want her save day final scene where filibuster is taking place is among greatest ever made but proof you ask early 80s i showed this film over three days group 15 year old inner city teenagers i taught political science very difficult school chicago it was new class not all best students took it i decided show this film at end year just see how long i could keep students attention i didnt expect much fifteen is very tough age keep any kind attention span it was at end day 2 30 3 15 pm which made things worse as film began there was rustling seats boredom that famous oh what waste time look mind you this is 43 year old film about white senator those old days being shown totally afro american crowd 15 year olds late day over three day period which meant students would have wait till next day see what was going by end third day capra had worked his magic entire class was spellbound by this film they were there till very end you could see how much they enjoyed seeing film that they wouldnt have looked at thousand years comments were wonderful any film that could accomplish this more than 40 years after its conception crowd that no one would believe would have any interest deserves be truly called great film,0.5207088744588744,0.14941603535353537,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,Capra-corn but very watchable with some great performances...,"Frank Capra's knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances. Ironically, Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. As a bumbling, naive senator who is a lamb thrown to the wolves in Washington, D.C., Stewart does a fabulous job--although there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks a bit staged. Jean Arthur is a natural for the role of the wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes to realize he's the real thing.All of the supporting players are excellent--especially CLAUDE RAINS as a mentor to Stewart who finally has a conscience about deceiving him, and Harry Carey (the western actor) as the man with the gavel who soon realizes that Stewart is not to be underestimated. His reaction shots, grinning and sometimes stifling a grin, say more than words. He and Rains both deserved their supporting role nominations.But, as usual in a Capra film, you have to be willing to forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz. The ending (when it finally comes after some excessive length in running time) is rather abrupt as though the director suddenly realized he'd gone overtime on the story. And some of the sentimentality (such as the scene where Arthur joins him at the Lincoln Memorial where she knew she'd find him), is hard to swallow until you remind yourself that--hey, this is Capra-corn. Nevertheless, despite some flaws, it's the kind of comedy-drama about Washington, D.C. that only a director like Capra could make. And the replica of the Senate is amazingly detailed, as are all the interiors which were shot on a soundstage at Columbia. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior, filibustering, etc. It will leave you with a warm glow--somewhat like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in that respect.Summing up: It's Stewart's show all the way. He's at his peak here.",capra corn but very watchable with some great performances,frank capras knack getting best out james stewart jean arthur is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances ironically stewart would not win oscar this role but was awarded one following year lesser role philadelphia story as bumbling naive senator who is lamb thrown wolves washington d c stewart does fabulous job although there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks bit staged jean arthur is natural role wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes realize hes real thing all supporting players are excellent especially claude rains as mentor stewart who finally has conscience about deceiving him harry carey western actor as man with gavel who soon realizes that stewart is not be underestimated his reaction shots grinning sometimes stifling grin say more than words he rains both deserved their supporting role nominations but as usual capra film you have be willing forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz ending when it finally comes after some excessive length running time is rather abrupt as though director suddenly realized hed gone overtime story some sentimentality such as scene where arthur joins him at lincoln memorial where she knew shed find him is hard swallow until you remind yourself that hey this is capra corn nevertheless despite some flaws its kind comedy drama about washington d c that only director like capra could make replica senate is amazingly detailed as are all interiors which were shot soundstage at columbia its also nice lesson how senate works how bills have go through committees rules behavior filibustering etc it will leave you with warm glow somewhat like its wonderful life that respect summing up its stewarts show all way hes at his peak here,0.6290540540540541,0.24279279279279278,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"The best film of 1939, about a love of honor that's gone with the wind.","For a film 88 years old and 14 presidents later, this film represents what is best about the United States and also a reminder what is wrong with it. I do find it difficult to pick out the best film out of the dozens of classics released in 1939, but of those 50 or 60, ""Mr. Smith"" remains the most prestigious with a message that resonates today. Like the dozens of classics in 1939, this has dozens of moments that are considered among the great scenes in film history. As good as best actor winner Robert Donat was as ""Mr. Chips"", James Stewart is simply far better, going from naive country bumpkin handed a senate seat, his slow education to the corruption, his determination to accomplish something, the crooked obstacles he faces, and the explosion that opens his eyes to the evils standing in his way. Stewart displays many different sides to his character, but one thing is clear: he isn't going to fall down and go boom without fighting. This features an ensemble that rivals 1939's best picture winner, ""Gone With the Wind"", starting with Jean Arthur as his initially cynical assistant, Claude Rains as his long time mentor, Edward Arnold as the power hungry money man (identical to his powerful Nazi like autocrat in ""Meet John Doe"", Guy Kibbee as the governor of Stewart's home state, and Beulah Bondi (in a role she would play many times) as Stewart's mother. Ruth Donnelly as Kibbee's no nonsense wife, Charles Lane as a nosy reporter and Thomas Mitchell as Arthur's confidante are also quite good. The surprise for me is Harry Carey as the speaker of the house who says more with a bang of his gavel and all knowing grin than the rest of the cast does with Robert Riskin's brilliant words. Director Frank Capra has been nicknamed the inventor of ""Capra Corn"", a description of the stories of Cinderella men who rose above their naivete to fight injustice. Rains is described as a villain in this, but he's a villain with a soul, one who forgot why he got into public service in the first place, allowing himself to be manipulated and controlled at the expense of his soul. Stewart's desire to have a boy's camp funded blocks pending bills of Rains and several others, and this results in some violently shocking actions, culminating in the famous filibuster sequence.I believe in fighting for lost causes, so this film means a lot for me. This film means more to me now than it did upon my first viewing of it some 30 years ago. Memories of a family trip to Washington D.C. when I was a boy and a return for a march for a supposed lost cause make the big eyed grins of the young pages and visiting boy scouts all the more emotional. Seeing this film in a chaotic time makes it all the more memorable, and even with simple, supposedly dated, American values, shows that modern values are as corrupt as the most sinister of political bigwigs that control the government behind the scenes.",best film 1939 about love honor thats gone with wind,film 88 years old 14 presidents later this film represents what is best about united states also reminder what is wrong with it i do find it difficult pick out best film out dozens classics released 1939 but those 50 or 60 mr smith remains most prestigious with message that resonates today like dozens classics 1939 this has dozens moments that are considered among great scenes film history as good as best actor winner robert donat was as mr chips james stewart is simply far better going naive country bumpkin handed senate seat his slow education corruption his determination accomplish something crooked obstacles he faces explosion that opens his eyes evils standing his way stewart displays many different sides his character but one thing is clear he isnt going fall down go boom without fighting this features ensemble that rivals 1939s best picture winner gone with wind starting with jean arthur as his initially cynical assistant claude rains as his long time mentor edward arnold as power hungry money man identical his powerful nazi like autocrat meet john doe guy kibbee as governor stewarts home state beulah bondi role she would play many times as stewarts mother ruth donnelly as kibbees no nonsense wife charles lane as nosy reporter thomas mitchell as arthurs confidante are also quite good surprise me is harry carey as speaker house who says more with bang his gavel all knowing grin than rest cast does with robert riskins brilliant words director frank capra has been nicknamed inventor capra corn description stories cinderella men who rose above their naivete fight injustice rains is described as villain this but hes villain with soul one who forgot why he got into public service first place allowing himself be manipulated controlled at expense his soul stewarts desire have boys camp funded blocks pending bills rains several others this results some violently shocking actions culminating famous filibuster sequence i believe fighting lost causes so this film means lot me this film means more me now than it did upon my first viewing it some 30 years ago memories family trip washington d c when i was boy return march supposed lost cause make big eyed grins young pages visiting boy scouts all more emotional seeing this film chaotic time makes it all more memorable even with simple supposedly dated american values shows that modern values are as corrupt as most sinister political bigwigs that control government behind scenes,0.505790711346267,0.2082304526748971,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10.0,Required viewing for anyone elected or appointed for public office.,"Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based). There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term ""Capra-esque"" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message. His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic. And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.A Senator from an unnamed, middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper, a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor. They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the now-senior Senator Joseph Paine (played brilliantly by Claude Rains), so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate. After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor, and Taylor's handpicked man is shot down by the public, the governor chooses Jefferson Smith, played to perfection by James Stewart, a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process. After he gets embarrassed by the local print media, Mr. Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC. Paine, Smith's boyhood hero, takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill. Smith agrees, and with his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (played by Jean Arthur), they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process, much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders. Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek, the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true string-pullers find that out, major complications ensue.Although the basic premise is David vs. Goliath, the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt. The characters are played excellently by all principal actors, with Mr. Smith you root for whole-heartedly, Mr. Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed, and Mr. Paine, who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self. A great performance was given by Harry Carey, Sr., who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief. The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact. There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score. The climax is as tension-packed as drama can get, and while the ending may seem rather sudden, and everything isn't completely or neatly resolved, it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy note.Obviously, few if any people elected to public office has the moral character, conviction, and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith, and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was. The movie showed an ideal, a supposed ""lost cause"" of truth in government. And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture, at least it shows that maybe once in a great while, being the good guy has its definite rewards. If (using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season) The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking, then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak, something done with full class and the highest respect in mind, and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches. This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.

10.0,Still Relevant,"Few films succeed in being relevant a decade or two after its release, but Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is still relevant 77 years later, especially in a voting year with questionable candidates.Before Frank Capra ventured into his war propaganda films in the early-to-mid 40's, he made some of the most important and acclaimed films of all time. In back to back years he directed the 1938 sleeper hit, You Can't Take it With You, and the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra carried some of the same cast members over to the ladder, as Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are among the many who acted in both films. Continuing with the tradition of Capra's other works, Mr. Smith deals with a common man taking on big ideas and ideals, only to be shut down by those more powerful and privileged.This was the film that really showed the world what Stewart could do. Even though I have seen tons of his films, this one stands out as some of his finest acting and most demanding roles of his filmography. He was always great at playing an every-man and someone you can undeniably root for, and Jeff Smith is a defining role for him. Smith represents the audience in going along for this political ride and I loved the way Stewart gave the character a certain amount of innocence and vulnerability while also displaying a graceful and powerful presence as well.Having wonderful chemistry in You Can't Take it With You, it's no surprise that Stewart and Arthur's work together here is just as good, if not better. Arthur plays Clarissa Saunders, who manages to keep Smith afloat even though he's constantly swept away by Washington and all of the extra perks for being in the Senate. It's also not a forced romance, like a lot of 30's films, it takes a while for it to be developed as its handled with care. Arthur may very well be the best romantic partner Stewart ever had.1939 was a fantastic year for film, with Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind also being released. But perhaps no film from that year is still as relevant as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra covers the film with patriotism with beautiful shots of Washington D.C. and a patriotic song here or there, but its his step into a pessimistic style of filmmaking that's most intriguing here. The last 30 minutes with Stewart giving an Oscar worthy performance and Capra seamlessly twisting the story into unpredictable territories is truly something special.+Stewart becoming the Stewart we all love+Arthur is marvelous+Capra's balanced directing10/10",still relevant,few films succeed being relevant decade or two after its release but mr smith goes washington is still relevant 77 years later especially voting year with questionable candidates before frank capra ventured into his war propaganda films early mid 40s he made some most important acclaimed films all time back back years he directed 1938 sleeper hit you cant take it with you classic mr smith goes washington capra carried some same cast members over ladder as jimmy stewart jean arthur edward arnold are among many who acted both films continuing with tradition capras other works mr smith deals with common man taking big ideas ideals only be shut down by those more powerful privileged this was film that really showed world what stewart could do even though i have seen tons his films this one stands out as some his finest acting most demanding roles his filmography he was always great at playing every man someone you can undeniably root jeff smith is defining role him smith represents audience going along this political ride i loved way stewart gave character certain amount innocence vulnerability while also displaying graceful powerful presence as well having wonderful chemistry you cant take it with you its no surprise that stewart arthurs work together here is just as good if not better arthur plays clarissa saunders who manages keep smith afloat even though hes constantly swept away by washington all extra perks being senate its also not forced romance like lot 30s films it takes while it be developed as its handled with care arthur may very well be best romantic partner stewart ever had 1939 was fantastic year film with wizard oz gone with wind also being released but perhaps no film that year is still as relevant as mr smith goes washington capra covers film with patriotism with beautiful shots washington d c patriotic song here or there but its his step into pessimistic style filmmaking thats most intriguing here last 30 minutes with stewart giving oscar worthy performance capra seamlessly twisting story into unpredictable territories is truly something special stewart becoming stewart we all love arthur is marvelous capras balanced directing10 10,0.5053287981859411,0.23078939909297055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.51}"
10.0,Mr. Smith learns about politics the hard way,"What a wonderful film. What an exaggerated, corny, fantastic, beautifully acted, exciting, wonderful film.""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is a classic for good reason. It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way: idealism, strong, unshakable belief, never quitting, honesty, and commitment. Today, patriotism and ""American values"" have taken on another connotation. They have become the property of the right wing. But there isn't anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith, which are different from what is being expressed today.Is anyone today as idealistic as Mr. Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money, I sadly have to answer that I don't think so. In the real world, as Court TV has taught us, things don't work that way. Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly, I'd have to say probably. Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes. Have they? Definitely.""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is a fantasy, but it's a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and, like Jean Arthur says in the film, maybe being jaded isn't such a good idea all the time.James Stewart had the role of a lifetime, and he was perfect. Homespun, intelligent, boyishly good-looking, his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves. His filibuster scenes are incredible, passionate, and strong. We were lucky we had him as long as we did. There will never be another. Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in. Claude Rains, as the unlikable, weak Senator Paine, gives a powerful performance. The bad guys - and Capra always makes sure they're real bad - were all great.

8.0,"Politics, the politics never change","A senator suddenly dies and a replacement needs to be named. The other senator for the state, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains), along with Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), his corrupt businessman backer, decide to name a truly surprising candidate, one Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). He's meant to be nothing more than a seat warmer so that Paine and Taylor can push through a new piece of legislation concerning a dam, meant to make them filthy rich. Unfortunately Mr. Smith is something they've rarely seen and are utterly incapable of understanding: a good and honest man. And a boy scout to boot.The film is corny and filled with pathos. Phrases like ""the American dream"", ""truth and honesty"", ""reliability"", and so many like those, get thrown around all the time. Politicians are nothing more than hungry jackal fat cats, aiming to filch the hard-earned pennies of the good American people. True way of life is to be found outside, on the prairies where grass leans on the wind. On the mountains reflected against the noon sun. I could feel my spleen turning red, white and blue as I watched this film.And yet, despite all that, the film is magnificent. Perhaps it's because 'It's a Wonderful Life', another film from director Frank Capra, also stars Stewart, but for some reason or other this film reminds me of Christmas. Because Christmas is also corny and filled with pathos. It is. But it's also the best time of the year. When it's okay to be a bit sentimental. Or a lot sentimental. When it's okay to remind ourselves of the values we all hold dear, but which we usually don't talk about because it's seen as embarrassing.Hopefully people still watch this film. Because even though it's old, and corny, and sentimental, and even a bit silly, it's values, themes and lessons are as relevant today as they were back then.

9.0,Sadly Still Super Relevant Today...,"(Flash Review)...from both sides of the isle. Smith, a young small town, morally honest, gentleman is given a senate seat due to a unique situation. Upon his arrival to the nation's capital, he is amazed and in awe of the history upon which the United States has been formed as he wanders the national monuments. Quickly he becomes angered by the misleading press articles after he dips his toe into political waters. He also learns of the lack of expertise of congressmen and the process it takes to actually pass a law. Getting his feet wet with his first harmless bill proposal comes in direct conflict with a plan a few corrupt congressmen have been planning. Looks like this is shaping up for an honest man up against established and scheming congressmen who are heavily influenced from outsiders. Stewart carries the picture as his emotions range from frustration, pleading, anger to exhaustion of trying to prove an honest point.

9.0,"""Either I'm dead right, or I'm crazy!""","Patriotic, stirring, uplifting, absolutely mesmerizing¬Ö Here are just a few words that can be used to describe Frank Capra's brilliant 1939 film, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors, Capra manages to reach into each of our chests, and wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings.Jefferson Smith (James Stewart, 'It's A Wonderful Life'), is a young, enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state, but is known throughout it (most especially by the young boys of the region) as an unsung hero. Head of the Boy Rangers, Smith has a love of his country and of nature, once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire single-handedly. After the unexpected death of a current Senator, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) is forced to choose a replacement. Whilst his corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge, Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children, awarding the job to Smith.Smith arrives in Washington, excited and idealistic, no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position. He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains, 'Notorious'), a highly-esteemed man who was once great friends with Smith's father. Unbeknownst to Smith, however, Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals, seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make ""certain compromises."" Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boy's camp at Willet Creek, which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty, the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality, an act that will serve nobody but the power-hungry Jim Taylor. When Paine's cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), informs Smith of these plans, he determinedly attempts to speak his mind, only to be quashed by the almighty ""Taylor Machine.""Frank Capra, who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners ('It Happened One Night,' 1934 and 'You Can't Take It With You,' 1938), once again proved his undeniable genius, something he would continue to do throughout his film-making career. One often-cited example involves the romantically-awkward Smith's second encounter with Paine's beautiful daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Rather than focusing on faces, as would be the typical style for such a scene, Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smith's hat, as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers, frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it. This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial close-up ever could!Finally, James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young, idealistic Smith, in one of his first critically recognised roles. The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine, despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection. For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film, Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse, an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak. As we witness Jefferson Smith, ragged and exhausted, determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members, we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much, much further. He is not just shouting at the Senate, but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us. And we are right there alongside him, quietly urging him along.",either im dead right or im crazy,patriotic stirring uplifting absolutely mesmerizing here are just few words that can be used describe frank capras brilliant 1939 film mr smith goes washington bringing together stellar cast both fresh seasoned actors capra manages reach into each our chests wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings jefferson smith james stewart its wonderful life is young enthusiastic patriot who resides unnamed american state but is known throughout it most especially by young boys region as unsung hero head boy rangers smith has love his country nature once quenching potentially devastating forest fire single handedly after unexpected death current senator governor hubert hopper guy kibbee is forced choose replacement whilst his corrupt political boss jim taylor edward arnold urges him appoint handpicked stooge hopper surprisingly decides follow confident advice his own children awarding job smith smith arrives washington excited idealistic no doubt modestly considering himself be unsuitable such prestigious position he is proud accompany other current state senator joseph harrison paine claude rains notorious highly esteemed man who was once great friends with smiths father unbeknownst smith however paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals seduced by promise power political longevity make certain compromises whilst smith works tirelessly submit bill regarding creation national boys camp at willet creek which he hopes will teach new generation value freedom liberty devious paine schemes dam that same locality act that will serve nobody but power hungry jim taylor when paines cynical secretary clarissa saunders jean arthur informs smith these plans he determinedly attempts speak his mind only be quashed by almighty taylor machine frank capra who had previously supplied columbia pictures corporation with two academy award best picture winners it happened one night 1934 you cant take it with you 1938 once again proved his undeniable genius something he would continue do throughout his film making career one often cited example involves romantically awkward smiths second encounter with paines beautiful daughter susan astrid allwyn rather than focusing faces as would be typical style such scene capra keeps camera firmly smiths hat as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers frequently dropping it floor stooping reclaim it this shot tells us more about smith than any facial close up ever could finally james stewart is unquestionably brilliant as young idealistic smith one his first critically recognised roles look absolute awe wonderment his face upon first witnessing capitol dome appears truly genuine despite fact that stewart was merely acting against projection his highly memorable filibuster speech at climax film stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate soda make himself sound hoarse act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability speak as we witness jefferson smith ragged exhausted determinedly continuing shout hoarsely at senate members we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much much further he is not just shouting at senate but he is shouting at people he is shouting at his country he is shouting at us we are right there alongside him quietly urging him along,0.55488455988456,0.12954605579605583,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,an honest film,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful film about a man Jeff Smith (James Stewart) who believes that children are the future and should be able to enjoy the outdoors, while taking in knowledge of their great Country. When a senator dies in Smith's state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing the new senator. While the governor is sitting down to dinner, his young children propose the idea of Jeff Smith who is head of the Boy Rangers and prints a weekly newspaper for the local children. Mr. Smith is elected into office in the funniest way, a coin toss. When Mr. Smith arrives in Washington with his colleague Mr. Pain, (Claude Rains) he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. After being sworn into the Senate Mr. Smith comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let boys come together and enjoy the wilderness, and the perfect spot would be in his home town next to a creek. What he doesn't know is that his colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man.The plot of the film will grab the viewer within the first five minutes and will not let go until the astonishing end. Even though this type of thing is implausible it's still very funny and unique in its own way. The acting was superb! James Stewart will always represent the good guy trying to make his way through life in an honorable way. Claude Rains character was perfect for him, a good man gone bad by the power of politics. Jean Arthur's character was something that isn't normally seen in the movies. She played an ambitious woman trying to get to the top without anyone's help, but is still the great old fashioned woman she was born to be. James Stewart and Jean Arthur were very charismatic together. There could not have been a better pair. The lighting in the film was great in two scenes when Mr. Smith is at the Washington memorial the light shines on sentences of the constitution that added a lot to the emotion of the character and helped set the tone for the scene. This is a classic film that should be recognized and cherished forever. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great film for the whole family, the film is not only captivating and genuine but there is also a moral in the story.

9.0,Educational and courageous - Stewart at his finest.,"Jimmy Stewart stars as Jefferson Smith, the leader of the Boy Rangers who was appointed by Governor Hopper (Guy Kibbe) as a new U.S. senator for his state. Realizing him having no prior political experience and his naivety, Hopper thought that Smith would be easy to manipulate. Once in Washington, Smith discovers the downsides of the political process as his first piece of legislation he introduced, producing a national boys' camp, leads to a conflict with state political boss Jim Taylor. Taylor tries to corrupt Smith and then attempts to destroy his reputation through a scandal, hoping to lead to his expulsion from the Senate. In on the scheme is the crooked Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).Having first watched this film in a college government class, this movie is both educational and fascinating. You get to learn part of the legislative process of the U.S. Senate, including introduction of bills, the committee process and the filibuster. And, you get to see a good piece of cinema work with a captivating story and superb acting, from the corrupted Jim Taylor and Senator Paine concocting their scheme for political gain to the courageous Senator Smith trying to beat the political machine to seek the truth and fight for his constituents. Having the odds stacked against him, Smith presses on, showing the audience that even in a machine as big or tainted as the U.S. Senate or any other political institution could still yield a man of integrity and honesty. At the same time, you get to see the U.S. Senate in action, letting us see the political powerhouses as they debate the laws that will eventually affect our country. Even for a drama-genred golden oldie that is over two hours long, Director Frank Capra really kept the plot's momentum going strong and screen writers Sidney Buchman, Lewis R. Foster, and Myles Connolly wrote a fascinating script that really attracts the audience's attention. I thoroughly enjoyed this film - it is highly recommended.Grade A",educational courageous stewart at his finest,jimmy stewart stars as jefferson smith leader boy rangers who was appointed by governor hopper guy kibbe as new u s senator his state realizing him having no prior political experience his naivety hopper thought that smith would be easy manipulate once washington smith discovers downsides political process as his first piece legislation he introduced producing national boys camp leads conflict with state political boss jim taylor taylor tries corrupt smith then attempts destroy his reputation through scandal hoping lead his expulsion senate scheme is crooked senator joseph paine claude rains having first watched this film college government class this movie is both educational fascinating you get learn part legislative process u s senate including introduction bills committee process filibuster you get see good piece cinema work with captivating story superb acting corrupted jim taylor senator paine concocting their scheme political gain courageous senator smith trying beat political machine seek truth fight his constituents having odds stacked against him smith presses showing audience that even machine as big or tainted as u s senate or any other political institution could still yield man integrity honesty at same time you get see u s senate action letting us see political powerhouses as they debate laws that will eventually affect our country even drama genred golden oldie that is over two hours long director frank capra really kept plots momentum going strong screen writers sidney buchman lewis r foster myles connolly wrote fascinating script that really attracts audiences attention i thoroughly enjoyed this film it is highly recommended grade,0.36936796536796523,0.17394372294372296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"

It looks lovely, the cinematography and scenery are delicious eye candy, while the film is richly scored, not to mention superbly directed by Capra.The script is another outstanding asset, it is honest, funny and poignant. And then there is the superb acting, whether this is Stewart's best role is up for debate, personally I think not, but as the idealistic senator there is no denying he is superb here. Jean Arthur is wonderful too as the cynical secretary, Claude Rains is excellent as always but the best supporting performance comes from Harry Carey, who is magnificent as the vice president.Overall, a superb film, and in the top 5 of my favourite Capra movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox",absolutely superb,having loved everything frank capras work ive seen especially its wonderful life i wanted see this film as i feel capra was wonderful director james stewart great actor so this was perfect combination works superbly mr smith goes washington has totally original story that is beautifully constructed never falls into slushy sentimentality huge danger with this sort film moves quickly it looks lovely cinematography scenery are delicious eye candy while film is richly scored not mention superbly directed by capra script is another outstanding asset it is honest funny poignant then there is superb acting whether this is stewarts best role is up debate personally i think not but as idealistic senator there is no denying he is superb here jean arthur is wonderful too as cynical secretary claude rains is excellent as always but best supporting performance comes harry carey who is magnificent as vice president overall superb film top 5 my favourite capra movies 10 10 bethany cox,0.7683823529411766,0.6127450980392156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Mr Smith's 300th review,"Superbly cast, acted, and directed with a gripping narrative and political observations that continue to resonate to this day, despite a tendency to slip into bathos, in particular at the conclusion. For me the most salient figure was Claude Rains' Senator Joseph Paine, representing a permanent fixture in all manner of political organisations of whatever stripe throughout the ages, the individual who starts as an idealist, but whom is corrupted by power, the system and above all by the immense continual pressure to do whatever is expedient. Such people inevitably do far more to further disenchantment with political causes than do the out and out crooks, if only because they are far more numerous. The story's major weakness in my view is that such an experienced type would use far more subtle tactics to take down and discredit an opponent. The ownership and control of the popular press to stampede the public and smear an individual is another time-honoured occurrence.There is plenty of light relief too with James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Thomas Mitchell particularly effective.

10.0,"Frank Capra's magnum opus - a searing indictment of politics, even more relevant today than in 1939","Through a series of fortunate, and unfortunate, events, an unsophisticated local hero, Jefferson Smith, is appointed a US Senator. The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans, some of which aren't entirely ethical, or legal. However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.Brilliant movie from Frank Capra. While Capra also gave us such great movies as It's A Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night, this is his greatest work. A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted, told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism. Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.Clever, engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second. Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.Add in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.In all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay.
