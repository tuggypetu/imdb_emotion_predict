10.0,Another miracle from Hayao Miyazaki,"I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""One of the most beloved of all family films"". Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting. It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute. The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic. The film takes place in the early 50s, when 10-year-old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4-year-old Mei spend one summer in an old house in the country side with their University professor father while their mother recovers from a serious illness in the nearby hospital. The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it. This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists - just like Miyazaki himself. The film is partially autobiographical for the writer/director/storyboard artist. ""When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls."" (From the IMDb film trivia)Totoro of the title is an adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives in the nest beneath a huge tree and makes the trees grow and the winds blow. Totoro becomes the friend and protector of the sisters and one day he sends them on the bus journey that is like nothing they and the viewers could ever imagine. I wish I could ride that cat bus. What a wild and kind imagination an artist should have to create it. How much happier we all are knowing that Hayao Miyazaki exists and makes his amazing films at the Studio Ghibli for which King Totoro is the mascot.",another miracle hayao miyazaki,i absolutely agree with roger ebert who called my neighbor totoro one most beloved all family films its colorfully bright sparkling animation is enchanting it is incredibly realistic at same time makes us along with two main characters young sisters ready miracle happen any minute gentle story is touching uplifting funny tender without being overly sentimental or didactic film takes place early 50s when 10 year old satsuki her baby sister curious energetic 4 year old mei spend one summer old house country side with their university professor father while their mother recovers serious illness nearby hospital great master hayao miyazaki remembers well what it is like be child see magic everyday life be always ready encounter it this ability usually disappears as child becomes adult but it stays forever few chosen they become visionary artists just like miyazaki himself film is partially autobiographical writer director storyboard artist when miyazaki his brothers were children his mother suffered spinal tuberculosis nine years spent much her time hospitalized it is implied yet never revealed film that satsuki meis mother also suffers tuberculosis he once said film would have been too painful him make if two protagonists were boys instead girls imdb film trivia totoro title is adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives nest beneath huge tree makes trees grow winds blow totoro becomes friend protector sisters one day he sends them bus journey that is like nothing they viewers could ever imagine i wish i could ride that cat bus what wild kind imagination artist should have create it how much happier we all are knowing that hayao miyazaki exists makes his amazing films at studio ghibli which king totoro is mascot,0.5575203252032518,0.14146341463414636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,I loved the film but know there are now three versions on video in the USA,"Although so many reviews have been written here for the movie, I am including one because there are now 3 different video versions of this movie and all three are certainly worth watching.Originally in the United States, 20th Century Fox released the movie on video in the early 90s. This is the version I first saw. Then, a few years later, Studio Ghibli (who made this film in Japan) signed a deal for exclusivity with Disney. This has resulted in a more widespread release of their pictures but has also recently resulted in a new dubbed version of the movie. The Disney version has, perhaps, more realistic voices--as the children sound more like kids. However, I prefer the original voices--particularly the voice for Mei. I think it's the same lady who does the voice of Angelica on Rugrats.Finally, there is the original Japanese version that is subtitled into English. I am a bit compulsive and actually have seen all three versions! I think the subtitled is best because there are also a few tiny scenes that are in neither dubbed versions (not enough to change the story, but still I prefer a complete film). Of the dubbed, my loyalty is to the Fox version--it just sounds more charming and cute.Now about the movie itself, the animation is about the best you'll find anywhere--particularly the gorgeous backgrounds. They seem to yell out ""QUALITY PRODUCTION"" throughout. The story, though very simple, is very captivating and the emotional response the film triggers is amazing. Anyone (except a total curmudgeon) will love this charming and simple film. See the movie, as it's about as good an animated film as you can find--regardless of where it was made.",i loved film but know there are now three versions video usa,although so many reviews have been written here movie i am including one because there are now 3 different video versions this movie all three are certainly worth watching originally united states 20th century fox released movie video early 90s this is version i first saw then few years later studio ghibli who made this film japan signed deal exclusivity with disney this has resulted more widespread release their pictures but has also recently resulted new dubbed version movie disney version has perhaps more realistic voices as children sound more like kids however i prefer original voices particularly voice mei i think its same lady who does voice angelica rugrats finally there is original japanese version that is subtitled into english i am bit compulsive actually have seen all three versions i think subtitled is best because there are also few tiny scenes that are neither dubbed versions not enough change story but still i prefer complete film dubbed my loyalty is fox version it just sounds more charming cute now about movie itself animation is about best youll find anywhere particularly gorgeous backgrounds they seem yell out quality production throughout story though very simple is very captivating emotional response film triggers is amazing anyone except total curmudgeon will love this charming simple film see movie as its about as good animated film as you can find regardless where it was made,0.4841130460448642,0.28624311294765836,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Stunning,"I am a huge Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki fan, and My Neighbour Totoro is no exception. In fact it is one of my favourites from them. There are so many wonderful things about My Neighbour Totoro. It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together. I have very little to complain about the voice acting either, everybody did a fine job. In conclusion, in my opinion this is an animated classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",stunning,i am huge studio ghibli miyazaki fan my neighbour totoro is no exception fact it is one my favourites them there are so many wonderful things about my neighbour totoro it is very simple story character but it is all very beautiful charming touching animation is typical ghibli ethereal looking just ravishing watch while music is one my favourite scores ghibli film story is simple but i loved simplicity it had such pleasant atmosphere it characters are engaging with great chemistry together i have very little complain about voice acting either everybody did fine job conclusion my opinion this is animated classic 10 10 bethany cox,0.6449874686716791,0.3898026315789474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,This is a great film!,"There is no compulsory villain in this wonderfully animated film, no moral lessons, no standard blue print story, and the characters will definitely not break out in a song.

10.0,The cutest movie I ever saw !,"My favorite Miyazaki's movie is ""Princess Mononoke"" on a graphical scale. But on a ""charming scale"", this one is really the best.Even the Disney movies are not so charming than this movie. Poetic, charming, cute, I can't find the words to describe the good this movie made to me. Miyazaki brings us into the wonderlands of the children, better than ""Alice in wonderland"" or ""Peter pan"".In fact, Miyazaki makes us loving children. In the movie, the children run, shout all time, laugh, cry, and so on. In the real world, I hate this. In normal movies I hate this too. But, here, every actions of the two little girls touch us deep in our heart. We learn to love children's world.Every one of us will have a smile on this face, from the beginning to the end of this movie.My favorite scene is the first encounter between Mei and Totoro. It's fun, poetic, and charming. Miyazaki succeeds to make a movie enjoyable for the very little kids (4 y.o.) and for the adult audience. It's very rare to succeed doing that !Really, a masterpiece !10/10 !",cutest movie i ever saw,my favorite miyazakis movie is princess mononoke graphical scale but charming scale this one is really best even disney movies are not so charming than this movie poetic charming cute i cant find words describe good this movie made me miyazaki brings us into wonderlands children better than alice wonderland or peter pan fact miyazaki makes us loving children movie children run shout all time laugh cry so real world i hate this normal movies i hate this too but here every actions two little girls touch us deep our heart we learn love childrens world every one us will have smile this face beginning end this movie my favorite scene is first encounter between mei totoro its fun poetic charming miyazaki succeeds make movie enjoyable very little kids 4 y o adult audience its very rare succeed doing that really masterpiece 10 10,0.6227777777777778,0.32362499999999994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.03}"
10.0,This is the movie I watch to restore my faith in humanity,"I first saw ""My Neighbor Totoro"" when I was maybe seven.At the time, I thought that it was really boring(that was still when I liked Disney movies). Years later, when I discovered ""Princess Mononoke"" I learned that MNT was by the same director and watched it again. And I find that I appreciate this film a whole lot more now then I did when I was seven.The animation is absolutely stunning(as with all Miyazaki films)and the story is deceptively simple, told with patient, subtle attention to detail. The best example IMO is the scene where Mei falls asleep on Totoro's stomach.It's fruitless to try and describe it;you have to see it for yourself.In closing, I would just like to say that I can't wait for a decent DVD to arrive so I can view this quiet masterpiece in widescreen in Japanese with subtitles.",this is movie i watch restore my faith humanity,i first saw my neighbor totoro when i was maybe seven at time i thought that it was really boring that was still when i liked disney movies years later when i discovered princess mononoke i learned that mnt was by same director watched it again i find that i appreciate this film whole lot more now then i did when i was seven animation is absolutely stunning as with all miyazaki films story is deceptively simple told with patient subtle attention detail best example imo is scene where mei falls asleep totoros stomach its fruitless try describe it you have see it yourself closing i would just like say that i cant wait decent dvd arrive so i can view this quiet masterpiece widescreen japanese with subtitles,0.4511054421768707,0.13452380952380955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.54, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.19}"
8.0,cute and sweet,Professor Tatsuo Kusakabe moves his daughters Satsuki and Mei to an old house in the country near the hospital where his wife Yasuko is convalescencing. The girls find tiny soot sprites scurrying away from the light. Mei discovers forest spirit Totoro sleeping in a giant tree. The girls are waiting for their father at the bus stop. He's late. Mei is falling asleep when Totoro shows up. Satsuki gives him an umbrella and he's overjoyed. He gives the girls a gift of acorns as he boards the cat-bus.It's a gentle story with cute characters and an adorable spirit from legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki. The drama isn't that heightened but it's a great coming-of-age story nonetheless. Totoro discovering the fun of raindrops on the umbrella is pure joy.

10.0,"A delightful, touching, timeless classic!","From the brilliant ""Walt Disney of Japan"", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that's simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.Sometimes you feel like you're not watching an animated children's movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There's no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.Miraculously, Totoro doesn't talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).I loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo's world.BOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple.",delightful touching timeless classic,brilliant walt disney japan hayao miyazaki comes wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace featuring stunning animation endearing personable characters heart tugging storyline thats simple enchanting even dramatic sometimes you feel like youre not watching animated childrens movie because characters particularly children storyline seem so realistic theres no bad guy no song numbers no references pop culture most cartoons especially disney feature these it gets old routine here we have break all that get real masterpiece miraculously totoro doesnt talk yet you can still understand what lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions six legged catbus is undeniably one most imaginative characters animation history human characters are also remarkable mei satsuki act like little girls not like kids who are smarter than adults routine toons today are guilty i loved totoro when i was small child i always will when i have children my own someday i will show them totoro instead toy commercials like dora elmos world bottom line masterpiece pure simple,0.5807142857142857,0.3014484126984126,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Totoro is a Winner,"Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro is a film that should be able to put a smile on any viewers face, and without a doubt, it'll take you on one of the most whimsical and fantastic journey's ever.My Neighbor Totoro is a story that definitely something children can relate with, as i watched this with someone, they immediately paused the film and asked if this reminded me of being 4 years old again. This film really connects with people. But it's far from a quality nostalgia piece, it's well animated, beautiful, avoids cliché stereotypes (from both typical of the Anime genre and Children's Fantasy films), and is beautifully filmed (see scenes such as the girls waiting for the bus with Totoro and the scene where the magic nuts and seeds grow with the help of Totoro).Even the English dub done by Fox isn't as bad everyone states. I've seen the Japanese version, and i'd have to say it's a mixed-bag between having Mei's voice sounds a bit too bratty for the English version, or having the Father's voice sound a bit awkward and perhaps not as caring in the Japanese version. Disney is said to be releasing a re-dub in mid-to-late 2005, so perhaps that will even out the controversy.This film may not reach the heights of other Anime classics (mainly it's double bill with Grave of the Fireflies, or Miyazaki's other masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), however this will definitely be high on any film lovers list, and is definitely a high water mark of it's genre.A solid 9/10, This film is next to impossible to watch without it pushing a smile out of your face.",totoro is winner,miyazakis my neighbor totoro is film that should be able put smile any viewers face without doubt itll take you one most whimsical fantastic journeys ever my neighbor totoro is story that definitely something children can relate with as i watched this with someone they immediately paused film asked if this reminded me being 4 years old again this film really connects with people but its far quality nostalgia piece its well animated beautiful avoids clich stereotypes both typical anime genre childrens fantasy films is beautifully filmed see scenes such as girls waiting bus with totoro scene where magic nuts seeds grow with help totoro even english dub done by fox isnt as bad everyone states ive seen japanese version id have say its mixed bag between having meis voice sounds bit too bratty english version or having fathers voice sound bit awkward perhaps not as caring japanese version disney is said be releasing re dub mid late 2005 so perhaps that will even out controversy this film may not reach heights other anime classics mainly its double bill with grave fireflies or miyazakis other masterpieces princess mononoke spirited away however this will definitely be high any film lovers list is definitely high water mark its genre solid 9 10 this film is next impossible watch without it pushing smile out your face,0.4515714285714285,0.08009523809523812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,The kind of film that stays with you afterwards...,"I first watched this film in Japanese with a 12 year old translating for me and I still thought it was incredible. There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well.

9.0,"A superb, uncynical journey into the imagination. Not so great dubbing, though.","This movie, set in Japan in the early fifties, is director Miyazaki's tribute to his mother (who suffered from tuberculosis, just like Satsuki and Mei's mother), his childhood home, and childhood innocence. Although some people who watch this movie wonder where the Americans are (this is post-WWII Japan, after all) and why so little screen time is spent on the girls' mother, but that may be partly due to the dubbing.Americans: First of all, the house the girls move into is rather European in design (with doorknobs, and an attic, and a front porch) despite the Japanese style bath and occasional sliding door. Secondly, Mei and Satsuki are really into Western fairy tales (the are brief glimpses of Japanese translations of The Three Billy Goats Gruff and other stories, along with Mei inadvertently re-enacting scenes from Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia). On top of that, according to Helen McCarthy and other Miyazaki experts, the name ""Totoro"" is little Mei's mispronunciation of the Japanese transliteration of the English word ""troll"" (""tororo,"" which the Japanese would pronounce like ""tololo"" because they do not distinguish between r's and l's). This is why an accurate dubbed version is nearly impossible (like any little girl, Mei mispronounces a lot of words).The Mother: I think this movie is entirely about the mother. Throughout, you see them subtly (almost too subtly at times) change from completely carefree to terrified with each scene involving the mother. This parallels Satsuki's coming of age subplot (she's ten and like anyone that age she is self-conscious about believing in Santa, or in this case Totoro). There's a little bit of both in the culturally-shocking--though completely innocent--bath scene (both girls take a bath with their father during a wind storm).Really, though, My Neighbor Totoro is less about story than it is about the imagination of children.Although the animation is a little dated and a bit jerky at times, the direction is absolutely top notch. There is enough visual creativity to rival an average Hitchcock film (Miyazaki's a huge fan of Hitch: check out the long wait at the bus stop, which is reminiscent of North by Northwest). Highlights include a Mary Poppins-esque ride on an Oriental top, a beautifully animated storm, Mei's nap on the slowly rising and falling chest of the giant totoro, and a cat-bus complete with headlight eyes.",superb uncynical journey into imagination not so great dubbing though,this movie set japan early fifties is director miyazakis tribute his mother who suffered tuberculosis just like satsuki meis mother his childhood home childhood innocence although some people who watch this movie wonder where americans are this is post wwii japan after all why so little screen time is spent girls mother but that may be partly due dubbing americans first all house girls move into is rather european design with doorknobs attic front porch despite japanese style bath occasional sliding door secondly mei satsuki are really into western fairy tales are brief glimpses japanese translations three billy goats gruff other stories along with mei inadvertently re enacting scenes alice wonderland chronicles narnia top that according helen mccarthy other miyazaki experts name totoro is little meis mispronunciation japanese transliteration english word troll tororo which japanese would pronounce like tololo because they do not distinguish between rs ls this is why accurate dubbed version is nearly impossible like any little girl mei mispronounces lot words mother i think this movie is entirely about mother throughout you see them subtly almost too subtly at times change completely carefree terrified with each scene involving mother this parallels satsukis coming age subplot shes ten like anyone that age she is self conscious about believing santa or this case totoro theres little bit both culturally shocking though completely innocent bath scene both girls take bath with their father during wind storm really though my neighbor totoro is less about story than it is about imagination children although animation is little dated bit jerky at times direction is absolutely top notch there is enough visual creativity rival average hitchcock film miyazakis huge fan hitch check out long wait at bus stop which is reminiscent north by northwest highlights include mary poppins esque ride oriental top beautifully animated storm meis nap slowly rising falling chest giant totoro cat bus complete with headlight eyes,0.40595238095238084,0.04260204081632653,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"

Meanwhile their mummy recuperates from Tuberculosis in hospital and only gradually becomes aware that something's hanging in the trees outside .This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, spectacular images and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and being quite entertaining . This is the animated movie that first brought Miyazaki international attention , it remains as a cartoon movie achievement almost without parallel. The first half delicately captures both quietness and mystery as two little girls move with their daddy to remote new mansion in the countryside , inhabited by strange spirits . While younger spectators will adore the funny creatures : Tororo , Kodamas , the twelve-legged cat-bus that can be only seen by kiddies ; adults will perhaps best appreciate the movie's delicate rending of atmosphere and its attuned understanding of the wonders and anxieties of infancy . It contains a great sestimentality and sensibility , it will be utterly refreshing to those raised on a diet of Walt Disney . The protagonist animal , house-sized Totoro steals the show , it is a giant cat-alike that can fly and has a magic bus which only can be seen by children . This stunning and superbly imagined film will appeal both , children and adults .The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's thousands animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. It packs up a big resonance , weight and delicacy that make it all an awesome film . Never remotely didactic , the movie is ultimately a children fantasy that touches brief thoughtful issues dealing with sintoism religion , ethical , ecological and kiddies psychological themes . It has some self-biographic elements as Miyazaki's mother suffered TB for 9 years , and she standed in hospital . It followed a Short movie , titled ¨Mei and the cat-bus¨ it is only exhibited in Ghibli studios . My neighbour Tororo premiered in cinemas along with ¨The tomb of glowworms ¨ (1988) by Isao Takahata and failed at boxoffice . However , later on Tororo has turned to be a real classic movie . As Tororo is an icon or brand in Ghibli Studios , getting a great merchandising . No other Word : a masterpiece Miyazaki wasn't yet a culture hero in Japan when made this animated mythic adventure ; later on , he directed ¨Princess Monokone¨converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world , it raised him to a status approaching living national treasure . Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Lupin¨ (1978) , Castle of Cagliostro¨ (1979) , ¨Nausica of the valley of wind¨ , ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Laputa castle of the sky¨ ,¨Porco Rosso¨ , ¨Kiki's delivery service¨, ¨Chihiro¨ or ¨Spirited away¨: the highest grossing Japanese film ever , and this cult movie : ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ .",riveting visually sumptuous marvellous animated movie by great hayao miyazaki,fascinating wonderful cartoon movie by genius hayao miyazaki this magnificent cartoon movie concerns japanese legends forest spirits exciting rather good film set fifities about japanese family moves country being formed by university professor father his children salsaki her younger sister lucy whose new house country is filled with magic including strange creatures as some black dusty balls especially by tororo it is cuddly friendly animal that can fly if weird mix bear owl cat seal with gentle rear whiskers naturally every time two sisters get into mischief sympathetic totoro is there rescue then meanwhile their mummy recuperates tuberculosis hospital only gradually becomes aware that somethings hanging trees outside this wonderful film is plenty fantasy adventures spectacular images with ecological message picture is narrated with sensibility sense wonder being quite entertaining this is animated movie that first brought miyazaki international attention it remains as cartoon movie achievement almost without parallel first half delicately captures both quietness mystery as two little girls move with their daddy remote new mansion countryside inhabited by strange spirits while younger spectators will adore funny creatures tororo kodamas twelve legged cat bus that can be only seen by kiddies adults will perhaps best appreciate movies delicate rending atmosphere its attuned understanding wonders anxieties infancy it contains great sestimentality sensibility it will be utterly refreshing those raised diet walt disney protagonist animal house sized totoro steals show it is giant cat alike that can fly has magic bus which only can be seen by children this stunning superbly imagined film will appeal both children adults motion picture was splendidly realized by hayao miyazaki he personally corrected or redrew more than 80 000 films thousands animation cels being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician joe hisaishi it packs up big resonance weight delicacy that make it all awesome film never remotely didactic movie is ultimately children fantasy that touches brief thoughtful issues dealing with sintoism religion ethical ecological kiddies psychological themes it has some self biographic elements as miyazakis mother suffered tb 9 years she standed hospital it followed short movie titled mei cat bus it is only exhibited ghibli studios my neighbour tororo premiered cinemas along with tomb glowworms 1988 by isao takahata failed at boxoffice however later tororo has turned be real classic movie as tororo is icon or brand ghibli studios getting great merchandising no other word masterpiece miyazaki wasnt yet culture hero japan when made this animated mythic adventure later he directed princess monokone converted first any kind gross over box office japan around world it raised him status approaching living national treasure miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as lupin 1978 castle cagliostro 1979 nausica valley wind howls moving castle laputa castle sky porco rosso kikis delivery service chihiro or spirited away highest grossing japanese film ever this cult movie my neighbour tororo,0.5657932263814616,0.24467914438502672,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.17}"
6.0,Where's the rest of it?,"It pains me to give it an average rating, but the fact that I wanted more of it proves that I was enjoying what we got before it came to an abrupt end. I was certain that I had accidentally hit the chapter skip button my remote, but nope, I did indeed watch the whole movie.It's summer 1955 and very cute and curious 4-year-old Mei and her sister Satsuki move out into the country with their dad while their mother is in hospital. The creaky, dusty old house that they move into appears to be hot spot for forest spirits and magical creatures. As with all Hayao Miyazaki movies there is a heavy theme of nature being beautiful and the Earth being precious but where is the story?Mei soon meets ""Totoro"" a giant cat/rabbit thing, who does...pretty much nothing. Totoro is barely IN the movie. I've seen pictures of him for years, I even carry around a Totoro satchel at work. I assumed that the movie would be filled with their wondrous discoveries, summertime adventures, and, y'know, some kind of PLOT! But nope. He's barely in it. Seriously, where is the rest of this film? I assume all those picture I saw were merely fan art and not stills from the actual film.At one point Mei runs off to find her mother but gets lost on her way to the hospital. Satsuki enlists Totoro to help her and he summons the Catbus to locate Mei and take them both to the hospital and the film ends there. That's it! My jaw was on the floor when the credits began to roll, and not in a good way.The animation is simply beautiful and is the perfect antidote to the ostentatious horror of modern CGI animated movies, the kids are cute, and Totoro (all 2 minutes he has on screen) is one of the most huggable characters ever created, but I am sorry I have to rate this on the lower rung of Miyazaki movies.

8.0,"Miyazaki's Absolutely Hilarious, Culturally Significant Story of Existence, Location and Expedition, Rather Than Rivalry and Danger.","This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.Miyazaki's films are in particular viscerally entrancing, using a watercolor look for the backgrounds and working within the unique anime tradition of characters with big round eyes and mouths that can be as minute as a fleck or as enormous as a cave. They also have an spontaneous authenticity in the way they mind minutiae.The movie tells the story of two young sisters who share a wonderful bond. As it opens, their father is driving them to their new house, near a boundless forest. Their mother, who is ill, has been moved to a hospital in this community. Now think about that. The film is about two girls, not two boys or a boy and a girl, as all American cartoon films would be. It has a resolute and loving father, in contradiction to the recent Hollywood affinity for selfish or absent fathers. Their mother is sick: Does sickness happen in American family cartoons?A neighbor boy later tells them their new house is haunted. But not haunted in the American sense, with ghosts or forbidding creations. When the girls let light into the shadow, they get just a peek of little black fuzzy dots scampering to refuge. ''Probably just dust bunnies,'' says their father, but there is an old nanny who has been employed to look after them, and she suggests that they are ''soot sprites,'' which like empty houses, and will pack up and leave when they hear laughter. Perhaps I'm reading too much in, but during this scene, I feel like I caught a brief reference to Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, as one sister stares transfixed at a crack in the wall.Assent to how the father composedly receives their account of arcane critters. Are sprites and totoros for real? They surely do in the minds of the girls. So do other hilarious beasts, such as the Cat Bus, which bustles through the forest on eight fast paws, its big eyes working as headlights. Instead of letting the children be scared of hauntings and the soundness of their own minds, the elders teach them to like and enjoy it all. They go along with it rather than irrationally making them feel silly.While it's not necessarily clear whether or not the adults actually consider them, not once does Miyazaki trot out the relic children's literature adage of The Adults Who Think The Child Is A Liar, So Child Is Going To Have To Save The World Without Them. This welcoming approach to accustomed Japanese spirit-creatures imparts a telling distinction between our two cultures. In America, there must always be something to fear, always a scapegoat, always something or someone to antagonize. No matter how equally violent or aggressive the history is of Japan, they do not thrive on fear factors. It is a beacon of great hope and pleasure to me that family films are the rudimentary place where cultural difference is easiest to discern in the movies.My Neighbor Totoro is made of existence, location and expedition, not on rivalry and danger. This is made crystal in the engrossingly extensive sequences involving totoros, which actually are not Japanese myth, but were indeed created by Miyazaki specifically for this movie. In these sequences, Miyazaki gets no mileage out of any trite ideas about the dark and dreadful forest. It's only nature. Is the film sometimes corny and absurd? Yes, but it knows when to be quiet and real.One of the funniest scenes I think I've ever seen on film occurs when the girls go to meet their father's bus. But the hour grows late and the woods grow dark. Without a sound, matter-of-factly, the giant totoro joins them at the bus stop, standing to one side as if it's been there the whole time. It starts to rain. The girls have umbrellas, and give one to the totoro, who is fascinated by the raindrops on the umbrella, and jumps up and down to render free a downrush of drops from the trees. Watch how coolly and constructively the scene has been handled, with the night, the forest, the lateness of the father seen as a circumstance, not an omen. The movie needs no villains. I remember that Winnie the Pooh also had no evil characters at first, but that in its new American version evil weasels have been interposed into his benevolent setting.But it would never have won its worldwide audience simply owing to its fuzzy heart. It is also full of mortal humor in the manner in which it perceives the two exceptionally authentic, realistic little girls, and I refer to their characterizations, not their physicality. It is side- splitting in the scenes involving the totoro, and in the scenes with the ridiculous Cat Bus. It is a little tearful, a little hair-raising, a little out of the blue and a little enlightening, just like life itself. The film expresses a refreshing ideology with Miyazaki later deepens and defines in his more recent films. Look at the minimal amount of external things in these girls' lives, or their father's, or the nanny's. Their story exists as a situation rather than a plot, and suggests that the uncertainty of life and the makeshifts of invention afford all the enterprising escapades one needs.",miyazakis absolutely

10.0,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) My Neighbor Totoro (1988),"I have never sat through a complete Hayao Miyazaki animated movie despite all the good vibes, reviews, recommendations I got from friends. Actually I have Spirited Away on DVD just waiting to be watched, but for some reason it still sits on my desk amongst others. Well, a good friend from up north passed me THREE Miyazaki DVDs, and given I'm going to where he is tomorrow visiting someone who mentioned during a visit to the previous movie set, how the scene was reminiscent of My Neighbor Totoro, I thought I'll pop that DVD and give it a watch.I was blown away. This IS animation, with a story suitable for kids to understand, and for adults to get a kick out of given its fantastical pieces. I shan't spoil the movie by spelling out the storyline, but suffice to say it centers very simply on a family, the father a professor who has recently uprooted his family of two girls, Satsuki and Mai, to the countryside, to provide a healthier environment for their ailing mom, currently in the hospital, to recuperate in. Thus begins the children's adventures in the country, with its lush greenery, and of course, with their new found friend, a giant ghibil known as Totoro, with seemingly magical powers of flight and fantasy.And it is in its simplicity where its beauty shines through. It is always said that children can see things that adults don't, and hence, there's a constant question as to whether Totoro is real, or not, and if so, how its interactions with the kids are possible. It's not just Totoro itself which is out of this world, but I totally like that grinning cat-bus.This is the kind of animated movie that our local animation production houses should be looking at. First and foremost, the story. While it doesn't contain huge battle sequences, complex or multiple characters for the sake of stuffing the movie, it goes to show that the story matters, in its ability to touch and resonate with audiences young and old (while the young ones go to the cinemas, don't forget the adults have to bring them too, and somehow you have to entertain them as well without being too complex for the little ones to understand).The character designs are also kept simple, but nonetheless effective. The animation here is top notch despite it being 2D, as are the cast who voiced the characters. The acid test here is whether the movie can stand the test of time, and watching it close to 20 years after it was made, the answer is a resounding yes, it passed with flying colours. There are plenty of moments where you go ""so cute!"" without it being saccharine, or trying too hard, and that is indeed remarkable. Characterization is superb, especially Mai, whom I think everyone who has a kid sister, would be able to relate to. That's how realistic I thought she was!Everything in this movie works well together, like a fine orchestra performing its pieces with precision yet with lots of heart. I do feel compelled to pop in and watch all the other Hayao Miyazaki DVDs I have in my collection, but I have to travel tomorrow and be away the next few days. You can be sure however, I will be back and complete watching them all real soon!I like Tonari no Totoro, certainly one of the best movies I've seen!",nutshell review dvd my neighbor totoro 1988,i have never sat through complete hayao miyazaki animated movie despite all good vibes reviews recommendations i got friends actually i have spirited away dvd just waiting be watched but some reason it still sits my desk amongst others well good friend up north passed me three miyazaki dvds given im going where he is tomorrow visiting someone who mentioned during visit previous movie set how scene was reminiscent my neighbor totoro i thought ill pop that dvd give it watch i was blown away this is animation with story suitable kids understand adults get kick out given its fantastical pieces i shant spoil movie by spelling out storyline but suffice say it centers very simply family father professor who has recently uprooted his family two girls satsuki mai countryside provide healthier environment their ailing mom currently hospital recuperate thus begins childrens adventures country with its lush greenery course with their new found friend giant ghibil known as totoro with seemingly magical powers flight fantasy it is its simplicity where its beauty shines through it is always said that children can see things that adults dont hence theres constant question as whether totoro is real or not if so how its interactions with kids are possible its not just totoro itself which is out this world but i totally like that grinning cat bus this is kind animated movie that our local animation production houses should be looking at first foremost story while it doesnt contain huge battle sequences complex or multiple characters sake stuffing movie it goes show that story matters its ability touch resonate with audiences young old while young ones go cinemas dont forget adults have bring them too somehow you have entertain them as well without being too complex little ones understand character designs are also kept simple but nonetheless effective animation here is top notch despite it being 2d as are cast who voiced characters acid test here is whether movie can stand test time watching it close 20 years after it was made answer is resounding yes it passed with flying colours there are plenty moments where you go so cute without it being saccharine or trying too hard that is indeed remarkable characterization is superb especially mai whom i think everyone who has kid sister would be able relate thats how realistic i thought she was everything this movie works well together like fine orchestra performing its pieces with precision yet with lots heart i do feel compelled pop watch all other hayao miyazaki dvds i have my collection but i have travel tomorrow be away next few days you can be sure however i will be back complete watching them all real soon i like tonari no totoro certainly one best movies ive seen,0.5126397023455849,0.1845715558950853,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Wonderfully Magical!,"Like all Miyazaki films, this one is absolutely sacred. Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.The premise is nice and simple, which works brilliantly because the plot is established as a foundation without hindering the experience of the movie itself. The viewer is allowed unrestricted access and exploration of the messages offered by the film.In addition, Totoro is not bound by any rules of traditional storytelling. Instead, it presents occurrences that touch on a fundamental human level that is so deep and profound that it will have you feeling a range of emotions. There are so many layers to this movie, each one meaningful and special. From community building to the love of a family to sibling relationships to facing the unknown; everyone can take away something personal from this movie.Perhaps the most sacred aspect of the film, however, is that it reminds us that life is magical. Not all of us have a neighbor like Totoro, but we are all fortunate in different ways. Each of us has something to treasure, something that brings joy and comfort.Totoro is special in that it frees the viewer to be a child again and to contemplate the world through a perspective that we have perhaps forgotten. Everything is new and interesting and beautiful, from a crumbling porch to an acorn seed. We live in a magical world, and it is definitely worth taking the time to appreciate this.",wonderfully magical,like all miyazaki films this one is absolutely sacred some parts are reminiscent laputa castle sky spirited away alice wonderland by extension but totoro stands out as probably most unique them all premise is nice simple which works brilliantly because plot is established as foundation without hindering experience movie itself viewer is allowed unrestricted access exploration messages offered by film addition totoro is not bound by any rules traditional storytelling instead it presents occurrences that touch fundamental human level that is so deep profound that it will have you feeling range emotions there are so many layers this movie each one meaningful special community building love family sibling relationships facing unknown everyone can take away something personal this movie perhaps most sacred aspect film however is that it reminds us that life is magical not all us have neighbor like totoro but we are all fortunate different ways each us has something treasure something that brings joy comfort totoro is special that it frees viewer be child again contemplate world through perspective that we have perhaps forgotten everything is new interesting beautiful crumbling porch acorn seed we live magical world it is definitely worth taking time appreciate this,0.6356304985337243,0.3353337522692361,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Essential Viewing,"I was initially skeptical on the quality of this one, but surprisingly this film was both engaging and beautiful from start to finish. Loosely based on Miyazakis own childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a simplistic story with a kind of charm, depth, and broad appeal that makes it irresistible. When two girls move to a new farmhouse to be closer to their ailing mother, they have to deal with some of life's more eccentric experiences, that of impending death and incredible magic. At its heart, its about the uninhibited curiosity of childhood, and the innocence in accepting everything without question, to such an extent that magic is a very real reality. The otherworldly in this film, comes in the form of Totoro, an animal spirit who is the guardian of the forest near the girls home. Overall, this film is absolutely spectacular. Kids will love it, though some of the deeper meaning will be lost on them. Adults will also love it, as a nostalgic ride through childhood and for some of the more profound themes running throughout the film. Technically, though made in 1988, the animation in this film looks every bit as stunning today. Totoros forest and the many quiet landscape shots are absolutely gorgeous. Disney, eat your heart out. The film is paced slow, letting the film unfurl at a relaxing pace through its scant 86 minute runtime. The lethargic pace, along with Miyazakis expressive camera pans and attention to detail lend the girls discovery of their home/the forest, the famous cat bus scene, and every moment with Totoro a very 360 degree, hypnotic feel. The new English dub is well done without losing much in translation, retaining the witty and lighthearted exchanges from the original. Overall, this films serves as a great introduction into the world of Miyazaki, and remains a timeless classic in its own right. Miyazakis most lighthearted venture also remains his most introspective and grounded work. Even without the whimsicality of Spirited Away and Kikis Delivery Service, this is by far his most engaging and charming film.

10.0,Magical film for young and old!,"Hands down, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is far superior to any film ever produced by Disney and that's including my personal favourites 'The Lion King' and 'Hercules'.It revolves around two young girls Satsuki (aged around eight) and Mei (aged around three) who move to a new house while also coping with their mother's illness in the resilient, sweet way young children have in dealing with problems. They then discover these furry totoro creatures only ever seen by children and through their new friends, they are able to face their fears.You can actually feel the magic when you watch this. The totoros are adorable and their haunting silence only intensifies their beauty and the two children are so innocent and captivating that you completely empathise with their delight at meeting these fabled creatures.Although I watched it a few times when I was around 12, I rediscovered this in Disney Land (Disney own the rights now) and walked from the Britain exhibit in EPCOT back to Japan to buy the cuddly Totoro toy which is now my most prized possession from that Florida holiday. At the moment, this excellent film is not on DVD in Britain for some criminal reason, I hope now that Disney own it they will release it soon enough. I would certainly reccommend it to anyone of any age.",magical film young old,hands down my neighbour totoro is far superior any film ever produced by disney thats including my personal favourites lion king hercules it revolves around two young girls satsuki aged around eight mei aged around three who move new house while also coping with their mothers illness resilient sweet way young children have dealing with problems they then discover these furry totoro creatures only ever seen by children through their new friends they are able face their fears you can actually feel magic when you watch this totoros are adorable their haunting silence only intensifies their beauty two children are so innocent captivating that you completely empathise with their delight at meeting these fabled creatures although i watched it few times when i was around 12 i rediscovered this disney land disney own rights now walked britain exhibit epcot back japan buy cuddly totoro toy which is now my most prized possession that florida holiday at moment this excellent film is not dvd britain some criminal reason i hope now that disney own it they will release it soon enough i would certainly reccommend it anyone any age,0.6119517687699506,0.2297411342865888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,"My Neighbor Totoro turned me into a little squish-ball, and I mean that as a compliment","That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the ""King"" Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasn't annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.If anything might be lacking in the film it's a 'plot' or sorts, as there really isn't any- a story it does have, however loose with what goes on. It's a pure kind of feel-good story about two young girls who have moved into a new house with their father so they can be closer to their mother who's at a hospital. After finding their house might be haunted, the younger of the two Mei searches around a gigantic tree to find Totoro and his buddies, who help make things grow in nature and are generally just there to act like fuzz-balls. Aside from a bit of trouble that arises in the third act, which does hold some overall significance to the implicit message in the film, it's really got nothing on its agenda except to give the little kids a big smile and some laughs in some of the cuter, odder moments. If some American kids might not get it or latch on to it like the homegrown animation of late, it might still work for their parents probably watching it with them.And this message I mentioned- which is also connected with Winnie the Pooh on some fundamental level- is that its essential to have this kind of lively dream-life for children, to have a section of the world just for them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through. But, like Miyazaki's other films, this isn't a message crammed down the kids throats. It's also for me (damned if I'll say it as a guy who's usually into more mature dramas and such) one of the most charming and cute pieces of animation to ever come out of Japan, and I would give it such a recommendation that the Pooh movies meant for me- as a first movie for a little one to see and maybe get addicted to.",my neighbor totoro turned me into little squish ball i mean that as compliment,that one line summary refers basically what it feels like be kid get delighted by story characters that are use overused word enchanting fact this film me represents kind enjoyment i had as very young tot watching winnie pooh films it is so touch with innocence escapism children that it actually works adults too as man already his twenties i was really taken aback by how adorable all little woodland creatures are king totoro cat bus other little creatures alongside him how it wasnt annoying or nearing that this is kind japanese export that puts entertainment like pokemon which is all about conflict defeat trying save end everything some super chu or whatever as fun if shallow stuff that it is here is story that works much more like fairy tale where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble only exaggerated thoughts occasionally distraught emotions kids 4 10 years old hayao miyazaki is really truly touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these if anything might be lacking film its plot or sorts as there really isnt any story it does have however loose with what goes its pure kind feel good story about two young girls who have moved into new house with their father so they can be closer their mother whos at hospital after finding their house might be haunted younger two mei searches around gigantic tree find totoro his buddies who help make things grow nature are generally just there act like fuzz balls aside bit trouble that arises third act which does hold some overall significance implicit message film its really got nothing its agenda except give little kids big smile some laughs some cuter odder moments if some american kids might not get it or latch it like homegrown animation late it might still work their parents probably watching it with them this message i mentioned which is also connected with winnie pooh some fundamental level is that its essential have this kind lively dream life children have section world just them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through but like miyazakis other films this isnt message crammed down kids throats its also me damned if ill say it as guy whos usually into more mature dramas such one most charming cute pieces animation ever come out japan i would give it such recommendation that pooh movies meant me as first movie little one see maybe get addicted,0.4723682545053513,0.05378281216990895,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,An enchanting story for all ages,"My Neighbour Totoro is one of the most enchanting films that I've seen. As one would expect from a film made by Hayao Miyazaki the animation is beautiful and detailed and the story engrossing.The film start with a man and his two young daughters, Satsuki and Mei moving to a house in the country. When the girls explore the house they find strange creatures that look like tiny black fur balls which scurry away as soon as anybody enter the room. While Satsuki is at school Mei sees a strange little creature, about the size of a rabbit, in the garden and chases it into the forest, here she finds a similar creature which is much larger. She names them ""Totoro"", which I believe is a slight mispronunciation of the Japanese word for a troll.When here father and Satsuki find her sleeping in the woods we are left unsure whether it was real or whether Mei had dreamt it. Not long after while waiting at the bus stop in the rain Satsuki also sees Totoro as he is waiting for his bus... not just any bus though, he rides in the Cat-bus, a wonderful eight legged creature who's eyes are its headlights.This film is suitable for people of all ages, there is no antagonist and the only slight worries are when Mei gets lots while trying to walk to see her mother who is in hospital.This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles, I've only seen a little bit of it in English but what I saw gave me no cause for complaint.",enchanting story all ages,my neighbour totoro is one most enchanting films that ive seen as one would expect film made by hayao miyazaki animation is beautiful detailed story engrossing film start with man his two young daughters satsuki mei moving house country when girls explore house they find strange creatures that look like tiny black fur balls which scurry away as soon as anybody enter room while satsuki is at school mei sees strange little creature about size rabbit garden chases it into forest here she finds similar creature which is much larger she names them totoro which i believe is slight mispronunciation japanese word troll when here father satsuki find her sleeping woods we are left unsure whether it was real or whether mei had dreamt it not long after while waiting at bus stop rain satsuki also sees totoro as he is waiting his bus not just any bus though he rides cat bus wonderful eight legged creature whos eyes are its headlights this film is suitable people all ages there is no antagonist only slight worries are when mei gets lots while trying walk see her mother who is hospital this comment was based watching film japanese with english subtitles ive only seen little bit it english but what i saw gave me no cause complaint,0.4246913580246914,0.10925925925925928,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.21, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
