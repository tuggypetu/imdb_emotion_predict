2,Who is Uwe Boll and what did we do to him to deserve this?,"I went into this expecting a bad movie, you could say I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I'm a fan of Jason Statham which made me want to see it despite my expectations, plus I work at a theatre and see movies for free which makes me less picky about the movies I watch.Now I don't typically leave reviews for movies, but after seeing this I felt that I needed to warn people. Up until tonight, I'd never seen a movie directed/produced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me, as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal, Statham, Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad, Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.I don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.If you read this review, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't watch it to see if it is as bad as the guy on the IMDb said it was. This movie should only be shown to criminals in jail as further punishment for their crimes.",who is uwe boll what did we do him deserve this,i went into this expecting bad movie you could say i was hoping best but expecting worst im fan jason statham which made me want see it despite my expectations plus i work at theatre see movies free which makes me less picky about movies i watch now i dont typically leave reviews movies but after seeing this i felt that i needed warn people up until tonight id never seen movie directed produced by this uwe boll guy believe me as i write this i wish that was still case there are no redeeming qualities this movie you realize it within first ten minutes cast is brutal statham liota reynolds are all laughable as main characters evil army krug reminded me dudes monkey suits early planet apes movies during action scenes you see same shot over over again as if they only had one shot bad guy hit by arrow even props were bad stathams sword looked like something youd give six year old halloween i dont even know if i can accurately put into words how bad this movie is best way describe this pile is piture you your friends trying remake lord rings your backyard because what you ended up with would be similar quality if you read this review dont make same mistake i did dont watch it see if it is as bad as guy imdb said it was this movie should only be shown criminals jail as further punishment their crimes,0.4949999999999999,-0.13638888888888884,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1,Wow this was bad!,"OK, first off, all of the glowing, gushing reviews here were obviously (OBVIOUSLY) planted by someone doing PR for the film (which is shameful in and of itself). There is no way that anyone sane would think this movie was anything more than laughable tripe.I saw it at a preview, and have to say that I was expecting much more. I didn't realize that Ewe Boll was directing, otherwise I would have skipped it altogether (he should never be allowed near a camera, ever). However, I like nearly every star, enjoy the genre and have been a big fan of the video games for years now, so I figured that this would be worth seeing (nothing will ever compare to LOTR, but it sounded promising).So yeah, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said here already. Horrible dialog, two-dimensional characters, lousy cinematography, cheesy effects and a plot which is nearly impossible to care about makes this one worth skipping.Seriously, don't pay to see this. It will only encourage them to give Ewe more projects.",wow this was bad,ok first off all glowing gushing reviews here were obviously obviously planted by someone doing pr film which is shameful itself there is no way that anyone sane would think this movie was anything more than laughable tripe i saw it at preview have say that i was expecting much more i didnt realize that ewe boll was directing otherwise i would have skipped it altogether he should never be allowed near camera ever however i like nearly every star enjoy genre have been big fan video games years now so i figured that this would be worth seeing nothing will ever compare lotr but it sounded promising so yeah theres not much i can say that hasnt been said here already horrible dialog two dimensional characters lousy cinematography cheesy effects plot which is nearly impossible care about makes this one worth skipping seriously dont pay see this it will only encourage them give ewe more projects,0.5637681159420289,-0.023913043478260863,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4,Ridiculously cheesy,"IN THE NAME OF THE KING is another laughably bad movie from German director Uwe Boll, undoubtedly his highest-profile effort thanks to an astonishing number of appearances from famous actors who really should know better than to appear in this. It must have seemed like a good idea at the time, or Boll is a fine salesman. Anyway, this is a ridiculously cheesy LORD OF THE RINGS rip-off, with Jason Statham's hero Farmer (no, I'm not kidding, that really is his name) heading off to fight an evil wizard and his army of orcs. Every scene copies one scene or another from the Jackson trilogy, except without any of the quality. A Hong Kong stunt team and some half-decent choreography is the best this has to offer. Watch out for a frail Burt Reynolds, a slumming-it Ron Perlman, a hammy Ray Liotta, a gorgeous Claire Forlani, a barely-glimpsed Kristanna Loken, a cheesy Matthew Lillard, a lazy John Rhys-Davies and an embarrassingly poor Leelee Sobieski.",ridiculously cheesy,name king is another laughably bad movie german director uwe boll undoubtedly his highest profile effort thanks astonishing number appearances famous actors who really should know better than appear this it must have seemed like good idea at time or boll is fine salesman anyway this is ridiculously cheesy lord rings rip off with jason stathams hero farmer no im not kidding that really is his name heading off fight evil wizard his army orcs every scene copies one scene or another jackson trilogy except without any quality hong kong stunt team some half decent choreography is best this has offer watch out frail burt reynolds slumming it ron perlman hammy ray liotta gorgeous claire forlani barely glimpsed kristanna loken cheesy matthew lillard lazy john rhys davies embarrassingly poor leelee sobieski,0.6,0.05317460317460317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
1,Uwe Boll does it again.....,"Don't really know how he gets great actors in his movies. Uwe Boll does it again, a cast of some of the best actors in one of the worst movies ever made. The story is bad, really really bad, the acting wasn't good either even with the presence of Burt Reynolds, Ron Perlman and ray Liotta.I have sworn that I won't watch a Boll movie again, they've proved to be a waste of time and money even if it comes in the shape of a 1$ pirated DVD. Never buy,rent, download or even think of borrowing it from a friend. Its a waste, and a huge one too. And be advised never to watch a Boll movie again, its enough already.EDIT: I've posted this a while back and I just wanted to add something.If you're reading this and you happen to work at a store where you sell video games, please and I beg you memorize the name and face of Uwe Boll and if you see him crossing the street immediately shut your doors and windows and put that close sign.

1,A real mess of a film,"I have seen several bad films, but I haven't seen one this bad in quite some time. Apart from Matthew Lillard, well sort of, nothing whatsoever works. The way the film is shot is in an incredibly shoddy and repetitive manner, and the film is one of the most ineptly directed films I have seen in years. And if that wasn't any worse, just listen to the dialogue, which is so clunky and juvenile. The story is too thin for the running time and the pacing is constantly on and off, while the characters are clichéd and I felt indifferent to every single one of them. The scenery is gaudy, likewise with the costumes, while the props look like fancy dress items more than anything else. The acting is also dreadful, Burt Reynolds and Ron Perlman can't do anything with their roles, Jason Statham is handsome and charismatic but his acting range is limited here and I have never seen Ray Liotta overact so embarrassingly than he did here. Overall, a mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",real mess film,i have seen several bad films but i havent seen one this bad quite some time apart matthew lillard well sort nothing whatsoever works way film is shot is incredibly shoddy repetitive manner film is one most ineptly directed films i have seen years if that wasnt any worse just listen dialogue which is so clunky juvenile story is too thin running time pacing is constantly off while characters are clich d i felt indifferent every single one them scenery is gaudy likewise with costumes while props look like fancy dress items more than anything else acting is also dreadful burt reynolds ron perlman cant do anything with their roles jason statham is handsome charismatic but his acting range is limited here i have never seen ray liotta overact so embarrassingly than he did here overall mess 1 10 bethany cox,0.42434807256235835,-0.12287414965986392,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1,"Longer than Lord of the Rings (well not really, but it felt like it)","I went to see this movie because I needed some time to kill, and at over 2 hours in length, this seemed like a decent candidate. Boy, I was wrong.Like previous reviewers that have posted before me, I would say that this movie was ""choppy,"" in that you never are watching one scene/actor for more than 5 minutes at a time. The back and forth between all the characters makes you feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but after a while when you get to grasp the plot it just becomes annoying. It's like the Director is saying ""Okay, now we've got to show you what's going on with these characters right this second,"" even if what they're cutting to is inconsequential.The acting itself is underwhelming, as is the script. The script calls for the cast to sound noble or poetic at times, but it just comes off as cheesy. The plot was a bit outlandish, but I cannot complain here as I knew it could be as this was a Fantasy. So you'd think that the special effects would redeem this as it's a big Action/Adventure/Fantasy type? Sorry, the monsters didn't look more than a pile of mud wearing mud colored armor, the battle scenes weren't anything special, and the magic special effects weren't anything we haven't seen before with a few twists.Pros: Jason Statham finally shows that a Boomerang can be a deadly weapon. Much Better than Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee. Cons: ""Choppy,"" too long, bad acting, bad script, sub-par effects.",longer than lord rings well not really but it felt like it,i went see this movie because i needed some time kill at over 2 hours length this seemed like decent candidate boy i was wrong like previous reviewers that have posted before me i would say that this movie was choppy that you never are watching one scene actor more than 5 minutes at time back forth between all characters makes you feel bit overwhelmed at first but after while when you get grasp plot it just becomes annoying its like director is saying okay now weve got show you whats going with these characters right this second even if what theyre cutting is inconsequential acting itself is underwhelming as is script script calls cast sound noble or poetic at times but it just comes off as cheesy plot was bit outlandish but i cannot complain here as i knew it could be as this was fantasy so youd think that special effects would redeem this as its big action adventure fantasy type sorry monsters didnt look more than pile mud wearing mud colored armor battle scenes werent anything special magic special effects werent anything we havent seen before with few twists pros jason statham finally shows that boomerang can be deadly weapon much better than paul hogan crocodile dundee cons choppy too long bad acting bad script sub par effects,0.4914285714285715,0.00948979591836736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7,It's become fashionable to hate Uwe Bol....so don't trust the score of this one.,"Uwe Bol has made some terrible films. I certainly won't defend his making crap like ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"". And, I noticed that quite a few of his films are on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...including this movie. But I also noticed that ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"", despite it's pathetic score of 3.8 that it's really NOT a bad film. Flawed, yes...but overall rather enjoyable if you like fantasy films.The story is about an evil sorcerer (Ray Liotta) who is in league with a pathetic wiener, the King's nephew (Matthew Lilliard). And, using the sorcerer's power, he is able to make the brainless Krug attack the people of Ehb and in the surrounding countryside. Amazingly, the fate of the people all rests on the back of a simple farmer (Jason Statham) and his small band of allies.So what are the film's weaknesses...other than having Uwe Bol's name on the picture? Some of the characters (in particular, Statham) are underwritten and wooden and a few of the casting decisions are strange...though they mostly work. Some of the dialog is a bit silly. And, sometimes the film was very easy to predict. But, if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the story, the great music and the lovely BIG cinematography, there is a good movie here. Great? Certainly not...but not a bad film at all...and one I found I enjoyed even though I was totally expecting to hate it.By the way, I noticed some reviewers called it, essentially, a bad ""Lord of the Rings"" knockoff. Despite having John Rhys-Davies, the film really didn't seem to be trying to copy the trilogy. The closest movie to this one might be one more like ""Krull"" or ""Conan""...which is also quite watchable.",its become fashionable hate uwe bol so dont trust score this one,uwe bol has made some terrible films i certainly wont defend his making crap like house dead alone dark i noticed that quite few his films are imdbs infamous bottom 100 list including this movie but i also noticed that name king dungeon siege tale despite its pathetic score 3 8 that its really not bad film flawed yes but overall rather enjoyable if you like fantasy films story is about evil sorcerer ray liotta who is league with pathetic wiener kings nephew matthew lilliard using sorcerers power he is able make brainless krug attack people ehb surrounding countryside amazingly fate people all rests back simple farmer jason statham his small band allies so what are films weaknesses other than having uwe bols name picture some characters particular statham are underwritten wooden few casting decisions are strange though they mostly work some dialog is bit silly sometimes film was very easy predict but if you turn off your brain just enjoy story great music lovely big cinematography there is good movie here great certainly not but not bad film at all one i found i enjoyed even though i was totally expecting hate it by way i noticed some reviewers called it essentially bad lord rings knockoff despite having john rhys davies film really didnt seem be trying copy trilogy closest movie this one might be one more like krull or conan which is also quite watchable,0.5704365079365081,-0.04137755102040819,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.27}"
5,"Adventures , spectacular battles and necromancy with all star cast","Sword-and-Sorcery epic deals with a countryman named Farmer played by Jason Statham as lead accompanied by two partners , Ron Perlman and Will Sanderson , taking on multiple adventures , monsters and dangers . Thrilling and spectacular movie full of fantasy that introduces us a brave hero and appointed to juvenile public and full-blooded adventure aficionados. Sword-and-sorcery saga with stirring action , spectacular images and fantastic scenes including witchery ,witchcraft and necromancy . Set in the kingdom of Ehb, the tale tells a good man called Farmer (Jason Statham), who was adopted by a family . The man married a gorgeous woman and a son sets out to rescue his abducted wife named Solana (Claire Forlani) and revenge a death , two acts executed by the Krugs, a race of monster-warriors who are dominated by the wicked Gallian (Ray Liotta). When Farmer's wife and his son leave their hut to sell cabbage at the village of Stonebridge, Farmer's farm is attacked by strange creatures called Krugs. With the help of his neighbor Norrick (Ron Perlman) he travels to Stonebridge; however, the Krugs capture his wife. With the assistance of Norrick ( Ron Perlman )and Bastian (Will Sanderson)Farmer's brother-in-law, and a magician (John Rhys Davies) he tries to encounter and save his wife. Furthermore , they are helped by an intrepid Amazon woman (Kristanna Loken) . The Krugs are being submitted by the sorcerer Gallian with the collaboration of the King's nephew Fallow (Matthew Lillard) who intend to amass an army to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds), being supported by his commandant (Brian White). At the end takes place an impressive battle between wizards (Ray Liotta , John Rhys-Davies and his daughter played by Lelee Sobieski) and Farmer .This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, violence and is pretty entertaining , though mediocre .This is a tale of magic , imagination, blood and wizardly set in a mythical world from Middle Age full of barbarisms . It packs large amount of fights in ¨Lord of Rings¨ style , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense several struggles in which the warriors are staked bloodily in the chest, beheaded or slashed . There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of monsters called Krugs and humans victims are relegated to being stabbed in the chest ,throat or neck. Breathtaking images , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment . Made on a fairly big scale with spectacular set design and glimmer photography . Quite budget for a German/Canada/US co-production and lavishly produced by the same Uwe Boll. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design . The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received below average reviews. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure films or those enjoy in general.The film will appeal to fantasy buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Sword-sorcery genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because action and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact.

Well the music is so bad in this film it spoils it.

I was very pleasantly surprised.The movie I saw was very entertaining fantasy story with a great cast, great scenic locations, engaging battles, outstanding costumes, that kept me thoroughly entertained for it's entire running time.I would describe the acting as ""adequate"". Some of the characters seemed over the top and the worst by far was Ray Liotta (I've never been a great fan of his), but overall they got the job done.I liked the magic in this movie.

3,"Not THAT bad. Have seen worse, have seen a lot better.","Just coming back from a double feature (In the Name of the King + The Golden Compass). All in all, ITNOTK felt just like an overlong TV feature. Some weird choices when it comes to editing (especially three locations at once in the final battle scenes, with a cut at about every ten seconds - so much for developing any kind of tension...). Image quality was uneven, especially when it came to ""souped-up"" scenery with the castles or the evil's lair, which seemed blurred or coarse compared to the close-ups of the characters. Some laughable ideas (using catapults in a forest? Suuuure...). Dialoge was really weird at times (at least in the German version), just short of holding up signs saying ""LISTEN UP! THIS IS MEANT TO BE PROFOUND AND/OR MOVING!"" (of course, being neither - just talking slowly and incoherently is most likely not character development...), while at other times it was ... like something straight from a certain group of New Zealand TV fantasy series of the nineties ;)Impressive list of cast members, though their characters are all a bit flat. Like, ""slide through beneath the door"" flat. Not even cardboard. The combat scenes are fast-paced, almost all the time in close-up (aka ""what's-going-on"" mode), except for the final fight, which was along the lines of ""who can spot the most MATRIX imitations"". The evil wizard (Ray Liotta? who cares...) somehow lacks any qualities of being someone you love to hate, *spoiler?* combined with evil's usual incompetence when dealing with the almost defeated good guys. */spoiler* The good king (Burt Reynolds) seems more bored than bothered by the events throughout the whole film. Ron Perlman is seen without a ton of make-up. Camera knows of two color tints for the film: brown for all the outside scenes, and reddish brown for all the dungeon scenes.

But there is no exploitation of women in this movie, and some of the women even take up swords. So, okay, this isn't Shakespeare.

3,It Lived Up To The Bad Reviews Here,"Fortunately, I read a few reviews before watching this. I had already ordered it as part of my mail-in DVD program, so I was stuck with rental, even if I had been thoroughly warned by the folks here. At least I had low expectations now, so I wasn't disappointed when I discovered - yes - it's certainly was not up to what you'd think by looking at the famous names in the cast.The actor who astounds me the most is Ray Liotta. What has happened to him since ""Goodfellas"" fame to do something like this? Has his career plummeted this bad, or did he just make a poor choice of roles to play? I can see Burt Reynolds taking anything since he's peak days are long gone, and Leelee Sobieski, because she's never been a star, but Liotta?Actually, to present both sides, the action scenes, the costumes and the story overall are not boring and not the worst thing I've ever seen. Some of the special-effects were a lot of fun to watch, so it's not all bad.....but the dialog is horrendous. It totally ruins the film and makes the whole movie appear like some B-grade cheapie. It's why I also was disappointed to see Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies being part of this.The worst acting performance in here, by far, was not Liotta but Matthew Lilliard as ""Duke Fallow,"" the son of the king. How Reynolds, who had a fine career, could work opposite this over-the-top guy and keep a straight face, is beyond me. Lilliard overacted so bad, it was embarrassing to watch. I can only hope he was supposed to act that ludicrously, but if that's the case his character is so annoying, it's not fun to view.Jason Statham: well, I've had it watching his movies. I loved his early work (""Snatch,"" ""The Transporter,"" etc.) but now he's just a ridiculous action-freak-character, one of these guys who can beat up 50 people by himself in every film, especially this one, as ""Farmer."" I have to admit, however, I did like him using a boomerang as a weapon. I thought that was pretty cool. I like Claire Forlani, too, who played his wife.Sadly, the dislikes far outweigh the likes and I can see why so many reviewers here panned this film.

1,I rarely walk on out movies...,"but unfortunately this was one of the rare ones. I love epic fantasy, but this movie relates to LOTR and Gladiator as a bottle rocket relates to the Starship Enterprise, and to mention them in the same breath is a monumental insult to those fine films. I really wanted to like it, honestly. I love Jason Statham and Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast (yes, even Burt Reynolds, who didn't deserve the audience's derisive laughter every time he appeared) were fine, although Ray Liotta was comically miscast and mis-costumed as Liberace. The British Columbia scenery was nice. The storyline, scriptwriting and editing, however, were absolutely abysmal. Just awful. The attempts at mid-battle banter were incredibly inept - they actually stop fighting to say things like ""What took you so long?"" and ""They don't scare easily!"". Jason Statham fights off big monsters who are armed with broadswords with what looks like a flimsy machete, while Ron Perlman uses a pickaxe(!). The opening scenes are amazingly clumsy, they just dump you randomly into the story with no preamble. And I am so tired of the overused Chinese martial arts film cliché of showing the audience a plain shot of mysterious badguys who suddenly aren't there as soon as the movie characters look - it's so cheaply manipulative. Lame, predictable line follows lame predictable line. When John Rhys-Davies comes to the bedside of the (unbeknownst to him) just-poisoned king (Burt Reynolds) I said to myself ""If he says ""The king has been poisoned!""

1,Miserable. A chore for the most masochistic viewer,"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale - Uwe Boll's latest cinematic abortion has a main character named ""Farmer"" (Jason Stratham) who goes on to fight the evil Gallian (Ray Liotta) all in the name of King Burt Reynolds. You read right. And despite all kinds of comedy that sentence might imply, the film is bitterly unfunny. Some comedy might have eased the pounding boredom.I couldn't begin to describe what's wrong with this movie, but I'll try. Firstly Jason Stratham's character is known only as ""Farmer"". Even his wife doesn't know his name. He's a hard-edged working class character, and one of only two Brits in the entire movie. He shouldn't have any sort of combat skills. Yet when the call to battle is raised, Farmer suddenly wipes out fleets of stock bad guys with an odd mixture of swordfighting, kickboxing, and the occasional poorly done CGI boomerang toss. Where the heck did that all come from? Why is ""Farmer"" named ""Farmer""? That's the poorest descriptor I could ever pick. Oh and *spoiler*! Farmer's the son of King Burt Reynolds. Take that as you like. My explanation is it's the script vomiting up blood in its last dying throes.Next, I mentioned that Stratham was one of two Brits in a fleet of Americans doing poor British affectations. The other British man is John Rhys Davies, whose presence makes the whole thing that much sadder. He does the best he can with the poor material offered. Ron Perlman is here too, presumably paying the rent before the Hellboy2 check came in. Kristanna Loken strangely comes back after sucking....blood in BloodRayne. It's unusual to see anyone of even minor celebrity status come back to Boll after one outing. It must be because the script gives her so much to say about war and the environment. Nearly everyone over or underacts, and it's ridiculously uneven.Sidenote: Being lectured on the environment by Uwe Boll is like being criticized by a meth addict. God knows how many reels of film and gallons of gas and carbon dioxide emissions were spent making this film.Anyway, back to the acting. The worst sinner here is Ray Liotta. Goodfellas fans, be warned. You may experience a heart attack during his acting. Hammy doesn't even begin to describe it. He just yells half his scenes, often in a pitch that could put Wallace Shawn to shame. He didn't have as far to fall as Ben Kingsley did in Boll's BloodRayne, but it's still one of the worst performances outside of the Sci-fi channel (Where this film belongs). Liotta also has telekinesis and psychic abilities, which he could use to murder everyone, but just uses slavish idiots instead. It's all just plain retarded.It gets worse. The story is impenetrable. The aforementioned enemies resemble something from Power Rangers. I kept waiting for Goldar. The editing is ridiculously confusing and sloppy. The battles just go on forever and are ridiculous. Example: One side has no archers. Technically the other side could just pick them off and keep retreating. But no. Instead we get increasingly muddled and boring combat involving characters we don't care about. The film is more soporifically effective than a glass of warm milk.I could be kinder as funny enough, it's still not the worst film Boll has ever unleashed on the world. That dubious honor goes to House of The Dead. It's not even Boll's most boring film, which is Alone in the Dark. But I'm so malicious because in the end it's a two hour long unfunny parody of The Lord of the Rings. Virtually shot for shot you can pick out a scene reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, except not in the same realm of awesome. Not even passable.

3,Friday night Hoot,"We went to this film intentionally (knowing its reputation) as a means of escaping a really busy and stressful Friday. We don't recommend the film to anyone with serious cinematic intentions, However, as kitsch this film almost succeeds. So, OK, we tried to come home and convince our ""knowing"" kids that ""In the name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" was worth the Friday opener vote, but broke down laughing about five minutes into our rave when they just were not having any of it.So let me add a few cogent notes. For 'entertainment' value, given what we were looking for after a long Friday, we were very satisfied, though we worried at times that our guffaws and groans, and open commentary, might have disturbed some of the other 30 or so people in the theater (but for their own laughing). King Burt Reynolds? Oh well. We have to admit that Ray Liotta's ""Goodfellas"" reprise as an evil mage was the most amazing thing we've seen since Jack Lemmon's service as Horatio in Branagh's ""Hamlet."" Of course, this mention of Uwe Boll's effort alongside Kenneth Branagh is totally appropriate, except that Branagh's ""Hamlet"" had little entertainment value of any kind. School is still out on which of these two can make the worst film of a decade. If Matthew Lillard's over-the-top contributions to ""In the name o..."" (which is all of the title that fits on the ticket marquee at the theater) served well in a film with vine dangling amazons, synchronized ninja archers, prolonged out-of-focus long shots, granular irrational close-ups, and some of the most inane dialog in the history of film, one wondered in that case why Scooby Doo didn't put in a cameo in one of the dungeon or castle scenes. Nonetheless, many of the second tier characters were convincing and well acted, amidst all the mish-mosh of incongruous effects and disaffects. So there were moments when one, though not entirely forgetting how bad this film was, felt sorry for many of those who found themselves in it. Or should they all have known better? But laugh! Oh my, did we laugh, to the extent that it became uncomfortable laughing at a screen strewn with dead bodies and actors struggling for motivation. Oh, we could have seen high drama or thought-provoking art, but this way our Friday night was pure poetry... the dungeon it was dark and dank the bodies in a pile and there atop the smelly heap was Ray Liotta's smile. his polyester wizard suit bespoke a man with guile but then behind a squeaky line was Ray Liotta's smilewhen Uwe Boll directs a film the casting's done with style that's why for evil, nothing's like sweet Ray Liotta's smileand though we hoot and holler at such feckless goofy bile now laughing all the way to bank is Ray Liotta's smile",friday night hoot,we went this film intentionally knowing its reputation as means escaping really busy stressful friday we dont recommend film anyone with serious cinematic intentions however as kitsch this film almost succeeds so ok we tried come home convince our knowing kids that name king dungeon siege tale was worth friday opener vote but broke down laughing about five minutes into our rave when they just were not having any it so let me add few cogent notes entertainment value given what we were looking after long friday we were very satisfied though we worried at times that our guffaws groans open commentary might have disturbed some other 30 or so people theater but their own laughing king burt reynolds oh well we have admit that ray liottas goodfellas reprise as evil mage was most amazing thing weve seen since jack lemmons service as horatio branaghs hamlet course this mention uwe bolls effort alongside kenneth branagh is totally appropriate except that branaghs hamlet had little entertainment value any kind school is still out which these two can make worst film decade if matthew lillards over top contributions name o which is all title that fits ticket marquee at theater served well film with vine dangling amazons synchronized ninja archers prolonged out focus long shots granular irrational close ups some most inane dialog history film one wondered that case why scooby doo didnt put cameo one dungeon or castle scenes nonetheless many second tier characters were convincing well acted amidst all mish mosh incongruous effects disaffects so there were moments when one though not entirely forgetting how bad this film was felt sorry many those who found themselves it or should they all have known better but laugh oh my did we laugh extent that it became uncomfortable laughing at screen strewn with dead bodies actors struggling motivation oh we could have seen high drama or thought provoking art but this way our friday night was pure poetry dungeon it was dark dank bodies pile there atop smelly heap was ray liottas smile his polyester wizard suit bespoke man with guile but then behind squeaky line was ray liottas smilewhen uwe boll directs film castings done with style thats why evil nothings like sweet ray liottas smileand though we hoot holler at such feckless goofy bile now laughing all way bank is ray liottas smile,0.5358271604938272,0.08717548500881836,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7,"Decent, if slightly cheesy, sword and sorcery action","Set in the medieval kingdom of Ehb, a man known only as Farmer is caught up in the battle for the kingdom. A powerful magus by the name of Gallian is using magical powers to control the orc-like Krug. Also working with him is Duke Fallow, the King's nephew, who wants power for himself. Farmer wants nothing to do with the war but when his son is killed and his wife taken he has no choice if he is to save her. He heads off in search of her with his friends Norick and Bastian; together they face various difficulties and are ultimately separated. Farmer later learns a hidden truth about himself before helping lead the fight against the Krug and ultimately facing Gallian.I was surprised to see just how negatively reviewed this film has been; it may not be great but it is far from terrible. There is plenty of impressive action; this is exciting and stylishly choreographed by Siu-Tung Ching. The story may contain many clichés but just about every film in this genre does to some degree. Jason Statham does a solid job as Farmer and there is solid support from Ron Perlman as Norick. Some people weren't too keen on Matthew Lillard's performance as Duke Fallow but I rather liked it; the character was never meant to be heroic in anyway. Not all the performances impressed though; I never bought Burt Reynolds as the king and the less said about Ray Liotta's Gallian the better... he was more camp than commanding; certainly he never looked a match for Statham. While the highlight of the films were the battle scenes there were other impressive moments; I particularly liked the mysterious women of the forest and the way they moved on long vines.

I never heard of him or his movies prior to today. I really wanted to hate this movie. I was going to do a whole ""forensic accounting"" style review talking about how he vaporized 60 million. Oh how I wanted to hate him. Oh, how I loved the comments. The one about how Scooby Doo should have a cameo, and all the ones complaining about every single thing in the movie. I loved the Japanese guy: ""I think {Uwe Boll} should get some education from whatever school he goes too and learns and relearns directing techniques to keep people interested in his movies."" Oh god, I laughed until I needed oxygen, all that home-spun Japanese decency. I was ready to pile on, and then, get this, I watched the movie.What I saw was a 120-million dollar movie delivered for 60-million. I was amazed. There were some shadows crossing actor's faces, but the cinematography was so good otherwise, I have to believe this was hip and intentional. How neo-postmodern. Decent score, decent acting, good audio, all around pretty good, plot not so hot.I know this movie was a flop. It barely moved the needle the first week, and fell off a cliff the second week. I know that Uwe must have offended some gamer Asperger sensibility, but I'll be darned if I can figure it out. Perhaps he respected women too much. Was he too socially adept? Viewers sure hate him for something. Yeah, it was goofy in places, but I liked it way better than any of the Lord of Rings movies, none of which I have been able to watch beginning-to-end. I try again every few years, maybe its time.Perhaps it was not goofy enough, I mean, maybe with this genre you do have to go full retard and have walking talking trees and flaming hemorrhoids in the sky, like Lord of the Rings. This movie was pretty mild, some particle effects, I thought rather well done. So maybe you have to have wildly implausible things to get a true following, like Scientology or Mormonism. Gosh knows it works for Lord of the Rings, talk about stupid stuff going on. That movie makes gold plates and personal planets look sane.As you can surmise, I am not too fond of this type of movie, so rather than push it into full retard mode, I would scale it back. You have to realize the demographic is not the 13-to-16 year old Howard Stern demo. Its the 8-to-12 Caucasian boy demo. Its a little tougher.Since mom and dad may well be at the theater, lets just take out Ray Liotta. I liked him, despite it looking like he just had a Botox enema, but all this mystic debbel crap will just get the parents looking at each other and going ""huh?"" Sad fact is that the antagonist goes from the hyena people at the beginning to Liotta at the end. So half the money shots are with Ray. Too bad, now we're in rewrite.Just as well, since the other problem is that 8-year-old Caucasian kids might idolize their brothers, and they still remember momma's breast feeding, but they really don't want to root for dad. So both Burt Reynolds and Statham are father figures in a movie trying to appeal to a demographic that is starting to resent and hate their fathers.OK, easy fix. The weaselly slightly effeminate son of the king--Lillard-- that is the guy the kids want to identify with, not Burt. So switch those two roles. Now the weaselly kid can be the boy regent hero, and Burt can be the evil vizier, like in Aladdin. Now we are right back to Boogey Nights and Burt is in his element. Leave Burt in it, or replace him with Statham, to get mom and dad into the movie. For Statham's character, same deal, instead of his son getting killed by the hyena people, let Statham get killed and have the son be avenger. Now the 8-year-old boy has a reason to watch, and to watch the endless sequels as well. I surf the web while I played the movie so a lot of it made no sense. It seemed like there were the hyena people so it started out like 7 Samuri/Magnificent 7. Then it went kind of Bronson/Walking Tall, which is just fine. But keep it with the hyena people, not Ray Liotta at the end, its too confusing for me, much less 8-year-olds. I loved the Tarzan Girls that dropped out of the trees. I was struck by how artistic and visual it was, while still being dirt cheap to film. Remember, they are not sex-objects to an 8-year-old, so give them bigger breasts to serve as momma reminders.That Ironboy.... ahhh...jethead---- ahhn no, Hellboy, that Hellboy guy was in the movie and he is always great. Not sure who he was or what he was doing, but keep him in for sure. With Liotta out, that should get the time closer to 90 minutes, that is another key thing to fix this.The mom character was way too old-- this is for 8-year-olds so she should be 25 tops. Wasn't the mom in the Stargate franchise? Gosh I love her from there, but sorry, ya gotta work the demo.So, switch Reynolds and Lillard's roles. Switch Statham and Ford's roles. Write out Liotta. Substitute any teen vampire fluff babe for Claire Forlani. (I now realize she is not the Stargate girl, Claudia Black, sorry ladies.) One kid dies from an arrow, the other kid saves his mom and the kingdom, 85 million domestic gross, but the action figures will haul in 40 million easy. Hellboy can be the kid's new daddy, how cool is that?",wanted hate it but is not bad,after seeing uwe boll whine about not getting his kickstarter money what prick he is i looked him up came here i never heard him or his movies prior today i really wanted hate this movie i was going do whole forensic accounting style review talking about how he vaporized 60 million oh how i wanted hate him oh how i loved comments one about how scooby doo should have cameo all ones complaining about every single thing movie i loved japanese guy i think uwe boll should get some education whatever school he goes too learns relearns directing techniques keep people interested his movies oh god i laughed until i needed oxygen all that home spun japanese decency i was ready pile then get this i watched movie what i saw was 120 million dollar movie delivered 60 million i was amazed there were some shadows crossing actors faces but cinematography was so good otherwise i have believe this was hip intentional how neo postmodern decent score decent acting good audio all around pretty good plot not so hot i know this movie was flop it barely moved needle first week fell off cliff second week i know that uwe must have offended some gamer asperger sensibility but ill be darned if i can figure it out perhaps he respected women too much was he too socially adept viewers sure hate him something yeah it was goofy places but i liked it way better than any lord rings movies none which i have been able watch beginning end i try again every few years maybe its time perhaps it was not goofy enough i mean maybe with this genre you do have go full retard have walking talking trees flaming hemorrhoids sky like lord rings this movie was pretty mild some particle effects i thought rather well done so maybe you have have wildly implausible things get true following like scientology or mormonism gosh knows it works lord rings talk about stupid stuff going that movie makes gold plates personal planets look sane as you can surmise i am not too fond this type movie so rather than push it into full retard mode i would scale it back you have realize demographic is not 13 16 year old howard stern demo its 8 12 caucasian boy demo its little tougher since mom dad may well be at theater lets just take out ray liotta i liked him despite it looking like he just had botox enema but all this mystic debbel crap will just get parents looking at each other going huh sad fact is that antagonist goes hyena people at beginning liotta at end so half money shots are with ray too bad now were rewrite just as well since other problem is that 8 year old caucasian kids might idolize their brothers they still remember mommas breast feeding but they really dont want root dad so both burt reynolds statham are father figures movie trying appeal demographic that is starting resent hate their fathers ok easy fix weaselly slightly effeminate son king lillard that is guy kids want identify with not burt so switch those two roles now weaselly kid can be boy regent hero burt can be evil vizier like aladdin now we are right back boogey nights burt is his element leave burt it or replace him with statham get mom dad into movie stathams character same deal instead his son getting killed by hyena people let statham get killed have son be avenger now 8 year old boy has reason watch watch endless sequels as well i surf web while i played movie so lot it made no sense it seemed like there were hyena people so it started out like 7 samuri magnificent 7 then it went kind bronson walking tall which is just fine but keep it with hyena people not ray liotta at end its too confusing me much less 8 year olds i loved tarzan girls that dropped out trees i was struck by how artistic visual it was while still being dirt cheap film remember they are not sex objects 8 year old so give them bigger breasts serve as momma reminders that ironboy ahhh jethead ahhn no hellboy that hellboy guy was movie he is always great not sure who he was or what he was doing but keep him sure with liotta out that should get time closer 90 minutes that is another key thing fix this mom character was way too old this is 8 year olds so she should be 25 tops wasnt mom stargate franchise gosh i love her there but sorry ya gotta work demo so switch reynolds lillards roles switch statham fords roles write out liotta substitute any teen vampire fluff babe claire forlani i now realize she is not stargate girl claudia black sorry ladies one kid dies arrow other kid saves his mom kingdom 85 million domestic gross but action figures will haul 40 million easy hellboy can be kids new daddy how cool is that,0.5248433857808859,0.05882034632034629,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"
3,"terrible, but entertaining","I saw this in the theater because it looked interesting, but I was disappointed. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible editing. It was basically just a rehashed made for TV fantasy that wound up in the movie theater. The plot line was like a super condensed version of lord of the rings without the magic, story, and allegories. The film starts and leaves the viewers wondering and doesn't explain the plot well. The editing is VERY choppy and amateurish. The actors looked bored and unexcited. The krugs were basically ORCs stolen from Lord of the Rings.I should have waited until it was dollar night. But for a couple of hours, it did fill some time.

1,It is astonishingly forgettable.,"I really have a love/hate relationship with Hollywood. So much in fact that I sometimes fantasize about going all-Rambo on the ""suits"". Film is not considered art anymore nowadays. It seems that whenever some lame-ass hack like Uwe Boll brings a film based on a video game to the big screen, the result is excremental (albeit from either his mouth or the other ""thing"" that, fortunately for you moviegoers, I won't mention to spare you the insanity). Boll's resume of films should have indicated to moviegoers that this ""film"" is gonna suck. And I can never understand why the hell Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds are in this POS? I guess money goes a long way of snorting cocaine at the end of a ""hard days work"" should suffice but the latter states the obvious. With that being said, doing that provides ""remedial"" relief for the actors and critics who presumably were subjected to Boll's unique brand of ""film making"" which I'm sure gave them the feeling of being like Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"" forced to watch unspeakable horror.If you are a bright, meek, intelligent individual, skip this excrement of Uwe Boll. If, however, you've never understood the meaning of ""curiosity killed the cat"" and went to see this anyway, you may suddenly find yourself in a catatonic state were there's very little chance of recovery. Spare yourself from this fate. I beg you. It's for your own good.",it is astonishingly forgettable,i really have love hate relationship with hollywood so much fact that i sometimes fantasize about going all rambo suits film is not considered art anymore nowadays it seems that whenever some lame ass hack like uwe boll brings film based video game big screen result is excremental albeit either his mouth or other thing that fortunately you moviegoers i wont mention spare you insanity bolls resume films should have indicated moviegoers that this film is gonna suck i can never understand why hell ray liotta burt reynolds are this pos i guess money goes long way snorting cocaine at end hard days work should suffice but latter states obvious with that being said doing that provides remedial relief actors critics who presumably were subjected bolls unique brand film making which im sure gave them feeling being like alex delarge clockwork orange forced watch unspeakable horror if you are bright meek intelligent individual skip this excrement uwe boll if however youve never understood meaning curiosity killed cat went see this anyway you may suddenly find yourself catatonic state were theres very little chance recovery spare yourself this fate i beg you its your own good,0.5242222222222224,0.06258333333333331,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
