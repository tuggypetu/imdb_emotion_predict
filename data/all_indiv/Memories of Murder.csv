,The Shaman's Eyes,"Joon-ho Bong directs ""Memories of Murder"". A police procedural, the film's first act flows along conventional lines. Here a murder takes place and detective Park Doo-Man is assigned to the case. He's a hotshot cop, hardworking and determined, who thinks he can spot a criminal simply by ""looking into their eyes"". Joon-ho Bong, however, repeatedly questions Park's abilities. Early in the film, for example, Park's commander points at two men at the far side of a room and asks Park to pick out the criminal. Park looks deeply into each man's eyes, but before he gives his answer, the director cuts to black. We assume that Park has picked the right guy.But 20 minutes into the film, and our faith in Park begins to crumble. Indeed, he begins to come across as a bit of an idiot. He's deeply superstitious, relies on fortune tellers, believes in hunches, and is highly insecure.At this point the film introduces another detective. His name is Sae Yoon, and he's been assigned to help Park on his case. The film's second act is thus a repetition of the first act, Sae Yoon re-enacting all the scenes that we just witnessed Park do. The way Park handles the film's first crime scene is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles the film's second crime scene. The way Park handles an interrogation is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles an interrogation. In seeing how a methodical, clever and genuinely skilled detective like Sae Yoon handles his job, the audience is forced to reconsider their views of Park. Maybe Park wasn't a hotshot cop after all. The juxtaposition between the way the two men handle the film's first two murders forces us to re-evaluate our perceptions.This notion of reassessing what our eyes see, is constant throughout the film. A mentally ill kid seems like a likely suspect, but is actually not. A local pervert seems like the killer, but is actually a caring husband. An effeminate loner may be the rapist, but DNA samples prove otherwise. Detective Sae Yoon, himself a ""by the books"" cop, eventually becomes a violent, loose cannon, determined to throw away rules and regulations based on a hunch, whilst Park, the very cop who consults shamans and witch doctors and stages false confessions, becomes the film's voice of law-abiding righteousness.And so it is the way the film's characters are constantly in a state of moral flux that makes ""Memories of Murder"" so exciting. The audience is constantly asked to ""look the characters in the eyes"" and reassess what they're seeing.But what makes the film great is its ending. If surface perceptions are inadequate, then how can we truly understand another human being? If personal emotions get in the way of objective truth, how can we ever trust our own acuity? And so because the criminal is never identified or caught, suddenly everyone is guilty. There can be no closure because everyone, police included, is implicated. Watch how the director contrasts the film's first shot (the innocence of a child's face) with the film's final shot (the retired face of detective Frank staring down the camera and directly at the audience). Frank's catch phrase, ""look into my eyes"", now takes on a whole new level of meaning. He's a cop again, and everyone including we the audience are now under suspicion. And so while most serial killer films end with closure, or in the case of the recent ""Zodiac"", with the comfortable knowledge that our killer is now old and largely impotent, ""Memories of Murder"" leaves us on a note of profound paranoia. We're left uncomfortable, disturbed, and everyone now seems a potential suspect. 8.5/10 – Though it isn't brave enough to stray far from genre conventions, this is a stylish, engrossing film.

9.0,The Slow Development of a Masterpiece,"This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since ""Insomnia,"" and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since ""Seven."" But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.",slow development masterpiece,this is probably best crime thriller ive seen since insomnia contains most haunting climax any serial killer flick since seven but like most films reaching greatness this is most admirable its striking details filmmakers here craft taut careful delicately strung together motion picture that relishes its amazing development mood place character first mood haunting cinematography rain falling small village at night shadows darting across thick field grass figures lurking woods masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene foot poignant music score aided by creepy use korean pop song that accompanies each murder no nonsense direction peppered with fabulous doses comic relief how shakespearan keep film more more intriguing at each turn fascinating watch second place south korea circa late 1980s apparently under some sort militia rule this is inspired by true story koreas first publicized still unsolved serial killer case this unique time place serves as wonderful respite typical american big city setting so many other films this ilk finally character development small details revealing haunted souls detectives case is nothing short brilliant witness tiny executions minutae cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not leave scars when he kick boxes suspects into submission harried chief police checking his own blood pressure while trying keep his off cuff detectives line or fighting keep headline starved reporters at bay young female officer desperately trying showcase her abilities crime solving between serving chauvinistic detectives cups fresh coffee outsider detective seouls insistence that documents never lie brutal irony at climax that challenges his entire sense being main village detectives scathing speech difference between american fbi agents koren policemen beauty is details this film like all great ones revels their uncovering one flaw is that some might find film bit long tooth but this is not be missed fans serial killer thrillers police procedural movies korean filmmakers amazing cast this is their master stroke,0.5959935897435897,0.1735576923076923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Great serial killer drama,"I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.",great serial killer drama,im one those people who tend think that south korean movies are perhaps bit too slow paced my taste memories murder isnt fast paced film by any means but this time slow pace made this movie about investigation serial killings so much better than 95 its american counterparts essentially memories murder is drama first with thriller comedy elements yes first hour or so movie is actually quite funny kang ho song sang kyung kim are brilliant as two cops who have drastically different views how solve crime character development is fascinating believable thanks great script highly recommended,0.5087037037037037,0.2727777777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.57, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.1}"
8.0,Must See,"After two women are found dead in a rural community, a detective arrives from the big city to help out. Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.Whether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Korea's first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.On top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950's.This is brilliant brilliant film-making.I've given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, I'm still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it?

8.0,the crime is solved - decades later,"Greetings again from the darkness. Between 1986 and 1991, 10 women were raped and brutally murdered in the province of Gyeong-gi outside Seoul. Considered South Korea's first serial killer case, the crime went unsolved until 2019. The case was the inspiration for writer-director Bong Joon Ho's second feature film, as was Kwang-rim Kim's play, ""Come to See Me"". Director Bong Joon Ho co-wrote the screenplay with Sung-bo Shim, and of course, went on to win an Oscar for PARASITE (2019), in addition to providing other popular features such as OKJA (2017), SNOWPIERCER (2013), and THE HOST (2006). This early film can be compared to David Fincher's ZODIAC (2007), although this one is a blend of murder mystery, crime thriller, black comedy, and political commentary.Kang-ho Song (PARASITE) stars as Park, a local detective called to the scene of the first victim. Almost immediately we can tell Park and the police force are borderline incompetent. Park is convinced he has ""Shaman eyes"" and can identify the guilty party simply by looking at them. Of course, this is ridiculous and is proven so on a few occasions. Park's partner, Detective Jo, is a hothead who takes a heavy-handed approach to interrogation (though he later experiences true karma). When a second victim is discovered, a more seasoned professional, Detective Seo, arrives from Seoul. In contrast to Park's gut-feeling approach, Seo puts faith in evidence, proclaiming, ""Documents never lie"". These two detectives are at the core of the story and we watch as each evolves.The film begins on October 23, 1986 as the body of the first victim is found. We witness how the crime scene is immediately corrupted by both cops and local kids. This is also our indoctrination to how the filmmaker is treating this much differently than most crime dramas. A stream of suspects Park refers to as ""punks"" are paraded through the station, but true chaos ensues at the scene of the second body. We can't help but be relieved when a professional, big city detective arrives. Bits of evidence are slowly assembled - red clothes, rainy nights, a song on the radio - each may play a role in the actions of the killer. Frustration builds as more murders occur and the detectives are unable to pin down the perpetrator.The mental and physical toll that detectives endure with such a case are on full display. The obsession with finding the murderer never ends and the fantastic ending proves that even a career change doesn't erase the failure. We are inundated with crime thrillers these days, but it's difficult to grasp how this masterpiece was put together by a director whose career was just getting started. Certainly today we recognize the brilliance of Bong Joon Ho, but this was 17 years ago! It plays as a time capsule of South Korea socially and politically in 1986, and it works on that level every bit as much as a crime thriller. Cinematographer Hyung Koo Kim (THE HOST) balances the crime scenes with the police station, as well as the telling facial expressions of the characters. Last year's solving of these horrific crimes pushed this classic into release, and it's well worth a watch.",crime is solved decades later,greetings again darkness between 1986 1991 10 women were raped brutally murdered province gyeong gi outside seoul considered south koreas first serial killer case crime went unsolved until 2019 case was inspiration writer director bong joon hos second feature film as was kwang rim kims play come see me director bong joon ho co wrote screenplay with sung bo shim course went win oscar parasite 2019 addition providing other popular features such as okja 2017 snowpiercer 2013 host 2006 this early film can be compared david finchers zodiac 2007 although this one is blend murder mystery crime thriller black comedy political commentary kang ho song parasite stars as park local detective called scene first victim almost immediately we can tell park police force are borderline incompetent park is convinced he has shaman eyes can identify guilty party simply by looking at them course this is ridiculous is proven so few occasions parks partner detective jo is hothead who takes heavy handed approach interrogation though he later experiences true karma when second victim is discovered more seasoned professional detective seo arrives seoul contrast parks gut feeling approach seo puts faith evidence proclaiming documents never lie these two detectives are at core story we watch as each evolves film begins october 23 1986 as body first victim is found we witness how crime scene is immediately corrupted by both cops local kids this is also our indoctrination how filmmaker is treating this much differently than most crime dramas stream suspects park refers as punks are paraded through station but true chaos ensues at scene second body we cant help but be relieved when professional big city detective arrives bits evidence are slowly assembled red clothes rainy nights song radio each may play role actions killer frustration builds as more murders occur detectives are unable pin down perpetrator mental physical toll that detectives endure with such case are full display obsession with finding murderer never ends fantastic ending proves that even career change doesnt erase failure we are inundated with crime thrillers these days but its difficult grasp how this masterpiece was put together by director whose career was just getting started certainly today we recognize brilliance bong joon ho but this was 17 years ago it plays as time capsule south korea socially politically 1986 it works that level every bit as much as crime thriller cinematographer hyung koo kim host balances crime scenes with police station as well as telling facial expressions characters last years solving these horrific crimes pushed this classic into release its well worth watch,0.33566639299397927,0.01696086480569238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,nothing prepares me for this masterpiece,"I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters.

7.0,A Gritty Murder Mystery with Political and Social Overtones,"""Memories of Murder (Salinui chueok)"" is an involving, cross-cultural take on the ""L.A. Confidential"" noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter, layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered, from ""Prime Suspect"" on.While co-writer/director Joon-ho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie, sometimes simplistically for comic effect, he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986, the film visually captures the changes in industrializing, modernizing and politically restive South Korea, where new, dark, noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of ""Witness,"" we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough ""CSI""s to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Cops-incompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures ""evidence."" Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an old-fashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect -- and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law, it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation, as his thug partner, who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White, gets as out of control as a cartoonish ""Lethal Weapon"" cop, and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure. Their complicit boss just seems ineffectual as he's clearly over his head with this kind of murder investigation.But through the background TV broadcasts of demonstrations and civil defense alerts and drills, we gather that their interrogation procedures were more developed through oppressing political dissidents and forcing confessions than professional criminal detective work. Ironically, they ultimately can't get the resources they need in this difficult case because of these politically-drummed up time-consumers, especially for manpower and sophisticated forensic tools that they have to beg from the FBI.The film changes tone and settles down into an intellectual thriller as a classic big city detective is sent from Seoul, and we have some of the interchanges we've seen in ""In the Heat of the Night"" and in ""Insomnia,"" as the first cop now seems even more of a simpleton in his standard operating procedures of relying on his knowledge of the locals and instincts about human nature (though even a fellow officer teases him about whether he can tell apart a rapist and victim's brother), while the city guy is looking and listening for clues and real evidence, like a Korean ""Dalziel and Pascoe."" But the tension is ramped up as the killer keeps killing  and the film starts showing us the murders as they are about to happen just as the cops are getting hints about his modus operandi and even after the police are on alert. Their frustration at not being able to stop him is grippingly conveyed by the lead actors, as each starts to abandon their usual procedures out of mounting frustration, and by the editing.A droll side bar is that the macho team is given a key clue by a policewoman who they otherwise relegate to getting them refreshments. Their macho attitudes also keep them from learning vital clues from the marginalized men they pick up as suspects.The coda in contemporary Korea is effective, reinforcing a sense of societal complicity is letting such murders happen and go on, though I was curious what happened to the city cop as well as the local guy.

10.0,A Masterpiece that you cannot miss,"Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon-Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du-Man (Song Kang-Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong-Gu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae-Yun (Kim Sang-Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park - methodical and rational - and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye', suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon-Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's A-list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time.

10.0,Walking in Dangerous Rain,"Since a synopsis would be redundant here, I'll confine myself to praise alone.Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate. I watched this movie yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Everything taking place on screen was riveting, from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain, to a wild chase by three desperate detectives. This movie held me in thrall.As a new viewer of Asian movies, I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer. I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players. They seem to be people first, actors by choice, and stars, by the public making them so.In Memories of Murder, I saw this human factor almost too painfully. By the end of the story, I was in tears. Even now, the mood prevails. It's been so long since these crimes took place, and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved, but I think it's the case, and I think about that, and how frustrating it still must be to those who worked on the case.The actors have become the people in my mind, and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually, is heartbreaking. When one relates to the inroads made on the health; mental and physical; of the detectives, who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case, you realize that you've watched something that is historic. You have seen the probable truth.The way this movie draws you into it, so that you are walking through dangerous rain, with a warning shout in your throat, points to the brilliance of the director and the players.It is difficult to say, ""I love this movie"", just as it is hard to say, I love Silence of the Lambs, because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.But yes, I love it for the fact that during it, I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of sirens blaring, military dictatorship, and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer. I landed back here in this time and place with a thud, only after turning off the DVD player, and going to the kitchen for a glass of water. While I was caught there mentally---I felt the desperation, and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives, who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.There are not many movies that can time-travel you into their present. This will do it.I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars (all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind) in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.These are incredibly interesting people, and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful. They're intelligent, educated and articulate. The younger members of the cast, the less seasoned, are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.They definitely did it right. They were wonderful, and they thanked the interviewer. How lovely that was to see.I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity.

8.0,"""This time be realistic, like in a movie.""","Starting out I didn't know how to take this movie. The senior police detective is out planting evidence, his belligerent sidekick routinely beats and tortures suspects, and people brought in for questioning admit to crimes they're completely innocent of. It's all very disorienting and doesn't make a lot of sense until about the second half of the movie when the detectives hunker down and involve themselves in routine but exhausting police work.Regarding planted evidence, feeble minded suspect Kwang-ho (No-shik Park) might have been able to out Detective Park (Kang-ho Song) for his dishonest methods if he'd been able to differentiate the underside of his left foot sneaker with the picture the detective showed him of a right shoe footprint. If you go back and check that scene, you'll see that the physical shoe couldn't have made the print in the 'evidence'. The correct sneaker would have made a reverse image print in the dirt.It's kind of ironic actually that the big break in the case occurs because a lowly female desk officer makes a connection between a sad song played on a radio station and rainy nights when a serial killer's murders occur. This while Detective Park is crystallizing his theory about crazy hairless men (trust me, you have to catch that!).When everything finally comes together and the detective on loan Seo Tae-yoon (Sang-kyung Kim) closes in on the suspected serial killer, the rug is pulled out from under him and the viewer with the information from America that the DNA sample sent in is not conclusive. It points to another irony in as much as Seo's insistence on the infallibility of 'written documents' is torn to shreds. At that point, one feels helpless over Park Hyeon-gyu's (Hae-il Park) get away, since most of the circumstantial evidence pointed to him as the killer.I didn't know this film was about a real life serial killer case that went unsolved in South Korea in the Nineties.

With this film, Memories of Murder, he's more than that now. As one goes through this tight murder mystery, based more on character and on the frustration of a clear pattern of a killer who makes it just a little too hard for the detectives to track down, you forget about the world around you or the time and just focus in on this story, of the grim line that delineates how to find a serial killer. Maybe it's because Joon-Ho knew that he was making a movie about the first ever serial killer in South Korea that he had to make it this way, about clash between inexperience and professionalism and right and wrong that's demonstrated here.It's not an action movie, but a character study, as non-conventional in its outcome or in its style as something like Fincher's films Se7en and Zodiac (for the former there's even so much as a specific shot and scene that is lovingly ripped-off, and the latter, well, just see the results of the case to know what I mean). It's the story of a series of rape/murders in a rural area of South Korea during a time of military dictatorship (watch out those 'citizen' alarms!), where women are being murdered and all in a pattern: wearing a red item of clothing, when it's raining, and when a specific and *sad* song is requested and played on the radio. While the local detectives Park Doo-Man and Cho Yong-koo try and shake down a confession out of a couple of suspects, one obviously mentally retarded, a seemingly hot-shot cop out of Seoul, Seo Tae-Yoon, comes in to help with the investigation and practically takes it over since he is, frankly, best at the job. This is not without some protest from the other detectives, of course, who feel threatened by their means of (nasty) interrogation to get a confession.One of the things that marks this as a departure from a lot of familiar serial killer mystery movies in America is the nature of the characters and how they relate to each other. Take the interrogation scenes early on: would you see in a typical movie an interrogation of a suspect where the suspect starts to go along with the detectives' premise just to get the hell out of the room? It's all about the details in the way the scenes are played out, how specifically and different Song and Kim play their roles, even as they're in the same profession and wanting the same end goal.Bong Joon-Ho also gives actors in small parts some fantastic scenes, such as the actor playing the mentally challenged man, or even the woman who somehow escaped the murderer's grasp but didn't see his face. And we get a real sense of these characters as having real conflicts and lives outside of this- sometimes with humor like Park's attempt to find a ""hairless man"" suspect at a sauna, or with some dark and violent ways like detective Cho who meets a nasty fate after a bar fight. Barely anyone is just two-dimensional, and even the main suspect-killer in the second half plays his blank-faced part perfectly.The characters all work, and the scenario is played out in a superior style (or if nothing else than with efficiency and a clear eye for details in the case arising naturally and without unnecessary melodrama), and on top of this the film looks gorgeous. Joon-Ho and his DP shoot and shoot away, getting some fantastic shots in these fields of the 'Boondocks' where the detectives find the bodies, or in the rain, or in a short burst in slow-motion that is just the right touch. A similar approach to artistry could be found in the Host, where an attention to light and dark and how to paint black and night scenes don't mare anything with the story itself. Particularly haunting is how he films the glimpses of the killer's-scenes-at-work, or in that masterful climax at the railroad tracks at the tunnel. By the end of the film, we don't know for sure if it's all entirely the truth and the whole truth (based on a true case), but it attains a hyper-reality that one can't shake off once it ends. It's a chilling tale that needs to be told, about the dire straits of breaking ground and not everything falling in to place.",gripping sad dark coming but dramatic superior serial killer flick,bong joon ho is director that i knew little about back 2006 when i saw his wildly entertaining monster movie host i had only seen that one film him but kept him mind as someone good korean film world that is someone not chanwook park or kim ki duk with this film memories murder hes more than that now as one goes through this tight murder mystery based more character frustration clear pattern killer who makes it just little too hard detectives track down you forget about world around you or time just focus this story grim line that delineates how find serial killer maybe its because joon ho knew that he was making movie about first ever serial killer south korea that he had make it this way about clash between inexperience professionalism right wrong thats demonstrated here its not action movie but character study as non conventional its outcome or its style as something like finchers films se7en zodiac former theres even so much as specific shot scene that is lovingly ripped off latter well just see results case know what i mean its story series rape murders rural area south korea during time military dictatorship watch out those citizen alarms where women are being murdered all pattern wearing red item clothing when its raining when specific sad song is requested played radio while local detectives park doo man cho yong koo try shake down confession out couple suspects one obviously mentally retarded seemingly hot shot cop out seoul seo tae yoon comes help with investigation practically takes it over since he is frankly best at job this is not without some protest other detectives course who feel threatened by their means nasty interrogation get confession one things that marks this as departure lot familiar serial killer mystery movies america is nature characters how they relate each other take interrogation scenes early would you see typical movie interrogation suspect where suspect starts go along with detectives premise just get hell out room its all about details way scenes are played out how specifically different song kim play their roles even as theyre same profession wanting same end goal bong joon ho also gives actors small parts some fantastic scenes such as actor playing mentally challenged man or even woman who somehow escaped murderers grasp but didnt see his face we get real sense these characters as having real conflicts lives outside this sometimes with humor like parks attempt find hairless man suspect at sauna or with some dark violent ways like detective cho who meets nasty fate after bar fight barely anyone is just two dimensional even main suspect killer second half plays his blank faced part perfectly characters all work scenario is played out superior style or if nothing else than with efficiency clear eye details case arising naturally without unnecessary melodrama top this film looks gorgeous joon ho his dp shoot shoot away getting some fantastic shots these fields boondocks where detectives find bodies or rain or short burst slow motion that is just right touch similar approach artistry could be found host where attention light dark how paint black night scenes dont mare anything with story itself particularly haunting is how he films glimpses killers scenes at work or that masterful climax at railroad tracks at tunnel by end film we dont know sure if its all entirely truth whole truth based true case but it attains hyper reality that one cant shake off once it ends its chilling tale that needs be told about dire straits breaking ground not everything falling place,0.4911974789915965,0.028643790849673202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.48}"
9.0,Jarringly disturbing and haunting film,"I have long since heard of the excellence of this korean movie on koreanfilm.org, but it was only after reading the review in detail and realizing that the score was written by Taro Ishiwaro ( a well known Japanese musician who also wrote scores for Shohei Imamura and Japanese TV serials, including The Inanimate World ), and that the DOP was Kim Hyung-gu (who also shot Musa, One Fine Spring Day and Chen Kaige's Together) that it stumped on me I was indeed missing a masterpiece.And a masterpiece it is, one deeply haunting and disturbing asian crime thriller. The mood invoked during the last few minutes of the film is something you would probably never forget.Watch this film not only for its cinematic brilliance, but also because of the mezmerising score written by Taro Ishiwaro, track no 29 on the OST the favourite on my list.",jarringly disturbing haunting film,i have long since heard excellence this korean movie koreanfilm org but it was only after reading review detail realizing that score was written by taro ishiwaro well known japanese musician who also wrote scores shohei imamura japanese tv serials including inanimate world that dop was kim hyung gu who also shot musa one fine spring day chen kaiges together that it stumped me i was indeed missing masterpiece masterpiece it is one deeply haunting disturbing asian crime thriller mood invoked during last few minutes film is something you would probably never forget watch this film not only its cinematic brilliance but also because mezmerising score written by taro ishiwaro track no 29 ost favourite my list,0.37976190476190474,-0.07380952380952381,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.26, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.16}"
5.0,I was let down by the high ratings....,"I love Asian cinema, and good movies of many genres from across the world. I think Korea has some of the best new films I've seen in years, compared to the dead drivel oozing from America and Hollywood these days. Admiral: Roaring Currents is a good example, as is Outlaws, and there are several epic drug or detective dramas and serial killer thrillers like ""I Saw the Devil""--- absolute masterpieces, or at the least, excitingly different takes on modern thrillers. There are many others I can't remember by name, but you get the point. I enjoyed ""Outlaws"" the other night, which has a 7 rating, so when I saw that this film has over 8, I was thrilled. I had contemplated watching it for some time, and even got my wife to watch(she is not nearly as into foreign flicks, but enjoyed the Handmaiden and a few other horrors or thrillers from Asia.Anyway, this was intriguing, and had the potential to be very spooky and chilling. I just found that the direction they took with this made everyone seem humorous, disjointed, and inept idiots. The local cops are so unbelievably lazy and stupid that it ruins the realism. The pacing is bad, and way too slow or comedic for such heavy material in places. I was really hoping for a big twist, only to be let down by a ""it could be anyone, even you"" ending for finding the killer. There are many holes in logic in this movie, and I really need to read what the true story is based on-- because this surely cannot be the full true story. There are interesting moments, and the cinematography and music are quite haunting in places. The 8.3 or whatever score is a bit absurd, though. I can name at least 5 Korean films that are ranked lower than this one, but are extremely better in action, pacing, acting, script, and payoff. Worth a watch, but I was fooled by the over-the-top ratings and hype surrounding this film.",i was let down by high ratings,i love asian cinema good movies many genres across world i think korea has some best new films ive seen years compared dead drivel oozing america hollywood these days admiral roaring currents is good example as is outlaws there are several epic drug or detective dramas serial killer thrillers like i saw devil absolute masterpieces or at least excitingly different takes modern thrillers there are many others i cant remember by name but you get point i enjoyed outlaws other night which has 7 rating so when i saw that this film has over 8 i was thrilled i had contemplated watching it some time even got my wife watch she is not nearly as into foreign flicks but enjoyed handmaiden few other horrors or thrillers asia anyway this was intriguing had potential be very spooky chilling i just found that direction they took with this made everyone seem humorous disjointed inept idiots local cops are so unbelievably lazy stupid that it ruins realism pacing is bad way too slow or comedic such heavy material places i was really hoping big twist only be let down by it could be anyone even you ending finding killer there are many holes logic this movie i really need read what true story is based because this surely cannot be full true story there are interesting moments cinematography music are quite haunting places 8 3 or whatever score is bit absurd though i can name at least 5 korean films that are ranked lower than this one but are extremely better action pacing acting script payoff worth watch but i was fooled by over top ratings hype surrounding this film,0.48513822434875065,0.10017986886407938,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,Memories of Murder,"Two rural detectives, their chief & a well-educated Seoul detective search for a serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains, using their own undergarments to bound and strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies. We watch as the rural detectives, who often use rough tactics to secure their admittance of guilt from those they question, try to find the killer and how the effected the city detective is when attempts to catch him often fail. We see their dogged, weary pursuit of suspects and the exhaustive, emotional let-down when each is ruled out by one way or another. When a possible suspect emerges, and seems the ideal candidate fitting the profile of the rapist who nearly murdered one living victim(..and also requested a specific song only on the nights the murders took place, not to mention the fact that he started working at a factory right before the murders), they believe that their misery might finally end as they await a DNA semen report from America possibly pinpointing him as the murderer. But, is this suspect the murderer, and better yet, can the rural detectives keep from exploding in anger when they interrogate the suspect? It'll all come to a head when the city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep on his watch and yet another young woman is horribly butchered in a much more heinous manner during one of the town's common blackouts..the detective will take his suspect to an isolated location claiming him guilty even though the American lab results may say otherwise.Powerful, haunting, gut-wrenching, & heartbreaking..we see how these men fail at their methods despite giving their heart and souls to the case day after day. Developed obsessions with possibly suspects even have the detectives at each others' throats. The film is quite absorbing as we see how each detective loses a bit of their humanity as they cripple at the leads that fail them or at an eyewitness who perishes accidentally during a horrible train accident. The Korean leads all bring much to their roles..during the film each character is fleshed out and exposed of their flaws at trying desperately to catch a killer against many odds such as unavailable forensic techniques or civilians trampling over crime scenes. Beautifully crafted by director Joon-ho Bong who adds many humorous bits sprinkled throughout so that the achingly tragic story will not be such a burden to sit through. Bong respects the victims by not dwelling on the murdered bodies too long.",memories murder,two rural detectives their chief well educated seoul detective search serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains using their own undergarments bound strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies we watch as rural detectives who often use rough tactics secure their admittance guilt those they question try find killer how effected city detective is when attempts catch him often fail we see their dogged weary pursuit suspects exhaustive emotional let down when each is ruled out by one way or another when possible suspect emerges seems ideal candidate fitting profile rapist who nearly murdered one living victim also requested specific song only nights murders took place not mention fact that he started working at factory right before murders they believe that their misery might finally end as they await dna semen report america possibly pinpointing him as murderer but is this suspect murderer better yet can rural detectives keep exploding anger when they interrogate suspect itll all come head when city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep his watch yet another young woman is horribly butchered much more heinous manner during one towns common blackouts detective will take his suspect isolated location claiming him guilty even though american lab results may say otherwise powerful haunting gut wrenching heartbreaking we see how these men fail at their methods despite giving their heart souls case day after day developed obsessions with possibly suspects even have detectives at each others throats film is quite absorbing as we see how each detective loses bit their humanity as they cripple at leads that fail them or at eyewitness who perishes accidentally during horrible train accident korean leads all bring much their roles during film each character is fleshed out exposed their flaws at trying desperately catch killer against many odds such as unavailable forensic techniques or civilians trampling over crime scenes beautifully crafted by director joon ho bong who adds many humorous bits sprinkled throughout so that achingly tragic story will not be such burden sit through bong respects victims by not dwelling murdered bodies too long,0.5613267770876467,0.004770531400966192,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.43}"
