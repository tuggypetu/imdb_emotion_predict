10.0,A cinematic bad boy,"Oldboy really is an odd movie. It's totally unconventional, completely original, and unlike anything else you'll probably find out there, even in the realms of Asian cinema. To say too much would be to spoil the ride, but this is a film where you'll always be guessing what's going to happen next and never quite sure what's really going on.It's a bleak, dark movie that begins very well indeed and stays strong throughout. Chan-wook Park is an expert director and really handles everything well. He's blessed with a superior leading man in Choi Min-sik, the kind of actor who gives his all to the movie, no restraint, no mild-mannered acting here...he lives and breathes the role and you believe in him at all times. Kang Hye-jeong, starring opposite him as love interest Mido, is also very effective, completely lovely and just right for her role.As for the story... wow. This movie has a brilliant script that constantly surprises you right up until the very last scene. Twists are commonplace these days, but the one found here is the most shocking I've ever seen. OLDBOY has it all, really. A great story unveiled in a leisurely way, piece by piece, no hurry. Touches of the surreal â€“ the disgusting octopus-eating scene is everything you'd imagine it to be. Great acting, great technical aspects. There's violence too, of course. The tooth-pulling torture is probably the most squirm-inducing bit, but the highlight for me is the one-take corridor battle which has to be seen to be believed. One guy with a hammer versus twenty hoods...well, watch it and find out what happens.By the time the ending comes and you find out why Oh Dae-su was imprisoned, you realise you're watching a masterwork of cinema. It's not an easy film to sit through by any means, but it is affecting and it is very well made indeed. Challenging, gut-punching and outrageous: OLDBOY is one of the bad boys of our time.",cinematic bad boy,oldboy really is odd movie its totally unconventional completely original unlike anything else youll probably find out there even realms asian cinema say too much would be spoil ride but this is film where youll always be guessing whats going happen next never quite sure whats really going its bleak dark movie that begins very well indeed stays strong throughout chan wook park is expert director really handles everything well hes blessed with superior leading man choi min sik kind actor who gives his all movie no restraint no mild mannered acting here he lives breathes role you believe him at all times kang hye jeong starring opposite him as love interest mido is also very effective completely lovely just right her role as story wow this movie has brilliant script that constantly surprises you right up until very last scene twists are commonplace these days but one found here is most shocking ive ever seen oldboy has it all really great story unveiled leisurely way piece by piece no hurry touches surreal disgusting octopus eating scene is everything youd imagine it be great acting great technical aspects theres violence too course tooth pulling torture is probably most squirm inducing bit but highlight me is one take corridor battle which has be seen be believed one guy with hammer versus twenty hoods well watch it find out what happens by time ending comes you find out why oh dae su was imprisoned you realise youre watching masterwork cinema its not easy film sit through by any means but it is affecting it is very well made indeed challenging gut punching outrageous oldboy is one bad boys our time,0.5643253968253968,0.11385822510822509,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Excellent in it's sickness,"I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10",excellent its sickness,i looked at program today i saw movie oldboy i read plot i liked it what i expected is decent thriller very good south korean cinematography something like salinui chueok but once again i was wrong oldboy is masterpiece so unusual all other movies ive seen lots violence screen me this isnt nothing new but i think that people under 18 really shouldnt watch this one its because movie is brutal i dont think that younger ones would fully understand this one say something about plot is quite impossible because i dont know where begin if i start talking about movie i could tell few important things i know that people often read other comments because they didnt watch that movie so im going say only what i read before watching this movie his daughters birthday oh dae su gets drunk soon hes arrested by police his best friend no joo hwan somehow manages get him out jail when no joo hwan is making phone call oh dae su disappears someone kidnaps him puts him into room during 15 long years but one day hes released thats plot very interesting you should watch this movie then judge it by rating imdb this movie is top 250 movies now i can understand why this plot that i wrote doesnt reveal greatness people who wrote script i bow them because this movie is so good with all those twists it really represents whole new wave making movie writing script acting it about direction actors i can say only good things director park chan wook won prize grand jury at cannes thats enough about direction part about actors i can say that im impressed by one actor choi min sik hes amazing major role he showed great potential i hope i will see him again some good movie i cannot say anything more because i could reveal some secret i dont wanna do that all new viewers only recommendation beautiful intelligent masterpiece movie that i highly recommend everyone with strong stomach too all you who want see one excellent but sick story 10 10,0.647724567099567,0.22678413600288605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,If only we were all living in Asia....,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!",if only we were all living asia,start off this is one only film that kept me quiet whole 5 mins after seeing it i literally couldnt close my mouth yet there wasnt any sound coming out it oldboy had such impact me that words are too little describe that impact therefore this film is definitely my top 3 films ever made it belongs there because it has massive ingredient that lot films seem miss out divine plot even though acting screenplay are world class plot is really cherry cake when it comes screenplay park chan wook is unique at least western standards his way filming colours are so vivid it seems like he wanted every shot be piece art one tip if you like shooting oldboy have look at sympathy lady vengeance third part parks revenge trilogy its even superior camera work oldboy dont however expect story like oldboys because you would be very disappointed when it comes acting music this film is also one better films ever made music sticks your head every time i put my oldboy dvd theme song comes up im just flooded with good memories even though plot doesnt have single reason be happy about characters are also presented very well by outstanding cast especially choi min sik yu ji tae set very convincing performance i really appreciate this film being respected as it should be by having place top 250 if however it was up me it would be even higher ranking i dont see why films like usual suspects or memento which are fantastic pieces film making which without doubt deserve place top 250 are higher top 250 than oldboy they serve same cause fantastic plot but those plots cant stand shadow or even come close plot oldboy one only reason is that those two films are better known western production company if we were all living asia no doubt oldboy would be top 20 all time my advice people who havent watched this film yet go see it this is definitely must see if you have weak stomach pull yourself together still watch it dont be as shallow as lot people here tend be look beyond violence see things i mentioned before world class acting cinematography music last but certainly not least plot once youve opened yourself up youll find whole new world cinema enjoy,0.5133766233766232,0.16488203463203469,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"

9.0,A couple of answers that may be useful to understand this film better!!,"Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.I hope my talk helps.",couple answers that may be useful understand this film better,hi i am south korean national student here london would like give you some clues why main character oh dae soo was kept private prison exactly 15 years why he ate live octopus as i hope you all understand this film little better firstly his wife was killed one year after his being kept privately run prison obviously oh dae soo didnt kill her but was suspected murdering her it must be done by lee yu jin who planned have his sisters revenge upon oh dae soo south korea criminals unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven overlooked by law 15 years after crimes were committed which means murder suspect wouldnt be charged or get punished unless suspect is caught within 15 years after murder this is why oh dae soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed thus he wouldnt be disturbed by police investigation lee yu jin could play with him at his own discretion secondly nobody country eats live octopus like way he ate film it seems me that scene shows his uncontrollable anger against man who he talked with phone didnt say anything about reasons why he was kept prison if there was piece cake or bowl rice front him i guess he would probably eat it same way he did with octopus so please dont get it wrong that eating something alive is part korean culture it should be understood itself that extreme context i saw this film several times with my friends i didnt quite understand it first view but came like it second time its one my favourites now i like complicated plot shocking ending as im studying translation english korean most my classmates friends are english who spent some time south korean they liked this one most among other korean films i hope my talk helps,0.390909090909091,0.0349058769513315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,Didn't like it much at all,"Armond White of the NY Press has called it a ""virtuosic stupid movie"". I think that's exactly right.Certainly the movie looks fantastic. I liked the surrealistic touches. I think the director has a real imaginative way of capturing the process of memory -- there's an extended flashback about 3/4 way through which I think is as well conceived and shot as anything I've seen. The acting is standout. Hell, I even liked the score.But the movie almost aggressively makes no sense.SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes, large and small -- although it's worth noting that there's a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances, too: the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them, the rather magical view of hypnosis, Dae-Su's magical new abilities, the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. Let's assume all this is beside the point, and that we're supposed to take the movie more or less symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB (probably the closest reference).The movie doesn't make any sense thematically, either. What's it really about? The virtue of keeping your mouth shut? The movie seems to suggest that the bad guy's sexual relationship with his sister is just fine, the problem seems to be Dae-Su's big mouth. The movie rather laboriously teaches this: the sister kills herself because of the rumors which somehow the sister believes to be true (?); Dae-Su becomes convinced that he was, in fact, at fault; Dae-Su cuts his own tongue out; Dae-Su pleads that Mi-do never learn the truth; Dae-Su even ends up brainwashing himself via hypnosis to forget the truth -- or ""keep his mind shut"", in a sense. I mean, huh? This is a pretty juvenile kind of ethics, to be blunt about it. Although Dae-Su is the protagonist the movie really doesn't seem to be on his side. It also hints at a weird kind of passivity: for all of the hammer swinging and octopus eating, Dae-Su doesn't really do all that much: things are done to him, and eventually he begins to internalize the abuse given to him.Is it about the futility of revenge? One would think, particularly with the references to COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. But leaving aside the notion that Dae-Su's tormentor's omnipresence seems to weigh against the notion of him and Mi-do doing anything, really, but take their lumps or try to fight back, the fact that Dae-Su is considered by the movie to have really ""done"" something makes any critique pretty complicated. Remember, in COUNT Dantes is a true innocent. His motives are as pure as revenge ever gets -- that's why Dumas's ultimate critique, his ultimate notion that revenge even for the Count is wrong works so well. The force is seen in isolation. Here, though, it seems more a case of Dae-Su learning how ""bad"" he really is. He shouldn't take revenge because he really IS at fault.I guess you could argue that the movie shows revenge is futile from the bad guy's point of view. Then why are we watching Dae-Su at all? Maybe the point is that everyone feels themselves righteous until they realize the true dimensions of their ""sin"". But I don't see a lot of people facing up to facts in the movie: I see a lot of denial, in fact. Dae-Su admits to his relatively ""minor"" sin but can't face up to his ""major"" one.After I saw this I read some interviews with the cast and crew, and apparently some of this vagueness is intentional -- we're supposed to be left unsure. Well, the movie is successful in that, but I think it's an unworthy goal, an abdication of the artist's responsibility. People have bristled at the charge that this movie is nihilistic, but if that really is the point, that the movie's supposed to throw up it's hands and say, ""hey, I dunno, you figure it out"", then that truly is nihilism.Ah well, I could go on, but I won't bore you.

8.0,As good and disturbing as expected.,"I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration. The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note. Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten.

The acting is amazing, especially Choi as the main protagonist Dae-su Oh. All the actors did great but his performance was powerful and emotional (all you need to do is see the infamous squid scene). Chan-wook Park gives this movie a very unique style with his direction. The plot starts off like a fairly standard revenge drama but he slowly makes the movie darker through a series of beautifully shot flashbacks and a huge scene involving nothing but a family photo album.If you can't handle extremely strong violence, torture, sex and language and can't stand subtitles it's best you stay far away from Oldboy....if you can, though, then watch it!

10.0,"Complex, challenging masterpiece that puts Hollywood to shame.","While Hollywood is slowly choking to death on clichÃ©s and unrealistic budgets, the movie lovers turn their attention to Asia. Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with state-sponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent, disturbing drama-action movies.Oldboy has an extremely intelligent and edgy script, which will make you think and question your morals. It would NEVER be picked up in Hollywood. Even the initial concept of being locked up for 15 years without apparent reason would be deemed to strange for the audience. Thankfully, the Korean producers could see the brilliance of the script and give it a shot. It's budget is some $4 million, which is amazingly well used.Oldboy is very much the child of it's director, Chan-Wook Park, who's name should warrant a lot more fame than it does. The camera-work and pacing is amazing. There are virtually no dull moments. The fighting scenes are used to compliment to movie, not to give a reward after half an hour's boredom.The lead actors are no less amazing. Min-Sik Choi is a perfect anti-hero. Unlike the Western antiheroes, he even has the looks of an everyman, which makes his transformation so much more spectacular. The lead actress is a bit understates in my opinion, but memorable never the less. The best one is by far Ji-Tae Ju, the charismatic villain. He dominates every scene he's in, a sort of Korean Christian Bale American Psycho.Music and choreography is great as well. All the details and the grit makes the movie really come alive. At the end, you are in awe, a rare feeling for a movie. The feeling stays with you for days. Occasionally you will think of the movie and shake your head, unbelieving someone could actually pull it off.So do yourself a favor, watch Oldboy.

7.0,Revenge: a dish best eaten live?,"In Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' (which won the grand prize at Cannes in 2004 when Tarantino was at the helm), a rough-looking man is held by the cops for some hours after a drunk. A series of relentless jump-cuts show him misbehaving at the police station. Once bailed out, he suddenly disappears in a pour-down rain while his rescuer is in a phone booth. The next we know he's imprisoned in a tiny apartment-like jail cell, and is held there forÂ….fifteen years! Again jump cuts take us through this experience, which includes pumped-in gas while he sleeps, self-tattoos of cross-hatching to remind himself of the years, a journal, a constant TV which is his only companion, imaginary swarms of insects, and personal martial-arts conditioning that includes punching the wall till his knuckles bleed.Once released, having a taste for something other than the pot-stickers he was served all the time in his prison, our man stops at a sushi bar and asks for ""something live."" He's brought an octopus as big as two fists and he gobbles it -- live -- and passes out. The female sushi chef presiding at this event bonds with the man and they go looking for whoever imprisoned him and try to find out why. I forgot a man who jumps off the roof of the prison building before this: but nobody could keep track of all the hyper-kinetic, dark, grungy contents of 'Oldboy.' It's in Korean, by the way, and if you don't know Korean you may miss a bit of the dialog. It's got those subtitles that fade when the background's light, and they flick by pretty fast too.What is clear is that as somebody taunts him, Oh Dae-Su's just in a larger prison when his captors let him out, and what he does is part of a maniacal scheme to do him far worse harm than mere physical confinement.What's initially endearing about this accomplished but cartoon-like revenge-mystery action film, apart from Choi Min Sik's gonzo performance as Oh Dae-Su, the imprisoned man who turns sushi freak, is its obsessiveness, which Choi's intensity neatly underlines. The troubles begin when you realize that however maniacally determined Oh Dae-Su's pursuit of his tormentor and unraveling of his imprisonment's secrets are, it's all ultimately lost on us because it makes little logical, and even less emotional, sense. Or, where it does make sense, it's patently impossible.Park Chan Wook is a clever and inventive filmmaker who like many of the other 'dark,' 'cool' filmmakers of today has a visual style that outstrips his ability to tell a story. Since you could have said that about The Big Sleep and many still do, it may be that critical head-shaking over 'Oldboy' will seem passÃ© in time and the film will morph into a classic. It's been said already though that Park is pursuing cult status faster than he can keep up with himself.The encrustation of the mechanical upon the living was Bergson's definition of the comic, and by that definition this movie should be a laugh riot. There's both elaborate visual trickery and intense real physicality -- witness Oh Dae-Su's consumption of the octopus. He really bites the thing's head off and chews on the still-writhing tentacles as they nervously coil round his cheek. The martial arts sequences are tricky and complicated; I doubt that the actor is doing all his stunts like Tony Ja in 'Ong-bak: Thai Warrior,' but his physicality is down to earth as he punches out one thug after another. No jumping, just punches and falls. But the images and their sequencing are most artfully manipulated. There's a sex scene, and an erotic scene, and a torture sequence involving dental extractions.How Oh Dae-Su finds people and how people find Oh Dae-Su is pretty confused. There's a vague sense that those tormenting Oh Dae-Su are evil masterminds Ã  la James Bond. They have gangster connections and there's a posh huge penthouse at the end. But our hero seems to have been held in a kind of rent-a-jail cell, and whoever ordered up this treatment was apparently connected with something more mundane than Goldfinger: simply a schoolmate who bears Oh Dae-Su an obscure grudge. When the school enemy appears, if I've got this right, he seems to be a decade or two Oh Dae-Su's junior. Does it matter? Well, cultists of the movie will want to explain everything. But not rest of us, because the people aren't real or specific enough for us to care. Choi Min Sik's a gnarly little dynamo (his wacko behavior fits better here than it did in the artistic biography Chihwaseon) and his nemesis is a tall, cool, godlike personage. That's the point. The contrast is enough.Oldboy has hints of Tarantino and Tarantino's Asian martial arts sources, but although there's a lot of dialog, as far as one can tell the talk is very far from Pulp Fiction's priceless exchanges.You think the idea's unique -- imagine being locked up for fifteen years without explanation -- but then you realize it's not only what happened to Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean, but essentially what happens to a lot of black men in America, only then it isn't the beginning of a hip nightmare film. The imprisonment of black men is the real tale of society's revenge on an undeserving minority, but Oldboy's maniacal and inexplicable personal revenge of one middle class man on another has no social significance; worse yet, it never acquires an emotional one.Director Park Chan Wook is a director to reckon with -- some of Oldboy's sequences are hard to forget -- and he's found a worthy star in Choi Min Sik. But this disturbing, violent movie is clever without being intelligent.",revenge dish best eaten live,park chan wooks oldboy which won grand prize at cannes 2004 when tarantino was at helm rough

10.0,Absolutely authentic and 100% bad ass.,"The first time I saw ""Oldboy"" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost clichÃ©. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of ""Oldboy"" are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like ""Oldboy"" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.' 10 out of 10, kids.",absolutely authentic 100 bad ass,first time i saw oldboy i watched it by myself rainy evening when credits rolled at end i think i actually stood up clapped its been long time since ive seen something so original film is gripping it grabs never lets you go it starts out with man who is locked inside this room doesnt know why blah blah blah sounds almost clich read back dvd case summary last fifteen minutes oldboy are most intense fifteen minutes ive seen any movie by end you are so eager know what happened this poor guy why he has been punished film takes twist that makes every hair your arms stand up it remains satisfying its not one those twists that leaves you scratching your head it makes sense film like oldboy is humbling that it makes you realize that america is no longer turning out most cutting edge stuff but its also nice know that someone out there still has guts do film with no barriers that makes you stand up flip off guys like tarantino go thats what im talking about 10 out 10 kids,0.5979166666666667,0.13593750000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Old Boys was very interesting!,"This South Korean mystery thriller neo-noir film is like a hammer. It always manage to hit the nail on the head. Directed by Park Chan-wook, and loosely based on the Japanese manga of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by 2002's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and followed by 2005's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film follows the story of a Korean businessman, Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), who is locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of lies, conspiracy and violence. With the help of a female Japanese chef named Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang) and one of his old computer friends, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji), Dae-su must find a way to piece together the scattered clues of who took his life away from him, while cutting down anyone who gets in his path. Without spoiling the movie too much, this film has a lot of twist and turns, that will keep the viewer, interested in the story. The movie is an extreme art-house film, often using tropes taken from previous psychological movies such as 1929's Un Chien Andalou (1929) & 1966's Persona. The film also has several parallels to classic stories such as William Shakespeare's to Titus Andronicus & French author Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. The most famous one is the Greek myth of Oedipus Rex. Other works, like Ella Wheeler Wilcox's famous poem, ""Solitude"", played a big part in this film. ""The Man of Sorrow"" by Belgium painter James Ensor gave the movie, some depth with it looks. Classical music gave the movie, its ears. ""The Last Waltz"" by FrÃ©dÃ©ric FranÃ§ois Chopin, and the first movement of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons: Winter"" are certainly used the best. The rest of the entire soundtrack is a work of genius. Not only does every title clearly applies to the events seen in the film when the track is played, but every track is takes their name after a famous film noir film. The acting is excellent for the most part. Min-sik Choi really put a lot of work, into this film. Not only did, he nailed it, with the emotional side, he trained for six weeks and lost twenty pounds to get in shape for the role of Dae-su, and did most of his own stunt work. If that wasn't extreme, enough, he ate four real life live octopodes as Dae-su in the sushi bar scene. While, it did provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. I saw nothing wrong with it, as long as he ate all of them. That scene was used, to represent, Dae-su hatred toward his enemies and I think Min-sik Choi capture that. Supporting character, Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee was great at being sinister, while being realistic. Director Quentin Tarantino was at the screening and was shocked to find himself crying for a character who had been completely despicable for the prior duration of the movie. That's how much, Ji-tae Yu got people to invest in the character. The only weak acting in the film, had to be Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do. I really didn't like her damsel in distress, manic pixie dream girl role. Still, this was a very powerful film. The movie was shot, superb. Great use of mirrors, as a symbolism of fragmentation of one self. I like how everybody is looking at another person, through a mirror. I like how shots of Woo-jin Lee, show how much omnipotent by wealth, he is. I like how Dae-su is shown as the common man. Getting back at the society, by hammer. It remind me of socialism ideas pitting against that of capitalism. Still, the most well-known shot had to be, the lengthy scene in which Oh Dae-su takes on over a dozen men armed with just a hammer. Given that the scene is nearly 5 minutes long, and is all filmed on one camera, in one take. The fight sequence took three days, worth of attempts to nail it. The violence in this film wasn't as violent, as some critics made it out to be. The torture wasn't too in- depth, as the camera cuts away, when things become way too gory. I found the violent to, pretty tame for a Rated R film. The story matter is indeed shocking. The whole twist toward the end is a gut-wrenching and sick. The movie ends with a gloomy ambiguous ending. While, some people might see this as a fault; I see it as thought provoking. While Dae-su is let out of captivity, he can only free himself, by finding out why he was imprisoned. Dae-su takes on many aspects of an Ubermensch on finding the truth, but ultimately his character has no control of his own fate and plays into his enemies' hands. By the end of the movie he is a very, very broken man. It's a great example of why human decisions are meaningless and choice is an illusion. One of the most important themes of Old Boy is the truth. Sometimes, the truth doesn't set you free. The only thing, that I can see as a fault of the film is how some scenes were very confusing. One of the biggest mistake, you can make, is watching it, with the English dubbing. It's horrible. It doesn't match with the lips on the screen at all. Unfortunately, you will lose a lot of Korean language drastically changed over those fifteen years, with it. You should watch it with English subtitle, instead. This movie help influence a Bollywood remakes in 2005 & an American remake in 2013. Overall: This dark Oedipian tragedy is somewhat enlightening. Drop the hammer, and give this a watch!

And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's ""Oldboy"" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as ""Mr. Park"", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie! This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't.""Oldboy"" is a 10 out of 10. It is as close to perfection as a film can get.",park chan wooks masterful oldboy is tour de force storytelling my favorite film all time,i just recently noticed that i have written 99 reviews imdb since joining 2005 i have decided honor my 100th review tackle my favorite film korean release 2003 directed by masterful park chan wook i am speaking course controversial amazingly elegant film oldboy based loosely upon japanese manga chan wooks oldboy stars amazing choi min sik as oh dae su drunk businessman korea film opens with his abduction public as he is mysteriously placed dark dingy building where criminals pay have people held captive dae su is locked hotel like room being fed daily only having tv keep him company 15 years one day he learns news report that his wife was found murdered he later learns that his young daughter was sent adoptive parents out country over time he becomes depressed angry eventually empty he begins train himself fight plotting escape seek vengeance then all sudden he awakens one day find that he has been set free given money suit cellphone taunting phone call one who ordered his captivity ensures that dae su will stop at nothing get his revenge he is joined by mi do kang hye jeong beautiful feisty young chef his old friend no joo hwan ji dae han whom try assist him as he solves mysteries surround why he was imprisoned he also does eventually encounter man who ordered his capture wealthy businessman who lives towering skyscraper named lee woo jin played by yoo ji tae though encounter only raises stakes dae su cannot kill him he will kill himself first rob dae su his revenge if he tries now dae su only has five days solve mystery or else woo jin will kill mi do whom dae su has began fall acting is superb especially our leads choi min sik yoo ji tae both deliver astounding detailed performances choi min sik is sympathetic yet at same time frightening unstable you will root him while fearing him yoo ji tae is incredible as our villain who is oddly likable charming despite his cruel often evil nature much same way hannibal lector was silence lambs he plays role with much joy delight both were chilling supporting roles were all well played kang hye jeong ji dae han were both phenomenal all other secondary characters were well played particularly funny is oh dal su as mr park nasty little jerk who runs building where dae su was imprisoned hes sort guy who would double cross his mother nickle hes lot fun watch park chan wooks direction is what really truly elevates this film unknown bounds though chan wook has poetry distinctive sharp visual sense his camera work everything is perfectly deliberate perfectly fine tuned his choice colors textures patterns also set marvelous mood this is one those films where even if muted visual tell story just as much as dialog everything is perfectly planned out right down wallpaper walls tiniest prop its even making chan wooks visual sensibility ability communicate his ideas with actors is closest perfection as is obtainable he is truly master film script is very tight dare i say even flawless it all fits together like enormous jigsaw puzzle each piece is important few action sequences are amazing gritty music is perfectly implemented compliment story many twists turns plot takes are breathtaking you will leave this film feeling touched disturbed it gets under your skin infects you you will not forget this movie this is truly amazing film i usually try find something negative mention each my reviews but here i just cant oldboy is 10 out 10 it is as close perfection as film can get,0.6052412204197919,0.18750308884237452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"
5.0,I don't get it; what's the hype all about?,"'Oldboy' is constantly mentioned as one of the greatest Korean films ever made, and has also been called the most disturbing Korean film (followed by 'I saw the Devil' and 'The Chaser', which were both incredibly disturbing). I therefore eagerly watched the film in high anticipation, but am quite sad to say I was very disappointed. It started off very interesting and mysterious, and the story was told in a very unique way. The moment Oh Dae Su is released, the film becomes very neo-noir-ish (and I don't enjoy neo-noir) and I actually found it to me more comedic than disturbing or suspenseful. Choi Min-sik was excellent, as usual, and without him in the lead I might have liked the film even less. So, essentially the film is about an old school friend, Lee Woo-jin, who wants to avenge Oh Dae-Su for Lee's sister's suicide. Because of this he locks him up for 15 years, then sets him free after 'programming' both him and his daughter via hypnosis to fall in love. Uhmm, ok... Ok, spoilers to follow, so stop reading if you don't want to know. Is this filmed said to be the most disturbing film simply because it is revealed the woman he so eagerly had sex with is actually his daughter? Nothing else in the film is disturbing. When all is said and done and Lee kills himself (what an anti-climax!!), Oh Dae-Su tracks down the hypnotist and asks her to erase his memory of his daughter so they can have a relationship. Seriously!!?? So he'd rather have her as his lover than his daughter?? I rest my case...",i dont get it whats hype all about,oldboy is constantly mentioned as one greatest korean films ever made has also been called most disturbing korean film followed by i saw devil chaser which were both incredibly disturbing i therefore eagerly watched film high anticipation but am quite sad say i was very disappointed it started off very interesting mysterious story was told very unique way moment oh dae su is released film becomes very neo noir ish i dont enjoy neo noir i actually found it me more comedic than disturbing or suspenseful choi min sik was excellent as usual without him lead i might have liked film even less so essentially film is about old school friend lee woo jin who wants avenge oh dae su lees sisters suicide because this he locks him up 15 years then sets him free after programming both him his daughter via hypnosis fall love uhmm ok ok spoilers follow so stop reading if you dont want know is this filmed said be most disturbing film simply because it is revealed woman he so eagerly had sex with is actually his daughter nothing else film is disturbing when all is said done lee kills himself what anti climax oh dae su tracks down hypnotist asks her erase his memory his daughter so they can have relationship seriously so hed rather have her as his lover than his daughter i rest my case,0.5836485260770977,0.0947698412698413,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.16}"
3.0,Didn't do anything for me.,"Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. However before Dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. Dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) the two fall in love & together with her help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...This South Korean production was co-written & directed by Chan-wook Park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes while it was also nominated for the Golden Palm so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well not for me it isn't since as I can't understand why it's so liked & I would go as far as to say I pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldn't get into the story at all, I just didn't like it as I thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe Oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever I thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. At almost two hours I almost fell asleep I was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that I would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. In fact Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. I didn't warm to any of the character's & while I accept Oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that I will never understand why so many people seem to like.Based on a Japanese Manga of the same name Oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot I was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. The actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, Dae-su eats a live Octopus which is apparently quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.The budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in South Korea & New Zealand. The acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute chore to sit through, I don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as I followed the thing perfectly but I just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005).",didnt do anything me,oldboy is set korea starts as drunken dae su oh min sik choi is bailed out police station by his friend only be abducted dae su wakes up finds himself small room which he will be imprisoned next fifteen years dae su is fed looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out room dae su begins train himself avenge himself after he gets out which he intends do by scrapping away cement brickwork with chopstick however before dae su finishes he is gassed rendered unconscious when he wakes up dae su finds himself free roof tall building dressed all moneyed up dae su instantly sets about trying find out who imprisoned him after meeting pretty mido hye jeong kang two fall love together with her help dae su finally finds what he is looking but truth comes at price this south korean production was co written directed by chan wook park has gotten any number glowing reviews sort that distributors can pick quotes out plaster them video box even won grand prize jury at cannes while it was also nominated golden palm so surely oldboy is true classic well not me it isnt since as i cant understand why its so liked i would go as far as say i pretty much hated it apart one or two isolated moments start i couldnt get into story at all i just didnt like it as i thought it was slow boring while many out there would have you believe oldboy has bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain not very well executed either ending which dae su goes new zealand alps be hypnotised feels tagged as well almost as if makers wanted some sort happy ending at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored violence is tame its thought whats happening that i would imagine most people have problem with rather than what is actually shown fact oldboy has very low body count about seven one mild sex scene its really not that graphic or memorable i didnt warm any characters while i accept oldboy has alright concept premise it fails deliver its one film that i will never understand why so many people seem like based japanese manga same name oldboy film looks alright theres one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about hallway fight that takes place one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed thought fight choreography was quite dull actual screen gore violence amounts very little dae su eats live octopus which is apparently quite normal korea anyway there are some fight scenes severed hand someones teeth are pulled out theres bit blood at end budget was supposedly around 4 000 000 mark which is actually fair bit filmed south korea new zealand acting looks alright but its hard tell when actors are speaking different language oldboy is film that i found absolute chore sit through i dont mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention plot as i followed thing perfectly but i just didnt like any it its as simple straightforward as that apparently second director choi wook parks revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy mr vengeance 2002 lady vengeance 2005,0.559326757031675,0.09427959335746224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Absolutely superb,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film as much as this one.The key premise is original, which is rare enough by itself, and when you add to that some good writing you get a great film.There are some deliberately hammed up comic moments to lighten the mostly very dark mood of the film and these are genuinely very funny.The action is often over the top, but not in a gory way, and it is interesting to watch the story unfold with the viewer having no more idea of what is happening and why than the protagonist.The pace is quick enough that you never get bored and the ending is dark and nasty and twisted and surprising.There is nothing bad I can say about the film.",absolutely superb,i cant remember last time i enjoyed film as much as this one key premise is original which is rare enough by itself when you add that some good writing you get great film there are some deliberately hammed up comic moments lighten mostly very dark mood film these are genuinely very funny action is often over top but not gory way it is interesting watch story unfold with viewer having no more idea what is happening why than protagonist pace is quick enough that you never get bored ending is dark nasty twisted surprising there is nothing bad i can say about film,0.6405128205128204,0.13608974358974357,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.16}"
9.0,One of most well-made films I've ever seen,"I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.",one most well made films ive ever seen,i decided check this movie out after eberts 4 star rave review cult status this movie has received was also intrigued by sexy looking ultimate edition so i decided rent it i was very surprised at how different it was than i expected it be i expected ton violence not much way writing or acting first time i saw it i wasnt blown away just kind like whatever when i watched it second time however i really started notice how well its made addition liking it more every shot is bursting with background detail great amount attention production design theme certain color scene was restrained yet perfectly balanced actors really gave it all especially 2 male leads who really blew me away music is varied mix beautiful classical music some pretty cool techno screenplay is brilliant characters are developed very well extremely complex plot is not only ingenious but payoff twists are 1000x better than any shamaylan movie simply put technical point view its one best movies ever critics point view it is very well done movie that goes little overboard sex violence is just little strange,0.49902319902319914,0.22228937728937728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,"Shocking! A must-see, if you have the stomach for it","To be hones I'm in a shock right now. The story of Oldboy is absolutely horrible. And no, I don't mean it's written badly, I mean the story is so horrifying that after I was done I just had to sit and stare the screen for a while. The only thought in my head is: ""What the hell did I just see?"" This is the beauty of movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you: Oldboy, Primal Fear, Fight Club... I'm sure there are many more, but just making a list would be lazy. The plot twist in Primal Fear is just surprising. It's clever, but the thing is, it's not that bad. while Oldboy... That plot twist is absolutely shocking. And the story is well written even when you don't count the plot twist. The main character's narration gives a lot more interest to the story. The mystery is intriguing, and the writers have a way of keeping the viewer invested in the story. Even when you don't really like Oh Dae-Su, you still want to know why. And even Oh Dae-Su is not really a likable character, you still wonder if he deserved that. That would be an interesting philosophical debate.There are a few group fight scenes in this film, and they are excellent. They are well coordinated and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as fight scenes are) to watch. The visual side of Oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs to. There were few gore-y scenes, yet nothing too horrifying was shown, so something was left to imagination. Still those scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.Oldboy is a very well made movie. It's shocking, and I'm not sure how good it is when you watch it a second time, but at least after this first time I am astonished - and shocked. I'd love to recommend this movie but I don't know how risky that would be.",shocking must see if you have stomach it,be hones im shock right now story oldboy is absolutely horrible no i dont mean its written badly i mean story is so horrifying that after i was done i just had sit stare screen while only thought my head is what hell did i just see this is beauty movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you oldboy primal fear fight club im sure there are many more but just making list would be lazy plot twist primal fear is just surprising its clever but thing is its not that bad while oldboy that plot twist is absolutely shocking story is well written even when you dont count plot twist main characters narration gives lot more interest story mystery is intriguing writers have way keeping viewer invested story even when you dont really like oh dae su you still want know why even oh dae su is not really likable character you still wonder if he deserved that that would be interesting philosophical debate there are few group fight scenes this film they are excellent they are well coordinated enjoyable or as enjoyable as fight scenes are watch visual side oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs there were few gore y scenes yet nothing too horrifying was shown so something was left imagination still those scenes keep you edge your seat oldboy is very well made movie its shocking im not sure how good it is when you watch it second time but at least after this first time i am astonished shocked id love recommend this movie but i dont know how risky that would be,0.5735355253212397,-0.010459183673469388,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"

After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. And also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.Unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, I didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that I had to watch from the beginning to the end. To my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an Eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. Afterwards I will take the ratings from the Cannes film festival with more precaution, as while Oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.I am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.",violence without sense,fortunately i havent seen this film movie big screen just small screen video i doubt that i would have been able sit through film cinema watch all violence present film after watching first 30 minutes i became both disappointed curious disappointed because hard follow story line hardly understandable screens huge amount aggression i still dont know why i had been shown daesu main character pulling out raw teeth another person his beastliness women him cutting out his tongue also curious see what will film say as conclusion what is ending summary all this brutality unfortunately though movie was not boring i didnt get any answer all these cruelty that i had watch beginning end my opinion if you want blood want laugh there is kill bill 1 2 if you want blood with more meaning you can take any recent war movie if you want eastern movie there are much better titles out there afterwards i will take ratings cannes film festival with more precaution as while oldboy got lot praise jury it had not much say me had only 4 10 my scale i am hungry see something beautiful harmonious with true feelings clear message,0.5864239926739926,0.04830586080586081,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"
