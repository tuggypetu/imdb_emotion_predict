8.0,Solid courtroom thriller with excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey and a five-twist ending...,"Agatha Christie would be proud of the five-twist ending to THE LINCOLN LAWYER. The film is clearly top-notch and street smart. It's the most efficient, solidly crafted courtroom thriller since PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. It has so many twists and turns that it's likely that Agatha Christie would be proud of it.It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor, not just a charismatic star. He manages to be smoothly appealing despite playing a corrupt lawyer who has no scruples in defending guilty clients as long as they provide the cash flow he demands. It's only after defending RYAN PHILLIPPE from a charge of murder and rape that he realizes he does have a few scruples left. And the plot twists provided by the screenwriter John Romano from the novel by Michael Connelly, are deftly handled for maximum shock effect. Brad Furman keeps the direction tight, forceful and swift-moving.The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his ex-wife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him, and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer, and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one, designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.By all means, highly recommended for fans of this genre.",solid courtroom thriller with excellent performance by matthew mcconaughey five twist ending,agatha christie would be proud five twist ending lincoln lawyer film is clearly top notch street smart its most efficient solidly crafted courtroom thriller since primal fear witness prosecution it has so many twists turns that its likely that agatha christie would be proud it it also reignites career matthew mcconaughey as actor not just charismatic star he manages be smoothly appealing despite playing corrupt lawyer who has no scruples defending guilty clients as long as they provide cash flow he demands its only after defending ryan phillippe charge murder rape that he realizes he does have few scruples left plot twists provided by screenwriter john romano novel by michael connelly are deftly handled maximum shock effect brad furman keeps direction tight forceful swift moving cast surrounding mcconaughey has been selected with care all them offer realistic performances marisa tomei is appealing as his ex wife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted him william h macy delivers solid performance as his investigator friend ryan phillippe is excellent as client whose surface appearance belies fact that hes as street smart as his sleazy lawyer frances fisher is outstanding small but pivotal role as young mans protective mother not since days primal fear witness prosecution has there been more intelligent script than this one designed baffle blindside viewer course unraveling some startling surprises by all means highly recommended fans this genre,0.6066594516594517,0.24777777777777776,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,"Handsome, snappy, warm movie--and leading man! But kind of ordinary crime stuff, too.","The Lincoln Lawyer (2011)You gotta love the suave, smart, never quite cocky performance by Matthew McConaughey as a wily defense lawyer in this slightly clever, slightly formulaic movie set in contemporary L.A. He's almost like the James Bond of the justice system, operating outside the rules but ultimately on the side of good. And himself.The one woman in his life is a common movie cliché, unfortunately, though a useful one--an ex-lover he's still a little in love with, and they once had a child together so there is a tinge of sweetness once or twice. And this woman (played by Marisa Tomei--I never caught whether they were once married or if they were just making good on getting pregnant) works in the D.A.'s office, which is useful for a defense lawyer. The rest of the cast is straight Hollywood fare, including a couple of older men big players who are always strong if a little too dependable and a couple of younger actors who are a bit more pretty than talented. The includes especially the principle perp, Louis Roulet, played Ryan Phillippe (he was that brand new cop in ""Crash"") who is decent in a role that demanded amazing.Roulet is super rich, and he's been accused of beating up a prostitute, who in turn is accused of using Roulet in some kind of scam for his cash. It's complicated from the get go, which makes the movie get your attention and hold on--you actually have to be careful not to get lost at first. The mind game/power game between the two men--McConaughey and Phillippe--is the crux of the movie, but it never gets the intensity of say a Hitchcock film (Hitch being the master of the innocent man accused, and of psychological intensity). In fact, you might say the movie misses a beat by letting the plot center mostly on the lawyer, except for the simple fact that McConaughey is so darned good. The subplot with his child, his relationship with Tomei, and a few other small diversions don't add enough to make them worthwhile. There is, luckily, plenty of screen time with the two men together, though all the courtroom scenes might not count (Phillippe is oddly lifeless there, except for one nice overacted speech about the horror of being accused of a crime you didn't commit). And gradually a very subtle shift in guilt and motive takes place, so that what we thought was happening gets undermined.And it's no great surprise. The one surprise at the end isn't even a surprise, quite, or if it is, it's not set up enough to really make you care. It's another cliché worked into a well made movie with a single actor shining in something close to an Oscar-winning role. The title? And the selling point of the movie (a lawyer working out of his Lincoln)? A terrific idea that is only pertinent in small moments, most notably and ludicrously in the motorcycle gang scenes (plural) Which shows another direction the movie might have taken into farce and comedy. But this is a congenial movie with a serious plot of crime, enjoyable all the way through, nothing more or less than that.",handsome snappy warm movie leading man but kind ordinary crime stuff too,lincoln lawyer 2011 you gotta love suave smart never quite cocky performance by matthew mcconaughey as wily defense lawyer this slightly clever slightly formulaic movie set contemporary l hes almost like james bond justice system operating outside rules but ultimately side good himself one woman his life is common movie clich unfortunately though useful one ex lover hes still little love with they once had child together so there is tinge sweetness once or twice this woman played by marisa tomei i never caught whether they were once married or if they were just making good getting pregnant works d s office which is useful defense lawyer rest cast is straight hollywood fare including couple older men big players who are always strong if little too dependable couple younger actors who are bit more pretty than talented includes especially principle perp louis roulet played ryan phillippe he was that brand new cop crash who is decent role that demanded amazing roulet is super rich hes been accused beating up prostitute who turn is accused using roulet some kind scam his cash its complicated get go which makes movie get your attention hold you actually have be careful not get lost at first mind game power game between two men mcconaughey phillippe is crux movie but it never gets intensity say hitchcock film hitch being master innocent man accused psychological intensity fact you might say movie misses beat by letting plot center mostly lawyer except simple fact that mcconaughey is so darned good subplot with his child his relationship with tomei few other small diversions dont add enough make them worthwhile there is luckily plenty screen time with two men together though all courtroom scenes might not count phillippe is oddly lifeless there except one nice overacted speech about horror being accused crime you didnt commit gradually very subtle shift guilt motive takes place so that what we thought was happening gets undermined its no great surprise one surprise at end isnt even surprise quite or if it is its not set up enough really make you care its another clich worked into well made movie with single actor shining something close oscar winning role title selling point movie lawyer working out his lincoln terrific idea that is only pertinent small moments most notably ludicrously motorcycle gang scenes plural which shows another direction movie might have taken into farce comedy but this is congenial movie with serious plot crime enjoyable all way through nothing more or less than that,0.5391058266058266,0.14127325377325375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,"""Attorney Client Privilege, This Is All Confidential""","Playing the title role in The Lincoln Lawyer is Matthew McConaughey so nicknamed because he conducts most of his business from his Lincoln Town Car which is chauffeured by Laurence Mason. As he has to travel to and from various courts, this makes it a whole easier. And the car and Mason thereby become a business expense. Roy Cohn would have been proud.McConaughey is no idealist, his services come at a price. But it turns out he has some scruples and they are put to the test when rich boy Ryan Phillippe and his mother Frances Fisher hire him to defend Ryan when he's arrested for rape. He was literally caught in the act as two neighbors broke in and held him for the cops for raping Marguerite Levieva. Due to the canons of the Bar Association ethics McConaughey finds himself in a jackpot similar to the one Al Pacino found himself when he played a young idealistic lawyer in And Justice For All. But the results are a whole lot different because McConaughey is not an idealist and he makes those canons work for him.The film looks like the pilot of a TV series, but I doubt we'll get any of the big name stars there if such a thing comes to pass. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey's ex-wife and a prosecutor to boot. Can't imagine what broke that marriage up. William H. Macy has a key role in this film as well as a private investigator who works for McConaughey and does very well in it.The Lincoln Lawyer is a very well done addition to the legal cinema with a cast that fills its roles out to a ""T"".

9.0,Well-worth watching,"Matthew McConaughey has arrived. He carries this movie. His presence makes this movie happen. He is the spark that lights this movie's fire. He takes a good story and makes it excellent. He projects the intensity and savvy that makes his character interesting and unique. And this is not hyperbole. Mr. McConaughey's performance is energetic, engaging and entertaining. He manages to project street-smarts and style; he is smart but not slick; he's realistic but not cynical; he is sensitive but not mushy. Another surprise is Ryan Phillippe's excellent performance which also adds considerably to the movie's entertainment value as his character spars with Mr. McConaughey's. Although the story itself is a variation of the detective-who-done-it genre, the effective manner in which the story unfolds coupled with the excellent acting makes this story well-worth watching.",well worth watching,matthew mcconaughey has arrived he carries this movie his presence makes this movie happen he is spark that lights this movies fire he takes good story makes it excellent he projects intensity savvy that makes his character interesting unique this is not hyperbole mr mcconaugheys performance is energetic engaging entertaining he manages project street smarts style he is smart but not slick hes realistic but not cynical he is sensitive but not mushy another surprise is ryan phillippes excellent performance which also adds considerably movies entertainment value as his character spars with mr mcconaugheys although story itself is variation detective who done it genre effective manner which story unfolds coupled with excellent acting makes this story well worth watching,0.6158521303258145,0.43057644110275684,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,A thoughtful ride with characters and intriguing conflicts of innocence and guilt,"The titular Lincoln lawyer is smooth Mick Haller who is just as smooth as Matthew McConaughey. His sleaziness is entertaining, but his lawyering is smart and intriguing. This film has pretty much the perfect mix of a smart plot, with inventive twists, amusing one-liners, and captivating thought-out characters.Limited action and instead using characters who have an actual story, we get a film that sets itself above its competitors. A charming, but also smart and strong, Matthew McConaughey introduces us to a lawyer who has a few inner turmoils that develop along with the plot. There may be a few too many twists in the story (and with the camera), but the evolution of McConaughey's Haller is rather subtle and not cliché.Questions of innocence versus guilt surround Louis (Ryan Phillippe) as Haller agrees to take on his case. But as the case starts to collide with incidents of the past, present and future, similar questions of guilt and innocence start plaguing Haller, his other clients, and the other lawyers. The fact that all these other characters are played by great actors only increases the entertainment value of this film. I highly recommend taking a thoughtful ride with ""The Lincoln Lawyer"".",thoughtful ride with characters intriguing conflicts innocence guilt,titular lincoln lawyer is smooth mick haller who is just as smooth as matthew mcconaughey his sleaziness is entertaining but his lawyering is smart intriguing this film has pretty much perfect mix smart plot with inventive twists amusing one liners captivating thought out characters limited action instead using characters who have actual story we get film that sets itself above its competitors charming but also smart strong matthew mcconaughey introduces us lawyer who has few inner turmoils that develop along with plot there may be few too many twists story with camera but evolution mcconaugheys haller is rather subtle not clich questions innocence versus guilt surround louis ryan phillippe as haller agrees take his case but as case starts collide with incidents past present future similar questions guilt innocence start plaguing haller his other clients other lawyers fact that all these other characters are played by great actors only increases entertainment value this film i highly recommend taking thoughtful ride with lincoln lawyer,0.4935521235521234,0.20422779922779927,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.53}"
8.0,Pretty darn good,"Hey, this isn't half bad at all. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much, so it was nice to be pleasantly surprised. Okay, it's no 'Primal Fear' - but it's as good as any Grisham adaptation.The script is pacey and smart, with some excellent lines from the central character - played with just the right balance of sass and integrity by Matthew McConaughey. In fact, everyone in the cast was up to the mark - and it's always a pleasure to see Marisa Tomei up there: a fine actress who deserves to be seen more often. Willliam H Macy, too, is always worth watching.As for the story... I thought it gave an interesting angle on the classic legal/moral problem : the failed defence in which an innocent client goes to jail, and the successful defence that acquits a killer.I haven't read the Michael Connelly novel, but I think I will now - if only to see more of the Mick Haller character. His back-story wasn't much more than suggested in the film - lost licence, broken marriage, smartness that's a combination of natural intelligence and life at the grittier edge of things. I want to know more! A couple of quiet spots, and a little bit of overstating the obvious (a la 'CSI'), but otherwise this is a highly entertaining film. The perfect antidote to some of the blockbusters and cartoons on offer at the moment.8/10",pretty darn good,hey this isnt half bad at all ill be honest say i wasnt expecting much so it was nice be pleasantly surprised okay its no primal fear but its as good as any grisham adaptation script is pacey smart with some excellent lines central character played with just right balance sass integrity by matthew mcconaughey fact everyone cast was up mark its always pleasure see marisa tomei up there fine actress who deserves be seen more often willliam h macy too is always worth watching as story i thought it gave interesting angle classic legal moral problem failed defence which innocent client goes jail successful defence that acquits killer i havent read michael connelly novel but i think i will now if only see more mick haller character his back story wasnt much more than suggested film lost licence broken marriage smartness thats combination natural intelligence life at grittier edge things i want know more couple quiet spots little bit overstating obvious la csi but otherwise this is highly entertaining film perfect antidote some blockbusters cartoons offer at moment 8 10,0.538471177944862,0.23760964912280702,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,Review: Lincoln Lawyer,"I know what you're thinking and I can agree with you that the name, Matthew McConaughey, does not instill great confidence that you're going to get a great movie experience. Now that is not to say that McConaughey hasn't done some great movies. For every Ghosts of Girlfriend's Past, Sahara, and Failure to Launch there are We Are Marshall and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Lincoln Lawyer is luckily part of the later group and reminds us that McConaughey can carry movie without having to take off his shirt in every scene.Lincoln Lawyer is a thrilling drama about a cocky and smooth defense attorney Mick Haller, played by McConaughey, who represents a high-profile client on charges of attempted murder. But as new evidence continues to pile on, Mick starts to grow suspicious that perhaps his client isn't telling him everything. With twists and turns at every corner, Lincoln Lawyer keeps you guessing till the very end.With the help of that distinct country voice and southern charm, McConaughey takes the movie to another level with this portrayal of the fast-talking lawyer. With the role of Mick, McConaughey is actually given a chance to show off a range of emotions that will truly surprise viewers. Mcconaughey doesn't carry this alone, Lincoln Lawyer gets some great acting from the likes of William H. Macy, Michael Pena, John Leguizamo, Josh Lucas, and Marisa Tomei. The only black sheep of his movie comes from the alleged murderer Louis Roulet, played by the ever wooden Ryan Phillippe. The only thing I find amazing from Phillippe's attempt at acting is his unique talent to deliver every line of dialogue without moving a single muscle on his face.The tension and intensity that begins to engulf Mike as the case continues is stellar. Lincoln Lawyer really pushes Mike to edge as his whole world becomes begins to collapse due to his Attorney-Client relationship. This is where Lincoln Lawyer really comes alive and delivers a must see movie experience. The court room scenes are some of my favorite scenes in the movie and there are plenty. The approach they took to portraying the lawyer aspect of the film feels accurate and realistic. The plot is solid and keeps you invested right from the beginning and keeps the grip tight throughout the movie. The movie keeps a good pacing and the dialogue is smart and witty. The film's color and camera work gives a very raw feel although at times it can be a little too unstable. The story and characterization is done well but there are a few things that should have been given more focus, like Mike and Maggie's relationship and more insight as to why they got divorced. The movie touches on the idea with a scene or two but never really reveals too much. We also never really get too much on Mike's relationship with his daughter. My biggest problem with the film was the underwhelming ending that really had everything necessary to end the movie with, but still felt lackluster when it came. However, don't let these few problems sway you. I strongly recommend this film and promise you that you will leave satisfied.-www.MovieFloss.com",review lincoln lawyer,i know what youre thinking i can agree with you that name matthew mcconaughey does not instill great confidence that youre going get great movie experience now that is not say that mcconaughey hasnt done some great movies every ghosts girlfriends past sahara failure launch there are we are marshall how lose guy 10 days lincoln lawyer is luckily part later group reminds us that mcconaughey can carry movie without having take off his shirt every scene lincoln lawyer is thrilling drama about cocky smooth defense attorney mick haller played by mcconaughey who represents high profile client charges attempted murder but as new evidence continues pile mick starts grow suspicious that perhaps his client isnt telling him everything with twists turns at every corner lincoln lawyer keeps you guessing till very end with help that distinct country voice southern charm mcconaughey takes movie another level with this portrayal fast talking lawyer with role mick mcconaughey is actually given chance show off range emotions that will truly surprise viewers mcconaughey doesnt carry this alone lincoln lawyer gets some great acting likes william h macy michael pena john leguizamo josh lucas marisa tomei only black sheep his movie comes alleged murderer louis roulet played by ever wooden ryan phillippe only thing i find amazing phillippes attempt at acting is his unique talent deliver every line dialogue without moving single muscle his face tension intensity that begins engulf mike as case continues is stellar lincoln lawyer really pushes mike edge as his whole world becomes begins collapse due his attorney client relationship this is where lincoln lawyer really comes alive delivers must see movie experience court room scenes are some my favorite scenes movie there are plenty approach they took portraying lawyer aspect film feels accurate realistic plot is solid keeps you invested right beginning keeps grip tight throughout movie movie keeps good pacing dialogue is smart witty films color camera work gives very raw feel although at times it can be little too unstable story characterization is done well but there are few things that should have been given more focus like mike maggies relationship more insight as why they got divorced movie touches idea with scene or two but never really reveals too much we also never really get too much mikes relationship with his daughter my biggest problem with film was underwhelming ending that really had everything necessary end movie with but still felt lackluster when it came however dont let these few problems sway you i strongly recommend this film promise you that you will leave satisfied www moviefloss com,0.4686804131540973,0.1738397129186603,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6.0,Ping Pong Tournament,"Greetings again from the darkness. Major dilemma: I am a sucker for courtroom dramas vs. I am no fan of Matthew McConaughey. I decided to give it a shot, and given my low expectations, I found the movie to be quite entertaining - despite its numerous flaws. If you are a fan of the endless stream of John Grisham book-turned-movie, then I expect you will find this one to your taste.Based on the Michael Connelly series of novels built around Mick Haller, this one has the look and feel of part one. Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer, so named because of his propensity to handle much of his work from the backseat of a classic Lincoln Town Car. The choice of McConaughey as Haller seemed all together wrong given his annual appearance in some lame ass Rom-Com, where he spends most of each movie shirtless and smirking. Luckily for us, Mr. McConaughey manages to re-capture some of the acting skills he flashed in A Time to Kill, so many years ago.In addition to his close to the vest portrayal of Haller, the movie works because of an incredibly deep cast that includes Marisa Tomei as his ex-wife and frequent courtroom adversary (she is an ADA), Ryan Phillipe as the accused rich boy, William H Macy as the long-time and streetwise private investigator, Josh Lucas as the ADA in the main case, Bryan Cranston as the detective in charge, plus Michael Pena, Bob Gunton (warden from Shawshank), John Leguizamo, Frances Fisher, Laurence Mason (Earl the driver), Shea Willingham (Boardwalk Empire), Trace Adkins (country star as the leader of a biker gang) and Michael Pare (Eddie and Cruisers). Seriously, this cast allows every scene to have something worth watching.The two things that prevent the movie from being top notch are the beyond belief exaggerated moments (including about 3 too many endings) and the absolutely distracting camera work courtesy of director Brad Furman. In the hands of a more experienced director, many of the flaws could have been corrected.This is not presented as an ultra serious courtroom drama in the vein of 12 Angry Men or Judgment at Nuremberg. Rather it is a character driven story with a multitude of twists ... some of which work and some of which don't. I found it to be quite enjoyable despite the script issues and the hey-look-at-me direction.",ping pong tournament,greetings again darkness major dilemma i am sucker courtroom dramas vs i am no fan matthew mcconaughey i decided give it shot given my low expectations i found movie be quite entertaining despite its numerous flaws if you are fan endless stream john grisham book turned movie then i expect you will find this one your taste based michael connelly series novels built around mick haller this one has look feel part one haller is lincoln lawyer so named because his propensity handle much his work backseat classic lincoln town car choice mcconaughey as haller seemed all together wrong given his annual appearance some lame ass rom com where he spends most each movie shirtless smirking luckily us mr mcconaughey manages re capture some acting skills he flashed time kill so many years ago addition his close vest portrayal haller movie works because incredibly deep cast that includes marisa tomei as his ex wife frequent courtroom adversary she is ada ryan phillipe as accused rich boy william h macy as long time streetwise private investigator josh lucas as ada main case bryan cranston as detective charge plus michael pena bob gunton warden shawshank john leguizamo frances fisher laurence mason earl driver shea willingham boardwalk empire trace adkins country star as leader biker gang michael pare eddie cruisers seriously this cast allows every scene have something worth watching two things that prevent movie being top notch are beyond belief exaggerated moments including about 3 too many endings absolutely distracting camera work courtesy director brad furman hands more experienced director many flaws could have been corrected this is not presented as ultra serious courtroom drama vein 12 angry men or judgment at nuremberg rather it is character driven story with multitude twists some which work some which dont i found it be quite enjoyable despite script issues hey look at me direction,0.5559895833333334,0.11132812500000001,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.46}"

8.0,"Crackling with tension and suspense, and buoyed by an excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey, this twisty and well-plotted legal thriller is one of the best in years","Matthew McConaughey returns to the courtroom- after a string of rom-coms that had all but typecast him as the romantic cad- to play the sleek, smarmy and hustling defense attorney Mick Haller, a famed Michael Connelly character whose first appearance was in the book on which this film is based. It was back in 1996 when McConaughey first made his mark in Hollywood with a stunning lead debut in the legal thriller ""A Time to Kill"", and it seems the years have not dimmed his ability to light up a courtroom. With his signature slick charm, toothy grin and Southern drawl, McConaughey is dynamic as ever in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", the title a reference to his character's workplace- the back seat of a Lincoln Continental whose registration plate reads ""NTGUILTY"". Haller is chauffeured from courtroom to courtroom across Los Angeles by Earl (Lawrence Mason), a former client now offering his services in lieu of legal fees. His clientele belong in the rock-bottom of society- biker gangs, drug dealers, and prostitutes- and because of this, Haller's expertise lies in negotiating plea bargains through finding loopholes that can get crucial evidence thrown out of court. Cajoling, wheedling and sweet-talking are the tools of his trade- very early on, we see Haller sweet-talking a bailiff to get a case advanced on the docket, deliberately delaying the trial of a biker until he gets his fee, and plea bargaining on behalf of a hooker who accepted payment in crack cocaine- and McConaughey's cocksure ease fits just right with his character. His latest client however is somewhat different, a Beverly Hills rich kid called Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is being charged with assault and battery of a female escort. Haller knows that he has struck gold, but the case starts becoming more complicated when Louis insists that he is innocent and flatly refuses to accept any plea bargain. The trailer will reveal more, but as with any crime thriller, the less you know the better. Suffice to say that veteran crime screenwriter John Romano has retained all the elements of Connelly's twisty, cleverly plotted thriller, including Roulet's overprotective matriarchal parent Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher), Haller's reliable investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy) and Haller's ex-wife-cum-prosecutor Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei). Other characters that readers of Connelly's book will instantly recognise are the bail bondsman Val (John Leguizamo) through whom Haller gets Roulet's case, and Haller's former client Jesus Martinez (Michael Pena) intimately connected with his latest case. Romano had the unenviable task of condensing Connelly's page-turning novel into a two-hour movie, and he does so superbly without losing any of the tension or suspense in the story. He also loses none of Connelly's debates about the vagaries in the justice system, seeing as how attorneys like Haller manage to put the innocent in jail and the guilty back out on the streets. Haller's crisis of conscience is also at the heart of the movie, and McConaughey gets to do some serious acting when his character is eventually confronted with the magnitude of his past follies. On his part, director Brad Furman (The Take) keeps the pace of the movie crackling every step of the way, making this as much of a gripping yarn as reading Connelly's novel. Furman's most significant accomplishment is in employing Lukas Ettlin's cinematography to give the movie a great sense of place amidst the less glamorous streets of Los Angeles, an unpretty look that suits the theme of the story just fine. Of course, Furman and Ettlin are equally adept when it comes to courtroom drama, and the back-and-forth questioning by Haller and the inexperienced prosecutor (Josh Lucas) unfolds with sizzling rhythm. Kudos to Furman too for assembling a top-notch ensemble cast who do outstandingly in their various supporting roles- especially William H. Macy as the wisecracking investigator, and Shea Whigham as a colourful jailhouse snitch called on the prosecution to testify against Roulet. But the actor that holds the movie from start to finish is McConaughey- and just as how ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" became a star-making turn for Connelly regular Mick Haller, McConaughey's performance here will also be a similarly definitive turn as the on screen rendition of that character.",crackling with tension suspense buoyed by excellent performance by matthew mcconaughey this twisty well plotted legal thriller is one best years,matthew mcconaughey returns courtroom after string rom coms that had all but typecast him as romantic cad play sleek smarmy hustling defense attorney mick haller famed michael connelly character whose first appearance was book which this film is based it was back 1996 when mcconaughey first made his mark hollywood with stunning lead debut legal thriller time kill it seems years have not dimmed his ability light up courtroom with his signature slick charm toothy grin southern drawl mcconaughey is dynamic as ever lincoln lawyer title reference his characters workplace back seat lincoln continental whose registration plate reads ntguilty haller is chauffeured courtroom courtroom across los angeles by earl lawrence mason former client now offering his services lieu legal fees his clientele belong rock bottom society biker gangs drug dealers prostitutes because this hallers expertise lies negotiating plea bargains through finding loopholes that can get crucial evidence thrown out court cajoling wheedling sweet talking are tools his trade very early we see haller sweet talking bailiff get case advanced docket deliberately delaying trial biker until he gets his fee plea bargaining behalf hooker who accepted payment crack cocaine mcconaugheys cocksure ease fits just right with his character his latest client however is somewhat different beverly hills rich kid called louis roulet ryan phillippe who is being charged with assault battery female escort haller knows that he has struck gold but case starts becoming more complicated when louis insists that he is innocent flatly refuses accept any plea bargain trailer will reveal more but as with any crime thriller less you know better suffice say that veteran crime screenwriter john romano has retained all elements connellys twisty cleverly plotted thriller including roulets overprotective matriarchal parent mary windsor frances fisher hallers reliable investigator frank levin william h macy hallers ex wife cum prosecutor maggie mcpherson marisa tomei other characters that readers connellys book will instantly recognise are bail bondsman val john leguizamo through whom haller gets roulets case hallers former client jesus martinez michael pena intimately connected with his latest case romano had unenviable task condensing connellys page turning novel into two hour movie he does so superbly without losing any tension or suspense story he also loses none connellys debates about vagaries justice system seeing as how attorneys like haller manage put innocent jail guilty back out streets hallers crisis conscience is also at heart movie mcconaughey gets do some serious acting when his character is eventually confronted with magnitude his past follies his part director brad furman take keeps pace movie crackling every step way making this as much gripping yarn as reading connellys novel furmans most significant accomplishment is employing lukas ettlins cinematography give movie great sense place amidst less glamorous streets los angeles unpretty look that suits theme story just fine course furman ettlin are equally adept when it comes courtroom drama back forth questioning by haller inexperienced prosecutor josh lucas unfolds with sizzling rhythm kudos furman too assembling top notch ensemble cast who do outstandingly their various supporting roles especially william h macy as wisecracking investigator shea whigham as colourful jailhouse snitch called prosecution testify against roulet but actor that holds movie start finish is mcconaughey just as how lincoln lawyer became star making turn connelly regular mick haller mcconaugheys performance here will also be similarly definitive turn as screen rendition that character,0.47578563227816956,0.19003553660270078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,A Nutshell Review: The Lincoln Lawyer,"Matthew McConaughey's roles have usually been the action adventurer or the romantic comedy lead these days, but it has always been his breakout role in Joel Schumacher's A Time to Kill, based upon what would be my favourite amongst the John Grisham books, that still remained one of his best, until his second outing now in a role as a criminal defense lawyer in Michael Connelly's bestseller of the same name. I suppose McConaguhey can convincingly project the savvy and wily minds of what it takes to be a legal eagle, given that after all he had swapped law school for film school.As Mick Haller, McConaughey shows how slick his character can be in glib talking his way through his myriad of contacts and networks built up over the course of his career, from ex clients to current ones, from beat cops to opposing lawyers. At times you may suddenly think of it as being a bastardization of justice, since Law Abiding Citizen reminded one and all that it's all boiled down to what you can actually prove in the court of law. So we actually cheer Haller on as the unorthodox lawyer who gets the job done, guided by a moral compass not to put an innocent man behind bars. He operates out of the Lincoln sedan, which is where the title got its name from, though a scene in the trailer that affirmed his choice of office got left out.And as far as the trailer goes, it probably hinted at all the narrative sequence to come - with Ryan Phillippe's Louis Roulet, a rich playboy realtor who got accused of bashing up a prostitute, and for Haller to defend him only to find that his client is more than meets the eye and may not be the innocent man he incessantly proclaims to be, and ultimately finding room to threaten Haller and his family. Well, thankfully that only scratched the surface of the story, which with its rich characterization is one of the key reasons why this film should be watched, since it's not your typical Matlock episode.I may say I've seen a number of courtroom movies and it does take something extra to provide that boost to its story, and here's where Michael Connelly aces it, by constantly highlighting a sense of danger in Haller's way that strikes very close to friends and family, never fearful of getting things out of the equation. More interestingly he presents a moral and professional dilemma for Haller who finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place, and has to utilize the full extent of his savvies to bail himself out of the situation, have justice served, lock the bad guys up and ultimately, making sure his family remains safe from the very real threats coming his way.While lacking very big name stars, this film is full of character actors that make The Lincoln Lawyer a compelling watch. There's Marisa Tomei as Haller's ex-wife and co-prosecutor, William H. Macy as the investigator for Haller's camp, spotting some great hippie hairdo unseen in his films before, John Leguizamo, Michael Pena and Josh Lucas who plays a relatively green prosecutor. But of course McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe (always bearing a sense of having something to hide) were great opposite each other, on the surface standing on the same side of the law, but beneath there's trouble brewing with a capital T as the client-attorney privilege boundaries get close to being violated on moral grounds.Michael Connelly is probably better known for his detective Harry Bosch series of books, but looking at how this turned out I'm secreting hoping the other films in the Mick Haller series get made as well. A great legal thriller on manipulation with a good twist at the end, perhaps the cinematography could have been improved somewhat if all shaky cam moments got converted and done the more conventional way of putting the camera on a tripod.",nutshell review lincoln lawyer,matthew mcconaugheys roles have usually been action adventurer or romantic comedy lead these days but it has always been his breakout role joel schumachers time kill based upon what would be my favourite amongst john grisham books that still remained one his best until his second outing now role as criminal defense lawyer michael connellys bestseller same name i suppose mcconaguhey can convincingly project savvy wily minds what it takes be legal eagle given that after all he had swapped law school film school as mick haller mcconaughey shows how slick his character can be glib talking his way through his myriad contacts networks built up over course his career ex clients current ones beat cops opposing lawyers at times you may suddenly think it as being bastardization justice since law abiding citizen reminded one all that its all boiled down what you can actually prove court law so we actually cheer haller as unorthodox lawyer who gets job done guided by moral compass not put innocent man behind bars he operates out lincoln sedan which is where title got its name though scene trailer that affirmed his choice office got left out as far as trailer goes it probably hinted at all narrative sequence come with ryan phillippes louis roulet rich playboy realtor who got accused bashing up prostitute haller defend him only find that his client is more than meets eye may not be innocent man he incessantly proclaims be ultimately finding room threaten haller his family well thankfully that only scratched surface story which with its rich characterization is one key reasons why this film should be watched since its not your typical matlock episode i may say ive seen number courtroom movies it does take something extra provide that boost its story heres where michael connelly aces it by constantly highlighting sense danger hallers way that strikes very close friends family never fearful getting things out equation more interestingly he presents moral professional dilemma haller who finds himself stuck between rock hard place has utilize full extent his savvies bail himself out situation have justice served lock bad guys up ultimately making sure his family remains safe very real threats coming his way while lacking very big name stars this film is full character actors that make lincoln lawyer compelling watch theres marisa tomei as hallers ex wife co prosecutor william h macy as investigator hallers camp spotting some great hippie hairdo unseen his films before john leguizamo michael pena josh lucas who plays relatively green prosecutor but course mcconaughey ryan phillippe always bearing sense having something hide were great opposite each other surface standing same side law but beneath theres trouble brewing with capital t as client attorney privilege boundaries get close being violated moral grounds michael connelly is probably better known his detective harry bosch series books but looking at how this turned out im secreting hoping other films mick haller series get made as well great legal thriller manipulation with good twist at end perhaps cinematography could have been improved somewhat if all shaky cam moments got converted done more conventional way putting camera tripod,0.4773267825648779,0.1384114386495339,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,Refreshing courtroom drama,"Starring Matthew McConaughey in this courtroom drama tells the story of a lawyer and his justice in protecting his name to help and serve his clients. In this film, he finds a perfect fit for his likable personality and screen charisma in a fictitious character created by Michael Connelly (Blood Work), a prolific best-selling author of legal thrillers. Michael ""Mickey"" Haller (McConaughey) conducts business in Los Angeles County from the back seat of a Lincoln Town Car driven by Earl (Laurence Mason), a former client working off his legal fees. This is a great role for McConaughey where he doesn't need to be over the top, and spewing out ridiculous one-liners, as he carries the film through beginning to end.Within the film, we see that Haller is a smooth operator who relies on his street smarts to make sure he always gets payment up front for the legal services rendered. He tries hard to avoid lengthy trials and prefers to cut slick plea bargain deals for the scum he represents. The Lincoln Lawyer does play out as if there was a potential series or franchise lined up, but since the film was not a box office success, we were only left with one film. This film is far more engaging and entertaining than one would have originally presented, as it keeps us the audience engaged in the story and wanting more of each step of the way. The supporting cast play their roles great, the dialogue is clever and the end result isn't as predictable as some of these other recent drama releases.

8.0,Matthew Is Good in This One,"I've always enjoyed sleazy lawyer movies. This one has an almost comic sense about it. As a lawyer to many lowlifes the central figure is able to balance his world through deal making. Of course, at first he is a money grubbing, anything goes personality, but finds out that there is more to life that this kind of existence. He is, of course, suave and controlled and usually gets his way. However, his office is in his car and his prospects of ever hitting it really big are quite limited. Still, there is a fine give and take between him and his client. There are some great twist and turns that spell a nice movie if you don't take it too seriously. It is remindful of those offbeat detective films of the forties where everyone gets in on the act and the conclusion is quite satisfying.

9.0,Because he Drives a Lincoln,"McConaughey knows how to pick his courtroom drama movies. ""A Time to Kill"" is one of my all time favorites and now I have to add ""Lincoln Lawyer"" to my list of faves.Matthew McConaughey played attorney Michael ""Mick"" Haller. He was a wheeling and dealing street savvy defense lawyer with all sorts of clients. Early in the movie Val (John Leguizamo), a bail bondsman, put him on to a wealthy client who was arrested for assaulting a prostitute. The client, Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), looked guilty (but that could be because I don't like Ryan Phillippe). He was a smug, young, rich boy who was claiming he got set up and it just didn't sit right. Then again, maybe he really was innocent and that's the twist.I thought the movie was going for the long march toward proving that Louis was innocent though he looked guilty. That would've been OK, but very routine and unoriginal. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait long to find out where the movie was going because Haller found out exactly why he was hired by this rich kid who could hire any lawyer he wanted. Louis was responsible for a murder that a former client of Haller's was locked up for. So now, with attorney-client privilege firmly in place, Haller would have to adequately defend Louis while knowing he was guilty of two crimes (the murder pinned on Jesus Martinez (Michael Pena) and the assault of Regina Campo (Margarita Levieva)).""Lincoln Lawyer"" was different and I liked that. The suspense wasn't upon the guilt or innocence of the defendant, or even upon what the jury would decide, but rather how Haller could both defend AND serve up his client to authorities. Haller had his hands full because Louis was clever, ruthless, and wealthy; a lethal combination. I loved it. It was a battle of wits and the lines were clearly drawn. What could Haller possibly do to get this creep off the streets was what we were all waiting for and it was well worth the wait.",because he drives lincoln,mcconaughey knows how pick his courtroom drama movies time kill is one my all time favorites now i have add lincoln lawyer my list faves matthew mcconaughey played attorney michael mick haller he was wheeling dealing street savvy defense lawyer with all sorts clients early movie val john leguizamo bail bondsman put him wealthy client who was arrested assaulting prostitute client louis roulet ryan phillippe looked guilty but that could be because i dont like ryan phillippe he was smug young rich boy who was claiming he got set up it just didnt sit right then again maybe he really was innocent thats twist i thought movie was going long march toward proving that louis was innocent though he looked guilty that wouldve been ok but very routine unoriginal fortunately we didnt have wait long find out where movie was going because haller found out exactly why he was hired by this rich kid who could hire any lawyer he wanted louis was responsible murder that former client hallers was locked up so now with attorney client privilege firmly place haller would have adequately defend louis while knowing he was guilty two crimes murder pinned jesus martinez michael pena assault regina campo margarita levieva lincoln lawyer was different i liked that suspense wasnt upon guilt or innocence defendant or even upon what jury would decide but rather how haller could both defend serve up his client authorities haller had his hands full because louis was clever ruthless wealthy lethal combination i loved it it was battle wits lines were clearly drawn what could haller possibly do get this creep off streets was what we were all waiting it was well worth wait,0.5859307359307362,0.13744588744588745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.49}"
9.0,Absolutely loved this!,"Well well well, why have I waited 10 years to watch this. It's a brilliant film.McConaughey is an actor that doesn't overly sell films for me, I've seen a few in the past that have put me off him. But he was fantastic in this, really sold his character well. Might have to start watching more of his films now.So the plot - its great. It's relatively simple in a sense that it's not hard to understand, yet the story has a good 3 to 4 more layers embedded within. So the entire journey through this film you are constantly gripped and wondering what will happen next. It's genuinely a really good plot!My only negative thought with this film is the little storyline he has with his ex wife. Nothing really gets explored with that. We know they split and have a daughter, however they seem to still somewhat get on and in the first hour it hints that it's heading towards being a major part of some plot. But the whole storyline vanishes and focuses on the court case. Which don't get me wrong is for the better as you're watching this for the drama, not romance. But my point is just why include it?

5.0,Plot Holes,"The good: This old-school courtroom thriller has good casting and acting, and features a fast-moving plot that keeps you on your toes. It also features Marisa Tomei who is as lovely as always.The screenplay, however, is one of those times when the writers try too hard to be clever beyond their grasp of the plot, and end up shooting themselves in the foot and contradicting themselves..*spoilers*The biggest problem is with Roulet's plan. At first he lies so well that he even has McConaughey believing him. And since he is a well known talented lawyer, and now he has him on his side, that should be enough to win. In fact, he could have hired any lawyer with his money and convinced him the same way. Except for some reason this isn't enough and it suddenly turns out that he asked for McConaughey because it would conflict with a previous case where he put an innocent man in jail.So what is the plan exactly? To have McConaughey afraid of revealing his mistake in public? Nothing would have happened! Everyone made the same mistake including the judge. In fact, he may just be the type of person who would want very much to correct this mistake, thus choosing him as his lawyer as part of his strategy makes no sense.In addition, if he hadn't hired him, nobody would have made the connection between the two murders in the first place.And then he goes and kills McConaughey's friend and sets him up for blackmail. Besides this being already two plans too many, once again, why not blackmail any other lawyer that wouldn't have been able to connect the cases in the first place? And to really finish himself off, he made it personal by killing McConaughey's friend when he could have framed any old murder in the same way. Would you hire a lawyer to defend you from the death penalty after killing his friend? Obviously he can do any of 500 things to sabotage the case, which is exactly what he did.And then they just couldn't resist adding a completely random twist where the murderer turns out to be someone else for no particular reason, thus undermining plausibility just to keep the twists coming.There are more plot holes, but this is quite enough for now.So, again, a case of hacks trying to be clever and biting off way more than they can chew.",plot holes,good this old school courtroom thriller has good casting acting features fast moving plot that keeps you your toes it also features marisa tomei who is as lovely as always screenplay however is one those times when writers try too hard be clever beyond their grasp plot end up shooting themselves foot contradicting themselves spoilers biggest problem is with roulets plan at first he lies so well that he even has mcconaughey believing him since he is well known talented lawyer now he has him his side that should be enough win fact he could have hired any lawyer with his money convinced him same way except some reason this isnt enough it suddenly turns out that he asked mcconaughey because it would conflict with previous case where he put innocent man jail so what is plan exactly have mcconaughey afraid revealing his mistake public nothing would have happened everyone made same mistake including judge fact he may just be type person who would want very much correct this mistake thus choosing him as his lawyer as part his strategy makes no sense addition if he hadnt hired him nobody would have made connection between two murders first place then he goes kills mcconaugheys friend sets him up blackmail besides this being already two plans too many once again why not blackmail any other lawyer that wouldnt have been able connect cases first place really finish himself off he made it personal by killing mcconaugheys friend when he could have framed any old murder same way would you hire lawyer defend you death penalty after killing his friend obviously he can do any 500 things sabotage case which is exactly what he did then they just couldnt resist adding completely random twist where murderer turns out be someone else no particular reason thus undermining plausibility just keep twists coming there are more plot holes but this is quite enough now so again case hacks trying be clever biting off way more than they can chew,0.41900000000000004,0.16191666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,""" No one is innocent until I see the size of his bank account ""","In every American courtroom there is a statue which represents the Greek goddess Justice. Anyone who comes before her in a courtroom is suppose to be innocent until proved guilty. However, that is not always the case. In this Michael Connelly story, a hustling pragmatic attorney is hired to defend the son of a wealthy real estate family on the charge of rape. Accordingly, his defense states the brutalized victim is really after a hefty settlement. To this end the Lincoln Lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) Mick Haller, creates a plausible defense and seeks evidence with which to exonerate his guilty client. At the same time, a wrongly convicted prison inmate, pleads for Haller to believe him that he is innocent. Believing that money makes for a better case, Haller shuns truth over justice. That all comes crashing down as he is overtaken by conscience and his chief investigator is murdered, which causes him to begin an uphill battle to set things right. Marisa Tomei leads a superb cast which includes Ryan Phillippe, William H. Macy, John Leguizamo, Michael Peña, Bob Gunton and Michael Paré. The result of their efforts ultimately creates a memorable Classic.

7.0,"Good TV-caliber plot in a well-acted, well-produced feature film","The film critics I've read have done an unusually good job discussing The Lincoln Lawyer, as I saw it. I will just hit the main points about the movie, pro and con, that made an impression on me. Overall, I thought the movie was well-acted, well-produced, and entertaining, even if limited by what might be called only a good TV-caliber screenplay.The movie drew me in at the very start when the Lincoln town car of the title and its driver turned out not to be the phony Hollywood glitz I had expected but a seedy image that fit the movie perfectly. (One amateur review's complaint that the car somehow failed to serve its purpose simply because the title character drove around in other vehicles at various points is silly.) The well-acted characters and unusually dingy L.A. settings generally felt authentic, as far as they went. Matthew McConaughey fit naturally, smoothly, and effectively into the lead character of Mick Haller. Haller is a slick, shady L.A. criminal defense lawyer who gets results for his low-life clients, even if things do not always turn out for the best. Haller runs into serious problems, suffers blows from them, does not act always and mindlessly cocky (unlike the annoying, one-note young prosecutor-on-the-make in the movie Fracture), yet draws on enough strength, ingenuity, and resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him. This made him fun to watch. Sometimes, he stepped over the line, but not so far as to throw believability to the winds.The story was basically interesting and tied up fairly neatly. In fact, it is quite an accomplishment to make a mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining and satisfying without going completely over the top, the way so many of these kind of movies do (such as The Firm, Final Analysis, Just Cause, Guilty as Sin, General's Daughter, and the Ashley Judd films Double Jeopardy and High Crimes). Lincoln Lawyer was refreshingly free of exploitative, sensational scenes used to gin up cheap shock value, horror, suspense, or titillation.At the same time, I have to agree with the critics that the movie's story and characters do seem familiar. Although workmanlike, including the courtroom scenes, well-handled by McConaughey, the movie lacked the sparks of imagination, originality, intricacy, and electricity that can sometimes come from films like this. It did not really hit the high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting. The writing, while good, seemed more like a script for a high-quality TV show than theatrical film. And some of the supporting characters, especially Haller's ex-wife and the bail bondsman, were badly under-developed and pasted on, wasting talented actors in nothing or contrived roles. Haller's interactions with his ex-wife were not convincing.Similarly unconvincing was the degree to which he felt a crisis of conscience about the way he represented a past client in light of newly discovered information from representing his current, rich-boy client, accused of trying to beat to death a woman he met at a bar. Haller had more practical and selfish reasons for resolving the current case the way he did, without delving so deeply into soul-searching and noble motives, which seemed ill-suited to the rest of the movie.",good tv caliber plot well acted well produced feature film,film critics ive read have done unusually good job discussing lincoln lawyer as i saw it i will just hit main points about movie pro con that made impression me overall i thought movie was well acted well produced entertaining even if limited by what might be called only good tv caliber screenplay movie drew me at very start when lincoln town car title its driver turned out not be phony hollywood glitz i had expected but seedy image that fit movie perfectly one amateur reviews complaint that car somehow failed serve its purpose simply because title character drove around other vehicles at various points is silly well acted characters unusually dingy l settings generally felt authentic as far as they went matthew mcconaughey fit naturally smoothly effectively into lead character mick haller haller is slick shady l criminal defense lawyer who gets results his low life clients even if things do not always turn out best haller runs into serious problems suffers blows them does not act always mindlessly cocky unlike annoying one note young prosecutor make movie fracture yet draws enough strength ingenuity resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him this made him fun watch sometimes he stepped over line but not so far as throw believability winds story was basically interesting tied up fairly neatly fact it is quite accomplishment make mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining satisfying without going completely over top way so many these kind movies do such as firm final analysis just cause guilty as sin generals daughter ashley judd films double jeopardy high crimes lincoln lawyer was refreshingly free exploitative sensational scenes used gin up cheap shock value horror suspense or titillation at same time i have agree with critics that movies story characters do seem familiar although workmanlike including courtroom scenes well handled by mcconaughey movie lacked sparks imagination originality intricacy electricity that can sometimes come films like this it did not really hit high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting writing while good seemed more like script high quality tv show than theatrical film some supporting characters especially hallers ex wife bail bondsman were badly under developed pasted wasting talented actors nothing or contrived roles hallers interactions with his ex wife were not convincing similarly unconvincing was degree which he felt crisis conscience about way he represented past client light newly discovered information representing his current rich boy client accused trying beat death woman he met at bar haller had more practical selfish reasons resolving current case way he did without delving so deeply into soul searching noble motives which seemed ill suited rest movie,0.5685554407713497,0.12011289846517119,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Reverse Indemnity,"What an amazingly lucky form the courtroom has presented filmmakers!It allows us to have one film where we sit in our seats with others making sense of a narrative, where we watch another ""film"" where a lawyer presents a narrative to a seated audience. There all sorts of overlaps and touches in what is allowed between the two layers. Each depends on very strict formula.In the outer story, everyone is a stereotype: the rich widow, the violent but honorable bikers, the exwife, pretty secretary, gruff cop and so on. Everyone operates according to rules we know, the only mystery being what rules apply.In the inner story, we inherit the rules of the courtroom. These do not comport with reality any more than say movie spaceships match the world of physics, but we know what those rules are. We expect and in collaboration with the filmmaker we exploit them.This is classic folded narrative. Amazingly, the genre is flexible enough to be stretched in an interesting way. The usual form is: evidence will surely convict an innocent man, and it is up to our (sometimes noirish) lawyer to align the outcome of the two narratives. The variety we have experienced in our small century of film is pretty broad, each one setting new bounds for another.In this case, we have an early hint that the police are framing a guy. Then we suddenly are told that no, the suspect is guilty not only of that crime, but of a previous one that resulted in an innocent's conviction. Now it becomes the lawyer's job as inner filmmaker to bring the outer story to the court rather than the usual other way around.The novelty of how he does this depends on our acceptance of inviolable rules of lawyering and trials, and it really is clever. He uses a THIRD storyteller, one who as an outlaw follows no story rules. This fellow is manipulated (because he DOES follow the rules of stereotype) into telling a fabricated story. He is a proved false storyteller, but his falsehood is true and allows the main folds to resolve.Because these things require a twist, and the main narrative does not allow for one, we have an extra bit on the end that surprises a little on a minor plot point. It features the notable Frances Fisher.Some of the car comings and goings that are usually filler and transition are used here as settings for genuine storytelling. The black chauffeur, our designated representative (named after Erle Stanley) in the non-courtroom threads, is always a risky play when the whole enterprise depends on stereotypes. Fortunately, we are far from offended by the special place this actor (Laurence Mason) finds.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",reverse indemnity,what amazingly lucky form courtroom has presented filmmakers it allows us have one film where we sit our seats with others making sense narrative where we watch another film where lawyer presents narrative seated audience there all sorts overlaps touches what is allowed between two layers each depends very strict formula outer story everyone is stereotype rich widow violent but honorable bikers exwife pretty secretary gruff cop so everyone operates according rules we know only mystery being what rules apply inner story we inherit rules courtroom these do not comport with reality any more than say movie spaceships match world physics but we know what those rules are we expect collaboration with filmmaker we exploit them this is classic folded narrative amazingly genre is flexible enough be stretched interesting way usual form is evidence will surely convict innocent man it is up our sometimes noirish lawyer align outcome two narratives variety we have experienced our small century film is pretty broad each one setting new bounds another this case we have early hint that police are framing guy then we suddenly are told that no suspect is guilty not only that crime but previous one that resulted innocents conviction now it becomes lawyers job as inner filmmaker bring outer story court rather than usual other way around novelty how he does this depends our acceptance inviolable rules lawyering trials it really is clever he uses third storyteller one who as outlaw follows no story rules this fellow is manipulated because he does follow rules stereotype into telling fabricated story he is proved false storyteller but his falsehood is true allows main folds resolve because these things require twist main narrative does not allow one we have extra bit end that surprises little minor plot point it features notable frances fisher some car comings goings that are usually filler transition are used here as settings genuine storytelling black chauffeur our designated representative named after erle stanley non courtroom threads is always risky play when whole enterprise depends stereotypes fortunately we are far offended by special place this actor laurence mason finds teds evaluation 2 3 has some interesting elements,0.5299103385040885,0.10698277417027417,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.48}"
5.0,A Time to DriveAway,"A lot of people (well, critics) were proclaiming Matthew McConaughey's ""triumphant"" return to the courtroom since 1996's A Time to Kill is The Lincoln Lawyer. Hardly; on many accounts.First: I really, REALLY loved A Time to Kill, but it was still a thoroughly fictional and Hollywoodized tale of the deep south, whereas The Lincoln Lawyer was a much more realistic tale of the legal system in modern L.A. Second: despite reading the very long John Grisham novel (twice) the movie wasn't all that predictable, whereas The Lincoln Lawyer was. Every step of the way. And third – BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST – the performances were hardly worthy of a mention in The Lincoln Lawyer whereas in A Time to Kill, they were brilliant.Okay, now that I debunked those nasty comparisons and hopefully helped you see this as two barely similar, but completely different courtroom tales, let's focus on this low-rent lawyer and how he defends the guilty to keep his car running in both this economy and with the rising gas prices.Mick Haller (McConaughey) works out of his car, a Lincoln to be precise – hence the film's (and from the adapted book) title, and he represents scum who are most likely and definitely guilty so he can continue his, uh, ""practice"" until one day he gets a tip that a high profile case might be seeking him out.Louis Roulet (Phillippe) is accused of sexually assaulting and almost killing a woman. He claims he's innocent and it's up to Mick who's juggling his ex-wife/fbuddy, a motorcycle gang and finances to defend the pretty boy.Seriouslyfrom the moment Louis enters the screen, you know how this will pan out or if he's guilty or not. The nice thing about this movie is: it doesn't matter. It's all about Mick both redeeming himself and how on Earth will he get out of this? I like movies that have characters backed into corners and whether right or wrong, they have to find a clever way out. Also, I LOVE courtroom dramas. Whether in film or book format.Unfortunately, this isn't a great movie, or perfect lawyer yarn, but it's entertaining and suspenseful enough for a viewing. Yeah, 'a' as in singular. This is mainly due to its length and its multiple endings – God, I hate more than 1-2-3 or FOUR sometimes finales.Quite frankly, I'd much rather watch the (surprisingly superior) comedy Liar, Liar where another lawyer has to get out of an impossible trial with a defendant who might be guilty. At least that entertained me, at a much quicker pace, less screen time and didn't take itself too seriously.Overall, it's not a bad viewingbut at home. On the Freezone on your DVR box from Cox Communications. Just don't expect this to be briefly mentioned at the next Oscars.",time drive away,lot people well critics were proclaiming matthew mcconaugheys triumphant return courtroom since 1996s time kill is lincoln lawyer hardly many accounts first i really really loved time kill but it was still thoroughly fictional hollywoodized tale deep south whereas lincoln lawyer was much more realistic tale legal system modern l second despite reading very long john grisham novel twice movie wasnt all that predictable whereas lincoln lawyer was every step way third but certainly not least performances were hardly worthy mention lincoln lawyer whereas time kill they were brilliant okay now that i debunked those nasty comparisons hopefully helped you see this as two barely similar but completely different courtroom tales lets focus this low rent lawyer how he defends guilty keep his car running both this economy with rising gas prices mick haller mcconaughey works out his car lincoln be precise hence films adapted book title he represents scum who are most likely definitely guilty so he can continue his uh practice until one day he gets tip that high profile case might be seeking him out louis roulet phillippe is accused sexually assaulting almost killing woman he claims hes innocent its up mick whos juggling his ex wife fbuddy motorcycle gang finances defend pretty boy seriously moment louis enters screen you know how this will pan out or if hes guilty or not nice thing about this movie is it doesnt matter its all about mick both redeeming himself how earth will he get out this i like movies that have characters backed into corners whether right or wrong they have find clever way out also i love courtroom dramas whether film or book format unfortunately this isnt great movie or perfect lawyer yarn but its entertaining suspenseful enough viewing yeah as singular this is mainly due its length its multiple endings god i hate more than 1 2 3 or four sometimes finales quite frankly id much rather watch surprisingly superior comedy liar liar where another lawyer has get out impossible trial with defendant who might be guilty at least that entertained me at much quicker pace less screen time didnt take itself too seriously overall its not bad viewing but at home freezone your dvr box cox communications just dont expect this be briefly mentioned at next oscars,0.5793013270882124,0.08288056206088992,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5.0,Time Killer,"Matthew McConaughey plays the sleazy, street-wise lawyer Mick Haller who at one point exclaims that he 'couldn't believe he was representing an innocent man' which goes to show the types of people he defends. The Lincoln Lawyer follows the story of Haller as he takes on Louis Roulet (Played by Ryan Phillippe) who has been suspected of assault. But as he represents him starts to question the good in what he is doing and the morals of his actions. This is one of McConaughey's finest roles in a long time but is nothing compared to William H. Macy who plays his detective in the case and brings a charismatic and involved attitude, stealing the limelight off of anyone else on screen.The problems that lie within The Lincoln Lawyer however are the horrible plot points that often appear out of nowhere to do nothing other than twist the story, especially around the halfway mark of the film. Along side this is the constant thought of how this would fit better as a late night television movie, it doesn't feel cinematic enough and the courtroom scene feel like missed opportunities to show this. That being said the film is entertaining enough while it lasts and the actors really throw themselves into their roles, despite the clichéd character development. There are worse ways to kill a few hours.",time killer,matthew mcconaughey plays sleazy street wise lawyer mick haller who at one point exclaims that he couldnt believe he was representing innocent man which goes show types people he defends lincoln lawyer follows story haller as he takes louis roulet played by ryan phillippe who has been suspected assault but as he represents him starts question good what he is doing morals his actions this is one mcconaugheys finest roles long time but is nothing compared william h macy who plays his detective case brings charismatic involved attitude stealing limelight off anyone else screen problems that lie within lincoln lawyer however are horrible plot points that often appear out nowhere do nothing other than twist story especially around halfway mark film along side this is constant thought how this would fit better as late night television movie it doesnt feel cinematic enough courtroom scene feel like missed opportunities show this that being said film is entertaining enough while it lasts actors really throw themselves into their roles despite clich d character development there are worse ways kill few hours,0.5583333333333332,0.10131578947368419,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,Quintessential McConaughey,"This is a who-done-it-cat-and-mouse thriller where the tables turn sometimes on a pin head. McConaughey brings all the punch, verve and deadpan comedy from Wolf of Wall Street broker, to this thinking man's lawyer role. Except here he is in every scene and I was sitting on the edge of my chair the whole time. William Macy is excellent as the fixer. Only problem here is everytime there is an important morsel of information needed to move the story along Macy comes up with it in no time, without any explanation, even before we know there is a need for that information. I guess that is the expediency of film. Keep it simple stupid.Other than that, there is a surprise at every turn.
