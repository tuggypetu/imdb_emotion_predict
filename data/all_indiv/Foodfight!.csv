1.0,A mindbogglingly convoluted chapter in animation and cinema itself,"I remember in 2005, as a young child who was just being acquainted with the internet, learning about Lawrence Kasanoff's Foodfight!. The film seemed unlike anything I had ever heard of before, combining dozens of popular advertising mascots such as Mr. Clean, Chester Cheetah, Mrs. Buttersworth, and Charlie the Tuna into one film that would resemble Toy Story if its setting had been transferred to a supermarket. The story of the film is actually one of cinema and animation's most baffling stories of a film's time in development hell and still captivates me whenever I scour the internet looking for a summation of what exactly went on with the picture. The story is one of incredible ambition, controversy, and an unfathomably disappointing conclusion. If you're not familiar with the backstory, I'll give you a little rundown.In 2001, director Lawrence Kasanoff, who was known for producing the Mortal Kombat films as well as a handful of TV adaptations on the franchise, announced an undertaking like no other - he was going to make an animated film under his own company Threshold Entertainment that focused on the events that would take place inside a supermarket when the lights would turn off. Kasanoff envisioned a spectacle like no other, centering on dozens of recognizable brand mascots that would fend off a new, evil brand that attempted to takeover the marketplace. Not only was a film planned, but merchandize-galore was in addition, with toys, stuffed animals, a potential web show, commercial tie-ins, fast food toys, books, and more were also planned to coincide with the film's release. Kasanoff called Threshold Entertainment ""the next Pixar"" and also banded together top animators from around the world to piece together a project with incredible ambition. The film was to be released in 2003.So why is it that for a film this ambitious you probably haven't heard a damn thing about it? Well, for starters, the film's first immediate roadblock came in the form of a burglary in 2003 when hard drives containing the film, its animation, and its conceptual mockups were stolen. The animators and everyone assigned to the project needed to start from scratch. Nonetheless, Kasanoff pushed on with the project, confirming a release date of 2005.Foodfight! never came out in 2005 and news of it became scarce and vague when it did manage to circulate. The release date was changed several times before finding itself up for auction in 2007 for a surprisingly low $2.5 million, given its ambition and $65 million budget. Finally, the film came out over a decade after it first hit production, in October 2012. It received a very limited theatrical release in Europe and a silent DVD/video-on-demand release in the States, effectively ending one of the most mindbogglingly convoluted chapters in animation history.Now the question begs an answer, what does Foodfight! look like in its final state? The simple answer is ""hell."" This is a film that was clearly rushed upon being purchased at the aforementioned auction. The story concerns, as stated, a supermarket that turns into a playground for its product-mascots upon closing. The leader of this world is Dex Dogtective (voiced by Charlie Sheen), a crime-fighter who becomes incredibly suspicious of ""Brand X,"" a new line of products that are hitting store shelves. Dex and his gang of friends Sunshine Goodness (Hilary Duff) and Daredevil Dan (Wayne Brady) prepare to keep the supermarket in their hands, but Dex increasingly finds himself distracted by the likes of Lady X (Eva Longoria), a desirable woman who keeps trying to win Dex's eye and the store manager finds himself dictated by Mr. Clipboard (Christopher Lloyd), who is enforcing Brand X.To begin with, the animation is awful. This is animation that looks and moves like a broken Sims game on PlayStation. Never in my life did I think I'd call an animated film with so many colors and characters odious but that's exactly what it is. While the characters appear in a three-dimensional state, the backgrounds almost look two-dimensional, and worst, are almost indistinguishable in terms of what they're supposed to be. This is clearly animation that is not finished and was forced to be the finished product. Characters are very stiff when moving, have a peculiar coldness to their movements in addition, and many of them look grotesque and ugly.Then there's the awful writing at hand here. One can sort of forgive the animation for looking terrible, seeing as, understandably, everyone's hands just wanted to be cleaned of this film, but with twelve years of production and a forced rewrite thanks to a burglary, you would think the writing would be marginally polished. And yet, Foodfight! bears so much sexual innuendo it's ungodly and very inappropriate for children (Daredevil Dan says to the sultry Lady X in one scene, ""Oh Mamacita! Yo, sweetcakes, nice packaging! How about some chocolate frosting? I'd like to butter your muffin!""), Lady X boasts fetish-like lingerie as her primary outlets, orchestrating the fan-fiction version of her character, and characters speak almost entirely in grocery-store/food puns. There's no characters here, despite there being like thirty that are recognizable. There are just empty, hollow animated creations programmed to spew something that is allegedly funny.Foodfight!'s existence and eventual outcome should be a warning to those who have an idea they see bold and ambitious opportunities for. Granted a burglary can't really be blamed on part of the writers and directors but an awful script, a premise that seems to exist solely as a corporate byproduct, fourth-rate animation, and incredibly unforgivable and unnecessary sexual innuendos can be. The fact that Foodfight! is a bad film is the least of its concerns; it's a morally, ethically, and visually reprehensible fiasco that scrapes the bottom of the barrel so forcefully that it's tearing a hole in its base.",mindbogglingly convoluted chapter animation cinema itself,i remember 2005 as young child who was just being acquainted with internet learning about lawrence kasanoffs foodfight

""Hey, we can create a cheap CGI movie and make companies pay for the celeb voices in advance by inserting their brands in the film!"" The result is worse than crass, it's abominably bad. It's so bad that the film has been stuck in production limbo for a decade and it hasn't aged well. The CGI, the story and the one-liners (oh God, the one-liners...) all bear the mark of genuine and profound incompetence, a complete lack of even the most most rudimentary story-telling skills.What passes for a narrative revolves around supermarket brands coming to life at night.

10.0,A True Masterpiece,"Where to start with this one? Let me start by talking about the animation. I do not understand what is up with all of these reviews saying that the animation is bad. Do not get me wrong, it is not on the same level as something such as The Queen's Corgi, but the animation is not bad like everyone says it is. The animation is unique and original. I bet you can not name one other animated film that has animation quite like this one. Every scene clearly had a lot of heart and soul poured into it. It truly makes me wonder why so many films that come out nowadays show no signs of having passion behind them.Moving onto to the characters. One of my favorite things about this piece of art is that around ninety percent of the characters is that they are product placements. Another interesting thing that I noticed was that for the companies that clearly disagreed to have their brand shown anywhere in this film are portrayed as some sort of disgustingly designed bootleg version. It truly shows that the creators of this movie were so confident in it that they basically laughed in the faces of the brands that refused to come near the movie. This movie introduces a new character in basically every scene which keeps the film from ever getting boring. Each and every character is unique and like able, something that most films nowadays fail to create. Each and every character has a role in the story and so much backstory to go with them.Another truly extraordinary thing in this movie is how characters get around. Literally one second they are standing in the strange alternate dimension that they reside in and than suddenly teleport to the actual world with no context whatsoever. Most people would see this as just being lazy, but I see it as something else. This is called character building. You see, given how fast characters move around it is easy to assume that they have teleportation abilities. A lot of people these days want everything said out loud to them because they lack the sufficient amount of brain cells to figure things out on their own.However, my favorite part about this movie has to be the villains. In every single scene that they are in there are Nazi overtones. One of the characters literally says ""We were just falling orders!"" before being flattened and most certainly died right after. Not to mention their logo is basically a eagle clutching a + symbol, much like the eagle clutching the swastika. Same position and everything. This goes to show that the creators were not afraid to teach young lings about Nazi Germany and what happened during those times. Show many movies for kids these days are so watered down that they become boring to anyone with a somewhat developed brain.There is so much more to this film and I do not understand where the negative reviews are coming from.",true masterpiece,where start with this one let me start by talking about animation i do not understand what is up with all these reviews saying that animation is bad do not get me wrong it is not same level as something such as queens corgi but animation is not bad like everyone says it is animation is unique original i bet you can not name one other animated film that has animation quite like this one every scene clearly had lot heart soul poured into it it truly makes me wonder why so many films that come out nowadays show no signs having passion behind them moving onto characters one my favorite things about this piece art is that around ninety percent characters is that they are product placements another interesting thing that i noticed was that companies that clearly disagreed have their brand shown anywhere this film are portrayed as some sort disgustingly designed bootleg version it truly shows that creators this movie were so confident it that they basically laughed faces brands that refused come near movie this movie introduces new character basically every scene which keeps film ever getting boring each every character is unique like able something that most films nowadays fail create each every character has role story so much backstory go with them another truly extraordinary thing this movie is how characters get around literally one second they are standing strange alternate dimension that they reside than suddenly teleport actual world with no context whatsoever most people would see this as just being lazy but i see it as something else this is called character building you see given how fast characters move around it is easy assume that they have teleportation abilities lot people these days want everything said out loud them because they lack sufficient amount brain cells figure things out their own however my favorite part about this movie has be villains every single scene that they are there are nazi overtones one characters literally says we were just falling orders before being flattened most certainly died right after not mention their logo is basically eagle clutching symbol much like eagle clutching swastika same position everything this goes show that creators were not afraid teach young lings about nazi germany what happened during those times show many movies kids these days are so watered down that they become boring anyone with somewhat developed brain there is so much more this film i do not understand where negative reviews are coming,0.5635468441023996,0.0940008551119662,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,Worst crossover ever,"I remember watching the Nostalgia Critic's review of this as well as JonTron's. It's truly some of the Critic's best work and should be seen. He compared it to ""Wreck-It Ralph"". I guess those are similar to the even more awesome Lego movie. They are films that show us that a world of fictional characters can be made into something wonderful. Sadly, this film shows us the complete opposite. I wouldn't quite say it was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I think that ""honor"" goes to the 2001 animated Titanic movie. This film has credits that go for eight minutes. That other one had credits for fourteen minutes! I guess it technically isn't as ugly as ""Joshua And The Promised Land"", but it really is a worse film. At least that movie was less than an hour long! I hated every minute of this. It has some of the ugliest CGI ever created. These cartoon characters are horrible at showing emotions. They just seem to be staring blankly all the time. All of these characters are ugly. Even the ones who are labeled ugly are really no worse than anyone else. This might be the reason why I'm not into celebrity voices. Of course, anyone would regret being in this movie. What's worse is that there's this guy called General X who explicitly mentions how aroused he is by everything.The villain, Lady X wears clothes that alone should have gotten this movie a PG-13 rating. The climax is one of the most monotonous things I've ever seen in any movie. It's just characters throwing food over and over. It's painfully drawn out for something that's only an hour and a half long. The movements in this film are amazingly terrible. The facial expressions are among the worst ever created. It's good expressions that make me love animation so much. This film makes no sense. It features this world where food mascots go into their own magical world or maybe it comes to life at the end of the day or it exists on some other plane, but I don't care at all.It is a hideous film where the cameos serve no purpose at all. I looked in the credits and I found out there were characters like the Energizer Bunny in this. I didn't recall seeing him so they probably just put him in the crowd scenes for no reason and still mentioned him in the credits. The voices are obnoxious, especially this giant nosed sneezing guy. It's also hateful with them explicitly making Jew jokes. Wait, why would Brand X recall the prunes that Lady X came from? That's impossible! This is idiotic in every sense of the word and is as terrible as every Internet critic has made it out to be.

You will rage, and you will fear. You will be sick to your stomach. You will ultimately feel a satisfaction unmatched by that which you have already experienced.Foodfight is more than just a movie. It's a personal experience. The characters were realistic and beautifully written. I felt like I knew them. Nay; I KNEW them. While I was watching the film, I considered them my closest friends. Their struggles, although foreign, were also relatable. As I watched them overcome their fears and their prejudices in order to save the day, they taught me that I, too, could be the hero. It made me rethink everything I thought I knew about society, heroism, and morality.This movie is truly a miracle. It cured my cancer, fed my starving children, and brought my grandmother back to life. Larry Kasanoff (the wonderful director of this film) is more than a filmmaker. He is a PROPHET.

1.0,It's not just a bad movie,"Foodfight! is a cynical, cheap, patronizing, lifeless, lazy, unfunny, tasteless, shoddy, disrespectful, offensive-to-anyone-with-a-brain piece of unmitigated garbage, sure, but it's much more than that.Because it is meant to be entertainment aimed at children, and because its message amounts to nothing more than ""BUY OUR BRANDS, OUR BRANDS LOVE YOU, YOU LOVE OUR BRANDS, EAT OUR FOOD, EAT, EAT, EAT, EAT, EAT..."" Foodfight! is not just a bad movie.Foodfight! is PURE EVIL.So far, the movie has only made $73,000 on a (shocking) $65 million budget.

The plot didn't made any single bit of sense, the jokes were dumb and inappropriate (I know that is a common practice for most of the recent animated films to include some hints of adult humor for the older viewers, but ""Foodfight!"" is just creepy. And also unfunny.)""Foodfight!"" is nothing but an ugly mess without any single redeeming quality. In fact, I think that it should be used as a textbook example of how NOT to make an animated movie.

2.0,"Wait, what?","You know, this review isn't based on the premise that this is an egregious film. It is, I agree that this film is abhorrent. However, the legend surrounding this lukewarm, atrocious piece of media is far more enjoyable than this pile of excrement. This *ahem* ""film"" came out December of 2012. It was supposed to come out in December of 2002. The film was stolen, and that was probably for the best. However, because the directors had faith (or fear that they'd lose 45 MILLION DOLLARS) for this film, so they began again from scratch. And what we got was probably the worst thing of all time.If this movie was a regular Hollywood flop I'd maybe forgive it. But on account of how atrociously awful this film is in any aspect, I'd expect it to be made by a 17 year cannabis addict who maybe knows a bit of VFX. But this is a 45 million dollar animated film starring Charlie Sheen and Dwayne Brady. If Clerks can be made with a 25,000 dollar budget and Napolian Dynamite for $40,000, how is this god-awful film's budget anywhere past $7.34! Oh I know! Charlie Sheen spent 44 of the 45 million on crack. Yeah, that'd explain this movie. They were on crack the entire time.Words cannot describe the amount of crap this movie sinks in. It's terrible in every single aspect: And I mean it this time.

1.0,I cannot imagine a more horribly animated film than this one and even film school students would be ashamed to put their names on this mess.,"While I love international films, classic Hollywood films and all sorts of bizarre films, I also have a love for terrible films--as many of our readers have no doubt noticed. It all started several decades ago when I read Harry Medved's great book ""The 50 Worst Movies of All Time"". Since finding and seeing all fifty of these movies, I have also attacked IMDb's list of the 100 lowest rated films of all time. However, as this list is ever-changing, I have to re-check the list periodically to see if there are any new additions. Fortunately (or more like UNfortunately) I noticed a new addition to the list....""Foodfight!"". However, unlike many of the bad films I have enjoyed for their sheer awfulness and cheese-factor (such as ""The Room"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""The Apple""), some films are just horrible and offer no enjoyment whatsoever. ""Foodfight!"" is surely one of these joyless and horrible films.The story of how this terrible film got made and released is something in itself. While work on the film began in the early 2000s, the hard drives for the film were apparently stolen and work had to begin again! I assume that these folks simply had never heard of the concept of making backup copies. Also, I can only assume someone stole the film in order to save humanity. Unfortunately, work began again--and the original release date in 2003 came and went. Release dates kept changing until eventually the filmmakers were in default on their loans. The film rights were bought at auction for a tiny fraction of the cost to make the film and it was eventually released to DVD only recently.So why is this film so horrible? Well, the reasons are countless so I'll just concentrate on the major problems. The biggest and most obvious problem is the computer graphics. This CGI film has the ugliest, cheapest and lousiest looking animated film in history. Film students would be ashamed to put their name on this product...it's that bad. Although the work was done in the 2000s, graphically the film is what you would expect in the early to mid 1990s--well before the first ""Toy Story"" film. Characters are blocky, haphazardly stuck on the backgrounds, have garish colors and are simply ugly. There is NOTHING about them that ever speaks quality in any manner. The same can be said about the backgrounds--which are usually very fuzzy and look worse than an old-school computer game like ""MYST"".The dialog is the second worst thing about this 'movie'. While it's clearly aimed at children and stupid people, too much of it is spiked with sexual innuendo to make it appropriate to the children at least. A few choice pieces of their brilliant dialog would include: 'I'd like to butter your muffins' 'Better take it easy on the potato juice before you become chip-faced' '...you have something to say, candy-arse?!' 'I want to scrub your bubbles, Dex' 'What the fudge?!' As for this final comment, it DOES actually sum up the film extremely well! The story itself is also simply horrible. Some parents might strongly object to the fact that this film is ALL product placement aimed at children--with many of the characters consisting of unappealing corporate knockoff characters that look like McGruff the Crime Dog, Charlie the Tuna and Mr. Clean (among many others). I could also talk about the plot involving the evil Brand X trying to take over the grocery store where all these characters live....but so many other awful things assaulted my senses that I really didn't even care about the insanely bad and cynical plot.Despite a plethora of B and C-list stars to provide the voices for these unpleasant characters, there just is no reason to see this film for the average person. For fans of dreck, perhaps it's worth seeing...if extremely unpleasant and boring. And, I could also see professors at schools such as Ringling School of Art and Design showing it to their students as an example of the worst animation to be produced since the beginning of time. Otherwise, steer clear of this wretched piece of bile...",i cannot imagine more horribly animated film than this one even film school students would be ashamed put their names this mess,while i love international films classic hollywood films all sorts bizarre films i also have love terrible films as many our readers have no doubt noticed it all started several decades ago when i read harry medveds great book 50 worst movies all time since finding seeing all fifty these movies i have also attacked imdbs list 100 lowest rated films all time however as this list is ever changing i have re check list periodically see if there are any new additions fortunately or more like unfortunately i noticed new addition list foodfight however unlike many bad films i have enjoyed their sheer awfulness cheese factor such as room plan 9 outer space apple some films are just horrible offer no enjoyment whatsoever foodfight is surely one these joyless horrible films story how this terrible film got made released is something itself while work film began early 2000s hard drives film were apparently stolen work had begin again i assume that these folks simply had never heard concept making backup copies also i can only assume someone stole film order save humanity unfortunately work began again original release date 2003 came went release dates kept changing until eventually filmmakers were default their loans film rights were bought at auction tiny fraction cost make film it was eventually released dvd only recently so why is this film so horrible well reasons are countless so ill just concentrate major problems biggest most obvious problem is computer graphics this cgi film has ugliest cheapest lousiest looking animated film history film students would be ashamed put their name this product its that bad although work was done 2000s graphically film is what you would expect early mid 1990s well before first toy story film characters are blocky haphazardly stuck backgrounds have garish colors are simply ugly there is nothing about them that ever speaks quality any manner same can be said about backgrounds which are usually very fuzzy look worse than old school computer game like myst dialog is second worst thing about this movie while its clearly aimed at children stupid people too much it is spiked with sexual innuendo make it appropriate children at least few choice pieces their brilliant dialog would include id like butter your muffins better take it easy potato juice before you become chip faced you have something say candy arse i want scrub your bubbles dex what fudge as this final comment it does actually sum up film extremely well story itself is also simply horrible some parents might strongly object fact that this film is all product placement aimed at children with many characters consisting unappealing corporate knockoff characters that look like mcgruff crime dog charlie tuna mr clean among many others i could also talk about plot involving evil brand x trying take over grocery store where all these characters live but so many other awful things assaulted my senses that i really didnt even care about insanely bad cynical plot despite plethora b c list stars provide voices these unpleasant characters there just is no reason see this film average person fans dreck perhaps its worth seeing if extremely unpleasant boring i could also see professors at schools such as ringling school art design showing it their students as example worst animation be produced since beginning time otherwise steer clear this wretched piece bile,0.5976753405324837,-0.10571511821511821,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.4}"

1.0,Insultingly execrable,"There is not much to add to what has already been said, and so well by everybody else here. As a lifelong animation fan, Foodfight! is one of the few that I deem completely unwatchable and it is certainly one of the worst animated films ever made. The animation is unspeakably awful, not just the worst computer-animation in an animated film(excluding Video Brinquedo's and Spark Plug Entertainment's output, seriously the animation here makes Animals United seem like Toy Story in comparison) but some of the worst-looking animation ever. Everything looks so flat and stiff, no vibrant colours, technical invention or easy movements, and you'd be hard pressed to find creepier and more nightmare-inducing character designs. The music is generic and completely unmemorable, often it is placed in an irrelevant and over-used way too. The story was not a very good idea to begin with, but everything is so contrived and predictable it actually hurts, there is little momentum in the pacing and the story meanders a lot while being simplistic at the same time. In short you are never engaged or emotionally invested. There is not a single decent character either, they are either annoying or insignificant and their creepy designs(especially the villains) further add to this. The voice cast on paper are talented, but the voice work is poor here with only Christopher Lloyd trying, Charlie Sheen sounds very detached and bored and there is a lot of overdone hyperactivity and wasted talent everywhere else. Harvey Fienstein is the only other voice actor along with Lloyd who sounds immediately distinctive, the bad news is that I didn't see the point of his very brief role. The script was the worst culprit though, not in a long time has there been a script in an animated film this abominably bad, the bad-taste bathroom humour, out-of-place and inappropriate innuendo, Nazi overtones and equally crude one-liners and catchphrases that are enough to make anyone cringe taken to offensive levels. To conclude, cheap and intelligence-insulting, Foodfight! is execrable, not just one of the worst animated films ever but one of the worst films in general that I've seen in some time. 0/10 Bethany Cox",insultingly execrable,there is not much add what has already been said so well by everybody else here as lifelong animation fan foodfight is one few that i deem completely unwatchable it is certainly one worst animated films ever made animation is unspeakably awful not just worst computer animation animated film excluding video brinquedos spark plug entertainments output seriously animation here makes animals united seem like toy story comparison but some worst looking animation ever everything looks so flat stiff no vibrant colours technical invention or easy movements youd be hard pressed find creepier more nightmare inducing character designs music is generic completely unmemorable often it is placed irrelevant over used way too story was not very good idea begin with but everything is so contrived predictable it actually hurts there is little momentum pacing story meanders lot while being simplistic at same time short you are never engaged or emotionally invested there is not single decent character either they are either annoying or insignificant their creepy designs especially villains further add this voice cast paper are talented but voice work is poor here with only christopher lloyd trying charlie sheen sounds very detached bored there is lot overdone hyperactivity wasted talent everywhere else harvey fienstein is only other voice actor along with lloyd who sounds immediately distinctive bad news is that i didnt see point his very brief role script was worst culprit though not long time has there been script animated film this abominably bad bad taste bathroom humour out place inappropriate innuendo nazi overtones equally crude one liners catchphrases that are enough make anyone cringe taken offensive levels conclude cheap intelligence insulting foodfight is execrable not just one worst animated films ever but one worst films general that ive seen some time 0 10 bethany cox,0.609600925390399,-0.2614798213482423,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.47, 'Fear': 0.23}"

Like the animated Titanic movie, it isn't just bad, it is bad in such a way that it will be considered inconceivable that such a movie could have even been green lit; a movie where people will see brief snippets and wonder if it was a real movie or just somebody's entry-level CG demo-reel.For this reason, this is not a movie that should be watched. This is a movie that should be thrown into the basement under lock and key for twenty years until it becomes obscure and collectible just like Nintendo's Virtual Boy.I'm not kidding.

But this isn't a precursor to ""Wreck-It Ralph"" -- won't offer any insights as to what the life of a marketing icon might truly be like (Charlie Tuna makes an appearance, but nobody comments on the fact that he exists to sell the shredded corpses of other tunas).
