10.0,A powerful antidote to conformism,"There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our ""homework"" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece.",powerful antidote conformism,there are certain films that get under your skin never come out they change your life subtly altering your perceptions reality almost always better dead poets society is one those few films i saw movie back when i was high school i had teacher who told us that we really needed watch it fact it was our homework day we didnt need bring back report or talk about it class all he asked us was watch it make up our own mind about it that was it as you can imagine many friends mine didnt watch it at all i did yes i feel i changed bit there back when you are young you never really stop think what world you are doing with your life you simply live day hope your grades will be enough pass thats it long term thinking involves maybe flirting with girl nothing more what this film showed me was that we have responsability joy being alive this planet that we are dust we will go back it so we have precious little time make difference that we have moral obligation seize day make our lives extraordinary my favorite quote all movie history that world basically is ours that only limitations are within ourselves that we owe it us fight rebel against conformity change what we hate keep what we love that living this world is beautiful responsability that only cowards dare not change it better fact that cast was basically my age was passing through same dilemmas situations i was facing made it all so much more powerful so here i sit 12 years that day i still dont think i have seized day completely but i keep trying i always will i wonder how many people were transformed by this gem movie i hope many 10 out 10 definitive masterpiece,0.5176007326007326,0.18777306027306023,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Thank You Captain,"It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society, as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film, I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work, in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had, and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context, but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher, and that's something you don't see very often.The thing about this film is that it doesn't shorten its importance to Williams's performance. The supporting cast is one that balances the film like no other. Every one of those students that revived the DPS is, in one way or another, influenced by Mr. Keating, be that positively or, unfortunately, negatively. The story being an Oscar winning screenplay, is one that I think mostly resonates with younger people, and with this movie being part of my 10th grade Portuguese course, I, personally, embraced its essence and of course its driving message of seizing the day.As I've seen here on IMDb, this movie might not gather nearly uncontested praise, but it is very much highly regarded today as it was 25 years ago. The final scene still gives me chills to this day, and in the midst of our sad goodbye to Mr. Williams I just wanna say Thank You My Captain. It was a pleasure learning to become my own motivated person.

10.0,Seize the Day- One of the Greatest Movies Ever!,"Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.The movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or ""Oh Captain, my Captain"", based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.There are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he's an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn't give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he's so embarrassed.Peter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie ""Master and Commander"" shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.Some of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that ""he wanted to throw up at the end of the film"". I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won't put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!",seize day one greatest movies ever,dead poets scoiety i suppose if you were high school sometime between 1990 2008 one your teachers thought id be good idea watch this movie i still remember my reaction ones our fellow classmates yeah probably boring movie that will try make school look better encourage us do our homework study our tests i couldnt have been more wrong this movie definitely changed my way thinking certain extent there are very few films who have moved touched me like this one movie plays 1959 centers around private academy somewhere new england curriculum is extremely difficult teachers have no humor are very strict new english teacher though mr john keating robin williams who graduated very same school uses unorthodox but quite effective methods teach students about literature poetry during their first lesson he tells them that they can either call him mr keating or oh captain my captain based quote by walt whitman he encourages them come out themselves use their energy make their lives worth living beautiful carpe diem seize day plot also centers around two students neil robert sean leonard who is funny popular but fails gain his fathers pride because his wish become actor todd ethan hawke who is very shy unsure himself is inspired by keating use his imagination eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes poetry after they find out about club keating was member while he was student dead poets society which was forbidden by school they decide reestablish it what ultimately gets them into lot trouble there are several key factors that make this movie as brilliant as it is first all there is acting robin williams who i really like as comedian really proves that he is great actor who can get deep into character play him with such passion energy that you will forget hes actor keating whose teaching methods are indeed unusual will probably make you laugh couple times is very interesting role teacher we all would have wanted but not because he doesnt give homework or makes up very easy open book tests no because keating shows us that we have come out ourselves make best our lives especially that there is poet everyone us then there is terribly under appreciated robert sean leonard who also gives very moving performance as student who is kept back by his father therefore fails make his dreams come true my opinion he is very underused as actor should have gotten lot more leading roles as ethan hawke he definitely was best choice character he plays we can literally feel his fear shyness when he stands front class gets no word out because hes so embarrassed peter weir who is probably most known his recent movie master commander shows what great director he is with this film it definitely deserved oscar best original screenplay nominations best picture director leading actor robin williams some you may have heard about roger ebert absolutely negative review this movie that he wanted throw up at end film i can understand why people might not like ending i wont put any spoilers but i think it just adds beauty drama this film film that should definitely be imdb top 250 movies this is movie you must have seen,0.514995315629644,0.1982887510499451,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A masterful tribute to teaching at its best,"Dead Poets Society is, to use a cliché, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of ""seizing the day"". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless ""Introduction to Poetry"" from the time honored Pritchard textbook! The ""Dead Poets Society"", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama. Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only ""Carpe Diem"", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.",masterful tribute teaching at its best,dead poets society is use clich cinematic masterpiece i can watch it over over absorbing more nuances meaning every time as former teacher myself albeit science i view it as tribute profession at its best teaching not merely subject but also person having lifelong impact students lives setting is weldon academy very traditional new england boys prep school 1959 if i can find one flaw with movie there certainly arent many its underlying premise that seems worship free thought implies that all tradition is necessity undesirable thus be avoided frankly compared modern classrooms which are bastions free expression i found weldon students respectful treatment their teachers rather refreshing but perhaps thats just ex teacher me coming out some weldons ideals generally referred mocking tones are actually qualities which parents rightfully do hope their offspring will aspire robin williams plays mr keating english teacher we all wish wed had he brings warmth passion endearing quiet humor role as he fosters individualism school environment total conformity endeavoring teach these young men both beauty english language importance living life full seizing day how many us mentally revolted at dissection poetry when we were school many viewer will both chortle rejoice when mr keating has his class rip out methodical emotionless introduction poetry time honored pritchard textbook dead poets society boys which mr keating has such profound impact include interesting mix characters neil perry passionate young man at odds with his fathers clearly defined expectations his sons life todd anderson classic shy adolescent through whose eyes we view unfolding drama charlie dalton quintessential rebel knox overstreet teen with whom most viewers can identify deep throes first love richard cameron mindless conformist ethan hawke gives moving performance as todd younger brother former weldon valedictorian my personal favorite who undergoes character transformation as plot unfolds sense this movie is really todds story as another reviewer has wisely pointed out his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all your heart will ache him sub plot young overstreets romance with girl nearby school may not be brilliant but it provides some light entertaining relief main drama needless say mr keatings unorthodox approach meets with obstacles his fellow teachers schools ultra traditional headmaster neils overbearing father other parents who are depicted as conservative status conscious lot his encouragement adolescent individualism leads dramatic consequences one student particular triggering dramatic scenario that engulfs most his classmates i dont want give plot away but dead poets society has most powerful ending ive experienced cinematic world i could watch it over over tears would either come my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time its intelligent film both gripping watch thought provoking afterward engaging plot memorable characters meaningful theme wonderfully done scenes atmosphere dead poets society has it all special tip my hat cinematography clearly it should have won oscar final scene alone this is must see movie especially if youre high school student who hates english it might just change your view subject even if your actual teacher doesnt quite measure up mr keating everyone not only carpe diem but certain phrase walt whitman poem will take incredible meaning be remembered forever,0.5289126746269602,0.21411929340500768,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,The 9/10 movie I'll never watch again.,"Personal Rating: 9/10This movie shattered me. There's the expression that something ""tugs at your heartstrings,"" well this movie ripped mine out.I'll be honest, I could find things to critique about this film, the instance of a scene that was used twice and felt sloppy perhaps; but this movie never claimed to be perfect, just to be emotionally moving, and that it certainly is. This review is written by a boy who also finds himself on the edge of adolescence and adulthood, does that mean I'm biased, absolutely, but everyone who watches this film is, everyone can relate. Your feelings I can assure you will be the same as mine when the credits start rolling, rolling like the tears down your cheeks.This movie makes you think. Conformity is easy, conformity is comfortable, conformity gets you good grades, trust me you're listening right now to a past perfect GPA teacher's pet. The thing conformity doesn't give you though, is a life, one worth living. For something to be beautiful it must also have a side of danger, and that's what freedom of thought is, as is mentioned in the movie ""we must constantly look at things in a different way,"" and that's beautiful! Yes, it means at times we don't agree, yes it means you might give this movie a 4/10 but I'll be damned if that changes my opinion of it.The themes this movie explores such as, never letting a moment slip by where you don't think for yourself, where you don't seize an opportunity, it does so beautifully. Robin Williams was not acting he was believing, everything in this movie comes across as genuine, a slice of reality, a harsh but beautiful one at that.Will I watch this movie again, I don't think so. But please, please watch it just once, you won't ever regret it.Carpe Diem.",9 10 movie ill never watch again,personal rating 9 10this movie shattered me theres expression that something tugs at your heartstrings well this movie ripped mine out ill be honest i could find things critique about this film instance scene that was used twice felt sloppy perhaps but this movie never claimed be perfect just be emotionally moving that it certainly is this review is written by boy who also finds himself edge adolescence adulthood does that mean im biased absolutely but everyone who watches this film is everyone can relate your feelings i can assure you will be same as mine when credits start rolling rolling like tears down your cheeks this movie makes you think conformity is easy conformity is comfortable conformity gets you good grades trust me youre listening right now past perfect gpa teachers pet thing conformity doesnt give you though is life one worth living something be beautiful it must also have side danger thats what freedom thought is as is mentioned movie we must constantly look at things different way thats beautiful yes it means at times we dont agree yes it means you might give this movie 4 10 but ill be damned if that changes my opinion it themes this movie explores such as never letting moment slip by where you dont think yourself where you dont seize opportunity it does so beautifully robin williams was not acting he was believing everything this movie comes across as genuine slice reality harsh but beautiful one at that will i watch this movie again i dont think so but please please watch it just once you wont ever regret it carpe diem,0.6641732804232805,0.20328703703703702,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,Excellent,"I have no need to summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend to do that anyway so, therefore, any addition of such would simply be frivilous. However, I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing. This could not be further from the truth. In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous. The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove. Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority. Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be. It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth. I urge everyone to give this movie a chance and to see it for what it really is. It may just change your life.",excellent,i have no need summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend do that anyway so therefore any addition such would simply be frivilous however i am somewhat disappointed see how people tend misinterprate this film by proclaiming that movies message carpe deium is derailed by fact that those who apply it end up losing this could not be further truth beginning when young men are first introduced this idea sucking marrow out life it is applied by students when its results prove be fun joyous point really driven home by movie though is stand up ones beliefs throughout all life no matter how hard it may prove now while character neil does try do what he feels he must without regard his father end he doesnt stand up at all but simply accepts his fathers authority some may not like it but his story serves prove just how important it is stand ones ground no matter how hard it may be its not only his character but fact every character film that does not fully understand mr keatings message until very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much opposing forces deny this basic truth i urge everyone give this movie chance see it what it really is it may just change your life,0.501984126984127,0.10963718820861679,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.58}"
9.0,Still stands strong after 30 years.

,A terrific film,There's so much good about this movie. The first time I saw it I watched it solely for plot and I loved it. Now I've seen it again and watched Peter Weir's filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he's serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way.,terrific film,theres so much good about this movie first time i saw it i watched it solely plot i loved it now ive seen it again watched peter weirs filming timing which is also great robin williams is terrific actor when hes serious he proved it good will hunting but he proved it first here if you liked that movie your liking it had something do with williams than you will like this one plot is about number students who are taught by williams about life they are taught how enjoy themselves this ends up causing great controversy among heads school students are terrific even dialogue is great this is movie that i cant imagine anyone not liking it is good every way,0.6988888888888888,0.4244444444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Make Your Lives Extraordinary,"So today is August 12th and news has broken of Robin Williams' untimely death. I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it's hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly ""moved"" in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won't be sorry.",make your lives extraordinary,so today is august 12th news has broken robin williams untimely death i just felt compelled review my favourite movie his rainy day back 1980 something my mother sat my brother sister me down put movie dead poets society little did i know what profound impact that movie its characters would have me film is bursting with quotable material my siblings i quote it this day o captain my captain carpe diem seize day course make your lives extraordinary its not until we grow older that we can look back teacher like john keating see what he really meant us chances he made us take way he made us feel alive i look back now robin williams performance see one most flawless performances all time when you watch movie its hard think hammy manic robin williams giving such nuanced subtle performance its almost as though sean maguire good will hunting is who john keating became funny how his most subtle performances may be ones hes most remembered when i heard news robins death i was taken back this film really felt how integral this movie actually was my childhood i think it was first time my 10 year old self was truly moved way that adults can be moved by art all i can say is watch this movie you wont be sorry,0.4654214559386973,0.09707854406130269,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,"Carpe Diem, because the days don't stand still","First of all, this is movie is my all-time favorite, out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with ""It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s."" After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.And lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.",carpe diem because days dont stand still,first all this is movie is my all time favorite out all hundreds films i have seen however every time i mention this film i have answer most peoples quizzical looks with its beautiful little 80s film that stayed 80s after seeing it 24th time since i first saw it 5 years ago my 13th birthday i can gladly say that this movie went far beyond 80s power inspiration message can be felt every day dead poets society is most underrated film by most underrated director whose inspiring uplifting moral tales firmly grounded reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be here we see one his very personal cradled projects he shows visual style concentration characters which he is so affluent his control camera characters are very strong very smooth cinematography is near perfect with every shot along with editing seamless also very compelling are color tones every scene perfectly matching mood events scene could you say this is art absolutely then we have performances robin williams continues stride as one who has date remained most touching heart wrenching awe inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent he still remains my most favorite performer film screen his professor john keating is man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool respectable every person who taught or enlightened you something out ordinary fact dare i say it he teaches something extraordinary we have tragically underrated robert sean leonard his role as free thinking catalyst student neil why is this man not household name hollywood heavyweight his roles are always full inspiration energy tragic emotion that never fail move audience his role this movie is fresh unhindered never pretentious as cautionary tale movie then we have ethan hawke one his earliest roles as point view character entire supporting cast is very strong also providing foundation serve as various emotional ties that further involve us story josh charless role as knox overstreet is role that almost all guys can relate wholeheartedly course all actors who are that dead poets society do fine job lastly story i wont summarize it since its been summarized many times here but i will say that it is one best coming age stories not only adolescents but anyone i have personally heard nine fivers who were inspired by this movie change situations their jobs careers relationships better i first saw this movie when i was 13 immediately stamped crowned elevated this movie as my all time favorite now that i am 18 living my own with very different concerns than back then i turn back this movie over over again find inspiration solace course entertainment it is still my all time favorite it still inspires me seize day make my life extraordinary,0.5822820512820512,0.27126923076923076,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Everybody is a poet. Even you are!,"Not every thing that's expected from you is your only motive of life. This movie in a great manner teaches us to listen and regard the voice of our soul, the voice of our self.Basically the story is about a English Literature professor Mr. John Keating who is a replacement for the previous professor and is conducting his very first class for the school. His idea of teaching is very different and informal, based more on practicality rather than just reading words written in the book. Being literature his subject, he inspires his students to weave their own thoughts, he encourages them to use their own imaginations. He clearly believes that everybody has their own personal sense of seeing this world, interpretating things in their own way.The influence of Mr. Keating on the boys can be judged from their inclining interests towards poetries and proses. They reframe Dead Poets Society which is a kind of club of people reading out poetries among the group. Meanwhile, they also learn to listen to their calling. And then series of events goes on and by the end of that, you will be left with tears in your eyes.Everything in the movie is so perfectly done. The character of Mr. Keating played by Robin Williams is flawless. The smirk on his face puts a different charm and it always keeps you under impression of his control over the situation. Also the character of Neil played by Robin Sean Leonard keeps you gripped to the emotions that the movie is carrying throughout.This is a kind of movie that will make you think about yourself, your dreams and desires. You will be left with the tears of happiness and a sense of introspection.

9.0,Always question authority,"The conformist 50s get a look in Dead Poet's Society. Seen through the eyes of several prep school kids it's only that several of them really grasp what Robin Williams is trying to teach them that we see hope for the future.Williams is one of those rare teachers whose unorthodox methods make him stand out. There will always two or three for me in every level of learning that I had who stuck with me. The kids at Welton Prep actually enjoy his poetry class, they even found a little private club the Dead Poet's Society and will quote Byron, Browning, and the Bard back and forth to each other.The difference between Williams and someone like Norman Lloyd the headmaster at Welton Prep is that Lloyd sees himself as training the future membership of the establishment and he's giving them the lessons they need to get by, Williams says that his function to tell the youth to question authority. Always ask why this is so. Progress is only made by those who ask questions.The film is mainly the story of two students in his class Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke. Leonard is a shy kid and Hawke is a popular one. But Hawke is not from a wealthy family. His father Kurtwood Smith has made many sacrifices to get him into that prep school. Hawke wants to be an actor and Williams says follow your dream. Their clash sets in motion the dramatic events of the climax.Dead Poet's Society won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director as well. Williams got a nomination for Best Actor. Dead Poet's Society maybe set in the 50s, but it expresses a universal theme about always question the status quo until you get a satisfying answer.Progress never happens any other way.",always question authority,conformist 50s get look dead poets society seen through eyes several prep school kids its only that several them really grasp what robin williams is trying teach them that we see hope future williams is one those rare teachers whose unorthodox methods make him stand out there will always two or three me every level learning that i had who stuck with me kids at welton prep actually enjoy his poetry class they even found little private club dead poets society will quote byron browning bard back forth each other difference between williams someone like norman lloyd headmaster at welton prep is that lloyd sees himself as training future membership establishment hes giving them lessons they need get by williams says that his function tell youth question authority always ask why this is so progress is only made by those who ask questions film is mainly story two students his class robert sean leonard ethan hawke leonard is shy kid hawke is popular one but hawke is not wealthy family his father kurtwood smith has made many sacrifices get him into that prep school hawke wants be actor williams says follow your dream their clash sets motion dramatic events climax dead poets society won oscar best original screenplay was nominated best picture best director as well williams got nomination best actor dead poets society maybe set 50s but it expresses universal theme about always question status quo until you get satisfying answer progress never happens any other way,0.43619791666666674,0.15065104166666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A Wonderful Film with a Great Anti-Conformity Message,"A thoughtful, moving, uplifting film, Dead Poets Society is about a teacher's relationship with his students, and how he helped them to grow and have a better quality of life through poetry.The performances were mostly strong all around, with the central characters being surprisingly solid and well-fleshed out for such young actors. The camaraderie between the boys was nice and believable, I thought they portrayed their friendship realistically. Robin Williams steals the show in every scene he's in, and I don't think he ever got his due as a dramatic actor. Sure he's a great comedy actor, but this and Good Will Hunting (1997) cement his obvious dramatic talent for any doubters. He too is believable in his role, and he develops a believable relationship with his students.Is Peter Weir not one of the greatest directors out there? He has such a good body of work, and his dramatic style and look are ever present here. I can't quite describe the feel of his films, but it's there. If you enjoyed Witness (1985) or Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003) of the World, than you'll appreciate this effort from Weir. It may be his best film.The movie's message and philosophy are admirable, too. The goal of taking every moment and living life instead of letting time slip away is important, and the emotional story surrounding the teacher's relationship with his students and how if affected their relationships is also moving and well-structured. The aspect of people being brought closer together through art and an appreciation of it is also interesting. Some may argue that non-conformity was the message, and that the film's ending goes against that, but I think non-conformity and defending one's own beliefs was displayed in the ending, and non-conformity is only part of the overall point anyway.I definitely can recommend this, though many have seen it already anyway. It's definitely one of Williams' best performances, and Weir's best films. If you ever needed inspiration to read poetry, this is the best place to start.",wonderful film with great anti conformity message,thoughtful moving uplifting film dead poets society is about teachers relationship with his students how he helped them grow have better quality life through poetry performances were mostly strong all around with central characters being surprisingly solid well fleshed out such young actors camaraderie between boys was nice believable i thought they portrayed their friendship realistically robin williams steals show every scene hes i dont think he ever got his due as dramatic actor sure hes great comedy actor but this good will hunting 1997 cement his obvious dramatic talent any doubters he too is believable his role he develops believable relationship with his students is peter weir not one greatest directors out there he has such good body work his dramatic style look are ever present here i cant quite describe feel his films but its there if you enjoyed witness 1985 or master commander far side world 2003 world than youll appreciate this effort weir it may be his best film movies message philosophy are admirable too goal taking every moment living life instead letting time slip away is important emotional story surrounding teachers relationship with his students how if affected their relationships is also moving well structured aspect people being brought closer together through art appreciation it is also interesting some may argue that non conformity was message that films ending goes against that but i think non conformity defending ones own beliefs was displayed ending non conformity is only part overall point anyway i definitely can recommend this though many have seen it already anyway its definitely one williams best performances weirs best films if you ever needed inspiration read poetry this is best place start,0.5657859078590786,0.3416666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.34}"

8.0,"""Now in my class, you will learn to think for yourselves again.""","It's with a sad sense of irony that one watches the film today, knowing that Robin Williams took his own life at the age of sixty three a few years ago. No one can truly know what personal demons another person faces daily to bring about such a tragic event. His suicide defied all rationality to anyone who followed his career and he is sadly missed.I think everyone deserves a teacher like John Keating at least once during their time in school. I came close, there was a teacher in my high school who was as well regarded as Mr. Keating but I was not in one of his classes. Yet he was a personal favorite and always took the time to chat when the opportunity presented itself. Insisting that one learns to think for themselves is probably the most valuable lesson any teacher can inspire, and when that lesson takes hold, you have the triumphant acknowledgment that that teacher is not only a capable instructor, but a valued human being as well.I've seen this film a number of times and it always manages to impress. You can see the young men of Welton Academy mature as students and as individuals over the course of the story. The death of Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) certainly strikes a discordant note, but serves to dramatize the inner turmoil one faces when forced to accept outcomes that don't come from the heart. It was unfortunate that he could not seize the day in his own good time, while attempting to conform to his father's accepted principles of Welton - 'Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence'. There should have been some room left over for Humanity.",now my class you will learn think yourselves again,its with sad sense irony that one watches film today knowing that robin williams took his own life at age sixty three few years ago no one can truly know what personal demons another person faces daily bring about such tragic event his suicide defied all rationality anyone who followed his career he is sadly missed i think everyone deserves teacher like john keating at least once during their time school i came close there was teacher my high school who was as well regarded as mr keating but i was not one his classes yet he was personal favorite always took time chat when opportunity presented itself insisting that one learns think themselves is probably most valuable lesson any teacher can inspire when that lesson takes hold you have triumphant acknowledgment that that teacher is not only capable instructor but valued human being as well ive seen this film number times it always manages impress you can see young men welton academy mature as students as individuals over course story death neil perry robert sean leonard certainly strikes discordant note but serves dramatize inner turmoil one faces when forced accept outcomes that dont come heart it was unfortunate that he could not seize day his own good time while attempting conform his fathers accepted principles welton tradition honor discipline excellence there should have been some room left over humanity,0.5171238095238094,0.02497142857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Walt Whitman Weeps,"""Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect."" - Mark Twain The ""teaching genre"". Typically these films deify heroic teachers whose classrooms are havens at odds with the conformity or mediocrity that plagues the rest of the institution. In this regard, these films merely take familiar stories about admirable loners and nonconformists and place them in an educational setting in which the school milieu is fairly incidental.Films like ""Stand and Deliver"", ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Mr Holland's Opus"", ""To Sir, with Love"", ""Dangerous Minds"", ""Coach Carter"", ""Mona Lisa Smile"", ""Music of the Heart"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""School of Rock"", ""Little Man Tate"", ""Dangerous Minds"", ""Freedom Writers"", ""Pay It Forward"" etc etc all follow the same narrative progression, the inspirational white/black teacher moving to a school where he/she is forced to deal with various problems (racial tensions, student apathy, learning difficulties and institutional barriers), all of which he/she solves by delivering inspirational messages in offbeat ways.Very few ""teaching films"" deviate from this formula. Some of the best that do are perhaps Frederick Wiseman's ""High School"", ""High School 2"" and ""State Legislature"", Laurent Cantet's ""The Class"", Nick Ray's ""Bigger Than Life"", Olivier's ""Term of Trial"", 2002's ""To Be and To Have"", and ""The Prime of Mrs Jean Brodie"", with Maggie Smith. For the most part, though, cinema has failed to produce many interesting ""teaching movies"".And so ""Dead Poets"" is another mushy ""teacher flick"" which advocates ""independence"" and ""non conformity"" by sticking to a very generic and clichéd movie formula. Here, the maverick teacher is played by Robin Williams, a wacky guy who inspires his band of students to ""seize the day"" and ""chase their dreams"".The film was directed by Peter Weir, and so it has a certain classiness which, at first glance, seems to differentiate it from the pack; it's low-key at times, well acted and beautifully shot. It's only during ""Poet's"" last half hour that we realise how much we've been conned. And so as Weir's plot draws toward a typical ""I am Spartacus!"" ending (you'll know it when you see it), we begin to grasp how goofy the picture really is, the film populated by one dimensional adults, villainous kids, ridiculously stuck-up parents and a plot which reduces the art of poetry to a couple selectively chosen one liners, all designed to illicit ""rebelliousness"" and ""non conformity"".So serious is the film in its message, that it even has one kid commit suicide because he is unable to break free of his father's wishes. In other words, conformity literally kills, physically as well as spiritually. This is a worthwhile message, but the film is so conventionally manipulative in its final half, that all power quickly fizzles out.For a film which pretends to profess a love for poetry, you might even call this flick anti-poetry. Early in the film, Robin Williams draws a graph on a blackboard which he says is used to ""measure the worth of a poem"". On one axis of the graph is a poem's ""importance"" or ""depth"", on the other axis of the graph its ""perfection"" or ""technique"", the implication being that a work of art which succeeds on both axes, or very highly on one, is discernibly ""better"" than others. Williams then erases this graph and orders his pupils to tear it out of their textbooks. You cannot measure the objective worth of art, he says, only what that art means to you personally.Later, one kid who spends hours and hours toiling over his poems, discarding them all because he doesn't think them any good, is put in front of the classroom and told to ""let go"" and ""just say what comes into your head"". Suddenly he becomes like all the other students in the film, able to magically and whimsically create great poetry. What the film is advocating is not some kind of objectively great poetry, which artists strive for and toil to create, but misusing poetry as a metaphor for a kind of whimsical freedom of expression; nothing matters other than your own subjective feelings and opinions. Nothing matters, other than you conforming to your desires, embracing your right to free speech and impulsively doing and saying what you want at any particular moment. This isn't poetry, this isn't artistic expression, it's just a kind of self-obsessed, narcissistic, rash impulsiveness.Now look at all the things the students in the film use poetry to achieve. It's all sex, girls, dancing or throwing things away. Very simple, egotistical, hedonistic or impulsive things. Children and people with bipolar disorder have been shown to act with more impulsivity than other people. Artists, of course, are themselves often described as being childish (or possessing a child's imagination) and are more prone to being bipolar. What the film is unconsciously doing is tapping into the whole ""artist as free"" and ""art as childish impulsiveness"" cliché, without marrying it to anything truly substantial.The limits of this approach are best observed in the film's final scenes. The young artists are given the chance to save their teacher, but instead choose to save themselves. They've never been taught, through poetry or art, to really stand up for anything of value external to themselves. Only later, when their teacher is kicked out of school, do they impulsively stand on their desks and show him support. But of course now it's a wasted gesture.Significantly, the one kid who ""stands up"" in defence of his teacher is the one kid who was serious about poetry and seemed sceptical of William's character. His act of ""standing up"" is the only true act of rebellion in the film, the artist putting himself on the line, standing up for something worthwhile. Weir completely misses the implications of this. 7.9/10 Generic. Worth one viewing. See ""If"" and ""The Magdalene Sisters"".",walt whitman weeps,whenever you find yourself side majority its time pause reflect mark twain teaching genre typically these films deify heroic teachers

10.0,Seize the day; be Exceptional!,"John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad.Released in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a coming-of-age drama that's one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.This is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" but he's dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent.The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""The letter kills,"" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment).There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well, but that's always the case, even with the best of films.One possible objection is that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic.Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we'd bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory.Most of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action,' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven't already. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).GRADE: A+",seize day be exceptional,john keating robin williams new teacher at stuffy prep school 1959 inspires his students capitalize their natural talents develop passion life because they only have one shot 60 years or so theyll all be worm food each boy starts act keatings dynamic ideas with explosive consequences both good bad released 1989 directed by peter weir dead poets society is coming age drama thats one most inspiring films ever made ranks with my all time favorite movies film captivates very beginning doesnt release until its over thats when you know movies really good regardless subject matter cinematography locations are top rate shot middletown region delaware although story itself takes place vermont quiet fall winter scenes are breathtaking this is not spoiler but theres powerful scene at climax where students give keating daring final salute roger ebert criticized scene as so moving he wanted throw up but hes dead wrong it is both unexpected potent film contains wealth riches mine subsequent viewings i dont just mean insights conjured poetry prose here are handful off top my head letter kills referring legalistic nature neils joyless father most teachers at school type judas cameron scapegoat keating stunning nature feminine beauty when chris appears at entrance school guys mouths drop marvels nature how theyre conducive inspiration spirituality keatings heartbroken countenance after neil is removed theater crowd keating knows theres little he can do about authoritarian mistreatment there are couple insignificant scenes that dont work so well but thats always case even with best films one possible objection is that one boys tragedy goes against very message film seize day i disagree kid really started seize day but his passions were quenched by someone who didnt share keatings mindset he unfortunately couldnt handle it again dynamic ideas have explosive consequences good bad other kids had varying results with their attempts seize day some made progress attaining their dreams others got trouble because they threw wisdom wind varying results make story realistic another criticism was voiced by reviewer who stated that late night meetings at cave read poetry inspire one another were homo erotic this interpretation could only be derived by adult our gay obsessed modern culture kids film are about 16 17 years old this was only way they could go out have fun under strict rules new england prep school 1959 i remember when i was teenager going out treehouse with several guys drinking smoking wed sometimes discuss metal rock lyrics which could be viewed as delinquent form poetry other such things sometimes wed bring girl or three likewise two cave meetings film one guys brings couple babes another school whilst others look awe two other occasions guy brings nude pages whoa men i think that pretty much quells homo erotic theory most those who scoff at this films message go back their 9 5 slavery or 3 11 or 11 7 etc with no light at end mundane tunnel i encourage such people give film second look but beware there are no moronic explosions cgi non stop action gore ott cussing nudity or sex scenes i know thats completely shocking but its true then i would encourage these people take good look at their lives ask are you willing change it throw off shackles throw caution wind pursue your true calling your dream will you sieze day or will you continue stagnate puddle mediocrity answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes favorite or not final analysis australian director peter weir has other good films like witness picnic at hanging rock latter is incidentally film about all girls school can be boring if youre not mood ultra mystery yarn but dead poets society is his best check it out give it second or third chance if you havent already its outstanding story itll inspire you especially if youve fallen into life stifling growth stultifying rut drudgery film runs just over two hours 128 minutes grade,0.5303247997213516,0.11654475792406828,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Words and ideas can change the world,"Dead Poets Society was one of my favourite movies when I was about 12 years old. It was a long time ago since I'd last seen it and I kinda expected it to have lost something over the years. Not true at all. The story's message still very much applies today and always will: make something of your life, enjoy it as much as you can.When you watch this beautifully acted, directed and well shot film, you can't help but be genuinely be seized by emotion. Several scenes are stunning, yet it never gets sentimental and stays sincere throughout the whole film.Because he was such a fantastic emotional actor, Robin Williams was the perfect choice to play John Keating, an original English teacher who wants his students to think for themselves, not only about poetry but also about life itself. If there'd be a John Keating in every school, the world might just become a little more interesting. Definitely a must-see classic.",words ideas can change world,dead poets society was one my favourite movies when i was about 12 years old it was long time ago since id last seen it i kinda expected it have lost something over years not true at all storys message still very much applies today always will make something your life enjoy it as much as you can when you watch this beautifully acted directed well shot film you cant help but be genuinely be seized by emotion several scenes are stunning yet it never gets sentimental stays sincere throughout whole film because he was such fantastic emotional actor robin williams was perfect choice play john keating original english teacher who wants his students think themselves not only about poetry but also about life itself if thered be john keating every school world might just become little more interesting definitely must see classic,0.5014942528735632,0.1927298850574713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
7.0,A hymn to life,"""Dead Poets Society"" is more than a lesson of life. It's a hymn to life. It has a good message: ""Carpe diem"", which means ""Seize the day"". I completely agree with that message because there's no coming back and time flies.It's a reasonable movie with an inspiring story, good message, great performances from the actors, wonderful sceneries, awesome soundtrack (classical music, for example), drama and comedy.John Keating is the kind of teacher that anyone would like to have as a teacher. A teacher with such a colorful imagination and sense of humor, a teacher who inspires his students to make their dreams come true and makes their lives extraordinary. I mean, wow! John Keating is brilliantly performed by the comedian Robin Williams. In general, Robin Williams is as humorous as usual in this movie, but we can also see some of his talent for drama.Besides this incredible teacher, other great characters are: Neil Perry, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, Todd Anderson and even Richard Cameron (although he has the power to anger us at the end because of his attitude). All of them are very well played by the actors.About the boys, Charlie Dalton aka ""Nuwanda"" is the funniest of all. He's just hilarious! ""Nuwanda"" is such a funny nickname - lol.Todd Anderson is a shy character portrayed by Ethan Hawke. This actor looked so different when he was younger and his role here is completely different from (for example) ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"".Mr. Perry (Neil's father) is a complicated character. Like Kurtwood Smith himself says, «he's understandable, not likable». He doesn't let Neil do what he wants and controls all of his life and future.The ending is somehow... empty: Neil dies and ""Nuwanda"" is expelled. But the boys's homage to Mr. Keating at the end is admirable. What's even more amazing is that it is started by Todd Anderson.",hymn life,dead poets society is more than lesson life its hymn life it has good message carpe diem which means seize day i completely agree with that message because theres no coming back time flies its reasonable movie with inspiring story good message great performances actors wonderful sceneries awesome soundtrack classical music example drama comedy john keating is kind teacher that anyone would like have as teacher teacher with such colorful imagination sense humor teacher who inspires his students make their dreams come true makes their lives extraordinary i mean wow john keating is brilliantly performed by comedian robin williams general robin williams is as humorous as usual this movie but we can also see some his talent drama besides this incredible teacher other great characters are neil perry knox overstreet charlie dalton steven meeks gerard pitts todd anderson even richard cameron although he has power anger us at end because his attitude all them are very well played by actors about boys charlie dalton aka nuwanda is funniest all hes just hilarious nuwanda is such funny nickname lol todd anderson is shy character portrayed by ethan hawke this actor looked so different when he was younger his role here is completely different example before sunrise before sunset mr perry neils father is complicated character like kurtwood smith himself says hes understandable not likable he doesnt let neil do what he wants controls all his life future ending is somehow empty neil dies nuwanda is expelled but boyss homage mr keating at end is admirable whats even more amazing is that it is started by todd anderson,0.5997093023255815,0.24292635658914727,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
