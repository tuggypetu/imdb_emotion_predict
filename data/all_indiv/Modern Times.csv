9.0,As relevant today as it was then - and still very funny,"Part satire, part slapstick comedy, part melodrama; the great pioneer of film, Charles Chaplin, has created his own monument with this film. At the same time, 'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.After nearly 80 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed. To me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it's certainly as relevant as it was then. The tramp still rules.

9.0,Solid comedy with great story and drama,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Modern Times"" (1936) is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin. Saw it first time in 2015, but nevertheless it's a great movie. Comedy here is truly funny, and it's not just a comedy. It tells a story, with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day – technology is changing, evolving, and if you are not keeping pace with it, you will have some hard times like our hero of this movie.Acting here is very solid, actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was – no one overreacted. Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced – at running time 1 h 27 min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finish.Overall, ""Modern Times"" is a black and white silent movie (there are some sounds actually) which safely can be viewed for the first time even in 2015 – 79 years after it's original release. It has some truly genuine comedic situations, it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid. Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because it's very old, but great movies are great movies – they can be viewed no matter what.",solid comedy with great story drama,greetings lithuania modern times 1936 is my first movie which i saw that features charles chaplin saw it first time 2015 but nevertheless its great movie comedy here is truly funny its not just comedy it tells story with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day technology is changing evolving if you are not keeping pace with it you will have some hard times like our hero this movie acting here is very solid actually i was surprised how well acted this movie was no one overreacted story itself is interesting movie is very well paced at running time 1 h 27 min it almost never drags is entertaining start till finish overall modern times is black white silent movie there are some sounds actually which safely can be viewed first time even 2015 79 years after its original release it has some truly genuine comedic situations it tells good story pacing picture is very solid maybe it is not possible review this movie correctly now because its very old but great movies are great movies they can be viewed no matter what,0.41546875,0.23583333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.19}"
8.0,In the Pursuit of Happiness...,"Never a dull moment with the vagrant antics of Mr Charlie Chaplin as he seeks to impress on his audience the impact of living in the modern era.

7.0,Individual Parts Greater Than the Whole,"One of this movie's most famous images--Chaplin sliding around inside the gears and cogs of a monstrous machine--provides a handy visual to go along with my opinion of the film in general: there are individual cogs that I remember as being brilliant, but when put together they don't make a totally satisfying machine.Unlike ""City Lights"" or ""The Gold Rush"" before, or ""The Great Dictator"" after, I didn't get caught up in the narrative of ""Modern Times,"" and I felt there were longer gaps between the funny bits. However, some of the set pieces in this are hilarious, most notably the scene where Chaplin finds himself strapped into an automatic feeding machine that goes berserk; and a nimble scene on roller skates that showcases his athleticism.Sadly, ""Modern Times"" was an all too applicable metaphor for Chaplin's place in the film industry. New technologies were beginning to make his artistry obsolete, and the sadness of that is palpable in the film's final shot.I'm recommending ""Modern Times"" because it's a very good movie. I just didn't think it was as good as some of Chaplin's other well-known projects.Grade: B+",individual parts greater than whole,one this movies most famous images chaplin sliding around inside gears cogs monstrous machine provides handy visual go along with my opinion film general there are individual cogs that i remember as being brilliant but when put together they dont make totally satisfying machine unlike city lights or gold rush before or great dictator after i didnt get caught up narrative modern times i felt there were longer gaps between funny bits however some set pieces this are hilarious most notably scene where chaplin finds himself strapped into automatic feeding machine that goes berserk nimble scene roller skates that showcases his athleticism sadly modern times was all too applicable metaphor chaplins place film industry new technologies were beginning make his artistry obsolete sadness that is palpable films final shot im recommending modern times because its very good movie i just didnt think it was as good as some chaplins other well known projects grade b,0.5983818181818181,0.34085454545454547,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,"Still modern, funny and profound","It is difficult to review Chaplin's movies objectively because many of us have seen them, or at least have heard about them, since we were young. They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural background.Chaplin is arguably the only complete director: in most of his pictures, he also produces, acts, writes the script, composes the music, does his own stunts and edits. His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes, even when he continued directing silent movies after their time. ""Talkies"" were the only films produced after 1927, the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception: ""City Lights"" in 1931 and ""Modern Times"" in 1936 were sensations worldwide (the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal). This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe. Only in 1940 did Chaplin direct a talkie.COMEDY OR DRAMA?Is the movie a comedy? Partly: tragi-comedy is Chaplin's trademark. In my opinion, there are three levels of humour.1. Pure amusement, sometimes as in slapstick: the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp roller-skates close to an edge in the department store (fabulous stunt); he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end. Again, I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film. To enjoy it fully, we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense, notably towards old-fashioned cinema.2. No humour, just drama: the gamin's father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job (an efficient illustration of ruthless competition).3. Amusement with a dramatic twist: these are the most frequent scenes, and probably the best. We grin even as we laugh. The movie opens on sheep moving grouped (of which a black one: an allusion to the tramp?), that fade out to workers coming out of the subway. This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression. Another example is one of Chaplin's most famous scenes ever: the tramp tries the eating machine. It is at the same time hilarious (Chaplin really gives all of himself here) and pathetic: a metaphor on ill-conceived progress, oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requests.Other scenes include: the entire first part in the factory, including when the tramp is stuck in the machine (inside shot, that became iconic), which also happens to a colleague later on (outside shot); the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea, with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hut.The movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour, as well as its rhythm. It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music. And it ends like a roller-coaster: funny musical (the tramp sings), emotional (he is hired), dramatic (the police arrest the gamin), thriller (they run away as climatic music plays), melancholic (they are on the road, free but uncertain). The last image is rightfully double-edged: the tramp and the gamin walk away quietly, yet mountains ahead block their road. She looks like an elegant lady, he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes. We don't know where they are going, nor do they.MODERNITYHence Chaplin's ambition was far more than to just divert. Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern: Crisis, redundancies, strikes, inequalities, social unrest.Working conditions in factories, even though exaggerated by humour and symbols: productivity, control, burn-out.Technology that dehumanises: chain-working, the eating machine, video surveillance (a science-fiction element at the time). Remarkably, the only sounds of the film are coming from devices, not humans: screen, phonograph, radio.Success with talent, work and some luck.The law. The topic is prominent (the police are omnipresent) and ambiguous. Can one steal food to survive? Chaplin seems to excuse this behaviour. The tramp is on both sides of the law: he steals food but helps the police arrest villains in jail. And the police's role is complex; notably, they shoot an unarmed man, followed by the ironic card: ""The law takes charge of the orphans"".Violence and drugs in prison.The universal dimension of the movie shows by the fact the main characters have no name: the tramp, the gamin. Chaplin will be blamed for its social topics during the McCarthy era, among other grievances, and he will be forced to exile. Considering it now, this seems ridiculous since the message of the film is not communist: the tramp and the gamin want everything but change society; they search for a job, a home and respect. Note also Lincoln's portrait in the tramp's cell: he is a patriot.The movie does not take sides: Workers can be friendly or violent.Policemen can be friendly (e.g. in jail) or violent (one purposelessly pushes the tramp outside the factory).Prison inmates can be honest (the tramp) or villains.Women can be attractive (the gamin) or not (all others, actually).This double-sidedness also divides individuals: Big Bill was bullying the tramp in the factory, but later sympathises with him.The gamin steals and then becomes settled.The tramp will do anything to protect the ones he loves (the gamin, children), but can abuse almost anybody else to achieve it: a recurrent feature in Chaplin's pictures.The underlying message seems to be: people are not good or bad, it mainly depends on their conditions.

10.0,"Charlie Chaplin's own deeply impoverished past plays an extensive role in the theme of his film Modern Times, which is probably the most potent of his dozens of films that deal with the difficult lives of th","It is a testament to Chaplin's filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot. Indeed, the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable, but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong, time-transcending message about poverty stricken populations. It is no secret that Charlie Chaplin was more or less dragged into the sound era against his will. In the early part of the 20th century, he had built a tremendous career as a silent film actor, and had created a character, the Tramp, that was purely a silent film character who could not be transported into the sound era. Charlie had built his career and his popularity with the Tramp, and the coming of sound to the cinema meant the end of that character (as illustrated by Robert Downey Jr.'s Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 film Chaplin, `The Tram CAN'T talk. The minute he talks, he's dead.'). Chaplin delivers to the world a cynical satire about modern technology as well as his own ode to the silent film with Modern Times.Charlie plays the part of a man who works a dehumanizing position in a factory in which he is little more than a component of a machine, and he is controlled like a pawn by the menacing boss, who we see mostly as a looming face on a tremendous television screen. Clearly, the most memorable scenes in the film involve something to do with the factory, such as Charlie's brief trip into the innards of the machine, as well as his warm-hearted efforts to feed lunch to a man who has inadvertently become lodged in a machine, with only his head free. However, there is a very noteworthy but fairly subtle subplot that quietly reveals Chaplin's fondness for the silent film.The first and most obvious thing is that for the most part, this is a silent film. There are intertitles, there is precious little dialogue, and the film's main character doesn't utter a sound until near the end of the film. But there are also a lot of other things that more subtly hint that silent films are better than sound films. For one thing, the only intelligible words spoken in the film are done so through some sort of barrier. There is the factory boss speaking demandingly through the television screen, and the feeding machine company speaking through the radio as they try to sell the feeding machine to the factory boss. This becomes the most obvious by the fact that anyone speaking on screen - such as the factory boss as he tells the men that the feeding machine is not practical - only does so in intertitles. We know that dialogue can be put in the film, but Chaplin chooses only to do this in a detached and mechanized way.There is also a very strong example of Chaplin's endless sympathy for poor people at several points in this film. The most significant example of this is his interactions with the Gamin, played by Paulette Goddard, as well as his nearly constant contempt toward the police. After the scene where he gorges himself at a small diner (note that the window said `Cafeteria: Tables For Ladies'), he casually calls an officer into the diner and tells him to pay the tab, unable to pay it himself. As he is handcuffed to the officer, he gets a cigar from a nearby vendor and hands some large candy bars to a couple of small children nearby, who look to be the type of children who are never sure where their next meal is going to come from. Charlie plays a hard working, lower class man in Modern Times, and no matter how badly he just wants to get some good work and earn a living so that he can buy a house for himself and Paulette, things constantly seem to go wrong for him. It seems that this bad luck is used to suggest that poor people are not poor as a result of their own shortcomings, but because they just can't seem to work their way up to a better life, no matter how hard they try. This social commentary is intertwined with such skillful intricacy with the story about Chaplin's love of silent film that there is really no switching back and forth between the two. Modern Times strikes me as especially memorable because it is a very simple story that is punctuated by a series of comedy skits, yet it also delivers several different messages that are important to society as well as to the filmmaker himself. In this way, the movie almost seems to deliver these strong messages without the audience even being aware that they are being presented with these issues. It is a great way to mix entertainment with important societal topics, and Charlie's decision to finally have the Tramp utter vocalized speech is done so in an endlessly watch-able song and dance scene, adding to the immeasurable number of film skits for which Charlie Chaplin will be remembered and loved.",charlie chaplins own deeply impoverished past plays extensive role theme his film modern times which is probably most potent his dozens films that deal with difficult lives th,it is testament chaplins filmmaking skills that he is able impose such significant meaning what really boils down little more than series comedy skits strung together apparently flimsy clothesline plot indeed cinematic value modern times is unquestionable but it is ironically noteworthy that such simple even blocky plot is made into such memorable film experience delivers such strong time transcending message about poverty stricken populations it is no secret that charlie chaplin was more or less dragged into sound era against his will early part 20th century he had built tremendous career as silent film actor had created character tramp that was purely silent film character who could not be transported into sound era charlie had built his career his popularity with tramp coming sound cinema meant end that character as illustrated by robert downey jr s charlie chaplin 1992 film chaplin tram cant talk minute he talks hes dead chaplin delivers world cynical satire about modern technology as well as his own ode silent film with modern times charlie plays part man who works dehumanizing position factory which he is little more than component machine he is controlled like pawn by menacing boss who we see mostly as looming face tremendous television screen clearly most memorable scenes film involve something do with factory such as charlies brief trip into innards machine as well as his warm hearted efforts feed lunch man who has inadvertently become lodged machine with only his head free however there is very noteworthy but fairly subtle subplot that quietly reveals chaplins fondness silent film first most obvious thing is that most part this is silent film there are intertitles there is precious little dialogue films main character doesnt utter sound until near end film but there are also lot other things that more subtly hint that silent films are better than sound films one thing only intelligible words spoken film are done so through some sort barrier there is factory boss speaking demandingly through television screen feeding machine company speaking through radio as they try sell feeding machine factory boss this becomes most obvious by fact that anyone speaking screen such as factory boss as he tells men that feeding machine is not practical only does so intertitles we know that dialogue can be put film but chaplin chooses only do this detached mechanized way there is also very strong example chaplins endless sympathy poor people at several points this film most significant example this is his interactions with gamin played by paulette goddard as well as his nearly constant contempt toward police after scene where he gorges himself at small diner note that window said cafeteria tables ladies he casually calls officer into diner tells him pay tab unable pay it himself as he is handcuffed officer he gets cigar nearby vendor hands some large candy bars couple small children nearby who look be type children who are never sure where their next meal is going come charlie plays hard working lower class man modern times no matter how badly he just wants get some good work earn living so that he can buy house himself paulette things constantly seem go wrong him it seems that this bad luck is used suggest that poor people are not poor as result their own shortcomings but because they just cant seem work their way up better life no matter how hard they try this social commentary is intertwined with such skillful intricacy with story about chaplins love silent film that there is really no switching back forth between two modern times strikes me as especially memorable because it is very simple story that is punctuated by series comedy skits yet it also delivers several different messages that are important society as well as filmmaker himself this way movie almost seems deliver these strong messages without audience even being aware that they are being presented with these issues it is great way mix entertainment with important societal topics charlies decision finally have tramp utter vocalized speech is done so endlessly watch able song dance scene adding immeasurable number film skits which charlie chaplin will be remembered loved,0.529474826388889,0.12032211061507934,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.48}"
10.0,Still a Modern Classic,"We like to think that comedy has evolved since the time of silent film. We like to think that with the advent of sound and the injection of modern technology in all aspects of film production has made just about everything better. Indeed, it's hard to argue that so much of today's fun and farce just can't exist without a sound mixer and a few boom mics laying around. Ask yourself, if you put The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) or The Hangover (2009) on mute, would you really get anything out of it?By 1936, sound had long taken the film industry by storm. In fact, if you listen closely to the moment Al Jolson uttered ""You ain't heard nothing' yet,"" in The Jazz Singer (1927), you may have heard the careers of many shattering in earnest. Never has there been a piece of technology so seamlessly adapted to an industry before or since. To name the number of noteworthy films made after 1929 that were silent would be to name perhaps a dozen.Yet with this adoption came growing pains. The cumbersome size of the Photokinema sound-on-disc machines and their components meant cameras had to stay bolted down. Actors had to not wonder too far from the mic or worse still, find a way to wear several pounds of bulky microphones under their garments. What once were dreams, stitched together by editing cuts became pale imitations of stage plays. The grammar of film essentially took two steps back.Seeing this, silent era superstar Charlie Chaplin decided to stem the tide. In 1931, he directed, produced and starred in City Lights, a romantic masterpiece of stagecraft and pantomime that to this day is one of the best examples of the beauty we lost. Seeing the writing on the wall by 1936, Chaplin decided to give the Tramp one last hurrah before retiring the character. One last bow before the tendrils of technology transforms his career into a shadow of its former self.Modern Times is at once one last bow, one last look at innocence lost and one glorious masterpiece of cinema. In it, Charlie's lovable Tramp struggles to adapt to a modern technological age while causing light-hearted mayhem everywhere he goes. Throughout the film he tries to conform to working as a security guard, a longshoreman, a factory worker, a mechanic etc. yet his peculiarity prevents him from being at a work site for too long. During his struggles he befriends an woman named Ellen (Goddard) who aids him in his quest for fulfilling work. They of course, fall in love in the chaste innocent way that couples did in the films of the time.Modern Times is infamous, for among other things, a soundtrack that includes the earworm ""Smile"" composed by Chaplin himself. The most famous cover was crooned by Nat King Cole whose astringent voice had the poorly covered scars of a life harshly lived. ""Smile"" to Modern Times is perfect; both as a bittersweet anthem and as addition to the American songbook. It perfectly captures the Tramp's uneasy monachopsis while hanging onto a buoyant hope of finding purpose. It's at times sad, at times triumphant but always life-affirming.Modern Times is also known for large, unique and detail filled comic set-pieces that despite being around for eighty years still coaxes laughter. One after another, these moments capture the absurdities of industrial life no other film does. Whether it be Chaplin toiling over a conveyor belt of widgets or literally being engulfed by a mechanical do-dad, He always has the perfect expression to reaffirm his humanity in the most inhuman of situations. It's pitch-perfect pantomime done by a true master of the craft.Of course, being the film advertised as ""the one where The Tramp speaks,"" Modern Times does succumb to the encroachment of sound. And unlike in City Lights, Chaplin decides to inject it as part of a large theme as opposed to a target of mockery. The film is book- ended by two moments of sound, the first of which is his factory boss yelling at him through a large projected screen. ""Get back to work!"" he yells while the Tramp struggles to find a moment of respite. The inclusion of sound as an oppressor, even a personified one is an effective means of identification. Those who have heard the phrase ""If you have time to lean, you have time to clean,"" will no doubt sympathize with Chaplin's character in that particular moment in time.The second time sound is used, is to affirm Chaplin's Tramp as a unique individual amid a crowd of onlookers. Late in the film, Ellen finds a job for the Tramp at a restaurant as a singing waiter. Right before his debut, he struggles to remember the words of the song he's to sing. He decides to put the lyrics on his detachable cuffs. Invariably, he looses the cuffs and, thinking quickly, begins to sing in gibberish. It's a prank pulled on audiences clamoring for the Tramp to finally speak on screen, yet it's one that's so incongruously Chaplin that one can't help but admire it.With Chaplin having a hand in every aspect of the film's production, one can write an entire book fawning over the exploits of a genius so ahead of his time, we still feel his influence.

10.0,The Farewell Performance of The Tramp,"Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.Still, the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one. The Jazz Singer, which debuted in 1927, five years before Modern Times began production, is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. In the film, comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin' in the Rain, the public was suddenly in a frenzy for ""Talking pictures! Talking pictures!"" Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.Modern Times is not an entirely silent film, (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects), but if you look closely, every character with dialogue (excluding Chaplin himself) is being mocked. Even when The Tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film), the words are nonsensical, defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance, entertainment, and quality.Despite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form, but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.As we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).He takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.This is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as ""The Gamin"" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.It is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.Then there is, of course, the comedy, which is the stuff of legendary status. Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times. These include The Tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches), his unfortunate encounter with ""nose-powder"", the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry, and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.In my opinion, however, the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).These are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is. On a personal level, the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. In our hearts, many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).As Chaplin so skillfully shows, however, our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream, lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. Still, the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing

,See That Little Man Over There? Remember When No One Was Better?,"Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the early-1930s due to the advent of sound (a medium that just never seemed right with him). Chaplin, probably the best film-maker/performer of the 20th Century, did not despair though. He fought back with heart and emotion and by 1936 ""Modern Times"" was a major box office and critical success. It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. As a factory worker in the film, Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing U.S. economy. He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard (who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life) and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change. ""Modern Times"" is one of those films that will put a smile on your face, but it could make you weep just as easily. Chaplin's world was changing (and not necessarily for the better from his point of view) and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted. Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplin's charm in one of his pictures. Their love for one another (even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life) just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heart-warming. Beautifully made, wonderfully written, perfectly performed, smart, insightful and always brilliant, ""Modern Times"" is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",see that little man over there remember when no one was better,charles chaplin seemingly had been pushed out movie business by early 1930s due advent sound medium that just never seemed right with him chaplin probably best film maker performer 20th century did not despair though he fought back with heart emotion by 1936 modern times was major box office critical success it is movie that quietly showed man suffering through world change as factory worker film chaplin tries cope with industrial revolution tries make it through quickly changing u s economy he finds love with vagrant paulette goddard who ended up marrying chaplin real life two come together lean one another world uncertainty change modern times is one those films that will put smile your face but it could make you weep just as easily chaplins world was changing not necessarily better his point view he wanted express variations his old way doing things new way everyone else had accepted goddard is also probably best actress match chaplins charm one his pictures their love one another even though marriage lasted relatively short amount time real life just seems shine silver screen they have chemistry that is sweet heart warming beautifully made wonderfully written perfectly performed smart insightful always brilliant modern times is another film chaplin that will brand itself souls all true lovers cinema 5 stars out 5,0.46418333918333926,0.29332514332514326,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,A Classic,"This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous ""Modern times"" - we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much, much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga. Another example of things I just assumed I know. It charmed me instantly, of course, because Chaplin was a true genius and magician - his creation, ""Little Tramp"" is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly, for all his sweetness, clumsiness and old heart. This story apparently happens in Metropolis-like factory where work, machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we (audience) roar with laughter - I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny. Basically, everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed, until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again. What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job - there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness, poverty and depression around - he quickly ends up in a prison, from which he doesn't even want to leave. However, he gets Cocaine in his salt, (Charlie Chaplin on a Coke!), saves policemen from escaped criminals, meets minister's wife (very funny scene) and gets release from the prison, with job recommendation letter. And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much, much more coming up later - it really goes on forever but its wonderful, heart-warming and joyous to watch. I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece. Film is so immensely rich with characters, stories, little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen.",classic,this is where i decided have look at charlie chaplin his famous modern times we are all familiar with scenes factory but honestly there is much much more happening later it truly surprised me that film turns into such epic saga another example things i just assumed i know it charmed me instantly course because chaplin was true genius magician his creation little tramp is easily understood anybody no matter what background we love him dearly all his sweetness clumsiness old heart this story apparently happens metropolis like factory where work machines buttons are parodied mercilessly until we audience roar with laughter i was honestly surprised that something filmed almost century ago was still so fresh funny basically everything after first start fast track was new me i laughed laughed until i found myself rewinding scenes enjoying them again what genius once little tramp looses his job there is whole unspoken atmosphere unfairness poverty depression around he quickly ends up prison which he doesnt even want leave however he gets cocaine his salt charlie chaplin coke saves policemen escaped criminals meets ministers wife very funny scene gets release prison with job recommendation letter this is still just beginning movie there is much much more coming up later it really goes forever but its wonderful heart warming joyous watch i almost forgot everything about myself my whereabouts while i was so deeply lost this masterpiece film is so immensely rich with characters stories little details magic that i honestly think its one best things i have ever seen,0.5537694013303769,0.26541943828529196,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Hilarious comedy with a serious message,"""Modern Times"" is in my top 5 films, and #2 in my list of favorite comedies. Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being, nevermind film maker, that ever lived. I first saw this treasure about 8 years ago, and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny, and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film. ""Modern Times"" passed my test with flying colors. I laughed hysterically from start to finish. Each and every scene is innovative, well thought out, and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed. Among my favorite scenes are the ""automatic worker-feeding machine""; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food, thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store. No special effects or computer animation, just pure, simple, genius.The storyline in ""Modern Times"" is purposefully naive, a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films. Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros. cartoon, which coming from me is a sincere compliment. The level of physical comedy in ""Modern Times"" is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and others.Finally, as was the case with most of his later films, ""Modern Times"" is a serious social commentary. Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released. In fact, it is arguably even more relevant today, and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be. ""Modern Times"" is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society. The opening scene, which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep, is Chaplin's warning against standardization, mechanization, and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality. Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden, because despite his enormous success and wealth, he never forgot where he came from. In the end, ""Modern Times"" is a reminder that no matter how bad things are, you can still smile. Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other, and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films. Its up to us to keep his legacy alive.",hilarious comedy with serious message,modern times is my top 5 films my list favorite comedies charles chaplin is arguably most talented human being nevermind film maker that ever lived i first saw this treasure about 8 years ago i watched it again recently make sure that it really was funny that i had not given it too much praise because it was simply chaplin film modern times passed my test with flying colors i laughed hysterically start finish each every scene is innovative well thought out executed with genius that only chaplin possessed among my favorite scenes are automatic worker feeding machine jail scene cafeteria when tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine his food thinking it is salt roller skating scene department store no special effects or computer animation just pure simple genius storyline modern times is purposefully naive trick chaplin used time again bring profound humanitarian quality his films watching this film is comparable watching warner bros cartoon which coming me is sincere compliment level physical comedy modern times is par with masterful short films chuck jones friz freleng others finally as was case with most his later films modern times is serious social commentary its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released fact it is arguably even more relevant today unless world changes drastically future it will continue be modern times is essentially story simple but extremely kind man caught traps industrialized society opening scene which compares crowd workers boarding subway flock sheep is chaplins warning against standardization mechanization other facets life which rob men women their individuality chaplin always tried speak downtrodden because despite his enormous success wealth he never forgot where he came end modern times is reminder that no matter how bad things are you can still smile charles chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other his legacy love laughter lives his films its up us keep his legacy alive,0.5135525961797149,0.1819612590799032,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,"""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along""","By 1936, Charles Chaplin was already an anachronism  albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. The arrival of 'The Jazz Singer (1927)' did little to curb the director's enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the ""talkie"" age was almost completely silent (Chaplin compromised by composing a musical score). Nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to 'City Lights (1931)' was strong, reaffirming Chaplin's status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. Thus, 'Modern Times (1936)' was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue (always spoken through a mechanical ""barrier,"" such as a record-player, radio or loudspeaker). The film is historically significant in that it was Chaplin's first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the Great Depression, and Chaplin's growing interest in socialism.The title 'Modern Times' is used to deliberate ironic effect. Traditionally, to be modern was to be at the forefront of human progress, a step forwards in Man's noble attempt to assert his dominance over his environment; in short, to further distinguish our species from the lower animals. Yet Chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was a step backwards for society. Even from the opening shot, he draws comparisons between the hustling crowds of factory workers travelling to work, and a flock of sheep being herded through a corral. The dehumanisation caused by the workers' monotonous factory work is played for maximum comedic effect, with Chaplin's Tramp eventually driven to a nervous breakdown by Frederick Taylor's apathetic brand of scientific management. In these conditions, direct human interaction is minimal, and almost always channelled through an mechanical mediator. In a scene predating Orwell's ""Nineteen-Eighty Four (1949),"" Chaplin is reprimanded by a telescreen in the bathroom, the image of his boss looming overhead like the spectre of Big Brother.Chaplin may also have been remarking upon the rise of the Hollywood studio system, which by then employed a comparable assembly-line approach to film-making. Chaplin, who was given full artistic control through his co-ownership of United Artists, worked in complete opposition to these practices, though it could be argued that his perfectionism and often improvisational style was so inefficient that only an artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it. Truth be told, there's nothing particularly distinguished about Chaplin's direction  despite his strong reliance upon actions over words, his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that of Murnau or Lang, for example. However, his greatest talents as a filmmaker were concerned with the plight of people, and, however much sentimentality he liked to dish out, there can be no doubt that, in Chaplin's characters, one found individuals with whom they shared a very real human bond, of empathy and compassion. For all the director's criticism of modern society, he possessed a genuine belief in the value of human spirit.When Chaplin came under fire for alleged ""communist sympathies"" in the late 1940s, the content of 'Modern Times' was scrutinised for evidence to support the allegations. Certainly, within the director's distaste for industrialisation one may discern an underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism, but Chaplin was definitely not a communist; after all, a prime motivation in his choosing to continue producing silent films was to retain his commercial popularity in foreign-language markets  that's the capitalist spirit! Nevertheless, Chaplin was eerily prescient when he included a scene in which his Tramp is falsely accused of being a communist, mirroring his own intense political troubles, which concluded in 1952 with the retraction of his US re-entry visa. Though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence, as Chaplin's political convictions grew, so too did his desire to have himself heard. For that, he would, however reluctantly, have to embrace the technology of sound, and, for a mouthpiece, he would choose the most hated man in Europe.",buck up never say die well get along,by 1936 charles chaplin was already anachronism albeit anachronism who was also treasured as artistic genius arrival jazz singer 1927 did little curb directors enthusiasm silent cinema though he considered at length commercial implications converting synchronised sound his first film talkie age was almost completely silent chaplin compromised by composing musical score nevertheless critical commercial response city lights 1931 was strong reaffirming chaplins status as cinematic master vindicating his decision linger with otherwise extinct medium thus modern times 1936 was follow same mould despite synchronised soundtrack which includes musical score sound effects several lines spoken dialogue always spoken through mechanical barrier such as record player radio or loudspeaker film is historically significant that it was chaplins first overtly political work raising concerns inspired both by economic hardship great depression chaplins growing interest socialism title modern times is used deliberate ironic effect traditionally be modern was be at forefront human progress step forwards mans noble attempt assert his dominance over his environment short further distinguish our species lower animals yet chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was step backwards society even opening shot he draws comparisons between hustling crowds factory workers travelling work flock sheep being herded through corral dehumanisation caused by workers monotonous factory work is played maximum comedic effect with chaplins tramp eventually driven nervous breakdown by frederick taylors apathetic brand scientific management these conditions direct human interaction is minimal almost always channelled through mechanical mediator scene predating orwells nineteen eighty four 1949 chaplin is reprimanded by telescreen bathroom image his boss looming overhead like spectre big brother chaplin may also have been remarking upon rise hollywood studio system which by then employed comparable assembly line approach film making chaplin who was given full artistic control through his co ownership united artists worked complete opposition these practices though it could be argued that his perfectionism often improvisational style was so inefficient that only artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it truth be told theres nothing particularly distinguished about chaplins direction despite his strong reliance upon actions over words his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that murnau or lang example however his greatest talents as filmmaker were concerned with plight people however much sentimentality he liked dish out there can be no doubt that chaplins characters one found individuals with whom they shared very real human bond empathy compassion all directors criticism modern society he possessed genuine belief value human spirit when chaplin came under fire alleged communist sympathies late 1940s content modern times was scrutinised evidence support allegations certainly within directors distaste industrialisation one may discern underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism but chaplin was definitely not communist after all prime motivation his choosing continue producing silent films was retain his commercial popularity foreign language markets thats capitalist spirit nevertheless chaplin was eerily prescient when he included scene which his tramp is falsely accused being communist mirroring his own intense political troubles which concluded 1952 with retraction his us re entry visa though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence as chaplins political convictions grew so too did his desire have himself heard that he would however reluctantly have embrace technology sound mouthpiece he would choose most hated man europe,0.41613181504485874,0.1308229813664596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,"""Actions speak louder than words""","There is something fundamentally sad about Modern Times, by the very fact that it shows an unparalleled genius making his last move in the now-defunct art form with which he made his name. Charlie Chaplin, undisputed master of silent comedy, had managed to bluff his way through the awkward early days of sound, but by 1936 the talkie had got its act together, and screen comedy was dominated by the witty wordplay of the Marx brothers and the smart sass of screwball. Slapstick had all but lost its market, and the picture is saturated with a feel of ""One last time"" And Chaplin expresses his feelings with scathing satire. Modern Times is quite plainly a blast at many aspects of industrialised living, especially unemployment and Fordist production management. However the picture also takes several sly swipes at sound film itself. From the beginning, sound is associated with the mechanical, the authoritative, and the austere, with the few bits of spoken dialogue being via some piece of technology such as a radio or the boss's speaking tube. Sound effects too are reserved for nasty clanking and scraping sounds of machinery and things breaking apart. Finally there is Paulette Godard's pronouncement that ""The words don't matter"" as Charlie forgets the lyrics for his singing waiter act. Chaplin was of course very good at nonsense voices, as this and his Adenoid Hynkel act in The Great Dictator demonstrate, whereas meaningful verbal comedy was his Achilles Heel.Despite all this vehemence, Chaplin is making one or two concessions to contemporary cinema. Modern Times features a lot more camera movement and close-ups than we see in his previous pictures, where he tended to stick to static long shots to preserve the best flow of physical comedy. The more technical approach here is always done for a reason – for example whip-panned close-ups are used for emphasis, and there is often a change of angle to punctuate a gag such as the half-built ship slipping out of dock. While they do draw attention to the funniest moments they disrupt the purity of the routine and are most likely concessions made by Chaplin for an audience not used to silent comedy. Modern Times is also much more variable and fast-paced than previous Chaplin features, skipping from factory to prison to department store and so on.And yet, of all his feature films, Modern Times includes perhaps the most protracted bouts of silent comedy, far more than the story-driven City Lights. Despite its linking plot, the various settings in which the little tramp finds himself each provide fully-fledged slapstick routines, and there are very few moments in which point or poignancy are allowed to overrule the comedy. The picture is in some ways like a compendium of the non-stop gagging two-reelers he was making in the 1910s. Modern Times may not be quite the tearjerker that The Kid or City Lights were, but it is the master's final great showcase of his primary talent.",actions speak louder than words,there is something fundamentally sad about modern times by very fact that it shows unparalleled genius making his last move now defunct art form with which he made his name charlie chaplin undisputed master silent comedy had managed bluff his way through awkward early days sound but by 1936 talkie had got its act together screen comedy was dominated by witty wordplay marx brothers smart sass screwball slapstick had all but lost its market picture is saturated with feel one last time chaplin expresses his feelings with scathing satire modern times is quite plainly blast at many aspects industrialised living especially unemployment fordist production management however picture also takes several sly swipes at sound film itself beginning sound is associated with mechanical authoritative austere with few bits spoken dialogue being via some piece technology such as radio or bosss speaking tube sound effects too are reserved nasty clanking scraping sounds machinery things breaking apart finally there is paulette godards pronouncement that words dont matter as charlie forgets lyrics his singing waiter act chaplin was course very good at nonsense voices as this his adenoid hynkel act great dictator demonstrate whereas meaningful verbal comedy was his achilles heel despite all this vehemence chaplin is making one or two concessions contemporary cinema modern times features lot more camera movement close ups than we see his previous pictures where he tended stick static long shots preserve best flow physical comedy more technical approach here is always done reason example whip panned close ups are used emphasis there is often change angle punctuate gag such as half built ship slipping out dock while they do draw attention funniest moments they disrupt purity routine are most likely concessions made by chaplin audience not used silent comedy modern times is also much more variable fast paced than previous chaplin features skipping factory prison department store so yet all his feature films modern times includes perhaps most protracted bouts silent comedy far more than story driven city lights despite its linking plot various settings which little tramp finds himself each provide fully fledged slapstick routines there are very few moments which point or poignancy are allowed overrule comedy picture is some ways like compendium non stop gagging two reelers he was making 1910s modern times may not be quite tearjerker that kid or city lights were but it is masters final great showcase his primary talent,0.47588095238095257,0.14631944444444447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,Some iconic scenes in socially conscious movie,"The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is just a cog in the modern machinery. He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts. The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine. By late afternoon, he gets lost in the machinery. He can't stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital. He gets out but he doesn't have a job anymore. A red flag falls off the back of a truck. He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it. The police grabs him thinking that he's the leader. In prison, he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released. A Gamin (Paulette Goddard) is stealing food for the children. Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage. She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp. He tries to take the blame but she's caught anyways. He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing. They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out together.This has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on. The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream. The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next. He's the cog that never really fits in the machinery.

9.0,A Masterpiece of Yesteryear,"I was actually about to completely write off this movie until I actually realised the genius that went into creating it. In a way Hollywood simply does not make movies like this any more, particularly where the creative genius of Charlie Chaplin is the writer, director, and star of the show. Sure, Chaplin is one of those actors that I have heard a lot about – he is one of the greats of the early years of Hollywood – but I never paid much attention to him believing that the only decent movies of the silent era came out of Germany (and to an extent Russia). However, a friend at work was talking about a film called The Dictator and a part of me decided that maybe it was time to actually sit down and see what Charlie Chaplin was all about. Well, I have to admit that I am glad that I did.The film itself doesn't have a plot, but rather is about the struggles of two people in the great depression and an age where technology is taking all of the jobs. However, Chaplin is a genius in how we satirises everything about modern life from automation, crazy inventions, the union movement, and even communism. On one level it simply seems to be nothing more than slapstick, though it is one of those movies that you have to take a step back and think about what is being said to really understand the true satire that Modern Times actually is – in a way it works on two levels, the slapstick for the lowest common denominator, and the satire of those who are actually willing to sit down and think about what is going on. Even then the slapstick itself is really clever – I am not going to forget the scene where he carries a tray into a restaurant to have everybody suddenly pile onto the dancefloor and then getting carried away with the crowd.What really impressed me was how versatile they were when it came to making silent films. Sure, by this time they had started to produce talkies, and you could tell that this film did have a sound track (and Chaplin even sings), however it is clear that you don't actually need sound, or even a lot of words, to be able to see the action that is happening, and to work out what is being said despite the fact that no words are coming out of the actor's mouth – only their lips are moving. In a way this type of film is actually far, far superior than many of the films that we see floating around today with all the great computerised special effects and clever stunt doubles. In fact all of the stunts in this movie would have been performed by Chaplin without any special effects whatsoever.Yet it is also interesting to see how much hasn't changed. In a way we look back in the days of our parents and grandparents and see a world where everybody had a job, and that you could drop out of school at year ten and walk straight into a career. It was also a world where people had money, and things were much more peaceful. However, Modern Times gives us a different glimpse into the great depression, where automation was taking all the jobs, and that unless you were skilled you were unable to find employment. Also notice how people are being sent to gaol simply for stealing a loaf of bread, but not only that but people will actually pursue somebody who is only trying to feed themselves. Yet we also have that dream of home ownership – and in a way it is painted that owning a home is a sign of wealth, a sign of achieving the American Dream – and the ending is interesting in that it gives the idea that no matter where you land up the dream is still alive.Having a job is a key to living the dream – as we see with the heroine. When Chaplin gets out of gaol the third time (it seems that he is always landing up in gaol – as if ending up there is just a part of life, however it is also just a minor inconvenience on the road to living the dream), she has found herself a job, and is now dressed well, and has possessions. In a way that reminded me of when I got my first job – suddenly I had money that I could spend, and I could go down to the shop and impulse buy an Iron Maiden T-Shirt. However, there is a catch, something that is not indicated in the movie, and that is the trap that the modern society creates – to survive you must work, but once you start working you suddenly have access to credit, and what credit, or more so debt, does is that entraps you in that daily cycle of forever going to work.Yet we also have the capitalist idea of forever producing more and becoming more efficient. The factory bosses are looking for ways to cut down on break times, so they create an automated feeding machine (which basically doesn't work). Then we have the assembly line going faster, and faster, and faster, until poor old Chaplin has a nervous breakdown and eventually sees bolts everywhere that must be turned. Yet this is still the case today, where employers are looking for more and better ways to become more efficient, to get more out of workers, and to eventually increase the bottom line. This is more so since, like in Chaplin's day, we have entered a period of a new normal after the Great Recession.",masterpiece yesteryear,i was actually about completely write off this movie until i actually realised genius that went into creating it way hollywood simply does not make movies like this any more particularly where creative genius charlie chaplin is writer director star show sure chaplin is one those actors that i have heard lot about he is one greats early years hollywood but i never paid much attention him believing that only decent movies silent era came out germany extent russia however friend at work was talking about film called dictator part me decided that maybe it was time actually sit down see what charlie chaplin was all about well i have admit that i am glad that i did film itself doesnt have plot but rather is about struggles two people great depression age where technology is taking all jobs however chaplin is genius how we satirises everything about modern life automation crazy inventions union movement even communism one level it simply seems be nothing more than slapstick though it is one those movies that you have take step back think about what is being said really understand true satire that modern times actually is way it works two levels slapstick lowest common denominator satire those who are actually willing sit down think about what is going even then slapstick itself is really clever i am not going forget scene where he carries tray into restaurant have everybody suddenly pile onto dancefloor then getting carried away with crowd what really impressed me was how versatile they were when it came making silent films sure by this time they had started produce talkies you could tell that this film did have sound track chaplin even sings however it is clear that you dont actually need sound or even lot words be able see action that is happening work out what is being said despite fact that no words are coming out actors mouth only their lips are moving way this type film is actually far far superior than many films that we see floating around today with all great computerised special effects clever stunt doubles fact all stunts this movie would have been performed by chaplin without any special effects whatsoever yet it is also interesting see how much hasnt changed way we look back days our parents grandparents see world where everybody had job that you could drop out school at year ten walk straight into career it was also world where people had money things were much more peaceful however modern times gives us different glimpse into great depression where automation was taking all jobs that unless you were skilled you were unable find employment also notice how people are being sent gaol simply stealing loaf bread but not only that but people will actually pursue somebody who is only trying feed themselves yet we also have that dream home ownership way it is painted that owning home is sign wealth sign achieving american dream ending is interesting that it gives idea that no matter where you land up dream is still alive having job is key living dream as we see with heroine when chaplin gets out gaol third time it seems that he is always landing up gaol as if ending up there is just part life however it is also just minor inconvenience road living dream she has found herself job is now dressed well has possessions way that reminded me when i got my first job suddenly i had money that i could spend i could go down shop impulse buy iron maiden t shirt however there is catch something that is not indicated movie that is trap that modern society creates survive you must work but once you start working you suddenly have access credit what credit or more so debt does is that entraps you that daily cycle forever going work yet we also have capitalist idea forever producing more becoming more efficient factory bosses are looking ways cut down break times so they create automated feeding machine which basically doesnt work then we have assembly line going faster faster faster until poor old chaplin has nervous breakdown eventually sees bolts everywhere that must be turned yet this is still case today where employers are looking more better ways become more efficient get more out workers eventually increase bottom line this is more so since like chaplins day we have entered period new normal after great recession,0.48272280255975913,0.20483797603362816,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,Hilarious work of genius,"Hilarious, touching, anarchic, revolutionary, realist, surreal, of its time, timeless - Modern Times is a multifaceted work of genius. When it's over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into 85 minutes, it is incredible - the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the ""nose powder""; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance (my favourite); the gibberish song - and many more. Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques, making the best of both worlds, not falling between stools as some directors might have done.Of course, there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances, of bureaucracy, and of the then current depression, on the ordinary ""little man"". And it is the little man, the individual caught up in society's complex machinery, whom Chaplin championed. He may have sympathised with left-wing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people, but Chaplin's essential beliefs are enshrined in the final ""words"" and shot, with him telling Paulette Godard, that she should keep smiling, they will get along, as they walk, a couple of individuals, into an uncertain future.

,Very amusing.,"Arguably Charlie's best film. Maybe not his funniest but his best because there's so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly used.Frankly I don't know how the guy did it, being so consistently humorous without using any words. All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplin's genius for mime and situation construction. There ARE some words spoken on screen -- this was his last holdout against talking pictures -- but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another. There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics. And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium, a record player, a radio, a television set. Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country, after which he lived in Switzerland. You couldn't tell he was a Commie from this movie. It comments on its time, of course, the Great Depression, and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people. Management is shown as callus, playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line. There is even a communist demonstration. But it's all played for laughs. One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street. Charlie picks up the flag and waves it, shouting after the truck. As he begins to hurry after the truck, still shouting and waving, a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and he's arrested. Poor people steal, but they only steal food. If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist, because that's roughly what the unemployment rate was. ""Modern Times"" is no more communistic than, say, ""My Man Godfrey"" or ""Salt of the Earth"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Besides that, Charlie is no classical Marxist. Marxism posited a transition from ""false consciousness"" (the feeling that one's miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck) to ""class consciousness"" (the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault). Charlie is no activist. He fumbles every job he gets. The other workers are hardly sympathetic. Charlie's not a working class hero but a black sheep. The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and it's hard to imagine that this was accidental.Actually, Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls. His second marriage resulted from a sixteen-year-old girl's (faked) pregnancy. Paulette Goddard, who became his third wife, maybe and maybe not, was twenty when this movie was made, and Charlie was forty-three. In any case -- boy, if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics. A sure-fire winner for the puritans. (It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet O'Hara in ""Gone With the Wind"" because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the time.)I don't want to spell out too many of the gags because I don't want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlie's throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob. Charlie looks as if he's strapped helplessly into his seat, but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself. The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington, New Jersey. When Paulette Goddard first appeared, the man on my right chuckled and said, ""Now that's a good-looking babe."" On my left, my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life.

8.0,Modern Times,"In the 1930s, technology was increasing faster than people could've imagined 30 years ago, and factories were simply becoming normal at this point. The world was moving faster than ever before, and I'm sure the workers at the factories couldn't help but feel like they were being used as just another cog in the machine. ""Productivity"" became more important than the workers well being and big company bosses - as well as the machines themselves - seemed to be controlling the workers. The machines seemed to be taking jobs from the actual human beings and this feeling is perfectly conveyed in Charlie Chaplin's great ""Modern Times"".I don't need to go into an in depth analysis to point out the parts of the film that convey these points but the most impressive aspect of this film is how genuinely funny it manages to be while making this point. From the lunch machine and the Tramp's mental breakdown to the entire jail scene, this is by far the funniest Chaplin movie I've seen yet, and one of the funniest silent films I've seen.Speaking of the lunch machine, the film's main point is perhaps portrayed with more clarity and hilarity in this scene than any other scene in the film, and that point is this: Humans aren't machines, and machines aren't perfect, and neither of those should be treated as such.As well as that bit of commentary it has a sweet story involving a young homeless girl and the Tramp and an optimistic ending in which they literally walk off into the sunset. It may sound trite, but in this story there's no telling if they'll be OK, the important thing is that they believe they will and they shouldn't stop trying, and that seems to be the most important thing to Charlie Chaplin, who seems to convey this message in one way or another in every film he makes.",modern times,1930s technology was increasing faster than people couldve imagined 30 years ago factories were simply becoming normal at this point world was moving faster than ever before im sure workers at factories couldnt help but feel like they were being used as just another cog machine productivity became more important than workers well being big company bosses as well as machines themselves seemed be controlling workers machines seemed be taking jobs actual human beings this feeling is perfectly conveyed charlie chaplins great modern times i dont need go into depth analysis point out parts film that convey these points but most impressive aspect this film is how genuinely funny it manages be while making this point lunch machine tramps mental breakdown entire jail scene this is by far funniest chaplin movie ive seen yet one funniest silent films ive seen speaking lunch machine films main point is perhaps portrayed with more clarity hilarity this scene than any other scene film that point is this humans arent machines machines arent perfect neither those should be treated as such as well as that bit commentary it has sweet story involving young homeless girl tramp optimistic ending which they literally walk off into sunset it may sound trite but this story theres no telling if theyll be ok important thing is that they believe they will they shouldnt stop trying that seems be most important thing charlie chaplin who seems convey this message one way or another every film he makes,0.5663194444444444,0.31380208333333337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,"Hilarious, Thoughtful, & Timeless","A delightful film with one great scene after another, Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" is hilarious, thoughtful, and timeless. Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music, and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings, to create a film that is very pleasing to watch. Chaplin's own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard. And the story itself, filled with twists and turns, is a timeless commentary on ""modern"" life, much of which is applicable to any era.Charlie's ""Tramp"" character joins up in this one with a lively, orphaned gamin (Goddard) to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fast-paced modern life. Most of their adventures are hilarious, but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age. Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survival.The movie has one great scene after another, from some wild sequences in a steel factory, to a set of sometimes breath-taking antics in a deserted department store, to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe, and many others in between. The settings are done with great care and wit, and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at hand.This is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy. Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give ""Modern Times"" a try. This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplin's or any other era.",hilarious thoughtful timeless,delightful film with one great scene after another charlie chaplins modern times is hilarious thoughtful timeless chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use sound effects music added wide variety interesting entertaining settings create film that is very pleasing watch chaplins own fine acting is complemented by delightful charming performance by paulette goddard story itself filled with twists turns is timeless commentary modern life much which is applicable any era charlies tramp character joins up this one with lively orphaned gamin goddard help each other through lengthy series setbacks triumphs that reflect stresses fast paced modern life most their adventures are hilarious but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant any age chaplin goddard make delightful pair who win complete sympathy viewer their fight survival movie has one great scene after another some wild sequences steel factory set sometimes breath taking antics deserted department store incomparable climactic sequence cafe many others between settings are done with great care wit action makes full use props possibilities at hand this is wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy even those who are thoroughly jaded by excesses modern cinema should at least give modern times try this is one great masterpieces chaplins or any other era,0.5680272108843537,0.3765924551638837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.21}"
