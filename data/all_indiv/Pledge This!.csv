1.0,No Rating lower than a one,"I have often used the phrase the worst movie I have ever seen when describing a movie that I did not enjoy. That was until I saw Pledge This. ever since then I have been unable to say worst movie ever because I know that it wasn't as bad as this one. Ill admit I thought I knew what I was getting into when I saw this movie. I knew that it was National Lampoon and how that name no longer means what it did in the 70s and 80s. I knew that it was staring Paris Hilton so that I shouldn't really expect anything majestic. But I thought that it would be a more or less fun 90 minutes if i wanted to watch a simple brainless sex comedy with lots of fart jokes. Boy was I wrong. There is nothing good about this movie. Not the story obviously or the acting. But I was almost stunned to see how bad the rest of the movie was. It was poorly edited, the quality was awful. One whole scene took place in a white room and the walls were so bright that I couldn't even see the characters. (unfortunatly I was still able to hear what was being said.) Now I'm not the type of person to normally go around bashing movies without reason. But I almost feel that I cant review this movie other than to repeat that it was bad bad bad. I planned to end this by saying that you should see it just to put every other movie you ever saw into perspective but I've decided that I couldn't even suggest you do that.",no rating lower than one,i have often used phrase worst movie i have ever seen when describing movie that i did not enjoy that was until i saw pledge this ever since then i have been unable say worst movie ever because i know that it wasnt as bad as this one ill admit i thought i knew what i was getting into when i saw this movie i knew that it was national lampoon how that name no longer means what it did 70s 80s i knew that it was staring paris hilton so that i shouldnt really expect anything majestic but i thought that it would be more or less fun 90 minutes if i wanted watch simple brainless sex comedy with lots fart jokes boy was i wrong there is nothing good about this movie not story obviously or acting but i was almost stunned see how bad rest movie was it was poorly edited quality was awful one whole scene took place white room walls were so bright that i couldnt even see characters unfortunatly i was still able hear what was being said now im not type person normally go around bashing movies without reason but i almost feel that i cant review this movie other than repeat that it was bad bad bad i planned end this by saying that you should see it just put every other movie you ever saw into perspective but ive decided that i couldnt even suggest you do that,0.5548941798941799,-0.2135802469135802,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.25}"
1.0,Absolutely The Worst Film Ever Made in This World,"I thought that Bloodrayne was bad enough. I was wrong. I considered Terminator 3 and Blade 3 to be bad. No, they are really great films in comparison with this scatological, brain-wrenching, gut-tearing, blood-sucking, mind-eating monster of a film. This is not a film, even. There is nothing there - no real script, no good casting, no good music, and finally there is Paris Hilton, an epitome of a bad taste. Man, she doesn't even pretend to play. All she can do, is a set of learned-before poses and smiles, wry and false, as she always was. This is not good, in addition to the ""pleasure"" of watching her legs and body too too much, which is not the most yummy part, either. I cannot even imagine anyone, except for sex-hungry, 12-years boy, or a little, brainless girl of 10, who could watch this abominable terror. Never allow your kids to ever think of going to watch this. Never recommended, to anyone. Rate - 0.

1.0,An ugly-spirited film intended for only the most shallow and stupid viewers.,"Some films get a score of 1 because they are ineptly filmed or the acting is terrible due to incredibly low budgets. Given what they had, they couldn't do much better.. This film, technically speaking, isn't that bad--it looks professional. But, it is also the ugliest and most shallow film I have ever seen without a single thing to recommend it.The film stars Paris Hilton and she also narrates much of the film. The premise is that she's the ultimate hottie and she goes to South Beach to help a sorority become hot enough to win some pointless award. And much of the narration consists of her finding fault with everyone and it abounds with her put-downs, as no one could possibly be ""as hot and sexy"" as her. She forgot to also add ""as narcissistic and pathetic"".Here are a few of the highlights in this uplifting and sublime film: a bathroom where the toilets and sinks become geysers of liquefied human waste and it spews on everyone, an Indian lady who learns about the joys of a vibrator, a lady showing off her horribly scarred breasts following breast surgery, stereotypes as opposed to realistic characters (such as the obligatory fat girl with a suitcase stuffed with snacks and the religious zealot), some anti-lesbian and anti-woman remarks/jokes (I'm not super-sensitive about politically correct stuff and still it clearly offended me to hear women referred to that way), bestiality as well as the crudest language I've ever heard (not funny crude, just classless and crass). Clearly, the film shows all the imagination and grace of a movie written by a 13 year-old--a very nasty and talentless 13 year-old. Currently, this and several other Paris Hilton films are in the hallowed Bottom 100 on IMDb. Considering it consists of Hilton dispensing advice to others on how to be a better person or just her torturing people for fun, I could certainly understand it making the list! It's nasty and cruel--without a hint of grace or cleverness. If you think that Paris does not get enough time in front of the camera and you have absolutely no values (other than to look 'hot'), then this movie is for you. Otherwise, find something else to do...ANYTHING else!",ugly spirited film intended only most shallow stupid viewers,some films get score 1 because they are ineptly filmed or acting is terrible due incredibly low budgets given what they had they couldnt do much better this film technically speaking isnt that bad it looks professional but it is also ugliest most shallow film i have ever seen without single thing recommend it film stars paris hilton she also narrates much film premise is that shes ultimate hottie she goes south beach help sorority become hot enough win some pointless award much narration consists her finding fault with everyone it abounds with her put downs as no one could possibly be as hot sexy as her she forgot also add as narcissistic pathetic here are few highlights this uplifting sublime film bathroom where toilets sinks become geysers liquefied human waste it spews everyone indian lady who learns about joys vibrator lady showing off her horribly scarred breasts following breast surgery stereotypes as opposed realistic characters such as obligatory fat girl with suitcase stuffed with snacks religious zealot some anti lesbian anti woman remarks jokes im not super sensitive about politically correct stuff still it clearly offended me hear women referred that way bestiality as well as crudest language ive ever heard not funny crude just classless crass clearly film shows all imagination grace movie written by 13 year old very nasty talentless 13 year old currently this several other paris hilton films are hallowed bottom 100 imdb considering it consists hilton dispensing advice others how be better person or just her torturing people fun i could certainly understand it making list its nasty cruel without hint grace or cleverness if you think that paris does not get enough time front camera you have absolutely no values other than look hot then this movie is you otherwise find something else do anything else,0.5283456486042691,-0.08489326765188832,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.21}"
,Not hot,"This film is about a sorority president doing whatever it takes to win the hottest sorority contest held by a popular magazine.I purely watched this film to see how bad it is. And I was not disappointed! Everything is bad. All the gross toilet jokes makes it bad, and that scene with breast augmentation scars is simply downright insulting and distasteful. The story is completely ridiculous. What's the worst bit though, is that the film keeps on portraying Paris Hilton as the Goddess that everyone worships. The minor characters says ""Oh my god she is so hot"" once every minute, and Paris Hilton uses every opportunity to degrade and humiliate everyone else to show that she is superior. From the name of her character ""Victoria English"", one can see that she thinks she is Queen Victoria. Oh she's even got a crown on half the time.

1.0,Pathetic!!!!,"Easily the worst film I have seen since little shop of horrors....And what Horrors there were in this film.National Lampoons films up until now had a certain pedigree, they were a bit cheesy but very funny Chevy Chase was always brilliant in them.This was just a pathetic ego booster for Paris Hilton as far as I can see who obviously is believing her own hype.Paris should stick to home made porn and shopping that is all she is good for Her parents must be so proud. I think she is a terrible actress in fact it didn't even seem like she was acting to me it was pathetic.To all of you who watched it just for Paris Hilton and drool over her grow up she is a spoilt slapper who can't act.

If I even stop one person from seeing this film it's been worth while.There is nothing right with this film. The acting is appalling (even Paula Garces whom I normally like) the script seem to have been written by a bunch of pubescent 14 year old boys and in what film EVER have you seen the ""baddie"" given an narrative voice-over??? I watch a LOT of films and as a result of this I get to watch a lot of dross, however I honestly think that this is the worst film I've ever seen. I did not see this film as Paris Hilton was in it in fact I saw it despite the fact her name was on the cover,in fact I thought her name was only on the cover for name value as no-one would be stupid enough to put her in a lead role, but yes they did!

""Fine lets make a movie about your ever-so-fabulous lifestyle"" said the director. That's how ""Pledge This!"" came to be.Never before have so many hot women (not including Paris of course, but that's just my opinion) starred in a more lame movie. Bad excuse for showing off skimpy outfits (that's why I gave it a star) and a wide variety of breasts.

2.0,Don't even bother. It makes you stupid.,"This movie is terrible, in every possible way. Even though I started it with already-low expectations, I was disgusted the entire time by its banality. This movie made me stupid.The acting is terrible, and Paris Hilton's voice-over is annoying at best, and sometimes ambiguous about whose voice-over it actually is. There is barely any continuity between scenes, and major plot points are often introduced but then mysteriously forgotten forever by the next scene. Gags and jokes are lame; every part of the movie seems to be designed specifically to insult your intelligence as a viewer. Worse, the entire movie is based around the idea of the sorority being ""hot"", but there wasn't a single part about it that I found hot. Truly, I don't think there's anything in this movie that anyone but a hotel heiress can relate to.In short, if you think Paris Hilton is beautiful and amazing, then you will love this movie!",dont even bother it makes you stupid,this movie is terrible every possible way even though i started it with already low expectations i was disgusted entire time by its banality this movie made me stupid acting is terrible paris hiltons voice over is annoying at best sometimes ambiguous about whose voice over it actually is there is barely any continuity between scenes major plot points are often introduced but then mysteriously forgotten forever by next scene gags jokes are lame every part movie seems be designed specifically insult your intelligence as viewer worse entire movie is based around idea sorority being hot but there wasnt single part about it that i found hot truly i dont think theres anything this movie that anyone but hotel heiress can relate short if you think paris hilton is beautiful amazing then you will love this movie,0.6351648351648351,-0.10803571428571426,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.23}"
2.0,I Pledge To You: Avoid This,"""Pledge this!"" is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have seen to date. It takes a tired concept and manages to make it worse in every possible way. The acting is horrid, the plot makes absolutely no sense, and the execution is dead on arrival. All this and more spells doom in a project that should have been left on the cutting room floor.It doesn't help that I find Paris Hilton to be extremely annoying and totally unworthy of the screen time she has been given, but to make matters worse, she narrates a movie in which she constantly tries to reaffirm her ""character"" as better than everyone else, but what was vividly clear (at least, in my eyes) is that she is talking about herself as a person, not the character she so poorly portrays.You would figure that someone like Paris would be able to handle playing the spoiled rich girl since the role hits so close to home, but unfortunately, even she seems like she doesn't know what is going on. She appears disoriented and dumbfounded as to what exactly she is doing, as do those surrounding her.This film doesn't have a saving grace. It has nothing to redeem it except for the fact it ends. And the ending is as predictable as anything you will ever find. In a movie where a snobby, rich girl gets all the admiration and respect, one easily expects the ending to knock her down a peg.... and that is exactly what happens. No curveballs here. The screenplay is bland and extremely unoriginal.Every single aspect from beginning to end was both predictable and poorly executed. It is bad enough to make a movie in which nothing new is attempted, but to do what has already been done and do it in a lackluster manner?

1.0,Worse than you can imagine,"OK, I'm really bad at writing reviews but I just have to warn you.This movie has gotten reviews with votes around 8/10, since this is obviously some of the cast members voting I'll just have to make that clear! No-one who isn't past puberty can find this funny, I watched this with 3 of my friends. We all like high school movies (we all go to college), especially when we are hung over from last night which we were when we watched this ""movie"".First we wanted to shut it off and go watch paint dry, but then some randomly placed (very nice) T&A came in to the picture and we decided to continue watching. We didn't understand anything about the plot and if you do, you have probably written the manuscript. There is no logic at all in this movie.This is what I believe that the movie is about: Paris Hilton is the head of some girl sorority, her biggest dream is to be on the cover of FHM (soft-playboy) and now she has her chance. FHM have a competition where the most beautiful sorority gets to be on the cover, awesome! But (oh no) the sorority has to have a nerd girl too so now they have to let in a group of nerd-girls in the sorority.Actually the only thing that kept us watching was that every time one of us started to complain about how bad this movie was one of the girls in movie showed her titties. Kudos to the director who actually saw when the movie sucked so bad that titties was the only thing that could save the movie. There are a LOT of randomly placed tittie-scenes which have nothing to do with the ""plot"" in this movie. And they're needed.This movie has no logic, actually not even scenes that fit together, it is for no one that isn't IN puberty, the few laughs you'll get is when the movie makes so little sense that it's actually funny. The girls in this movie are very nice tough, but they don't manage to make it watchable.Unless if you really-really like tits, then maybe this movie can make you not vomit.

3.0,What happened to National Lampoon?,"I have to admit that I rented this movie because Paris Hilton was in it. Now that that's outta the way, the second reason was because it was National Lampoon's. We're talking about the same people that brought us Van Wilder, Animal House and the Vacation series!!! With that said, after the movie was over, I asked myself, ""And why was the name National Lampoon's"" on this???? I have to admit that I didn't care too much for the Dorm Days series, either, and was even whispering then.......What happened to National Lampoon's??? Anyway, I have seen quite a few Paris Hilton films and enjoyed them all, and to be honest, I didn't think she did a bad job here guys. I've seen her do worse, like her performance in Bottom's Up with Jason Mewes. It almost appeared as if she didn't really want to do that movie, as she was not making an effort to making her character believable. As for the rest of Pledge This? The movie was filled with extremely lame punchlines and a predictable outcome. I watched the Special Features, and one of the actors, I believe it was, actually called it a great script! You could have put, I don't know, Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid in this movie and it still wouldn't have been a great script!

2.0,Victoria's Secret,"Pretty blonde Paris Hilton (as Victoria English) runs the sexy South Beach sorority ""Gamma Gamma"". In order to win FHM magazine's coveted ""Hottest Sorority"" contest, Ms. Hilton decides to diversify the wealthy, blonde sorority set by accepting ethnic, ugly, fat, and otherwise non-blonde pledges. Beautiful dark-haired rival Paula Garcés (as Gloria) makes trouble for Hilton and orally fixed boyfriend Simon Rex (as Derek). Hilton's dog chows down! The flesh is fleeting, and Hilton shows little. Fortunately, some of the other women aren't as shy. A good example of the humor is when a toilet reverse backs-up all over the screen. Worst of all, Hilton as ""Victoria"" has a skeleton in her closet - she was an ugly child. (Choke!) Will this dark secret ruin her chances to win the ""Hottest Sorority in the Country"" contest? It's nice to see performers like Mr. Rex and Alexis Thorpe (as Morgan); but, the material is not very good. So, you may want to park your car in another garage.

1.0,Might be useful on long haul flights when you need to slip into a coma for a few hours.,"This isn't a movie as such, more of an extended filming of ""I am Paris Hilton and I must be idolized"". Or soft porn for the brain dead. Wafer thin plot has something to do with a bunch of sorority girls trying to be on the cover of FHM magazine. The only attempts to advance the plot are in the form of voice-overs whenever she's on screen. Seems like weaving a story into the script was too difficult for the writers, and it's not even her voice you hear. No likable characters either. At one time a toilet explodes and covers all the girls in crap, but an old lady gets covered too, so the girls all laugh despite being covered themselves.

1.0,Somebody please make it stop,"This is a real story. This morning I finished my night ship at work, got into the car and drove home. On my way I got a message from one of my coworkers, who seemed really stressed and wanted me to get back to him as soon as possible.A few minutes later I got home, and called him back after parking. He said that there's a woman there who claims I trashed one of her car doors while leaving the parking lot. That was strange to me, since I didn't hit anything and my car was perfectly clean and whole. Later today I realized that the woman was trying to get other people to pay her for a new door, by parking next to them and then blaming them for hitting her car, while it was actually hit from before. I called my agency and it took them a while to calm me down. Eventually I did, but my day was ruined.And then, this evening, I saw Pledge This!, and realized my day wasn't entirely lost until that point, which made it the worst day in my life.(A stupid girl): ""Whoa, that dress must have cost hundreds of dollars!"" (Another stupid girl): ""You mean thousands."" (A stupid girl): ""Thousands of dollars?"" (Another stupid girl): ""Hundreds of thousands."" (A stupid girl): ""Thousands of thousands.

2.0,"cringe worthy all the way, inconsistent second half.","This film so weird, it doesn't really make sense. The concept is simple enough, a bunch of social outcasts girls get bullied by the hot rich girls, social outcasts become friends and plot vengeance, hot girls organize big party, social outcasts take revenge by showing everyone films of hot girls in embarrassing situations, everyone (except hot girls) get what they want, end of story. For some reason, the film makers have failed to make this very simple concept work. The problem lies in two things, one, the narrator, why a brain dead film like this even needs a narrator is beyond me but anyway. The narrator is no one but the obviously evil queen hot chick and the narration is right along the lines of her stuck up personality. Essentially, having a jerk be the narrator doesn't work.The second problem is that the movie, or at least the first half of it, is filled with jokes that are not only childish and unfunny, they are also very strangely executed and really rather haphazard. Combined these two things make the first half of the movie veeeeery cringe worthy. The second half of the movie is also cringe worthy, but what stands out is that it is very inconsistent, it feels like he movie makers forgot to record several scenes and just skip straight to the end.

The only scene that got a reaction out of me was seeing the scars from the one chicks plastic surgery. It brought nothing new to the table and I am shocked national lampoons would even put their name on this garbage. Paris needs to stick to doing what she does best. Nothing!

Only reason - They knew the movie was weak and having a known celeb exposed, it may have drawn a bigger crowd (At least they hoped so). Why would she hesitate at doing this? Her claim to fame is her sex tape (1 Night in Paris) and flashing her crotch and breasts in public.
