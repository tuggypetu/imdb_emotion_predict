10.0,A movie with full of memes and catchy dialogues,"Hera pheri is one of my all time favourite comedy movie, all the characters and their dialogues are still remembered especially Paresh Rawal's role Baburao Ganpatrao Apte (one of the most highlighted characters of the movie) and the dialogues are really catchy ""Khopdi tor saale ka"", Kutria saala dekh ke number dial kar"", ""Aurat ka chakkar Babubhaiya"", ""Yeh Baburao ka style hai"" ""Khadak Singh ke kharak ne se"", ""Kabira speaking"" and many more. Akshay Kumar is great, Sunil Shetty is also great and Paresh Rawal steals the show and the rest of the supporting casts are good too.

8.0,The nostalgia,"Look, I am a simple man. I see Akshay Kumar in a 2000s Bollywood comedy film, I watch it. And I'd blame this film for my obsession. And I'm like 99% sure I'm not the only one who thinks that way. Hera Pheri was something completely new for its time. Bollywood comedy-of-errors were not very common back in the days. And even if they were they'd rarely be good. So rare that we can practically name them (let's try - Golmaal, Andaz Apna Apna. That's it, I did it).Hera Pheri comes from a time when we were not used to this kind of a humour. After a complete decade of mindless slapsticks by Govinda, this seemed like something that was completely driven by the comic timing, phenomenal acting, the setting and the story. If any of these elements was missing this film would have also crumbled down like the later comedy movies of Akshay Kumar. What exactly makes this film special are the characters, their relatable behaviour and the situation they got in.Raju, Shyam and Baburao have now become household names. The character of Kabira has also become something staple with bad guys on phones. Amrish Puri chasing Shyam for returning his money so that he could have his sister's wedding was a very well done runnig joke. And finally the ending scene was also very satisfying. Overall there was a great performance by all the actors.I think I have heard this movie is going to get a third part with John Abraham. I'd absolutely not want that. Replacing Akshay Kumar with John Abraham will surely ruin the franchise (like Welcome and Welcome Back). I'd prefer that both of them should stay, if the planned sequel is actually very good. But otherwise a duology is perfect.",nostalgia,look i am simple man i see akshay kumar 2000s bollywood comedy film i watch it id blame this film my obsession im like 99 sure im not only one who thinks that way hera pheri was something completely new its time bollywood comedy errors were not very common back days even if they were theyd rarely be good so rare that we can practically name them lets try golmaal andaz apna apna thats it i did it hera pheri comes time when we were not used this kind humour after complete decade mindless slapsticks by govinda this seemed like something that was completely driven by comic timing phenomenal acting setting story if any these elements was missing this film would have also crumbled down like later comedy movies akshay kumar what exactly makes this film special are characters their relatable behaviour situation they got raju shyam baburao have now become household names character kabira has also become something staple with bad guys phones amrish puri chasing shyam returning his money so that he could have his sisters wedding was very well done runnig joke finally ending scene was also very satisfying overall there was great performance by all actors i think i have heard this movie is going get third part with john abraham id absolutely not want that replacing akshay kumar with john abraham will surely ruin franchise like welcome welcome back id prefer that both them should stay if planned sequel is actually very good but otherwise duology is perfect,0.5420901647372237,0.24156869274516335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,the best comedy i have seen in my life and i have seen many,"Hera Pheri is a film set in Mumbai and is not your run of the mill slapstick comedy that directors like David Dhawan indulge in. The movie is directed by Priyadarshan who proved that after making such wonderful and serious film like Virasat, he can also direct a comedy with élan.This film is a comedy of error. Set in a Mumbai slum where our three protagonists dwell, the movie depicts the hilarious moments created by the simplicity and/or stupidity of the characters. The look of the film is that of an art film. By the look of it, it seems as if it is going to be a really serious movie but it turns out to be one roller-coaster ride of laughter. The cast of the film includes Sunil Shetty who plays an unemployed guy who comes to Mumbai looking for work and a place to live. He lands up at the house of a simple man played deftly by Paresh Rawal who takes Sunil in. However, there is another person living in the house, namely Raju. Played by Akshay Kumar, Raju is the mischief monger and good for nothing. He keeps on getting jobs and losing them quickly. The story is taken forward by a phone call by the gangster Kabira who keeps on saying that he has kidnapped his grand daughter (sunil takes the call) and wants ransom. This call kickstarts a mayhem. Which ultimately leads us to the climax of the film where the protagonists end up becoming millionaires. Each and every member of the cast is brilliant in the performance of their roles. Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar's careers were in doldrums when this film released and both of them gave a stunning performance. Especially Akshay Kumar shows impeccable comic timing. Akshay Kumar is considered of the best comic actors of Bollywood these days after performing comic roles in films like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Khakee, Aawara Paagal Deewana and Waqt. However, the show stealer is none other that the unbelievable Paresh Rawal who plays Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. He is an absolute delight to watch. It will be an understatement to say that he completely overshadows the rest of the actors with his marvellous portrayal of a poor Mumbaiyya simpleton. This film changed the course of his career and he is now reckoned as a character actor who adds to the star value of a film. The music is not that good though. The song ""Main Ladka Pom Pom"" is hilarious though. The picturization keeps you in splits even though the song is irritating if you only listen to the audio. The real hero of the film is the dialogue writer Neeraj Vohra who comes up with some never before heard one liners. Anyone who wants another example of his great work must watch Aawara Paagal Deewana. In short, a film for every comedy lover. Some clean entertainment. Moreover, I can confidently say that this is the best comedy film i have seen in my life.

10.0,A light comedy everyone will enjoy,"I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve. One tip though, don't think too much about the logic of the story or the probability. Just turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy. You'll find yourself cracking up every time you think of ""Kabira speaking"". Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.",light comedy everyone will enjoy,i never expected much this movie because cast fading sunil shetty sabseboringkhiladi monkeyboy akki serious tabu only hope i had was paresh rawal after seeing him hilarious andaz apna apna highly recommended he was be taken notice so when i did watch it i was shocked say least i found hera pheri be one best comedies decade just forget about cheap attempts david dhawan called comedy this is real deal story is simple as is with many good movies 3 protagonists shyam sunil shetty raju akshay kumar babu rao paresh rawal are all dire need money shyam needs it pay back old friend om puri so he can get his as puris sister married raju needs it his mother babu rao pay back loans his father took when local rich mans grand daughter gets kidnapped by dangerous gangster kabira gulshan grover calls babu raos number by mistake raju sees end all their problems he suggests they play game do some hera pheri movie is off take you awesome ride performances by far surprised me sunil shetty i never liked but his performance as somewhat naive do gooder was wonderful akki ape also surprised me his sense comedic timing but paresh was biggest surprise even though he was my only hope this movie he came out ten times better than i expected he deserved best comedian filmfare award that he did receive 2000 tabu anu as another person need money who fights with shyam job is also competent it is small role but as always she leaves her mark asrani tiny role also gives some laughs om puri was also excellent his small role so bravo priyadarshan saheb once again youve shown that you are unique intelligent filmmaker with lot tricks up your sleeve one tip though dont think too much about logic story or probability just turn off your brain few hours enjoy youll find yourself cracking up every time you think kabira speaking watch movie youll know what i mean,0.5753745039682538,0.1825868055555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.28}"

7.0,"Funniest Movie Atter ""Padosan""","A movie is funny, when you can laugh at Om Puri. In fact he brings more laughs than the main characters. I could easily compare him to Robert De Nero, who excelled in ""Analyze Me"" and he never envisioned himself as a funny actor. The script is superb and the laughter is infectious with the venerable master of comedy, Paresh Rawal, at the helm. Akshay Kumar, who is other wise pathetic in serious roles, makes a good team with the muscle man Shetty, whose acting skills, are in the same range as Kumar's! After ""Padosan"" there has been some sprinkling of comedy, more like buffoonery, with the likes of Aaamir Khan, Johnny Lever and Shakti Kapoor, whose comedy interludes appeal to the ""sophisticated front bencher's"" who like fart jokes and toilet humor and Anti-Indian and demeaning humor produced by the ""Benchods of Bollywood"" as in films like ""Three Idiots"", ""Delhi Belly"" etc. The front benchers like filth since they live in the slums and this is the best they have seen in their life. They worship these ""Monkey's of Mumbai"" the Midget, The Ugly and The Apeman, since they are promoted by the ""Media Maggots of Mumbai"" who give glorious reviews for the price of banana thrown at them time to time. The comedy was generally demeaning, cheap and vulgar. But the audience had to put up with this, since there was no alternative, and they were not to blame since the scribes were not funny in the first place. The scene is changing with the script-writers and director the caliber of Priyadarshan. This is one funny movie that has opened the flood-gate for movies like ""Mallammal Weekly"" and others.",funniest movie atter padosan,movie is funny when you can laugh at om puri fact he brings more laughs than main characters i could easily compare him robert de nero who excelled analyze me he never envisioned himself as funny actor script is superb laughter is infectious with venerable master comedy paresh rawal at helm akshay kumar who is other wise pathetic serious roles makes good team with muscle man shetty whose acting skills are same range as kumars after padosan there has been some sprinkling comedy more like buffoonery with likes aaamir khan johnny lever shakti kapoor whose comedy interludes appeal sophisticated front benchers who like fart jokes toilet humor anti indian demeaning humor produced by benchods bollywood as films like three idiots delhi belly etc front benchers like filth since they live slums this is best they have seen their life they worship these monkeys mumbai midget ugly apeman since they are promoted by media maggots mumbai who give glorious reviews price banana thrown at them time time comedy was generally demeaning cheap vulgar but audience had put up with this since there was no alternative they were not blame since scribes were not funny first place scene is changing with script writers director caliber priyadarshan this is one funny movie that has opened flood gate movies like mallammal weekly others,0.6246913580246913,0.13221099887766552,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Great Comedy Film,"This along with Andaz Apna Apna are my most favorite Bollywood Comedy Movies. Every time I watch Heara Pheri I just can't stop laughing. The first time I watched it I couldn't sleep most of that night because I just continued to laugh on my bed.10 on 10 for me. Although I enjoyed other comedy movies of Priyadarshan like Hungama, Hulchul & Garam Masala and thought those were no less than Hera Pheri, but later when I watched those again they were not so funny as Hera Pheri. Akshay Kumar's acting was great but Paresh Rawal with his character Babu Rao is the one who steals the show, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Om Puri also played their parts well.Hera Pheri I believe is a milestone in Bollywood because it showed that you don't always need a emotional romantic/patriotic movie to produce a Hit Movie. This movie started a much needed trend of Bollywood Comedies that relied more on stories, errors and confusions for its fun element breaking away from those cliché slapstick comedies of David Dhawan starring Govinda. However the sequel to this movie Phir Hera Pheri I must say was disappointing, the first half was OK but the second half was really poor especially the circus scenes. That movie I guess lacked the Priyadarshan touch . Anyways there are talks about a third version of Hera Pheri and that I hope will be as funny as this one.BTW this movie is a remake of a Southern Movie...So those who have a problem with remakes and also those who lack a Sense of Humor should stay away.",great comedy film,this along with andaz apna apna are my most favorite bollywood comedy movies every time i watch heara pheri i just cant stop laughing first time i watched it i couldnt sleep most that night because i just continued laugh my bed 10 10 me although i enjoyed other comedy movies priyadarshan like hungama hulchul garam masala thought those were no less than hera pheri but later when i watched those again they were not so funny as hera pheri akshay kumars acting was great but paresh rawal with his character babu rao is one who steals show sunil shetty tabu om puri also played their parts well hera pheri i believe is milestone bollywood because it showed that you dont always need emotional romantic patriotic movie produce hit movie this movie started much needed trend bollywood comedies that relied more stories errors confusions its fun element breaking away those clich slapstick comedies david dhawan starring govinda however sequel this movie phir hera pheri i must say was disappointing first half was ok but second half was really poor especially circus scenes that movie i guess lacked priyadarshan touch anyways there are talks about third version hera pheri that i hope will be as funny as this one btw this movie is remake southern movie so those who have problem with remakes also those who lack sense humor should stay away,0.4341954022988505,0.1732758620689655,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.14}"
