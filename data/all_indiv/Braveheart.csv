10.0,"""Every man dies, not every man really lives.""","The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.",every man dies not every man really lives,academy award winning war epic braveheart is extraordinary film that set new bar genre story follows scottish peasant named william wallace whos pushed into leading rebellion against tyranny english rule when his wife is murdered starring mel gibson patrick mcgoohan sophie marceau brendan gleeson film has strong cast that delivers outstanding performances additionally battle sequences are remarkably gritty violent which adds authentic tone film composer james horner provides sweeping majestic score thats incredibly powerful groundbreaking film braveheart does exceptional job at depicting both valor horror war,0.6856060606060607,0.22074592074592075,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,It's a Masterpiece. Best Movie of All Time,"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.Telling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.Although its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.On this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.Without trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.James Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.There isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.This is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.The final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.In addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.When you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.This movie is a masterpiece.",its masterpiece best movie all time,braveheart is best movie ever made history absolute sculpted work art that depicts every emotion human existence suffering courage love front background political astuteness socio hierarchal analysis telling quasi true story one mans conviction courage exact vengeance killing his first wife father at hands ruthless king edward ii england who turn inspires his small province scotland rebel go war real fight freedom independence braveheart is stunning depiction capacity human spirit overcome odds defy tyranny achieve justice respect dignity against oppression although its retractors critics will dwell harp historical accuracy some movie particularly what part robert bruce played real life there is no denying true power emotional influence this movie its understandable particularly europeans how this could be problematic due their upbringing studying history but movie is not really about being historically perfect its work art about things much deeper documentary it is not its duplistic hypocritical films haters dwell this minor detail but perhaps allow historical rewriting slide give it free pass something like tarantinos inglourious basterds or once upon time hollywood this topic one dozens best parts movie is when robert bruce plays important role one battles eventually movie does come around get roberts history back track with more accuracy as his part character battle scotlands independence without trying get history perfect this movie is simply flawless its beyond flawless really flawless movie can just be technical masterpiece with very little power but raw power emotion coming off screen practically every single scene braveheart is like inferno james horners score is one greatest scores ever any movie it successfully enhances drama emotion each scene without coming across as manipulative it fits perfectly into every single scene it is used there isnt one acting role that is not well done this is one gibsons best acting roles guy who plays edward ii gives outstanding performance this is greatest epic movie ever created history hollywood few years later another great modern epic gladiator came out drew rightful comparisons braveheart but while gladiator is very good movie it lacks emotional depth power ultimate inspiration behind experience watching braveheart final act braveheart is one most powerful ever put film as first time viewer you really have no idea where story is going go even as repeat viewer it still holds weight this day there is still nothing like it just when you think its over or you know how it will end it just continues twist turn then it closes with what is probably best ending any movie history addition all this body braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes incredible editing great dialogue rooted inspiration political strategy philosophy stunning human experience love desire passion suffering identity when you look at top rated movies imdb it is laughable that comic book movies good popcorn fun movies are actually rated above this this is without doubt hands down one top 25 movies ever made my opinion it is best movie all time this movie is masterpiece,0.4971625867357575,0.30848050492867574,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,Stirring drama with a romantic soul,"Everyone knows the film has historical inaccuracies, but that's not the point. This is a grand romantic vision of the fight for freedom and casting off the yoke of oppression. James Horner's wonderfully moving, romantic score adds tremendously to the film. The most moving scenes for me are the interactions with the women whom Wallace loved, starting with a wonderful scene of the young Murron (the expression on the face of the little girl playing her is movie perfection) presenting him with a flower at his father's funeral, and moving on to their adult courtship and far too brief marriage, and ending with his interaction with the exquisitely beautiful Sophie Marceau as Isabelle. It's the stuff that movie dreams are make of. Unfortunately, it appears that Hollywood is no longer interested in depicting men and women interacting with each other this way.

10.0,One of the best modern movies of time,"I'm talking just in the 90's. The 90's were a great time for the movies, we had so many memorable one's and there is no doubt that ""Braveheart"" is one of them. ""Braveheart"" is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. Despite it's long running time, I will watch this movie any day.Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history, anyone can enjoy ""Braveheart"". Based on the life story of William Wallace, a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England, Longshanks, is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"", he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love, he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it. ""What will you do without freedom?!"", this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the British. Through countless battles, friends, traitors, and bloodshed, all Wallace just wishes for is freedom. As Robert the Bruce says to his father ""They look at him and fight by his side."" He describes Wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. I love Robert's last line ""You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track, it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie, a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.10/10",one best modern movies time,im talking just 90s 90s were great time movies we had so many memorable ones there is no doubt that braveheart is one them braveheart is one my favorite movies that never gets old despite its long running time i will watch this movie any day mel gibson has come so far movie business he not only stars but directed braveheart he did terrific job deserves lot credit this remarkable film despite it not being totally accurate with history anyone can enjoy braveheart based life story william wallace town peasant who just wants live peace harmony with wife children but when british king england longshanks is sick scotland being full scots he comes up with way bringing them more into british land by breeding them out promising any british soldier scotish bride her wedding night before her husband can have her wallace wont hear it marries his love secret when british soldier notices his wife attempts rape her wallace comes saves her causing riot their village he thinks hes got her safe when he sends her away soldiers but they catch her kill her right front her family wallace has had it wants war not only murder his wife love he wants freedom scotland will shed blood do it what will you do without freedom this is one most memorable speeches all cinematic history during their first major battle with british through countless battles friends traitors bloodshed all wallace just wishes is freedom as robert bruce says his father they look at him fight by his side he describes wallaces bravery what everyone feels wanting be him i love roberts last line you have bled with wallace now bleed with me army stands continues their struggling battles freedom this is such inspirational movie with powerful message every man dies but not every man really lives tearful ending that will make anyone shed tear terrific heartfelt sound track its no wonder this won best picture with other oscars this is movie terrific one that everyone should enjoy watch 10 10,0.5279075091575092,0.23356331168831174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Great movie!!!!,"The story of William Wallace, who led the Scots in a struggle for freedom from England's brutal rule, ""Braveheart"" evokes old-fashioned movie epics. Mr. Gibson's stroke of brilliance is to revel in those epic qualities -- tragic romance and unbounded heroism, gorgeous photography and a cast of thousands --and add a swift contemporary kick. ""Braveheart"" is also an explosive action movie. The logical comparison is not with the pallid ""Rob Roy"" but with a ""Die Hard"" film. The medieval Scots use spears, swords, axes and giant rocks, and they use them with a vengeance.They get quite bloody in the process, too. At the start of the film, the child William (sweetly played by James Robinson, who looks remarkably like Mr. Gibson) wanders into a hut where his clansmen have gone to make peace with the English. The boy sees their bodies hanging from the rafters, establishing right away that this movie is about a savage time.Despite that, the early episodes are more lyrical than brutal. Wallace is sent abroad to be educated, returns as Mel Gibson and falls in love with a beautiful woman named Murron (Catherine McCormack). Wallace and Murron are married in secret to elude an English law allowing a nobleman to rape a Scottish bride on her wedding night. The romantic marriage ceremony, at night in a clearing in the woods, is so evocative of ""Romeo and Juliet"" that there must be trouble ahead.",great movie,story william wallace who led scots struggle freedom englands brutal rule braveheart evokes old fashioned movie epics mr gibsons stroke brilliance is revel those epic qualities tragic romance unbounded heroism gorgeous photography cast thousands add swift contemporary kick braveheart is also explosive action movie logical comparison is not with pallid rob roy but with die hard film medieval scots use spears swords axes giant rocks they use them with vengeance they get quite bloody process too at start film child william sweetly played by james robinson who looks remarkably like mr gibson wanders into hut where his clansmen have gone make peace with english boy sees their bodies hanging rafters establishing right away that this movie is about savage time despite that early episodes are more lyrical than brutal wallace is sent abroad be educated returns as mel gibson falls love with beautiful woman named murron catherine mccormack wallace murron are married secret elude english law allowing nobleman rape scottish bride her wedding night romantic marriage ceremony at night clearing woods is so evocative romeo juliet that there must be trouble ahead,0.5164462081128748,0.05965608465608465,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,"A Memorable, Powerful, Oscar Winner!","An incredibly interesting story and many moments of rich dialogue Braveheart was film that not only kept you entertained but kept you feeling for the characters (This is mainly due to the directing and acting from Mel Gibson). The film really showed the true evil and good of the world (Which some films of good vs. Bad struggle to do). I don't think they ported the battles or William Wallace very well (It wasn't historically accurate). I think their use of humor in some scenes just felt out of place and while many people are against violence in movies I think for this film they easily could've had more to emphasize the brutality of the story. The score was fantastic one of the best I've heard it was fitting to the film it had a calming, Celtic and warming film yet you knew it was brutal. Hearing the score in my opinion was like looking at a battlefield after the battle it's quiet and its peaceful yet you know what really happened there.

9.0,"Brutal, But Epic Masterpiece","This is an emotional, involving and ultimately draining film. By the time you are done, you are spent. What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story, great cinematography, excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film.Patrick McGoohan shines as the evil English king and Sophie Marceau, Agnus McFadyen and Catherine McCormack all contribute. I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's ""army"" are fun to watch, too.For those a bit queasy with bloody violence, this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fast-forward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the three-hour film, an ""epic"" adventure, if there ever was one.The most memorable scene in the film, for me, was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to, although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story.

10.0,Historical war par excellence,"One of the early ""historical epics"" to set off a still-current wave of ancient adventures, this is epic, grand stuff spoiled only slightly by a twinge of Hollywoodian uneasiness and a little overloading of sentimentality. It isn't as bad as in something like, say, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES but it isn't mastered to the extent it was in GLADIATOR either. Although history is sometimes rewritten and distinctions are blurred, this is a moving masterpiece with a sweeping score and splendid visuals to boot.War is hell here, literally; bloody and violent, with limbs flying and bodies torn asunder. Yet for a film chock full of gruesome violence and obscene torture, it's remarkably good-natured, focusing on the characters foremost and being successful with it. Gibson is fine in the leading role – if a little too old – and the supporting cast are great. The plot is complex and wide-reaching and the characterisations and script are both spot on.

10.0,"""Every man dies. Not every man really lives.""","This movie is almost two decades old now and as is often the case with blockbuster films, I'm just now getting around to seeing it for the first time. My timing is kind of serendipitous too because Scotland will be voting on leaving the UK next week on September 18th, 2014 as I write this. It's pretty much a toss-up on how it goes, though whatever the outcome, the geopolitical consequences will be felt for a long time.Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner are a couple of names who frequently find themselves involved in controversy for their projects. In recent years, Gibson has been at the center of some embarrassing personal exploits, but there's no denying he's had a major impact on film making with movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"". Both films offer an epic sweep and are cinematically dynamic. The battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" are among the most expansive and realistic as you'll see anywhere.But as with most historical films, and I've learned this all too well by now, what you see is not necessarily what the world got at the time. I don't think such departures from accuracy are always meant to be made for the sake of revisionism, nevertheless they detract from a film's educational value. So one's approach to ""Braveheart"" probably ought to be made from the standpoint of an epic period drama with it's attendant personal stories thrown in as human interest. That's what you have here with this Best Picture winner and the award is well deserved on that score. Personally, I have my doubts whether the Scots ever mooned the British at the Battle of Stirling.",every man dies not every man really lives,this movie is almost two decades old now as is often case with blockbuster films im just now getting around seeing it first time my timing is kind serendipitous too because scotland will be voting leaving uk next week september 18th 2014 as i write this its pretty much toss up how it goes though whatever outcome geopolitical consequences will be felt long time mel gibson kevin costner are couple names who frequently find themselves involved controversy their projects recent years gibson has been at center some embarrassing personal exploits but theres no denying hes had major impact film making with movies like braveheart passion christ both films offer epic sweep are cinematically dynamic battle scenes braveheart are among most expansive realistic as youll see anywhere but as with most historical films ive learned this all too well by now what you see is not necessarily what world got at time i dont think such departures accuracy are always meant be made sake revisionism nevertheless they detract films educational value so ones approach braveheart probably ought be made standpoint epic period drama with its attendant personal stories thrown as human interest thats what you have here with this best picture winner award is well deserved that score personally i have my doubts whether scots ever mooned british at battle stirling,0.34942528735632195,0.1527298850574713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,For he had only one life to give for Scotland.,"On my list of the greatest movies of all time, BraveHeart ranks as number 3. It is by far one of the most epic stories ever told. Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he recieved and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on. The only part that lacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace. It historically never happened. This movie also has other historical errors but WHO CARES!The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage ever shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling. He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.

9.0,A motion picture that dares to be excessive...,"Set in the late 13th century, 'Braveheart' is the story of one of Scotland's greatest national heroes Sir William Wallace. leader of the Scottish resistance forces during the first years of the long, ultimately successful struggle to free Scotland from English rule...Crucially charismatic in the title role, Gibson plays the heroic figure and emerges as a remarkable hero with wit and romantic soul, determined to rid his country of its English oppressors...Wallace's revolution was set in motion, with great obstacles from his countrymen... Many Scottish nobles lent him only grudging support as most of them were more concerned with wealth and titles than the freedom of the country... In fact, the Scottish leaders are in favor of revolt-or not-depending on English bribes... Wallace, by comparison, is a man of honor, incorruptible and righteous... He was knighted and proclaimed 'guardian and high protector of Scotland,' but as much as he railed against the Scottish nobles, submitted to Edward I, King of England, he was astonished and in shock to discover the treachery of the leading Scot contender for the throneRobert, the Earl of Bruceto whom he confided , 'The people would follow you, if you would only lead them.' Sophie Marceau is exquisite as the distressed princess Isabella of France who ends up falling in love with Wallace, warning him out of several traps...Catherine McCormack is a stunning beauty who ignites Wallace's revolution...Patrick McGoohan is chilling, brutal, and vicious as the ruthless Edward I, known by the nickname 'Longshanks.' This king remains simply the embodiment of evil...While Angus McFadyen moves as a nobleman torn between his conscience and political aspiration, and Brendan Gleeson brings strength and humor to his role as the robust Hamish, David O'Hara is very effective as the crazy Irishman who provides much of the film's comic relief from even the most tensed moments...Mel Gibson has reason to be proud of 'Braveheart.' It is a motion picture that dares to be excessive... Gibson presents passionately the most spaciously impressive battles (yet staged for films) even excessively, and it is his passion and excess that make the motion picture great... The horror and futility of massed hand-to-hand combats are exciting rather repulsive... It is epic film-making at its glorious best...Gibson's 'Braveheart' focuses on the human side of Wallace, a character so immense, so intelligent, and so passionate, exploring the definitions of honor and nobility, pushing us to follow the hero into his struggle against injustice and oppression...There is a great shot of the lovely mountains of Scotland covered in mist with beautiful bagpipe music...

10.0,"Historical flaws aside, Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.","So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace, and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times, he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.Patrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks, King Edward I, and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.So yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10",historical flaws aside braveheart is rousing spectacle,so it comes pass year 1995 not year our lord i think that mel gibson would craft award winning epic that is braveheart film that is historically bent extreme that is directed by man who would go have less than favourable character reputation film that has heavy handed approach at times its also as choppy as boat ride during tidal wave so yes braveheart is far flawless folks yet structure epic emotional swirls sheer spectacle it all marks it out as rousing treat its lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out place year it was made perhaps secret films success is because 90s were crying out epic get us hankering back those halcyon days spartacus et al or just maybe film punched buttons public psyche because it is great grand thing see little people rise up kick some ass oppressed bullied strike back as it were surely that theme works normal human being its sweeping tale that involves love loyalty honour dishonour treachery death heroes villains short it ticks all boxes genre it sits clinical bloody battles superbly full gibson is william wallace although he may struggle nail scottish accent fully convince at times he more than makes up it with his verve vigour when delivering his lines with sons scotland speech at stirling particular iconic highlight patrick mcgoohan is pure egotistical villainy as longshanks king edward i supporting cast also do sterling work or should that be stirling brendan gleeson tommy flanagan catherine mccormack angus macfadyen wonderful james cosmo all add flavour delightful scotch broth screen score by james horner is appropriately tight themes at work piece cinematography by john toll was rightly awarded at oscar time since he captured essence film be it lush rolling hills or blood stained field aftermath battle tolls work is critically sync with unfolding mood picture so yes damn straight flaws all pic has ability lift inspire many discerning viewer it does kick you at times but as it does so it also emotionally engages you start finish which film deserves every accolade award that it won because grandiose epic had seemed long gone but gibson his army brought it back modern era made genre piece fit hold its head up high with greats years gone by 10 10,0.49071123321123306,0.15613324175824175,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Epic recreation about a notorious Scottish hero who purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward I,"In 14th Century Scotland, when his secret bride is executed for assaulting an English soldier who tried to rape her, William Wallace begins a revolt and leads Scottish warriors against the cruel English tyrant , the nasty ruler Edward I (Patrick McGoohan)the Longshanks (as he was called ""The Longshanks"" -long legs- since he was uncommonly tall for a man of the time , Edward I was at least 6 feet, 2 inches) who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself , ruling Scotland with an iron fist and succeeded his effeminate homosexual son Edward II Prince Edward (he was indeed the first English prince to carry the title Prince of Wales, although he did not marry Princess Isabella until 1308, after both Wallace (1305) and Edward I (1307) had died) . As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling , York (though the sacking of York was invented for the movie ,Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England) and the famous Battle of Falkirk (July 22, 1298), in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I, who decisively defeated the Scots , the real-life King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce , though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden) , who is considered a National Hero of Scotland . This epic movie contains thrills , emotion ,romance , breathtaking battles and being based on historical events . However , some reviewers often cited as the least accurate historical epic of all time and more than 90% of the movie is fiction. This is the classic story about confrontation between good guys , the Scots , versus bad guys , the Sassenachs . A simplistic and pure tale with rude stereotypes and offering a stew of Hollywood clichés , being overlong but well played and directed by Mel Gibson . Interesting script by Randall Wallace , this screen-writer had been visiting Edinburgh in 1983 to learn about his heritage when he came across a statue of William Wallace outside Edinburgh Castle; he had never heard of the 14th-century figure who shared his name but was intrigued enough by the stories told to him about ""Scotland's greatest hero"" to research the story as much as possible. The film was heavily fictitious but Gibson claimed the changes had been made for dramatic purposes , he also admitted he had always felt he was at least a decade too old to play Wallace. Impressive production design , including thousands of extras , a majority of the actors and extras in this film were actually Irish - members of the Irish Army - although they are supposed to be Scottish or English, as many as 1600 were used on a given day. The film is very crude and brutal , including bloody battles , strong tortures with disembowelment provoking brave grimace and violent scenes as when Edward I threw his son's lover out of a castle window was particularly criticized for inciting homophobia , the lover was based on Piers Gaveston, who was allegedly Edward II's lover. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by John Toll , showing marvelous outdoors , including glamorous opening shots , snowy peaks , silvery lochs , dark mists and many other things . Evocative and sensitive musical score by James Horner ; despite the film being set in Scotland, and based on the life of a Scottish folk hero, the primary instrument heard throughout the soundtrack -most notably at William's father's funeral- are the Uilleann pipes, which are a smaller traditionally Irish version of bagpipes rather than the ubiquitous Great Highland Bagpipe.This motion picture was very well directed by Mel Gibson and he picked up two Oscars for Best Film and Best Director ; though this film has been accused of promoting Anglophobia. Mel said that was influenced by various classic and historical flicks , among the films Gibson watched in order to prepare to direct ""Braveheart"" were Polanski's ""Macbeth,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Chimes at Midnight,"" ""Alexander Nevsky,"" ""A Man for All Seasons,"" ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" and ""Throne of Blood"" . Rating : Better than average. Worthwhile watching .

9.0,Wallace's courage is inspiring,"This epic tale of patriotism, love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music, and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.After a short introduction of a young William Wallace, involving his fathers death and his first step into warrior-hood, we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace (a rugged long-haired Gibson) who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran, a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage, as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.Unfortunately, one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in, but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon, other clans join Wallace, then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell, the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace, Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront, the senses of comradeship, love, patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic, be it sad and haunting tunes, or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power, not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far, but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film.",wallaces courage is inspiring,this epic tale patriotism love conflict opens with birds eye view which takes you through mist air out onto open loch with scenic mountains background this is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music shortly by start narrative by robert bruce after short introduction young william wallace involving his fathers death his first step into warrior hood we are taken present day england where edward longshanks tight rule over scotland is getting increasingly harsh enter fully grown wallace rugged long haired gibson who is back start family new life he soon meets muran girl who he remembered way back he muran fall love shortly get private nighttime marriage as public one would result prima nocte rule being enforced unfortunately one english soldiers controlling their village confronts scared muran forces her into quiet spot william leaps murans rescue all hell ensues commanding officer executes muran promptly assault one kings men as she bit him whilst defending herself she was supposed meet william at secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off horse william returns village horseback give himself but he has other plans uprising that ensues is one most pulse racing exciting fights that has ever graced silver screen imo this is spark that starts off scottish revolution freedom soon other clans join wallace then whole towns stand by him he soon finds himself fields stirling real showdown i thought id give you first hour nutshell rest movie revolves around wallace longshanks queen france as they all fight their own cause battle scenes are ground breaking upfront senses comradeship love patriotism courage all take stand throughout film music adds further epic be it sad haunting tunes or strong stirring bagpipe anthems wallace is portrayed as beacon strength power not mention much honoured leader sometimes gibson takes his character little too far but title braveheart is one that is implied wallaces qualities films dramatic moving ending is good finish superb powerful film,0.49454092419208706,0.11093702808819088,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
