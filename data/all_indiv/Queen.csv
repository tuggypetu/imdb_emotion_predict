9.0,This 'queen' will surely rule your hearts! <3 <3,"Wanna experience a hot air balloon ride? If not literally, Vikas Bahl's 'Queen' will surely give you the feel! This one too takes off after fire of strife but gradually zooms up in the air higher and higher, all liberated from the shackles of earthly rules and grief. 'Queen' is a journey of discovering oneself. Simply put – ""When things go wrong, cry not; gather your guts, not just move over but fly!"". A more detailed analysis follows: Plot: The plot resembles Gauri Shinde's 'English vinglish' in its theme but it is the execution and premises which makes 'Queen' more exuberant. While the former was poised and mature, this one is raw, yet sensitive, sensible, effervescent, all at the same time. How an otherwise banal story on paper could become so entertaining on-screen, only Bahl can tell. He injected the same positivity in his debut venture 'Chillar party' earlier. Another endearing fact is the handling of 'haww'-type (by Indian sanskriti standards) cheeky humor gracefully enough to make it watchable with family. Dialogues by Anvita Dutt and Kangana (yes, she has contributed here too) are pertinent. Despite lot of French and little Japanese here & there (with no subtitles), you don't mind as the situation and emotions say it all. Dilliwali Punjabi lingo, though, adds credibility. Heartiest congratulations to Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane for shelling put money for such a cinematic delight! Cast: It is out and out Kangana's film, with all others in supporting role. Bahl is believable in saying he penned Rani's role keeping only her in mind. No other actress would have better lived the vulnerability, innocence, craziness, elegance and emotions of Rani, the way Kangana did. This movie will definitely mark as a milestone in her career and give all reasons to other filmmakers to look beyond her fashionistic persona. Donning demure, no make-up, plaited look and wearing kurti with sweaters, she looks perfectly the Indian girl next door. At the climax too, she looks glamorous not out of the dress but the confidence she wears! Full marks to casting directors as all actors play within the skin of their respective characters, be it the confused Rajkkumar Rao, Rani's family (Dadi is esp. lovable), sensuous smart Lisa Hayden or Rani's endearing firangi friends. Cinematography: On Rani's canvas, you get to move from rues of Lajpat Nagar to the majestic Eifel Tower to the picturesque bridges of Amsterdam! Kudos to Siddharth Diwan and Bobby Singh for the awesome camera work! Music: Amit Trivedi is a winner all the way. Already hit ""London thumakda"" gives way to ""Ranjha"", classical pop 'Badra bahaar' and 'O gujariya'. However, it is the remixed ""Hungama ho gaya"" from 'Anhonee' (1973) rendered emphatically by ever boisterous Asha Bhosle, which stays with you even after you leave the theatre. Songs are nowhere a speed- breaker in this flick. Flaws: I failed to find any. :)The film ends with a confident rejuvenated Rani thanking her betrayer for giving her the opportunity for self-awakening; we as audience thank the director for infusing optimism into the minds and hearts of esp. female watchers. Go ladies, this one's the best Woman's day gift you can give to yourself. Men too will surely enjoy it for all its youthfulness. It's a movie for all.

10.0,This QUEEN is ROYAL in every way!,"QUEEN is directed by Vikas Bahl, starring Kangana Ranaut, in the lead role, along with Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon.The film revolves around Rani (Kangana Ranaut), an innocent Punjabi girl, who gets dumped one day before her wedding day. She gets an idea to go on her honeymoon all by herself, and that very trip shows her road to self-empowerment while going through several comical situations...The trailer of Queen didn't quite attract much attention, therefore, the film was extremely underrated by several critics, including me. However, the songs did grab a portion of my attention, so I was curious to know whether I was looking at Queen from a wrong angle. The film, itself, faced fierce competition from Madhuri-Juhi starrer, Gulaab Gang and the much-awaited Total Siyapaa. However, the reviews came in for the three films, and I was shocked to see so much praise for Queen. So I decided to go with the critics and chose Queen over Total Siyapaa that weekend. And I think its safe for me to say that it is one of the best decisions I've made in my life (and it might be yours too).Queen starts off in the most mainstream desi way possible. The Big Fat Indian Wedding with relatives at every nook and corner and dance to Punjabi tunes is galore. The calling off of the wedding takes place and you feel yourself going through the very same events as Rani. This is due to pure direction and acting. However, the film takes a VERY sharp turn when she leaves for her honeymoon. Rani meets new friends, goes through life how a woman should, and I think it was a smart move on the director to release it on Women's Day, because at the end of the film, the message is pretty clear. However, I shall not go on further about the plot, because after she leaves India, its all just fun.The acting is just top-notch. Kangana Ranaut, in all honesty, carries the film on her shoulders throughout the 2h30m run time. She portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards and utter praise for it. Rajkummar Rao played a great job as well and the rest of the foreign actors were just delightful and splendid to see.The songs are great as well. Amit Trivedi also deserves applause for the great music as well as background score. Every single song captures a theme of the film and just blends perfectly with the several scenes in the film. It helps you feel like Rani while she goes through her journey. 'London Thumakada' captures the Indian Wedding Theme, while 'O Gujariya' is just great to listen to. A special mention about the remake of 'Hungama Ho Gaya' which is just complete fun to listen to.In conclusion, QUEEN is possibly one of the best films of the year. I can't seem to see any flaw in the film; it is just complete fun. Go watch it; I highly recommend it.QUEEN- 10/10",this queen is royal every way,queen is directed by vikas bahl starring kangana ranaut lead role along with rajkummar rao lisa haydon film revolves around rani kangana ranaut innocent punjabi girl who gets dumped one day before her wedding day she gets idea go her honeymoon all by herself that very trip shows her road self empowerment while going through several comical situations trailer queen didnt quite attract much attention therefore film was extremely underrated by several critics including me however songs did grab portion my attention so i was curious know whether i was looking at queen wrong angle film itself faced fierce competition madhuri juhi starrer gulaab gang much awaited total siyapaa however reviews came three films i was shocked see so much praise queen so i decided go with critics chose queen over total siyapaa that weekend i think its safe me say that it is one best decisions ive made my life it might be yours too queen starts off most mainstream desi way possible big fat indian wedding with relatives at every nook corner dance punjabi tunes is galore calling off wedding takes place you feel yourself going through very same events as rani this is due pure direction acting however film takes very sharp turn when she leaves her honeymoon rani meets new friends goes through life how woman should i think it was smart move director release it womens day because at end film message is pretty clear however i shall not go further about plot because after she leaves india its all just fun acting is just top notch kangana ranaut all honesty carries film her shoulders throughout 2h30m run time she portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards utter praise it rajkummar rao played great job as well rest foreign actors were just delightful splendid see songs are great as well amit trivedi also deserves applause great music as well as background score every single song captures theme film just blends perfectly with several scenes film it helps you feel like rani while she goes through her journey london thumakada captures indian wedding theme while o gujariya is just great listen special mention about remake hungama ho gaya which is just complete fun listen conclusion queen is possibly one best films year i cant seem see any flaw film it is just complete fun go watch it i highly recommend it queen 10 10,0.5258451964701965,0.22993235930735934,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,"This Queen is innocent, naive but entertaining throughout","This film is a good example of Director's clarity of mind regarding characterization, mood of scenes and way of approach. Director Mr Vikas Bahl work is fantastic. In spite of very thin story line he projected this movie in a very unique, interesting and entertaining way. This movie speaks less and shows maximum. Screenplay is average. Dialogues by Anvita Dutt and Kangana Ranaut are very good. Even very average scenes are so good just because of expression and the way of taking the scene i.e When Rani goes on stage for dance, she copies other dancers and removes her sweater, rolls it like them but in spite of throwing it like them she keeps it in her bag. The way she struggles with the bag snatcher that this average scene comes out a laughter riot. Director inserted some flash back between the scene, which enhanced the scene very well and also projected some different emotions. Even the small characters are minutely observed . In a scene Rani goes to meet her family friend in Paris but that family ladies discuss about the money given to her just for a good luck or rituals. They minimize the amount because Rani is a distant relative. When Rani lives in Paris with her wonderful room mates, in this complete sequence Rani is wondered so director chose a T-shirt for Rani with quotation Alice in wonderland. This quotation clearly reflects Rani state of mind. Director never goes over board and never let the actors go over board. So, interest and entertainment remain intact. Of course Director has been supported by fantastic performance of actors. Kangana Ranaut is out standing. No one could have have performed better than her. Raj Kumar Yadav is OK. Lisa Haydon as Vijaylaxmi is fantastic. All actors are very good including Rani's Paris room mates. Music by Amit Trivedi suits the mood of film.",this queen is innocent naive but entertaining throughout,this film is good example directors clarity mind regarding characterization mood scenes way approach director mr vikas bahl work is fantastic spite very thin story line he projected this movie very unique interesting entertaining way this movie speaks less shows maximum screenplay is average dialogues by anvita dutt kangana ranaut are very good even very average scenes are so good just because expression way taking scene i e when rani goes stage dance she copies other dancers removes her sweater rolls it like them but spite throwing it like them she keeps it her bag way she struggles with bag snatcher that this average scene comes out laughter riot director inserted some flash back between scene which enhanced scene very well also projected some different emotions even small characters are minutely observed scene rani goes meet her family friend paris but that family ladies discuss about money given her just good luck or rituals they minimize amount because rani is distant relative when rani lives paris with her wonderful room mates this complete sequence rani is wondered so director chose t shirt rani with quotation alice wonderland this quotation clearly reflects rani state mind director never goes over board never let actors go over board so interest entertainment remain intact course director has been supported by fantastic performance actors kangana ranaut is out standing no one could have have performed better than her raj kumar yadav is ok lisa haydon as vijaylaxmi is fantastic all actors are very good including ranis paris room mates music by amit trivedi suits mood film,0.5759677419354838,0.2597043010752688,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,MY REVIEW: Queen of Hearts!!,"8th March is International Women's Day and Queen celebrates it with panache. When Rani played amazingly brilliant by Kangana Ranaut discovers herself on her solo honeymoon trip in Paris and Amsterdam, she comes back to India with a winning smile on her face. The same smile is pasted on your face throughout the movie. There is hardly any feminine emotion left that is not being touched upon in this witty, gritty, funny, emotional and very subtle cinematic portrayal of finding that a woman is more than being a mother, a sister or a wife. The movie talks in the language of love and affection which is not bound by the country in which you were born. All foreign characters here, be it Indian French single mother, the child-like Japanese guy, the European artist, the French restaurant owner or the black guy here play true to their cultures and don't seem fake at all. After Kangana, movie belongs to writer-director Vikas Bahl who shall be remembered now forever for penning this neat story and screenplay flooded with so many fresh and out of box ideas. So don't wait, go and experience the fun (read hungama) with your friends. It is one of the finest cinematic work of Bollywood.

9.0,Almost Pitch Perfect,"QUEEN - We hardly get woman oriented movies in Bollywood,,,,and most of them does disastrous business at box office....but our country kind of started liking woman oriented movies after superlative No One Killed Jessica,,,,and then comes Kahani..... Both of these movies create some space for heroins in Bollywood to get movies for them only.... But they too are not commercial movies,,,,being thriller they have limited audience,,,,so we want some light hearted movie and guess what we got English WINGLISH,,,,a perfect example of light hearted woman oriented film.....Queen goes on the same track of English Winglish but has crossed it...... Vikash Bhal (director of Chillar party) on his second directorial venture has taken care of each and every scenes of the movie.....There is a scenes where Kangana gives French toast to a french person in breakfast and the person replied m from France and there is nothing like french toast there ,, so Kangana replied 'Ye Sirf India Mein Milta Hei'...... You can laugh 100 times on such jokes,,,,,they are written with such cute humour...... There is another scenes where Kangana run out of the bathroom screaming after seeing a lizard and feel like a fool,,,,but when three of the boys who are her roommates also get scared Kangana take a deep breath with happiness and say 'Savi Dar Gaye',,,,.....Such cute scenes are rare in bollywood...... Story is simple,,,Kangana ' s Mangetar says he will not marry her a day before there marriage and with frustration Kangana decided to go to her Honeymoon alone..... So a girl who barely cross road in India without anyone's help in going to Paris alone.....Here is start of interesting session..... Most of the Bollywood movies make u laugh in there first half and become melodramatic in the second half like what happened in case of Ye Jawani Hei Dewani and a little bit in case of Shaadi Ke Side effect,,,,,but Queen is something far from being melodramatic..... Infect we have a very few films in Bollywood which can make u laugh from start till end despite of some emotional scenes in between those laughs.....Queen is one of the best among them..... To talk about Kangana m speechless,,,,she has always done glamorous roles in Bollywood but she walks into the shoes of such anti glamorous character of Rani with ease.....She has proved that she is far far ahead of the other actresses of her league....Get warned other actresses..... Lisa as the french friend of Rani is too good....Infect she has something great in comparison to what she last did in the movie RASCAL.....When she left Kangana on her way to Amsterdam u wish that she would have gone with her..... The three Roommates of Rani in Amsterdam are perfect...... Vikash Bhal need special mention,,,,,he has crafted every scene with his heart in it.....Casting was so perfect...... Songs goes with the mood of the movie.....Not a single song is wasted,,,,,or stop the flow of the movie,,,,my favorite are O Gujariya and Harjaniya....... I cant say that editing is bad but the movie could have been small,,,,that doesn't mean it will bore u...... So its the first film in 2014 to which m giving more then 3.75 .... M going for 4.25 out of 5...... Its a must watch for every body on this women's day occasion.....

10.0,Queen is soul stirring,Its not every year (or sometimes even years) that you come across a bollywood flick that stays with you for days after you watched it. Queen is one such film that will make you want to watch it again.The story is similar in theme to English Vinglish (Yet another masterpiece) but stands out in execution and story telling.Kangana Ranaut delivers her career best in Queen no doubt.I was actually there on location in Amsterdam sometime in September 2012 when they were filming the last scene where she runs down the bridge to meet her friends at the rock show. The simplicity of the set and all involved was an indication of a good film which i later found out was to be named 'Queen' Watch it right away and you will leave the hall with a smile.,queen is soul stirring,its not every year or sometimes even years that you come across bollywood flick that stays with you days after you watched it queen is one such film that will make you want watch it again story is similar theme english vinglish yet another masterpiece but stands out execution story telling kangana ranaut delivers her career best queen no doubt i was actually there location amsterdam sometime september 2012 when they were filming last scene where she runs down bridge meet her friends at rock show simplicity set all involved was indication good film which i later found out was be named queen watch it right away you will leave hall with smile,0.2628427128427128,0.1936507936507936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,Consistently Entertaining,"To All the Bollywood fan's you should watch QUEEN not because it has a good story no it doesn't the plot has been used numerous times but the journey of Kangana from a shy obedient Rajouri Garden Delhi Girl to a confident open minded today's modern girl is quite awesome. The small moments the little subplots that define Kangana's character is brilliantly written and filmed. Bollywood often becomes predictable but this movie isn't, u ll never be able to guess that such subplots would appear. The dancing of drunk Kangana in front of police scene, the sex toy shop scene, the boob pressing scene there are many more. Kangana's acting is brilliant even the side characters have played their part perfectly. Amit Trivedi's Music as always is amazing it suits the movie there are brilliant songs within the movie which has not been promoted in trailers plus oh Gujariya and Hungama Hogaya would rock any party. Director Vikas Bahl does a brilliant job. Only part where they could have done better is cinematography it is average.

8.0,Back to IMDb just for reviewing this Indian GEM,"Today is international women's day and this movie is a perfect gift. Kangna acts super fantastic with her cute expressions as a typical Desi girl who loves her family, gets over the fear and humiliation of no marriage and lives her own life to the full. First half is very pleasant, Lisa has a good comeback to this movie and impresses well. ""London Thumukda"" song makes audience tap their feet once. I had no idea that Kangna can live up to this mark, her appearance is quite impressive and i guess every Indian girl will like her. If you are assuming her to be the same as in ""Tanu weds Manu"", you are mistaken. You will not be disappointed.

10.0,"Must watch - highly recommended for all, men or women!","GO and WATCH this movie in theater. Bollywood needs high quality movies like this, which are not only meaningful but also provide full entertainment and fun without appearing pretentious/ fake. These are the kind of movies that need to make money so that producers invest in them.I feel a bit out-of-league reviewing this movie. When all the movie critics and stalwarts of Bollywood such as Karan Johar and Aamir Khan have highly praised this movie and Kangana Ranaut's performance in almost unanimous voice, it really leaves one with nothing more to say. So I am going to only mention few things in more detail.Ranaut's performance: One of the best performances to come out of Hindi cinema in several years, this is not about shedding tears, yelling, looking cute/ gorgeous or dancing (which interestingly accounts for ""good acting"" for most Indian audience). It is marked by subtleties, such as faintly raised eyebrows, shrunk nose, narrowed eyes, aversive gaze, awkwardly positioned arms/ legs, contorted body, crestfallen face, shadow of a smirk, etc. Even when she cries, her wailing makes you wonder if you are really watching an act? Ranaut, who in real life is well-known as a fashionista, has transformed her body language, her mannerisms and her expressions completely for this role. One thing is certain - it is hard to imagine any other actress in this role and hard to imagine this movie without Kangana Ranaut as Rani.Vikas Bahl's direction: The credit also goes to the director, Vikas Bahl. Without him, the movie could have been a wreck. The movie has a very simple plot and is therefore not an easy story to make a movie with. But Bahl manages to steer clear of all traps for derailment that the story provides. The movie may seem a bit slow in the middle, but then, without sufficient time to develop the emotions and attitude of the character, the movie would not be as effective. He is also one of the very few directors who have managed to utilize Ranaut's potential as an artist. I heard in an interview that Bahl allowed Ranaut creative freedom, allowing her even to pen her own dialogs for some parts of the movie - wish all those control freaks out there are hearing! Story/ Screenplay/ Dialog: Rani's challenges in this story are not hers alone - they are the trials of every person, man or woman, who has felt diffident owing to their cultivated nature or low-spirited when bowed down by circumstances. This is a story of gaining perspective and discovering one's potential through travel, cross-cultural exposure and external support. That is why the story is so meaningful for every person. One of the reasons the movie works is because it has realistic dialog - dialog as Indians use in normal daily life, nothing cheesy that Hindi movies are so used to. Music: The movie is aptly supported by Amit Trivedi's foot-tapping and innovative score. That said, if I could, I would either eliminate some songs or shorten them just to reduce the length of the movie.

9.0,Perfect!,"Queen (Hindi): The Phantom Productions are back with a bang this year after their fresh romance in ""Hasee Toh Phansee"" with the story of a typical Punjabi girl whose journey causing the change of her real identity which has been shown brilliantly in the film which has shades of films like ""Jab We Met"" , ""Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara"" and even some of the Satyajit Ray's films like ""Charulata"" and ""Mahanagar"" . Hatsoff to director Vikas Behl for showing the brilliant character development of the protagonist (played by Kangana Ranaut) from Rani to Queen which scores in its riveting screenplay (Behl, Parveez Sheikh and Chaitily Parmar) along with crackling dialogues (Anvita Dutt and Kangana Ranaut), the cinematography by Bobby Singh and Siddharth Diwan actually reminds of the film 'Dev D' and it captures the locales beautifully along with the moments in the film and then comes the music score by Amit Trivedi which is simply fabulous and scores in making the narrative flow like anything. In the performances, the foreign cast (Bokyo Mish, Jeffery Ho and Joseph Guitobh) are simply superb and riveting. Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Hayden provide shoulder brilliantly to the protagonist and it's development. Last but not the least, it's Kangana Ranaut who brilliantly carries the film on her shoulders and she repeats her brilliance what we saw in films like ""Gangster"" and ""Fashion"" and she comes out as a real winner and a real Queen. Despite some draggy moments, director Behl's narration succeeds in making the film worth a watch for some fresh cinematic experience.

I am sure most guys (at-least in their heads) can relate to that lad.Some scenes were executed perfectly. Some Punchlines were too good. Kudos to the whole Team.Kangana gave it all in this movie. She was immersed deep in the character. Her dialogue delivery;her posture;her expressions. One of the finest performances I have seen by any Bollywood Actress in Long time.From the right perspective; you can see that Queen has many messages.

8.0,Kangana's reigning moment,"Vikas Bahl's Queen is a refreshingly sensitive film, which gives us a story which is raw, simple, and highly involving. The film tells the story of Rani, an innocent and demure young woman whose fiancé calls off their upcoming wedding all of a sudden just a day before. Heartbroken, she decides not to cancel their pre-booked honeymoon and embarks on a journey to Paris and Amsterdam all by herself. How this simple, unassuming girl, who never left her city let alone her country, will manage all alone abroad is what this film is all about. The interesting people she meets, the lessons she learns as she reflects back on her past life, make it a fascinating ride.The film is wonderfully developed, and it works as a true dramedy, a positive one at that, where we are shown there's something good out of everything. Rani's story is inspiring and touching, and clearly a true queen emerges out of her struggle. Needless to say, nothing would have worked as well without Kangana Ranaut, whose charming, relatable and authentic performance is a portrait of vulnerability, strength and resilience. She really manages to capture Rani's naivety, innocence, and particularly her growing maturity and sense of independence. That this film is so good is mainly to her credit, as she is the heart and soul of the entire enterprise.Queen addresses many important themes and conveys social messages which could inspire many young girls, or everyone in general. But above all it's just a very entertaining film, with hardly a dull moment. The story might seem a little simplistic on paper, but the writing makes it much more profound than it could have been. It just feels so real and simple and devoid of redundant clichés. Bahl's excellent direction makes it a moving experience, producing an uplifting coming-of-age picture infused with moments of strong drama and heartwarming comedy, right to the exhilarating conclusion.

8.0,A perfect Women's Day gift for all girls out there. So go watch it & Kangna....just take a bow.,"Directed by Vikas Bahl, QUEEN actually works instantly since it breaks all the set molds of a Hindi film as soon as the girl moves out to her foreign destination to enjoy a honeymoon alone! And when in Paris, you get to see her coming out of her closed, conservative shell like no other Hindi film has shown till date, to be honest. Yes, the plot does remind you of films such as FRENCH KISS (1995) and our own English VINGLISH (2012) also based on a lady's self discovery. But the similarities end right there and QUEEN comes out as a true representative of the new age entertaining cinema, we have been looking for from quite long.The film is a winner straight away since it remains unpredictable right from its first scene till the last, offering many unseen sequences in a remarkable style. And then it's a very fresh, lively and honest depiction of the foreign life which truly adds to the overall feel of the film quite brilliantly. The other major winning perspective of QUEEN is that this is not a stereotype love story being told with a foreign angle. In fact it is not a love story at all in the first place and is more about the blessed journey of a depressed girl, who rediscovers a new self, after meeting another girl living her life at her own terms all alone, taking its full responsibility whatsoever.So actually QUEEN is all about women-liberation, but this liberation is not meant from any evil clutches of the men. On the contrary here the liberation is pointing towards getting free from herself and from her own set parameters which force her to questionably give away the reins of her life in the hands of a man, without asking any questions or getting any clear commitments for the future. It's a 150 minutes joyride which is certainly going to be enjoyed more by the women as its about them and their undisclosed aspirations only which remain hidden in most of the cases just to get buried or burnt along with their lifeless bodies in the end. So for a change, here we have the men playing the supporting cast taking the rarely acquired back seat and the film is all about the women superbly led by one of the most under-rated actress of our times, Kangana Ranaut.As clearly conveyed in its promos, QUEEN begins with Kangana and ends on Kangana too like very few Hindi films dare to do. The immensely talented girl who was mostly considered as a misfit in the fixed Bollywood format earlier just grabs this rare opportunity thrown towards her like a wounded tigress and then delivers a performance which is sure going to give a tough competition to her contemporaries like Parineeti Chopra, Alia Bhatt and more in the next rounds of awards ceremonies, without any doubt. Her flawless, natural act is simply spectacular in the film as Rani played in a cheerful mode. Plus such is the innocent brilliance in her truthful performance that the viewer just has the girl only in his or her mind while walking out of the theater and that too with all positivity and smile on the faces in a highly satisfying mode.However beginning with a highly enjoyable & entertaining first half, the film does tend to become a bit long in its few sequences of the second half (which required a wise editing). Plus it also takes some (fairly allowed) cinematic liberties in its basic storyline too leaving quite a few things unexplained about its key characters in the end. But fortunately Kangana never lets you feel these shortcomings frankly and the progression even makes a more solid impact once she returns back home and decides to do the unexpected quite daringly. The climax fills in a new life back into the film and I was really relieved that it didn't have something of the routine in its final moments. Apart from the spellbinding act by Kangana, the other great insightful features of the film deserving a special mention are its writing (dialogues), cinematography, costume designing and background score which give an extremely important and appreciable edge to the product in terms of ""A Balance maintained."" Musically, QUEEN has indeed got a worth listening, interesting soundtrack with a few peppy dancing tracks like ""London Thumakda"", ""O Gujariya"", ""Jugni"" and more soothing ones such as ""Badra Bahaar"", ""Taake Jhaanke"", ""Harjaaiyan"", ""Ranjha"" & ""Kinare"" sung well. Moreover it also teaches how a perfect tribute can be paid to the great songs of our Golden Era by using the track ""Maine Hothon Se Lagayi To"" from ANHONEE in a superb style with some fine added arrangements.In the supporting cast, Rajkummar Rao shines in his short role and it was really sporting of him to accept such a miniscule part at this crucial time of his career. Lisa Haydon is truly a delight to watch both in terms of beauty and dialogues complimenting Kangana in her every next step with confidence and all the foreign actors do add their own bit sincerely to make it a worth watching film in its final hour. Still, the ones really giving you a great time in the theater are the actors playing Kangana's family members especially the father, kid brother and the grandmother giving her a lovely life teaching advice sitting out of the locked door.To sum up QUEEN is a charmingly entertaining film, which many might rate as just a multiplex movie or something taking our Indian traditions for a toss and more. But for others QUEEN is the next step forward in our Indian Cinema and the effort surely needs to be applauded by one and all, loudly.",perfect womens day gift all girls out there so go watch it kangna just take bow,directed by vikas bahl queen actually works instantly since it breaks all set molds hindi film as soon as girl moves out her foreign destination enjoy honeymoon alone when paris you get see her coming out her closed conservative shell like no other hindi film has shown till date be honest yes plot does remind you films such as french kiss 1995 our own english vinglish 2012 also based ladys self discovery but similarities end right there queen comes out as true representative new age entertaining cinema we have been looking quite long film is winner straight away since it remains unpredictable right its first scene till last offering many unseen sequences remarkable style then its very fresh lively honest depiction foreign life which truly adds overall feel film quite brilliantly other major winning perspective queen is that this is not stereotype love story being told with foreign angle fact it is not love story at all first place is more about blessed journey depressed girl who rediscovers new self after meeting another girl living her life at her own terms all alone taking its full responsibility whatsoever so actually queen is all about women liberation but this liberation is not meant any evil clutches men contrary here liberation is pointing towards getting free herself her own set parameters which force her questionably give away reins her life hands man without asking any questions or getting any clear commitments future its 150 minutes joyride which is certainly going be enjoyed more by women as its about them their undisclosed aspirations only which remain hidden most cases just get buried or burnt along with their lifeless bodies end so change here we have men playing supporting cast taking rarely acquired back seat film is all about women superbly led by one most under rated actress our times kangana ranaut as clearly conveyed its promos queen begins with kangana ends kangana too like very few hindi films dare do immensely talented girl who was mostly considered as misfit fixed bollywood format earlier just grabs this rare opportunity thrown towards her like wounded tigress then delivers performance which is sure going give tough competition her contemporaries like parineeti chopra alia bhatt more next rounds awards ceremonies without any doubt her flawless natural act is simply spectacular film as rani played cheerful mode plus such is innocent brilliance her truthful performance that viewer just has girl only his or her mind while walking out theater that too with all positivity smile faces highly satisfying mode however beginning with highly enjoyable entertaining first half film does tend become bit long its few sequences second half which required wise editing plus it also takes some fairly allowed cinematic liberties its basic storyline too leaving quite few things unexplained about its key characters end but fortunately kangana never lets you feel these shortcomings frankly progression even makes more solid impact once she returns back home decides do unexpected quite daringly climax fills new life back into film i was really relieved that it didnt have something routine its final moments apart spellbinding act by kangana other great insightful features film deserving special mention are its writing dialogues cinematography costume designing background score which give extremely important appreciable edge product terms balance maintained musically queen has indeed got worth listening interesting soundtrack with few peppy dancing tracks like london thumakda o gujariya jugni more soothing ones such as badra bahaar taake jhaanke harjaaiyan ranjha kinare sung well moreover it also teaches how perfect tribute can be paid great songs our golden era by using track maine hothon se lagayi anhonee superb style with some fine added arrangements supporting cast rajkummar rao shines his short role it was really sporting him accept such miniscule part at this crucial time his career lisa haydon is truly delight watch both terms beauty dialogues complimenting kangana her every next step with confidence all foreign actors do add their own bit sincerely make it worth watching film its final hour still ones really giving you great time theater are actors playing kanganas family members especially father kid brother grandmother giving her lovely life teaching advice sitting out locked door sum up queen is charmingly entertaining film which many might rate as just multiplex movie or something taking our indian traditions toss more but others queen is next step forward our indian cinema effort surely needs be applauded by one all loudly,0.5195014378107903,0.23753999397884296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,Queen : Movie that stays in your heart,"Do you ever get that sinking feeling , as though you are being pulled down or the world is just collapsing before your eyes..and does that leave you feeling depressed and despondent? This is exactly the same trauma that Rani (Kangana Ranaut) ,a middle class Punjabi girl , experiences when her fiancé Vijay(Rajkumarr Rao) calls off their wedding at the last moment. You would think it to be a lamenting saga sympathizing with her but director Vikas Bahl adopts a refreshingly delirious approach and tells the adventures of the female protagonist who decides to travel on her honeymoon all alone , establishing an implicit ode to women empowerment.Rani is the quintessential conservative girl hailing from a small-town Mithaiwala family whose solo-travel(on honeymoon) marks her plunge to self-discovery. With a well-articulated narrative, resonating with the same sentiments that Shashi of English Vinglish carried , Queen brims with compassion and celebrates the joy of breaking free. It also reinforces the fact that - no man is foreign. The language barrier begins to fade when Rani befriends a Parisian waitress, shares flat with inmates who happens to be boys ,but she remains in the confines of her traditions and yet defies the norms set by others. You rejoice when she triumphs over a mugger, lets her hair down to Bollywood remix at a pub, gets drunk ,does some nut-crazy talks with strangers and inadvertently buys souvenirs from a sex shop. Bahl's deft direction with splendid cinematography handles these aspects pretty well. Amit Trivedi's soulful music brings in an added advantage but the dialogues(additionally penned by Kangana herself!) replete with humor, are bang-on!The plot however gets meandering and over-indulgent at times, Rani's first kiss and the golgappa becoming a rage in the Dutch boulevard appear fabricated but those are minor passable glitches .The beauty lies in the authenticity of the characters and Bahl brings out the flavor of the NRI influences in a refreshing way. Specially in one of those conversations where Rani goes to her meet her NRI aunt's family and they pretend to express grief over her getting jilted at her wedding.The film benefits from the bravura performance by Kangana who carries the film on her shoulders with aplomb. Her Rani doesn't shy from the problems, she chooses to embrace them and tries to find a solution. Sweet and diligent, yet strong willed and individualistic, Queen stands as the epitome of a liberated and independent Indian woman.Rajkumar Rao is brilliant as her egotist fiancé and his portrayal of an archetypal MCP is terrific. Lisa Hayden is a complete revelation playing the unapologetic Vijaylaksmi.The depiction of the refusal to feign hypocritical coyness while encountering the physical relationships is no mean feat and she does it with gusto.Queen is a gem and one must watch it for Kangana's heartfelt act.Right from its start till the ending credits rolling and paying tribute to Facebook,its a winner all the way. I strongly recommend that you go for it.",queen movie that stays your heart,do you ever get that sinking feeling as though you are being pulled down or world is just collapsing before your eyes does that leave you feeling depressed despondent this is exactly same trauma that rani kangana ranaut middle class punjabi girl experiences when her fianc vijay rajkumarr rao calls off their wedding at last moment you would think it be lamenting saga sympathizing with her but director vikas bahl adopts refreshingly delirious approach tells adventures female protagonist who decides travel her honeymoon all alone establishing implicit ode women empowerment rani is quintessential conservative girl hailing small town mithaiwala family whose solo travel honeymoon marks her plunge self discovery with well articulated narrative resonating with same sentiments that shashi english vinglish carried queen brims with compassion celebrates joy breaking free it also reinforces fact that no man is foreign language barrier begins fade when rani befriends parisian waitress shares flat with inmates who happens be boys but she remains confines her traditions yet defies norms set by others you rejoice when she triumphs over mugger lets her hair down bollywood remix at pub gets drunk does some nut crazy talks with strangers inadvertently buys souvenirs sex shop bahls deft direction with splendid cinematography handles these aspects pretty well amit trivedis soulful music brings added advantage but dialogues additionally penned by kangana herself replete with humor are bang plot however gets meandering over indulgent at times ranis first kiss golgappa becoming rage dutch boulevard appear fabricated but those are minor passable glitches beauty lies authenticity characters bahl brings out flavor nri influences refreshing way specially one those conversations where rani goes her meet her nri aunts family they pretend express grief over her getting jilted at her wedding film benefits bravura performance by kangana who carries film her shoulders with aplomb her rani doesnt shy problems she chooses embrace them tries find solution sweet diligent yet strong willed individualistic queen stands as epitome liberated independent indian woman rajkumar rao is brilliant as her egotist fianc his portrayal archetypal mcp is terrific lisa hayden is complete revelation playing unapologetic vijaylaksmi depiction refusal feign hypocritical coyness while encountering physical relationships is no mean feat she does it with gusto queen is gem one must watch it kanganas heartfelt act right its start till ending credits rolling paying tribute facebook its winner all way i strongly recommend that you go it,0.5211182336182336,0.11123066748066748,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,This Queen's worth your ten bucks,"Going in, I had read/heard mixed reviews. A few suggested that this one was a rip-off of 'English Vinglish' (more on that later). A few, said that the only 2 things worth watching were Kangana Ranaut's performance and the final 20 minutes. I did not know of Vikas Bahl (the helmer, who previously worked on the not-quite-here-or-there 'Chillar Party').I had seen/enjoyed 'English/Vinglish', and the one thing this one has in common with that is the music composer, Amit Trivedi (who's yet to surpass his own 'Dev D', but is probably belting out some of the best stuff that's out there these days).Kangana Ranaut: This is one actress at whom the entire audience was laughing at, when she tried 'acting' drunk in her first movie, 'Gangster', which was a hit because of its narration and great soundtrack, no credit to her, IMO. However, I did watch other movies she performed in, including 'Life in a metro' and 'Tanu weds Manu', and she was fantastic in both of them (also helped that both movies were very good, and the former also reflect director Anurag Basu's growth in terms of choosing subjects, though he did rip off the Jack Lemmon vehicle, 'Apartment' for the segment with Ranaut/Kohli/Menon - unkind words were said about her character in the movie mimicking her experiences in real-life at that time).She really owns it in this one, and it was kinda sad to note the material not really pushing it to the max, and staying safe, considering (I think) she was in a place so perfect that her performance would have benefited from some envelope-pushing. Having said that though, this Phantom production (Kashyap, et al, just coming off of the success of 'Hasee toh phasee') pushes all the (just) right buttons, and manages to educate and entertain at the same time. Wrong release timing though, since womens' day was a couple weeks earlier.This sure tries to be quite a few things at the same time: Rebelling against the typical conservative response to rejection is one theme, along with turning into a mismatched buddy-comedy where one learns from the other (along with some welcome same sex erotic overtones in a few sequences, though they're ultimately played for laughs), a competitive cook-off, Hostel 3 (just kidding, but I had to put this out there as well - you'll know when you watch it). Given that it tries to accomplish so many things at the same time in the same flick, I was as (pleasantly) surprised as I was watching 'English/Vinglish' when that also tried to become something more, while ultimately chickening out, just this way this one does as well. Too much to ask, I suppose.Lisa Haydon, an Angelina-done-right in terms of looks, has some amazing screen presence, but her acting definitely needs to shine better (she does have the looks to pull anything off, and her performance here is much better than a lot of good-looking wooden blocks that populate Bollywood). The supporting characters lend some able support, merging into the background when needed, and Kangana shines all through, as was the objective since the beginning.Though it sure has some sequences that left me scratching my head, more so from the censoring perspective - Lisa's bra is blurred in this theatrical cut, but the scene in the sex toy store is intact, as are few cleavage shots. Very confusing, and inconsistent, though their inconsistency's sure consistent.Definitely worth a watch, esp. on the big screen, though I wish it had been done much better.",this queens worth your ten bucks,going i had read heard mixed reviews few suggested that this one was rip off english vinglish more that later few said that only 2 things worth watching were kangana ranauts performance final 20 minutes i did not know vikas bahl helmer who previously worked not quite here or there chillar party i had seen enjoyed english vinglish one thing this one has common with that is music composer amit trivedi whos yet surpass his own dev d but is probably belting out some best stuff thats out there these days kangana ranaut this is one actress at whom entire audience was laughing at when she tried acting drunk her first movie gangster which was hit because its narration great soundtrack no credit her imo however i did watch other movies she performed including life metro tanu weds manu she was fantastic both them also helped that both movies were very good former also reflect director anurag basus growth terms choosing subjects though he did rip off jack lemmon vehicle apartment segment with ranaut kohli menon unkind words were said about her character movie mimicking her experiences real life at that time she really owns it this one it was kinda sad note material not really pushing it max staying safe considering i think she was place so perfect that her performance would have benefited some envelope pushing having said that though this phantom production kashyap et al just coming off success hasee toh phasee pushes all just right buttons manages educate entertain at same time wrong release timing though since womens day was couple weeks earlier this sure tries be quite few things at same time rebelling against typical conservative response rejection is one theme along with turning into mismatched buddy comedy where one learns other along with some welcome same sex erotic overtones few sequences though theyre ultimately played laughs competitive cook off hostel 3 just kidding but i had put this out there as well youll know when you watch it given that it tries accomplish so many things at same time same flick i was as pleasantly surprised as i was watching english vinglish when that also tried become something more while ultimately chickening out just this way this one does as well too much ask i suppose lisa haydon angelina done right terms looks has some amazing screen presence but her acting definitely needs shine better she does have looks pull anything off her performance here is much better than lot good looking wooden blocks that populate bollywood supporting characters lend some able support merging into background when needed kangana shines all through as was objective since beginning though it sure has some sequences that left me scratching my head more so censoring perspective lisas bra is blurred this theatrical cut but scene sex toy store is intact as are few cleavage shots very confusing inconsistent though their inconsistencys sure consistent definitely worth watch esp big screen though i wish it had been done much better,0.42231766124171183,0.16655816757082578,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,Uplifting film with important themes.,"Queen is a character-driven story revolving around Rani, a lady who goes on a journey of self-discovery after her fiance called off their wedding at the last minute. Vikas Bahl direction's is excellent. He handles every emotional scene with perfection; he beautifully captures the relationship between Rani and his father with effective flashbacks. Vikas Bahl's screenplay is good but there are some minor flaws: the film loses focus in the third act, the main conflict could easily be resolved but dragged on to the end. The comedy isn't forced and it blends well with the movie. The dialogue is decent. The character growth of Rani is handled well and felt smooth and realistic. She goes from a timid, naive, obedient girl to a strong, independent lady full with zeal for life. The film takes place in three different locations: India, Paris and Netherlands, each of those locations showcase different stage of growth for Rani. She meets different people, learns more about life and other cultures and she finally realized that there's more to life than being dependent on someone. Kangana Ranaut does a brilliant job as Rani, she showcases every emotions nicely. she is able to portrayed her character's vulnerable and timid side and also the bold and enthusiastic side, effortlessly. RajKummar Rao is also impressive, he's understated and consistent with his performance, even though his character lacks depth and motiveless. Lisa Haydon is great as the hippie mixed-race hotel maid Vijay, she's the first person to befriend Rani, she listens to her (even though she has no idea what she's talking about) and help her realized her true potential. The rest of the cast provide good support. Technically where do I start? Amit Trivedi's musical composition is simply wonderful, and the location feel gives it a unique atmosphere. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking; each individual shot in the film is crucial, and the camera work captures it with great, eye-level seeking shots, displaying the amazing scenery and characters emotions. The editing is seamless; the narrative style simply fits the film, and the scenes transition is smooth. In conclusion, Queen is a fantastic movie, with enough character development to care for the characters and good performances, with a very relevant message.",uplifting film with important themes,queen is character driven story revolving around rani lady who goes journey self discovery after her fiance called off their wedding at last minute vikas bahl directions is excellent he handles every emotional scene with perfection he beautifully captures relationship between rani his father with effective flashbacks vikas bahls screenplay is good but there are some minor flaws film loses focus third act main conflict could easily be resolved but dragged end comedy isnt forced it blends well with movie dialogue is decent character growth rani is handled well felt smooth realistic she goes timid naive obedient girl strong independent lady full with zeal life film takes place three different locations india paris netherlands each those locations showcase different stage growth rani she meets different people learns more about life other cultures she finally realized that theres more life than being dependent someone kangana ranaut does brilliant job as rani she showcases every emotions nicely she is able portrayed her characters vulnerable timid side also bold enthusiastic side effortlessly rajkummar rao is also impressive hes understated consistent with his performance even though his character lacks depth motiveless lisa haydon is great as hippie mixed race hotel maid vijay shes first person befriend rani she listens her even though she has no idea what shes talking about help her realized her true potential rest cast provide good support technically where do i start amit trivedis musical composition is simply wonderful location feel gives it unique atmosphere cinematography is absolutely breathtaking each individual shot film is crucial camera work captures it with great eye level seeking shots displaying amazing scenery characters emotions editing is seamless narrative style simply fits film scenes transition is smooth conclusion queen is fantastic movie with enough character development care characters good performances with very relevant message,0.6103243021346468,0.3046551724137931,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.49}"
8.0,Rani's journey is PATHBREAKING!!!!,"Rani (kangna) hails from a middle class Punjabi family in Delhi and when she is spotted by Vijay (rajkumar) who hails from London, it is love at first sight. He wooes her to the fullest and finally Rani agrees and marriage is set. But just at the eleventh hour, Vijay comes from London only to call it off. Everyone is shattered including Rani but she decides to have her honeymoon at Paris and Amsterdam, on her own. What happens from there forms the rest.The director has come up with an interesting storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was amazing. The dialogues were well written. The script was different and the screenplay made it gel perfectly one screen.The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the characters while the art department was natural. Kangna Ranaut carried the film very responsibly and she delivered her best. Lisa Haydon was not just smoking hot but also confident in her act. Rajkumar Rao was impressive, he scored well. Mish Boyko was worth mentioning, Jeffrey was entertaining, Guitobh Joseph was good.Coming up with rom-coms is one thing but including them with some offbeat concepts is something else. It can be seen in this one and at the same time, the makers are tapping the women audience with such subjects. The first half goes on a lighter mode with elements of entertainment, some romance. The interval bang was promising and the second half has its own share of fun and emotional highs. Overall, this is a film which appeals due to the class audience.The films performances are rich, the direction amazing, and when it comes to women centric films, Queen is pathbreaking creating a new genre in Hindi films. A must watch!!!",ranis journey is pathbreaking,rani kangna hails middle class punjabi family delhi when she is spotted by vijay rajkumar who hails london it is love at first sight he wooes her fullest finally rani agrees marriage is set but just at eleventh hour vijay comes london only call it off everyone is shattered including rani but she decides have her honeymoon at paris amsterdam her own what happens there forms rest director has come up with interesting storyline while presentation was rich narrative was amazing dialogues were well written script was different screenplay made it gel perfectly one screen background score was melodious three songs were worth watching cinematography was main strength this film editing was crisp costumes were well designed suit characters while art department was natural kangna ranaut carried film very responsibly she delivered her best lisa haydon was not just smoking hot but also confident her act rajkumar rao was impressive he scored well mish boyko was worth mentioning jeffrey was entertaining guitobh joseph was good coming up with rom coms is one thing but including them with some offbeat concepts is something else it can be seen this one at same time makers are tapping women audience with such subjects first half goes lighter mode with elements entertainment some romance interval bang was promising second half has its own share fun emotional highs overall this is film which appeals due class audience films performances are rich direction amazing when it comes women centric films queen is pathbreaking creating new genre hindi films must watch,0.5188219696969696,0.2663674242424242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,This is the best Hindi film I have seen so far this year!,"This is the second time in all my years of watching movies in the cinema, where during the climatic scene the whole theatre would erupt in spontaneous cheers, whistles and claps (the first time it happened was Speed). It's never an easy task to be able to manage a feat like that. If it happens it is because the movie has gotten under everyone's skin and the audience want to celebrate the end of the hero's journey. In Queen's case it is a heroine which is an absolute marvel in Bollywood. It is not often that an ordinary female figure is the central character. The story premise is not new. I have seen stories like this in every language. Rani (Kangana Ranaut) is due to marry Vijay (Rajkummar Rao), but 2 days before the wedding Vijay wants out. His reason - he has changed and marriage is an impediment to his life pursuit. His real reason I think is that he finds Rani is not good enough for him. Rani is devastated. Who wouldn't? She sulks and finally decides to go on the Honeymoon trip to Paris and Amsterdam on her own. The stuff that happen on the trip and the people she meets will change her life forever. This is a common story but what is done in Queen totally surprised me. My wife tells me that one of things she found so refreshing is that there is no new love angle. Most of these type of films love to rush out of the blocks to make the girl fall in love with a new worthier man. This movie also doesn't have any wise person to give sagely advice to her. In short it feels like a breath of fresh air. The script is really smart and maintains a light-hearted tone throughout. Everybody already knows breaking up is terrible, especially when it's at the marriage altar. No need to manipulate us to weep again and again. Instead the script make us laugh and laugh. But it's laughter tinged with poignancy. I also love the seamless editing. It moves back and forth in its timeline but not once am I confused. In fact, it makes perfect sense for the flashbacks because it is Rani's way of remembering the past and then to exorcise it out of her. Stories like this get condescending very fast but I didn't feel that low blow at all. Anybody who knows movies knows casting is 99%. The success of this film owes a huge proportion to the acting talents of Kangana Ranaut. I don't think I have seen her before and she absolutely nails her role to perfection. Right from the start when her character has not even been fleshed out, my heart already felt like bursting when Vijay says he doesn't want to marry her. Watch and marvel at a great actress. So nuanced, so pitiful, so spot-on. The whole film rested on her shoulders and she carried the movie to the finishing line and beyond. Why beyond? Because the movie is not just entertaining, it is also an important film with something to say about the plight of young women in India. The movie suggests that woman is looked upon as objects rather than life partners in a marriage. Where the finger is pointed at is a the mindset of people. So in a sense Queen is giving an ""up yours"" to all the men and also for women to start figuring out who they are, what they want and what they are worth. The message definitely went through because the audience cheered when Rani sticks it up to Vijay at the end. Watch this movie get nominated for some big awards this year.",this is best hindi film i have seen so far this year,this is second time all my years watching movies cinema where during climatic scene whole theatre would erupt spontaneous cheers whistles claps first time it happened was speed its never easy task be able manage feat like that if it happens it is because movie has gotten under everyones skin audience want celebrate end heros journey queens case it is heroine which is absolute marvel bollywood it is not often that ordinary female figure is central character story premise is not new i have seen stories like this every language rani kangana ranaut is due marry vijay rajkummar rao but 2 days before wedding vijay wants out his reason he has changed marriage is impediment his life pursuit his real reason i think is that he finds rani is not good enough him rani is devastated who wouldnt she sulks finally decides go honeymoon trip paris amsterdam her own stuff that happen trip people she meets will change her life forever this is common story but what is done queen totally surprised me my wife tells me that one things she found so refreshing is that there is no new love angle most these type films love rush out blocks make girl fall love with new worthier man this movie also doesnt have any wise person give sagely advice her short it feels like breath fresh air script is really smart maintains light hearted tone throughout everybody already knows breaking up is terrible especially when its at marriage altar no need manipulate us weep again again instead script make us laugh laugh but its laughter tinged with poignancy i also love seamless editing it moves back forth its timeline but not once am i confused fact it makes perfect sense flashbacks because it is ranis way remembering past then exorcise it out her stories like this get condescending very fast but i didnt feel that low blow at all anybody who knows movies knows casting is 99 success this film owes huge proportion acting talents kangana ranaut i dont think i have seen her before she absolutely nails her role perfection right start when her character has not even been fleshed out my heart already felt like bursting when vijay says he doesnt want marry her watch marvel at great actress so nuanced so pitiful so spot whole film rested her shoulders she carried movie finishing line beyond why beyond because movie is not just entertaining it is also important film with something say about plight young women india movie suggests that woman is looked upon as objects rather than life partners marriage where finger is pointed at is mindset people so sense queen is giving up yours all men also women start figuring out who they are what they want what they are worth message definitely went through because audience cheered when rani sticks it up vijay at end watch this movie get nominated some big awards this year,0.5322973072125615,0.18844632768361583,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,Simple Girl on a magnificent and stunning adventure of life,"Bollywood swept this year's international women's day by releasing two women centric subjects Gulab Gang and Queen. I decided to take Queen a chance to celebrate womanhood. We see two to three bollywood movies every year focusing female centric stories like Kahaani, Heroine, Fashion, English Vinglish, Dirty Picture, No one killed Jessica etc. So with no doubt Queen joins the wagon of woman leading in a film. This is an adventure trip of a simple Delhi girl to overcome her Psychological trauma after betrayed by her fiancée. Now I guess that's enough on the plot. I found lots of cliché in this movie but yet it stands out as a fresh meal. Kangana the girl who rocked in fashion with attitude has nailed it yet again in this flick together with her stranger flock of truly foreign gang Olexander, Taka, Tim, Lisa heydon as Vijaylakshmi. This movie goes with this theme ""I will row my boat, I will find my way, I will live my life and I will truly know who I am and what am I capable off"" So here's the quiz buzz!! can you link the following movies: 1.
