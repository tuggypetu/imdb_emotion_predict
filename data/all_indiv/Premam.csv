9.0,Watched thrice - loved each time!,"Watched the movie yesterday, the serum of rejuvenation that it injected into me yesterday is still flowing strong. I plan to watch the movie again possibly multiple times over this week. The movie has great humor, is amazingly truthful , beautifully heartwarming. Against the backdrop of simple and unassuming friendships, portrayed with excellent humor, multiple tales of love are presented. All the love stories presented have the genuineness of everyday life. Spectacular things do not happen which makes it so relatable. There are multiple points in life at which one is enamored by someone else and typically things do not work out all the way each time until finally it does. That is all the movie is about - a pretty simple and evident aspect of life. The movie is a total entertainer as it has great humor, presented with unabashed innovation,awesome songs, great scenery, timely stunt scenes to keep the pep up and most importantly the theme of love that flows through sincerely, straight into your heart, presented with all the vulnerabilities and insecurities that comes with loving someone deeply and giving someone else much more power than oneself. Movie is novel in its presentation. The sequence of execution does not fit into any of the typical patterns. The movie presents three different time periods with the same characters which worked very well.Alphonse Putheren has himself played a small cameo role in the movie which is going to endear him to the malayali psyche even more . It is clear that a lot of hard work has gone into the movie and it has been designed to be an entertainer and the movie has worked really really well. He is clearly masterful as the impressions his movie left on me 24 hours back lingers on pretty strong - it is not just the joy of love, the vulnerabilities, the sorrow , the excitement everything lingers on - hats off!Just back from my third view of the movie. There is not one scene that does not deliver. You appreciate each and every scene and the movie comes to an end smoothly to a successful finish.",watched thrice loved each time,watched movie yesterday serum rejuvenation that it injected into me yesterday is still flowing strong i plan watch movie again possibly multiple times over this week movie has great humor is amazingly truthful beautifully heartwarming against backdrop simple unassuming friendships portrayed with excellent humor multiple tales love are presented all love stories presented have genuineness everyday life spectacular things do not happen which makes it so relatable there are multiple points life at which one is enamored by someone else typically things do not work out all way each time until finally it does that is all movie is about pretty simple evident aspect life movie is total entertainer as it has great humor presented with unabashed innovation awesome songs great scenery timely stunt scenes keep pep up most importantly theme love that flows through sincerely straight into your heart presented with all vulnerabilities insecurities that comes with loving someone deeply giving someone else much more power than oneself movie is novel its presentation sequence execution does not fit into any typical patterns movie presents three different time periods with same characters which worked very well alphonse putheren has himself played small cameo role movie which is going endear him malayali psyche even more it is clear that lot hard work has gone into movie it has been designed be entertainer movie has worked really really well he is clearly masterful as impressions his movie left me 24 hours back lingers pretty strong it is not just joy love vulnerabilities sorrow excitement everything lingers hats off just back my third view movie there is not one scene that does not deliver you appreciate each every scene movie comes end smoothly successful finish,0.5396190476190476,0.3028333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Perfectly well crafted entertainer,"""What a way to refresh yourself.."" This is what came to my mind after watching this film. Being a great fan of the mastermind Alphonse Puthren and his debut film Neram, this didn't disappoint me. But it did impress me.It may not be a life-changing, mind-blowing film. But a clean romantic comedy that lies closer to reality than you think. Unintentional and situational comedy that shows up almost in every scene of the film, can clean your mind of any stress or anything of that sort that you have at the moment.The direction of the film as usual is exemplary. The edits (that too done by the director) certainly utilities the factor of directorial edited films. The film certainly lacks a story but that factor is hidden by the beautifully captured visuals thanks to the cinematographer, Anend. Screenplay is good. Production value and art was natural at it's level best as most of the places shown in the film originally exists.The film is divided into 3 acts that covers 3 stages of the life of George, a care-free living youngster - the first one covering the romantic relationship of George while studying in 12th grade is the shortest one of the film. The second covering his collage life is the longest and the most stylish\epic one among that, making it my favorite. The last act shows the life of George after his collage life, now a working class fellow. The film's main plot is based on 3 different women that George fell in love with during the 3 different stages.Simple and elegant plot which lags a bit in the last half hour is the only problem with the film that I saw.Positives :-1. Nivin Pauly himself is a great asset to the film. The film too should be a great asset to him as this film is the best work I saw from him. He has improved his weaknesses like acting out emotional scenes and dance. OMG, the wonderful dance choreographed by Sai Pallavi is amazing. And Nivin has danced it to perfection.2. All other male stars. When I say this I mainly mean none others that Krishna Sankar and Shabareesh Varma. Shabareesh does a kind of one man show which is my other favorite of the film. Being a lyricist and a singer, the actor have given all his level best performance at all areas. Vinay fort, Maniyanpilla Raju was also good. 3. All the three lead actresses were pretty good. Mostly Sai Pallavi who changed the entire course of the film with her cute performance as Malar miss smile emoticon4. Wonderful cameos. There are a lot of cameos throughout. First one being Jude Anthony as Jolly D' Cruz. Then there is Renji Panicker as David who did a stylish role with the superbly written dialogs from his own films. Finally there is the director himself as Ronnie who is a drug addict and the only or mainly the villain of the film.5. Superb stunt scenes. There is hardly 2 scenes of fights in the entire film and the main one in that being George's collage intro. I sure wished there was more of that frown emoticon6. Amazing cinematography and superb Edits.7. The best soundtrack I've ever heard along with Chandrettan Evideya and Neram.Negatives :-1. A little lag that happens the final half hour.Verdict - Premam is a surely must watch entertainer",perfectly well crafted entertainer,what way refresh yourself this is what came my mind after watching this film being great fan mastermind alphonse puthren his debut film neram this didnt disappoint me but it did impress me it may not be life changing mind blowing film but clean romantic comedy that lies closer reality than you think unintentional situational comedy that shows up almost every scene film can clean your mind any stress or anything that sort that you have at moment direction film as usual is exemplary edits that too done by director certainly utilities factor directorial edited films film certainly lacks story but that factor is hidden by beautifully captured visuals thanks cinematographer anend screenplay is good production value art was natural at its level best as most places shown film originally exists film is divided into 3 acts that covers 3 stages life george care free living youngster first one covering romantic relationship george while studying 12th grade is shortest one film second covering his collage life is longest most stylish epic one among that making it my favorite last act shows life george after his collage life now working class fellow films main plot is based 3 different women that george fell love with during 3 different stages simple elegant plot which lags bit last half hour is only problem with film that i saw positives 1 nivin pauly himself is great asset film film too should be great asset him as this film is best work i saw him he has improved his weaknesses like acting out emotional scenes dance omg wonderful dance choreographed by sai pallavi is amazing nivin has danced it perfection 2 all other male stars when i say this i mainly mean none others that krishna sankar shabareesh varma shabareesh does kind one man show which is my other favorite film being lyricist singer actor have given all his level best performance at all areas vinay fort maniyanpilla raju was also good 3 all three lead actresses were pretty good mostly sai pallavi who changed entire course film with her cute performance as malar miss smile emoticon4 wonderful cameos there are lot cameos throughout first one being jude anthony as jolly d cruz then there is renji panicker as david who did stylish role with superbly written dialogs his own films finally there is director himself as ronnie who is drug addict only or mainly villain film 5 superb stunt scenes there is hardly 2 scenes fights entire film main one that being georges collage intro i sure wished there was more that frown emoticon6 amazing cinematography superb edits 7 best soundtrack ive ever heard along with chandrettan evideya neram negatives 1 little lag that happens final half hour verdict premam is surely must watch entertainer,0.6088633040935673,0.3466478696741855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,"""A Thoroughly Enjoyable Offering From Alphonse Puthren""","I went for 'Premam' after witnessing the massive positive response that the movie received from the day of its release and naturally expectations were sky-high,which luckily didn't turn wrong as Alphonse Puthren could succeed in producing a delicious entertainer with originality in narration right from the word go.Made on a template that brims with inventiveness and unique stamp of the narrator,Premam is a good example of how intense belief that one has on himself can result in an alluring creation.Premam presents three different phases in the love-life of Protagonist George with hope,despair,success,failure,re-invention and optimism all going hand-in-hand on the course of the narration.The screenplay written by Alphonse himself smartly utilizes genuine situational humor to ensure that the audience is glued to the seats till the end of the feature.""Butterflies are mentally mental,so is love"" unveils on the screen as the end credit starts to roll,a perfect way to end all the madness associated with love that the movie showcased in its running time of around 166 minutes ranging from simple infatuation to deep love and from budding romance to heart-break and finally tying knot with the 'one'.The tempo of narration is somewhat slow or rather realistic,but never really tests the patience of the audience due to the emotional connect that the lead characters manages to develop and maintain with the viewers because of Alphonse's dexterity in presentation and the strong support of the whole technical and acting departments.Nivin Pauly continues his winning streak,this time with a pinch of #Kalipp added to his usual romeo avatar.The actor has managed to pull off three different phases in George's life with ease and won the hearts yet again after his character ""Umesh"" in the recent release ""Oru Vadakkan Selfie"".All the female leads did their job pretty well with Sai Pallavi being the pick who made me fall in love with her instantly likable character 'Malar'.Madonna Sebastian was lovable with her realistic performance and unmatchable cuteness.Anupama Parameswaran did her part well even though she had less screen presence compared to other female leads.Vinay Fort and Saubin Shahir were hilarious.Alphonse Puthren,Renji Panicker and Jude Anthany Joseph made their cameos remarkable.The score by Rajesh Murugesan was innovative and tailored for the storyline.Lyrics by Shabareesh Verma were refreshing.All the 7 songs and numerous song-bits used were situational and never harmed the pace of the narration.""Malare"" song in particular was brilliantly shot and the best part of the score.Cinematography by Anend C Chandran was good while the cuts by director himself was fine.Overall,'Premam' is a delicious tale of love that has its heart laid at the right place.Verdict::With Focused Direction,Well-Written Screenplay,Lovable Characters,Perfect Casting,Good Performances,Sound Technical Support & Refreshing Music Premam Is Undoubtedly The Best Entertainer To Comeout From Mollywood In Recent Times.Go For This Wholesome Entertainer & Enjoy All The Fun In

9.0,Undoubtedly Premam is a winner !!,"Don't think otherwise I wrote a review for the film which got released 6 months back. What to do when I want to watch other language films, I need to wait for subs ;). That is where the delay. Anyhow here we go !Premam film doesn't have a strong story line but I wasn't bored for a second. The way I got recommendations to watch Ustad Hotel, Bangalore Days & Neelakasam Pachadkal & Chuvannabhumi, likewise I got recommendations to watch Premam too. (Ofcourse I watched it with subs, manaki Hindi ye raadu sarigga.... inka malayalam aithey illileyoo..;) ) The way Malayalam Industry is making films now a days is spending very low budget and getting huge revenues. Actually Premam will come into that category.It's an emotional ride filled with good performances,extreme highs & lows and situational comedy and you travel with the characters throughout the story. Considering the scope of Malayalam industry this film has taken it to the next level actually. Overall it is a visually appealing chronicle of love with few blemishes.",undoubtedly premam is winner,dont think otherwise i wrote review film which got released 6 months back what do when i want watch other language films i need wait subs that is where delay anyhow here we go premam film doesnt have strong story line but i wasnt bored second way i got recommendations watch ustad hotel bangalore days neelakasam pachadkal chuvannabhumi likewise i got recommendations watch premam too ofcourse i watched it with subs manaki hindi ye raadu sarigga inka malayalam aithey illileyoo way malayalam industry is making films now days is spending very low budget getting huge revenues actually premam will come into that category its emotional ride filled with good performances extreme highs lows situational comedy you travel with characters throughout story considering scope malayalam industry this film has taken it next level actually overall it is visually appealing chronicle love with few blemishes,0.4616666666666666,0.11666666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,"Isn't it all about the telling, though","Observations from multiple big-screen viewings, most of those without English sub-titles (important-enough factor, since I do not understand the nuances of the Malayalam language, the way a native speaker would).Had no idea about this when it released, other than the fact that it was a reunion of sorts for most of the talent in front of, and behind, 'Neram', which was okey-dokey, to say the best. Had no expectations going in, other than the promise of good music and visuals that the trailer promised. Well, the first viewing kinda blew my mind away, since I never thought that being short on content, from a high level perspective (Infatuated boys love, lose and love again, then lose again, and then almost love again - to put it mildly) could afford so many opportunities for some amazing writing, acting, visuals and scores. Every person in charge of his/her department absolutely excels, and in terms of style, this hearkens back to 'Iyobinte Pusthakam', regardless of the differing mileux and genres of both works. I've always been a proponent of content being king, but this one kinda screams for execution/style over all else, and I've bought into that stream of thought firmly after seeing how well this one has been brought to life. Among its many strengths, casting is key. With one actor having to evolve over the 3 phases of life that the movie focuses on, Nivin Pauly, and the actors playing his friends, need to look, sound and behave in an age-appropriate way in each of those phases, while being consistent with their age and state of mind within those. And boy do they nail it, with the 3 main leads, and assorted characters around them having their own individual criss-crossing arcs across those phases. Another one of its main strengths are all of the running jokes/gags (one of which is to do with spelling/grammar/structural mistakes in a letter professing teen love, that loops all the way until the end) across each of those phases, that is not left hanging at any time, and one of the main reasons for multiple viewings, where one can marvel at the effort that has been made across this work of art. The background score is one of the strongest ever committed to celluloid, hearkening back to last year's superb 'Ohm Shanthi Ohshaana' (trivia: the helmer on that one, Jude Anthany Joseph, makes a funny cameo in this one) being as strong in its scoring department. Shaan Rahman is not missed, with this one having Rajesh Murugesan doing the honors, as good as he was in Anthony Putheran's earlier 'Neram' (pun fully intended, if you understand the language). Technically speaking, though it might seem minor, this movie integrates CG almost seamlessly, and this generation's film-makers, especially the ones who do not place any weight or value on that aspect, and others, need to take a page out of this movie, and see how they can 'up' their overall game. Nivin Pauly has always been good, subtly taking over the characters he (literally/figuratively) inhabits in each of his flicks - '1983', 'Ohm Shanthi Ohshaana', 'Oru Vadakkan Selfie', 'Neram' and even 'Ivide', in which, I thought, his character got short shrift. In my first viewing of this though, I wasn't all gung-ho about all aspects of this flick as I am being now, with my criticisms spanning (my perceived, at the time) lack of new content and how the leads' family lives are kept to background/ignored altogether, even with strong casting on those supporting characters who are (unfairly, as I thought at the time) ignored (example: Renji Panicker, who plays Pauly's dad, who is fantastic in the 2 scenes he's in, but has nothing else to do). I don't feel as strongly about those aspects now, but thought I'd just put them out there.All in all, this one makes for multiple great viewings, especially among those who consider themselves students of the craft. And yes, great for mainstream audiences as well, which kinda explains its box office, as well as cementing cult status.",isnt it all about telling though,observations multiple big screen viewings most those without english sub titles important enough factor since i do not understand nuances malayalam language way native speaker would had no idea about this when it released other than fact that it was reunion sorts most talent front behind neram which was okey dokey say best had no expectations going other than promise good music visuals that trailer promised well first viewing kinda blew my mind away since i never thought that being short content high level perspective infatuated boys love lose love again then lose again then almost love again put it mildly could afford so many opportunities some amazing writing acting visuals scores every person charge his her department absolutely excels terms style this hearkens back iyobinte pusthakam regardless differing mileux genres both works ive always been proponent content being king but this one kinda screams execution style over all else ive bought into that stream thought firmly after seeing how well this one has been brought life among its many strengths casting is key with one actor having evolve over 3 phases life that movie focuses nivin pauly actors playing his friends need look sound behave age appropriate way each those phases while being consistent with their age state mind within those boy do they nail it with 3 main leads assorted characters around them having their own individual criss crossing arcs across those phases another one its main strengths are all running jokes gags one which is do with spelling grammar structural mistakes letter professing teen love that loops all way until end across each those phases that is not left hanging at any time one main reasons multiple viewings where one can marvel at effort that has been made across this work art background score is one strongest ever committed celluloid hearkening back last years superb ohm shanthi ohshaana trivia helmer that one jude anthany joseph makes funny cameo this one being as strong its scoring department shaan rahman is not missed with this one having rajesh murugesan doing honors as good as he was anthony putherans earlier neram pun fully intended if you understand language technically speaking though it might seem minor this movie integrates cg almost seamlessly this generations film makers especially ones who do not place any weight or value that aspect others need take page out this movie see how they can up their overall game nivin pauly has always been good subtly taking over characters he literally figuratively inhabits each his flicks 1983 ohm shanthi ohshaana oru vadakkan selfie neram even ivide which i thought his character got short shrift my first viewing this though i wasnt all gung ho about all aspects this flick as i am being now with my criticisms spanning my perceived at time lack new content how leads family lives are kept background ignored altogether even with strong casting those supporting characters who are unfairly as i thought at time ignored example renji panicker who plays paulys dad who is fantastic 2 scenes hes but has nothing else do i dont feel as strongly about those aspects now but thought id just put them out there all all this one makes multiple great viewings especially among those who consider themselves students craft yes great mainstream audiences as well which kinda explains its box office as well as cementing cult status,0.46235639981908644,0.21263229308005427,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Nivin pauly and Alphonse puthren taking malayalam cinema to an another level!,"This film is just mind blowing!,i have never seen such a well executed movie with a brilliant sound and screen play in Malayalam cinema.As the title cards of Alphonse Puthren's 'Premam' came up, I couldn't stop thinking of those butterflies - the swallow tails and the cabbage whites, the blue bottles and the bird wings - that once flitted around with fragrant memories of an entire generation's childhood laden on their pretty wings. They seem to have wholly vanished and are no longer seen fluttering around these alley ways ridden with smoke and dust and have perhaps moved on to greener meadows where the sparkle of an unsullied dew drop awaits. It is this perfumed whiff of reminiscences that the film rakes up with its very first scene that makes 'Premam' one of the best films that I have watched till now this year; one that it maintains till the very last scene that comes almost after three hours. Bursting with hopefulness and loaded with resilience, 'Premam' is a stunning cinematic piece that talks of the process of falling in love, breaking a heart, nurturing a stinging memory or two for the rest of your life and above all, letting go and moving on.'Premam' follows its protagonist George (Nivin Pauly) and the three women who walk into his life - Mary (Anupama Parameswaran), his first love during those baffling pre-degree days, Malar (Sai Pallavi), his new teacher at college who surprisingly reciprocates his feelings and Celin (Madonna Sebastian) who finally lays down an anchor to his otherwise bobbling life. And then there is love itself, and the different shades that the oldest of human emotions brings in its fray. It does take a few years for George to get over the dejection that his first love had brought along with, and when Malar grabs his hand and walks forward life sprouts flowers all around. It's when these petals had long wilted and withered by, that Celin arrives accentuating once and for all that fresh shoots are bound to spring up after the heavy rains.'Premam' adopts a juicily unmarked conversational tone for the most part, and the audience draws in a few chairs and sits along with George and his pals as they plan and replan his life. It's no shocker then that his joys become ours as much as his grief does; his exultation and desolation are all ours to share as well.'Premam' spellbinds you with some real awesome performances from a group of young actors who seem to have thrown caution to the winds and who have gone at their respective roles - long or short - with a vengeance. The casting director of the film merits a bow, for there is not one actor in it who looks out of place.Nivin Pauly as George is tremendously remarkable, and comes up with one of his best performances till date. As he breaks down and walks away from the real love of his life, he manages to throw an entire cinema hall into silence with his tears, as much as he had driven them into irrepressible fits of mirth not much earlier. The three girls are equally extraordinary, but it's Sai Pallavi who wins the show hands down, with a bravura feat as the guest lecturer Malar who wins over George's heart. She lights up the screen with her fabulous screen presence, and with the most precise of expressions underlines that she is here to stay. Madonna Sebastian with her curious Bambi-esque eyes and agreeable smile breezes in while Anupama Parameshwaran retains the youthful charm that is required of Mary to the hilt.It's impossible to think of 'Premam' without that dazzling musical score by Rajesh Murugesan, with many a hummable number forming a part of the highly notable soundtrack. 'Premam' almost qualifies for a musical, and a decent one at that, since this is one film where you really do not mind those songs gushing into the narrative unapologetically; where the music camouflages itself and remains an indiscernible part of the account. Equally arresting is the cinematography by Anand C Chandran, who throws in an assortment of splendid visuals that capture the essence of the film to the core. His camera is unhesitant and ventures as much to the corner of an aisle to catch an incessantly chirping sparrow in action or on to the placid waters of a pool where a wayward frog has landed himself in. The verdant greenness that pervades his indoor and outdoor frames is stimulating and this ocular wizardry that Anand throws in contributes much to the stellar film that 'Premam' evolves into.

7.0,A Visually Appealing Chronicle Of Love. ♦ 71%,"What do we talk about when we talk about love? One can expect a detailed answer from Alphonse Putharen's visually stunning second feature aptly titled Premam.Nivin Pauly plays the ubiquitous lover George whose eventful life, from the age of 17 to when he grows into an adult, is what basically the film talks about. Other than his supportive and hugely carefree friends, there are 3 to 5 characters that play pivotal roles in his life. I will abstain from mentioning who and what they are because I think the makers purposely avoided publishing a trailer or showing them in the colorful posters. George is shamefully flirtatious and we, as an audience, almost empathize for him towards the end. Because he is one man greatly affected by love, and all that comes with it.It starts by showing the rawness of the college-school scene that is prevalent in Kerala, where lungi-clad boys await their chosen girls to come out of their protective dens just so they can blow a whistle or pass that atrociously written love letter. Brilliance is the only word that can be used to describe the exceptional writing that introduces us into the film, hinting at what would be a long journey, in parts. The parlance, the neighborhood (Aluva Puzha, et al), the country behavior, and the relatability factor is so deliciously palatable. You will be swooned over by the photography and the inventive camera work, which reminds us about the creative person at the helm.There is an ocean of humor with great timing that will definitely bowl you over. The small talks, those rejection slurs, those native semi-expletives, and wonderful situational comedy are what many sequences of the film made of. The textual graphics and arresting rock music will first intimidate you, and then numb your senses as you stay hypnotized in your seat.Pauly has grown glamorous and confident since his Malarvadi Club days and with this, he has really included himself in the top actors currently working in Malayalam cinema. I could even say he surpasses Fahadh Faasil in terms of character portrayal because he is just too damn good. The supporting cast is equally competent, including the débutantes. Great sound mixing, great editing, great music, great direction, great art setup, great everything, unless one starts to wonder about the story's movement. 3 songs stuffed in the first 40 minutes points to the most dangerous fact about the film, which is the absence of a measurable story. The second half blows a little, but soon picks up. The story, told in three parts, is a linear outline of a 5-second account of George's life, and thus, looks stretched. Of course, it manages to salvage the problem with a good climax that is followed by Putharen's remarkable crediting style.Yes, when we talk about love, we usually talk about a bed of roses. But, Premam as a film that talks about the proposals, the rejection, the anticipation, the competition, the tragedy, the happiness, and the pleasure that is derived out of a sweet thing called love. The writing is immensely powerful if one manages to stay hooked, which the filmmaking factors do ensure.It is definitely a watchable film that will brighten you up, but won't change anything. Because people still believe that love is calculated, when it is usually just random.BOTTOM LINE: Premam is a kaleidoscopic narrative of a man's life as he goes on a wide search for love, which is sure to make even the most serious man laugh like a drain. Recommended!RATING: 7 stars out of 10. 2015's best film yet.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

9.0,Premam is an awesome movie,"Filled with simple jokes, emotional performances and situational comedy, it feels fresh and beautiful than any other recent sterile Malayalam movies. The second act with Malar is simply the best part of the movie and where all the ""Premam"" happens. Kudos to a mesmerizing performance by Sai Pallavi as Malar. Nivin Pauly is at his best, some of his scenes are jaw droppingly powerful. Anupama E Parameswaran and the rest of the cast does a great job too. It's an emotional ride with extreme highs and lows and you travel with the characters through their arc and the story is gracefully wound up. It's one of those films you never want to end, coz you're having such a great time following its story and characters. Cinematography is beautifully ambient, music is catchy, story is simple and Direction is superb. The love of Alphonse Puthren is evident in his Directing and editing.

6.0,Gut rot liquor in a Scotch whiskey bottle .....,"Dear Alphonse Puthren, I think I know the reason why Premam was such a huge hit despite being a pretty average film.You conjured up a few clever and remarkable moments, beautiful images and cast pretty women whose combined impact sort of out-weighed the poor writing and average acting.Your film offers scenes from three different stages in the life of George. The first stage is his life as a love lorn teenager. This portion of the film has a magical and almost dreamlike quality to it, mainly due to the sepia tinged cinematography. Frankly Alphonse, some of the scenes were quite cringe worthy and the teenager's antics amounted to stalking of the female character.The second stage is George's life as a rowdy college student. This part was quite entertaining and the slow motion fight scene was very well done. The actress Sai Pallavi makes quite an impact with her pizza face and wild dancing.The third stage is George's life as an adult. This part was unremarkable at best. But the film does not go on for too long. The language you used in the film is very candid and colloquial. Slow motion scenes are used to great effect. The visuals were very striking The songs were catchy and the women were gorgeous.Nivin Pauly and his beard make quite an impact - especially in the second part of the film. The supporting was average at best. When you really think about it, the film is nonsense. But it is tolerable nonsense. I will watch your next film, Alphonse Puthren. Hope you can work harder on your writing. Best Regards, Pimpin.

9.0,A directorial delight!,"Yes yes Nivin Pauly has acted well but more than that it was the director's vision which gave this movie its heart. The storyline is nothing new - a young carefree lad George falls in love for the first time and many times thereafter and how his outlook of the world changes with each lady love of his life. Alphonse Puthren gave a new life to the script with his impeccable cinematography and detailing. Each and every role is etched perfectly and acted with excellence. The roles played by the support actors as George's best friends tingle your heart because when their friend is heartbroken they cry with him too. After a very long time has a movie come where the emphasis is not on the family drama but on the adopted family that we get as our friends. The background score of the movie is excellent keeping up with the tempo of the movie frames. Though I felt there were a couple of unwanted scenes here and there but whole and whole it was a good entertainer.

10.0,Premam - Azhage.. Malare..,"Okay, we travelled some 35 kms to catch a Malayalam movie that too running without subtitles, which starts at midnight (11:50 pm) at Mayajaal and reached our room back in the morning 3:30. We were mad to do this, but we did it. We weren't disappointed, it was really worth it.Premam, second movie from Alphonse Puthren who gave us a bilingual Neram, which really caught my eye and also introduced Nivin Pauly and Nazria to me. Premam is about Nivin's three stages of love. When he was in school, then during his final year of college and he was an adult. It was like Autograph, but this was even more fun.Alphonse Puthren has given his best in his second movie. And, Nivin as usual he was fantastic and it was really a treat to watch him on screen. I thought Oru Vadakkan Selfie is going to be the best of his movie this year, but this one was even better. First love was fun, where almost all the boys in her neighbourhood follows Mary when she leaves her tuition centre. And, she chooses someone else and Nivin ends up helping them in their love. This part was pictured in most beautiful locale. How green is Kerala, fantastic.Second love was the best in the movie. It happens during his final year in college when he fell in love with a Tamil speaking guest lecturer Malar. She looks so lovely and her Kuthu dance was terrific that was literally stunning. If I have seen the title credits correctly, I think she's the one who choreographed the Rockankuthu song. Looking forward to see her in more films. And, there was another lecturer who loves Malar teacher one-sided. He was fun who even ask Nivin himself to help him and he teaches Mava sorry Java. Nivin's rugged look in this part suits him well and maintains that ""gethu"". And, this love ends in a tragic way.The third and final part's love story comes with an unexpected twist. It may look bit too much, but you still got to love it. The director himself does a cameo in this part.Music was really fantastic. Aluva and Malare songs were too good, especially Malare with Malar teacher. And, Scene Contra was a different love failure song. The interval looked forced as if just because it was mandatory like a strategic timeout in IPL when the team where going good. And, cinematography was rich and the director himself is the editor as well so that part was handled well.All three ladies was beautiful, but we came out in love with Malar teacher. Nivin's two friends also come along with him throughout the movie and provide enough laughs. We got some 70% of the jokes, I wish they had released it in Tamil also like Neram or at least could have added subs, but never mind.Easily the best romantic movie of this year so far. After OKK, this movie puts a smile on your face from the start until it ends and I loved this even more than OKK.The movie's running length was big, but you never feel it. Premam was like a long ride on a rainy day in an empty road with Raja sir songs for company. You just wish the ride goes on and on.My Rating - 5.0/5.0. Not to be missed.",premam azhage malare,okay we travelled some 35 kms catch malayalam movie that too running without subtitles which starts at midnight 11 50 pm at mayajaal reached our room back morning 3 30 we were mad do this but we did it we werent disappointed it was really worth it premam second movie alphonse puthren who gave us bilingual neram which really caught my eye also introduced nivin pauly nazria me premam is about nivins three stages love when he was school then during his final year college he was adult it was like autograph but this was even more fun alphonse puthren has given his best his second movie nivin as usual he was fantastic it was really treat watch him screen i thought oru vadakkan selfie is going be best his movie this year but this one was even better first love was fun where almost all boys her neighbourhood follows mary when she leaves her tuition centre she chooses someone else nivin ends up helping them their love this part was pictured most beautiful locale how green is kerala fantastic second love was best movie it happens during his final year college when he fell love with tamil speaking guest lecturer malar she looks so lovely her kuthu dance was terrific that was literally stunning if i have seen title credits correctly i think shes one who choreographed rockankuthu song looking forward see her more films there was another lecturer who loves malar teacher one sided he was fun who even ask nivin himself help him he teaches mava sorry java nivins rugged look this part suits him well maintains that gethu this love ends tragic way third final parts love story comes with unexpected twist it may look bit too much but you still got love it director himself does cameo this part music was really fantastic aluva malare songs were too good especially malare with malar teacher scene contra was different love failure song interval looked forced as if just because it was mandatory like strategic timeout ipl when team where going good cinematography was rich director himself is editor as well so that part was handled well all three ladies was beautiful but we came out love with malar teacher nivins two friends also come along with him throughout movie provide enough laughs we got some 70 jokes i wish they had released it tamil also like neram or at least could have added subs but never mind easily best romantic movie this year so far after okk this movie puts smile your face start until it ends i loved this even more than okk movies running length was big but you never feel it premam was like long ride rainy day empty road with raja sir songs company you just wish ride goes my rating 5 0 5 0 not be missed,0.5291666666666667,0.24828431372549015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6.0,Old pickle in new jar,"I watched the movie after all the hype settled down and DVD was released. I watched it just to know what is so much to hail about , is it worth the hype or just another movie that calls itself new generation.First of all it is mixture of old seen things in a more trendy new gen way that's all.Before I start about the movie I must say Alphonse Puthren needs to understand the meaning of being humble, because one movie got hit and he began writing open letter to other directors as though he has done something that no one could achieve.I am saying this because people like Sachin Tendulkar or Abdul Kalam Sir have achieved a lot. Sachin holds the record for most number of record breaking and Abdul Kalam sir has worked with most noted people and has worked for our country. We respect them for their achievements as well as their humbleness.There are many people whom we respect because of their humbleness.He created hype by claiming that he took this movie 5K resolution and no other theatre had this provision and began criticising the Cinema. People who think they know everything are the most ignorant people (because if he knew that no cinema has 5k resolution provision he wouldn't have took it in that way). He needs to understand that movie makers,actors and all associated had their ups and downs, I am not going to lecture about how he has to change or what he should do. Let him decide whether to humiliate himself and belittle himself by trying to show off his ignorance, that's up to him. The movie has a lot of elements that Malayali audiences have nurtured and loved for decades. A hero who is anti hero and hero at the same time, like we used to love Lalettan in his Devasuram or Aaram Thampuran or Thoovanathumbikal or Mammuka from Kottayam Kunjachan, a lover who is dedicated to his love, friends who always provide shoulder, a dad who is friendly, college ragging, college lecturers and heroines who falls easily for the hero's charm.I personally think the movie was inspired (even though people wont accept) from several movies like Thoovanthumbikal where Lalettan was sort of anti hero and hero in college, Cherans autograph,Gautam Vasudeva Menon's Vaarnam Aaayiram, friends who provide support to everything like in classmates or any other 80's movie.I am teaching as guest lecturer in one of the named college in Trivandrum and after the movie became hit some of my colleagues who were teaching were called ""malare"" because the heroine in the movie is a guest lecturer who falls in love with the heroine, the students intensity of calling them increased and it lead to issue(even though a small one). I personally believe movies do inspire you to do what they show and this is one example of it, but it doesn't necessarily mean that all people do it, if that is so then after thoovanathumbikal got released every brother like character would be pimping out for his younger one or all people who failed in love would be going to prostitutes to avenge them. Nothing like that some people take these as part of movie and nothing more but some take inspiration to do it without thinking it could hurt others. Is there so much in the movie for the hype between youngsters calling it their movie and other people saying it is degrading the ethical values and moral values??? I personally think this movie should have been left without people bashing over moral values and ethics, that way the hype surrounding around the movie wouldn't have gained momentum, like India did to Indias daughter(they banned it and people began anxious as to what is so much about that documentary)??Finally the movie has pace till college days then it settles down to more of slow paced movie which has nothing much of an attraction except for the song and macho hero entering again into the arena, the music was good especially the Avalu vendra, the dappankoothu song (before the dance song or last music during credits), aluva puzha and malare. Anyway the movie starts in teens and ends up in middle age. Personally I think Nivin did justice to the role, because his portrayal of character in Ivide was horrible,terrible and pitiable which made several people think how he won State award. Sai pallavi was convincing as Tamil Guest lecturer, Kichu and friend character were notable, Vinay fort's professor character can be seen in many colleges where people don't know how to explain the concept and everything.The scenes do bring in nostalgia and a work that gets OK mark thats all. It is far from being a classic but yes it has got some people's attention that is all it is.",old pickle new jar,i watched movie after all hype settled down dvd was released i watched it just know what is so much hail about is it worth hype or just another movie that calls itself new generation first all it is mixture old seen things more trendy new gen way thats all before i start about movie i must say alphonse puthren needs understand meaning being humble because one movie got hit he began writing open letter other directors as though he has done something that no one could achieve i am saying this because people like sachin tendulkar or abdul kalam sir have achieved lot sachin holds record most number record breaking abdul kalam sir has worked with most noted people has worked our country we respect them their achievements as well as their humbleness there are many people whom we respect because their humbleness he created hype by claiming that he took this movie 5k resolution no other theatre had this provision began criticising cinema people who think they know everything are most ignorant people because if he knew that no cinema has 5k resolution provision he wouldnt have took it that way he needs understand that movie makers actors all associated had their ups downs i am not going lecture about how he has change or what he should do let him decide whether humiliate himself belittle himself by trying show off his ignorance thats up him movie has lot elements that malayali audiences have nurtured loved decades hero who is anti hero hero at same time like we used love lalettan his devasuram or aaram thampuran or thoovanathumbikal or mammuka kottayam kunjachan lover who is dedicated his love friends who always provide shoulder dad who is friendly college ragging college lecturers heroines who falls easily heros charm i personally think movie was inspired even though people wont accept several movies like thoovanthumbikal where lalettan was sort anti hero hero college cherans autograph gautam vasudeva menons vaarnam aaayiram friends who provide support everything like classmates or any other 80s movie i am teaching as guest lecturer one named college trivandrum after movie became hit some my colleagues who were teaching were called malare because heroine movie is guest lecturer who falls love with heroine students intensity calling them increased it lead issue even though small one i personally believe movies do inspire you do what they show this is one example it but it doesnt necessarily mean that all people do it if that is so then after thoovanathumbikal got released every brother like character would be pimping out his younger one or all people who failed love would be going prostitutes avenge them nothing like that some people take these as part movie nothing more but some take inspiration do it without thinking it could hurt others is there so much movie hype between youngsters calling it their movie other people saying it is degrading ethical values moral values i personally think this movie should have been left without people bashing over moral values ethics that way hype surrounding around movie wouldnt have gained momentum like india did indias daughter they banned it people began anxious as what is so much about that documentary finally movie has pace till college days then it settles down more slow paced movie which has nothing much attraction except song macho hero entering again into arena music was good especially avalu vendra dappankoothu song before dance song or last music during credits aluva puzha malare anyway movie starts teens ends up middle age personally i think nivin did justice role because his portrayal character ivide was horrible terrible pitiable which made several people think how he won state award sai pallavi was convincing as tamil guest lecturer kichu friend character were notable vinay forts professor character can be seen many colleges where people dont know how explain concept everything scenes do bring nostalgia work that gets ok mark thats all it is far being classic but yes it has got some peoples attention that is all it is,0.4377525252525253,0.12766122766122764,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Its Great!!,"First of all I watched the movie without any preconceptions and expectations as I thought it would be a simple love story as the name suggests, but in turn it came out to be an excellent entertainer. The movie is so captivating right from the beginning. It's a mixed bucket of our nostalgic childhood and the exact revelation of our modern day life. Each and every actor played complete justice to their roles through out the movie. It's another type of a feel excellent movie which pumps you to the core. And of course there are many surprise packages indeed. And Alphonse Puthren, you are an absolute genius! The way you directed the movie deserves great applause.

1.0,"""Highly Overrated""",Nearly wasted my 3 hours. I don't understand even now why people're geeting hyper after watching this film. Only for attractive smile of 'Sai Pallavi' & 'Anupama' or for Nivin only? What kind of story is it? Don't know! But I guess acting & attractive dance of Pllavi made them hyper. No lessons from this movie. Moreover it can misguide & excitws youngs to fall in love with cute & attractive teachers; How funny! How can a teacher tolerate such a guy? Isn't it funny practically? First one hour was really very boring & unbearable for me. It deserves 4 stars or may be less from me. But as it is overrated I'm giving it only 1. Before watching any movie I check imdb rating.

5.0,Premam is watchable for its laughter moments and is also believable. It has its own flaws as well.,"Premam is a romantic-comedy film by Alphonse Putharen. The basic plot of the movie is to show the life of teenager, who gets infatuated, falls in love, goes through his share of heartbreaks, cries his heart out, drinks, smokes. The movie has got great reviews from various parts of Kerala, but, I was not very happy to watch the movie. The way storytelling is done did not appeal to me at all. One of the most beautiful emotion i.e. love is the central theme of this movie, but it did not appear so. More than 80% of the time, the boys are drinking, smoking and talking about love life. Director intends to talk about one girl at one point of time (there are three in this). What was the obsession behind showing that the girl is having strong contenders around, since lot many are wooing a single girl. I would agree that, the attempt to show a teenager's life and habits is clear, but still, lot of drags were felt in the movie. The movie might turn out to be a commercial hit, since many youngsters may be able to relate with these, but I had a strong disconnect with the whole movie. Lot of subplots is there in the movie without any reason. Neither did those sub plots add any value to the movie nor any meaning to the plot.Nivin Pauly plays the main protagonist of the movie as George David. Timeline shows George's birth in 1984 and it quickly moves to 2000. The opening scenes are definitely good where George is trying to write a love letter to Mary (Anupama Parameshwaran), whom he met in Church. Shambu (Shabareesh Varma) and Koya (Krishna Shankar), George's great friends, accompany him to woo Mary. The initial few scenes are definitely very good, but as the movie progresses, it starts dragging, many scenes were repetitive and predictable. George had to face failure in his love for Mary.The timeline moves further, George and gang enters college, and they do lot of mischievous activities as well, don't mind getting suspended, come to the classroom drunk. At times, I felt that Nivin is being asked to imitate Mohanlal. Up for ragging, comes across a guest lecturer Malar (Sai Pallavi). George feels infatuated by her in the beginning, which slowly develops to love. That also does not give a happy ending.Timeline moves to 2014, there we get to see the third phase of George's life as an entrepreneur running Café Agape.What happens thereafter? How does George deal with his heartbreaks? What went wrong between Malar and George? Did a girl enter in the third phase as well? Who is she?The movie has definitely its own moments of humour: George writing love letter to Mary, his dialogue about Mary not required to change her name after marriage since her father's name is also George, his calling friends in the midnight to ask whether he can call Mary or not, many of his teenager antics, he and friends standing in awe when a traditional looking Malar does break dance etc.Certain scenes were just added without any specific purpose, logic or relevance. One such scene was the college festival function, where one person from George's group dance drops at the last moment and somebody from outside were brought to fill in the gap.Songs have definitely added meaning to the plot. Songs clearly mention the transition happening to George when he moves from infatuation to serious love to life-long commitment.The best moment: The dance sequence in the college festival.Premam is watchable for its laughter moments and is also believable. It has its own flaws as well.",premam is watchable its laughter moments is also believable it has its own flaws as well,premam is romantic comedy film by alphonse putharen basic plot movie is show life teenager who gets infatuated falls love goes through his share heartbreaks cries his heart out drinks smokes movie has got great reviews various parts kerala but i was not very happy watch movie way storytelling is done did not appeal me at all one most beautiful emotion i e love is central theme this movie but it did not appear so more than 80 time boys are drinking smoking talking about love life director intends talk about one girl at one point time there are three this what was obsession behind showing that girl is having strong contenders around since lot many are wooing single girl i would agree that attempt show teenagers life habits is clear but still lot drags were felt movie movie might turn out be commercial hit since many youngsters may be able relate with these but i had strong disconnect with whole movie lot subplots is there movie without any reason neither did those sub plots add any value movie nor any meaning plot nivin pauly plays main protagonist movie as george david timeline shows georges birth 1984 it quickly moves 2000 opening scenes are definitely good where george is trying write love letter mary anupama parameshwaran whom he met church shambu shabareesh varma koya krishna shankar georges great friends accompany him woo mary initial few scenes are definitely very good but as movie progresses it starts dragging many scenes were repetitive predictable george had face failure his love mary timeline moves further george gang enters college they do lot mischievous activities as well dont mind getting suspended come classroom drunk at times i felt that nivin is being asked imitate mohanlal up ragging comes across guest lecturer malar sai pallavi george feels infatuated by her beginning which slowly develops love that also does not give happy ending timeline moves 2014 there we get see third phase georges life as entrepreneur running caf agape what happens thereafter how does george deal with his heartbreaks what went wrong between malar george did girl enter third phase as well who is she movie has definitely its own moments humour george writing love letter mary his dialogue about mary not required change her name after marriage since her fathers name is also george his calling friends midnight ask whether he can call mary or not many his teenager antics he friends standing awe when traditional looking malar does break dance etc certain scenes were just added without any specific purpose logic or relevance one such scene was college festival function where one person georges group dance drops at last moment somebody outside were brought fill gap songs have definitely added meaning plot songs clearly mention transition happening george when he moves infatuation serious love life long commitment best moment dance sequence college festival premam is watchable its laughter moments is also believable it has its own flaws as well,0.5016914623837702,0.2086435615666385,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"

8.0,Team Work Entertainer,"Premam is not an extra ordinary Love Saga but it has got the elements of entertainment like fun, love, nostalgia (that our generation 80- 95 borns :P), love failures, depression, music, comedy, etc. Premam can be called as Alphons Putheran's baby. His excellent scripting and on the top making with crispy editing makes this movie a wonderful and highly energized entertainer. This movie made me to remember my childhood memories, all the naughty things did during my teen and college life. Nivin Pauly.. His screen presence was amazing (But in some scenes, i think he had that thattathin marayathu effect) and his acting skills (especially in the second half) was terrific. Shabareesh Verma & Krisha Sankar delivered good performances and their roles and casting was adequate for the movie. The simple dialogues (Excellent dialogues) which we use in our daily life was fun. Wilson Thomas, Vinay Fort (he was rocking), Shoubin Shaheer (PT Master - his counters were terrific), Renji Panicker (blasted), Maniyan Pillai all did justice to their roles and was brilliantly casted. Special Mention: Girirajan Kozhi Anupama Parameshwaran was okay with her role, but thanks to Alphons not to cast her for too long. Sai Pallavi as Malar, the celebrated newcomer did a wonderful job in Premam. I even thought when i watched her in her introduction, why these fb Pulees are so fond of her, and i got the answer of my doubt when the movie progressed. Her acting skills and the dance moves and her SMILE were feast to the eyes. Madonna Sebastian as Celine did a good job and was beautiful. Perfect casting by Alphons (the kid celine and grown up celine looked perfect). The Nothing fresh in the story, but the treatment and making of the movie was near to perfect. Alphons Putharen you did a wonderful job. Kudos to you. This is not a simple thing to know the pulse of the audience and delivering it to fullest. The Background Score by Rajesh Murugesan added the feel to the movie to a great extent. The violin piece just blown me away (Now my ringtone :P). Shabareesh Verma's lyrics were good and the music were also too good. The songs were really good especially Malare.. That was simply awesome. Special Mention: This is the first timein my theatre experience, the audience still didn't move out of their seats during the end credits.
