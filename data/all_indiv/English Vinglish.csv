10.0,A Nutshell Review: English Vinglish,"Many will know I have been following Bollywood films over the last few years with keen interest, with one of the prime reasons being, why not? We have dedicated halls and screens which are always showing the latest the industry has to offer, very often having same day premieres, and I cannot fathom having to close this option off for the lack of language ability. English subtitles is a boon, and my only option to understand what's being said on screen. English is of course the plot element here in this film, written and directed by Gauri Shinde, who has made a film that's strong in heart, and powerful in performance.I'm talking about Sridevi's comeback to cinema, having retired some 15 years ago to raise her kids. And this leave of absence surely helped her in her protagonist role here, but more on that later. For those unaware, like I was previously, Sridevi is arguably the best actress Indian Cinema has produced over the last few decades, and it is only today that I fully understood why. Her performance as Shashi, the traditional Indian housewife, is impeccable, and the littlest of nuances put into her role, reaped results in the manifold. As a line of dialogue described, her eyes are like coffee drops in a saucer of milk, and that in itself is an understatement.Charisma is something that you have, or have not, and Sridevi's presence is something that arrests your attention immediately when she comes on screen. Carrying the entire movie, it's unbelievable to think that she's pushing 50 already, as her performance here will probably inspire many actresses of today's generation sit up and take note, to realize that they still have a long way to go to reach a fraction of her level. I'm sold, impressed, and very eager to catch up on her filmography to see what more she had to offer during the 80s and 90s when she was at the peak of her popularity then.Her comeback in English Vinglish is a casting coup for its filmmakers, and let's not forget Shinde's story which was custom fit for her as well, playing the role of a mother, which probably made it quite an easy transition back to the industry. But it's an important role because one of the key takeaways from the narrative, is how we often take those who love us for granted, and as part of the process, inadvertently hurt them too. We may not realize it, or sometimes we do, but these hurt will likely be the worst possible. A callous word and a careless comment go a long way, and is difficult to, or sometimes cannot be taken back.It's something many of us have been through and experienced, regardless which side of the equation one was on, where respect does not get accorded, and where words go out to make others feel small about themselves. In Shashi's case, this happens to be her lack of command in the English language, perceived to be an ability of social status, made quite unbearable when her children thinks it so, and when her husband (Adil Hussain) also gets in on a private joke with their daughter.The film's story worked on many layers, and what I especially admired is how Sridevi becomes the spokesperson for lessons without being too overt about it, save for the ending speech that hammers in the emotion, and is sure to make your eyes well up. It deals with, on a macro level, how as humans we should be helpful and tolerant to those who don't speak our language or understand our culture, that one shouldn't be made to think one's superior just because, or make the other look small. And on the more micro level, the structure of the family and its importance. All these and more, told through a story about a woman finding her inner strength to stand out, stand up and be counted, building and reinforcing confidence that she's more than just a Laddoo machine.But social factors aside, the more obvious ingredient that's put into the movie, is the Mind Your Language type scenes when Shashi enrolls herself into an English crash course to learn conversational English in four weeks. Instead of Mr Brown, there's Mr David (Cory Hibbs) the teacher (whose sexual orientation again highlights the differences in the human race and the need for tolerance and acceptance), and a motley crew of classmates from various parts of the world bonding together. From a woman who centered her life around family, building a network of friends became something of a lifeline of sorts, in keeping life interesting through the sharing of experiences, and of course, food.English Vinglish has everything a typical Indian film contains, from comedy to romance - handled with such maturity - culture and language. What more, it has Sridevi's remarkable return, showing why she was, and still is, one of the iconic female actresses ever to grace the screens of Indian Cinema. A definite recommendation, and though formulaic at parts, is delivered with such slickness, that I'd shortlist it as one of the best this year.",nutshell review english vinglish,many will know i have been following bollywood films over last few years with keen interest with one prime reasons being why not we have dedicated halls screens which are always showing latest industry has offer very often having same day premieres i cannot fathom having close this option off lack language ability english subtitles is boon my only option understand whats being said screen english is course plot element here this film written directed by gauri shinde who has made film thats strong heart powerful performance im talking about sridevis comeback cinema having retired some 15 years ago raise her kids this leave absence surely helped her her protagonist role here but more that later those unaware like i was previously sridevi is arguably best actress indian cinema has produced over last few decades it is only today that i fully understood why her performance as shashi traditional indian housewife is impeccable littlest nuances put into her role reaped results manifold as line dialogue described her eyes are like coffee drops saucer milk that itself is understatement charisma is something that you have or have not sridevis presence is something that arrests your attention immediately when she comes screen carrying entire movie its unbelievable think that shes pushing 50 already as her performance here will probably inspire many actresses todays generation sit up take note realize that they still have long way go reach fraction her level im sold impressed very eager catch up her filmography see what more she had offer during 80s 90s when she was at peak her popularity then her comeback english vinglish is casting coup its filmmakers lets not forget shindes story which was custom fit her as well playing role mother which probably made it quite easy transition back industry but its important role because one key takeaways narrative is how we often take those who love us granted as part process inadvertently hurt them too we may not realize it or sometimes we do but these hurt will likely be worst possible callous word careless comment go long way is difficult or sometimes cannot be taken back its something many us have been through experienced regardless which side equation one was where respect does not get accorded where words go out make others feel small about themselves shashis case this happens be her lack command english language perceived be ability social status made quite unbearable when her children thinks it so when her husband adil hussain also gets private joke with their daughter films story worked many layers what i especially admired is how sridevi becomes spokesperson lessons without being too overt about it save ending speech that hammers emotion is sure make your eyes well up it deals with macro level how as humans we should be helpful tolerant those who dont speak our language or understand our culture that one shouldnt be made think ones superior just because or make other look small more micro level structure family its importance all these more told through story about woman finding her inner strength stand out stand up be counted building reinforcing confidence that shes more than just laddoo machine but social factors aside more obvious ingredient thats put into movie is mind your language type scenes when shashi enrolls herself into english crash course learn conversational english four weeks instead mr brown theres mr david cory hibbs teacher whose sexual orientation again highlights differences human race need tolerance acceptance motley crew classmates various parts world bonding together woman who centered her life around family building network friends became something lifeline sorts keeping life interesting through sharing experiences course food english vinglish has everything typical indian film contains comedy romance handled with such maturity culture language what more it has sridevis remarkable return showing why she was still is one iconic female actresses ever grace screens indian cinema definite recommendation though formulaic at parts is delivered with such slickness that id shortlist it as one best this year,0.47463186077643904,0.17243975903614459,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,A Satisfying Experience,"The essence of few stories lies in its simplicity portraying characters from our day-to-day lives and their struggle. English Vinglish is one such beautifully woven simple concept with which audience can identify themselves.English Vinglish is the story of Mrs Shashi Godvale,a regular home-maker from an upper middle-class household whose life revolves around doing the regular household chores. Alongwith homemaking she keeps her passion for cooking intact and within the homely set-up started a small scale business by making laaddoos. Her potential never gets the due diligence from either her indifferent husband who seem to get charged up only in bed, or her daughter who is ashamed of her mother's lack of English knowledge. It seems her lack of sophistication has even crafted the gap with her husband. She is more connected to her little son and her caring mother-in-law. Under circumstances she lands up in New York for her elder niece's wedding and eventually in an English tuition class and the story follows how her life changes thereafter. Learning a new language is symbolic of a key to regain her long lost confidence and self-esteem. Gauri Shinde's directorial debut needs to be applauded for the sheer treatment of the film. She wrote a dignified script which never crossed the line becoming overtly-dramatic. Her skill lies in passing a relevant message without getting didactic. The film re-iterates the importance of woman in our lives. In fact it is dedicated to all the middle-class housewives who are never valued in their own household in this patriarchal society.Mrs Godvale showcases pathos of all such women who are dying under the burden of inconsequential existence even though they have significant potential unexplored. Shinde's script does justice to all the characters. The characters are simple and relatable. Mr Godvale is never depicted as a wife beating devil or an infidel husband. He is just a regular working professional who has lost interest in her wife due to cultural differences and sadly that's the scenario of most arranged marriages (still) happening in our country where the wife is not at par as husband in terms of social strata. Such a marriage becomes a compromise, unsigned deal where physical proximity is rampant but the mental bonding is like searching meaning in a RohitShetty film.The English tuition reminds us of famous yesteryear serial ""Zaban Sambhalke"" where genius Pankiaj Kapoor played the Hindi teacher. There we had hybrid of cultures which created hilarious sequences due to their differences but by the end they got united under the umbrella of a common language. The setting is similar here and the students here are well-edged characters who help in elevating the pace of the film. With mixture of various cultures the experience that comes out is satisfyingly hilarious. Using the back-drop of the tuition class Shinde throws subtle hints on different issues like Indo-Pak peace, tolerance towards homosexuals and understanding them etc. She even used this medium to hint on the hypocrite mindset of male dominated Indo-Pak society as they verbally attacked the French student for openly admitting his soft corner towards Shashi. The relationship between Shahshi and the french student Laurent reminded of relationship shown in WoodyAllen's films. As she converse in Hindi and he reciprocates in French, there seem to be exchange of bouquet of emotions even though they are alien to each other's language. That's the power of feeling and mutual respect which Shashi wanted from her husband. Shashi & Laurent relationship remained as sweet and subtle as the rest of the film. The film can be summarized in one statement of Godvale where she sadly exclaimed that she doesn't need love; she needs Respect. It seems majority of the woman of India is speaking through her and with watery eyes I remember my own mother.I had even lost the opportunity to hug her and openly express my love for her which I never did while she was there beside me Technically the film is well edited by Hemanti Sarkar. The scenes never looked dragged. Utekar's cinematography added the feel-good factor without swaying into K Jo style of escapist extravaganza. Amit Trivedi's music is, as always, rocking. He manages to surprise with every film and his music syncs with the mood of the film, never looking like a separate music album unlike most music directors' scores. Swanand Kirkire is a gifted lyricist and he proved his mettle yet again. And special mention to casting directors (Rita & Sean Powers) who came up with some brilliant and off-beat cast for the film. Sridevi is plain brilliant as Mrs Godvale. I was never a Sridevi fan but was amused by her potential which I felt was never utilized to the fullest barring few films. She looked confident and underplayed her role to suit the character. Adil Hussain as her husband is expectantly efficient and did justice to his NSD degree. One of the finest actors, I sincerely hope this film opens more doors for him. Experienced French actor Mehedi Nebbou was fantastic in the role of Laurent and expressed with his eyes. His equation with Sridevi deserves mention. Priya Anand is spontaneous as Shashi's niece who instills confidence in Shashi's character. Cory Hibbs is rocking as the English teacher. The whole bunch of actors as the students of English tuition are superb. Rest of the supporting cast are all splendid especially the adorable kid who played Shahshi's son. Amitabh Bachchan is present in a meaningful cameo in the flight scene. Overall English Vinglish is a simple and linear yet effective,a touching story of majority housewives of our previous generation. While we are heading towards a more independent society we sincerely hope the mindset towards our woman changes so that we can Really be Proud of our culture and parampara.Hope the time is not far away with more Godvale's understanting their worth and fighting to earn back their dignity rather than letting oneself to be a subject of sympathy.",satisfying experience,essence few stories lies its

8.0,English Vinglish ∞ The Class for Earning Self Respect ∞,"""If we don't love ourselves we use to attract towards new things but as soon as we began to love ourselves we feel confident and old things look prettier again."" This is one dialogue from the movie's lead protagonist which teaches how one can come back to his normal life; English Vinglish is a sweet Laddu with almonds of a logical script, cashew nuts of nice music, raisins of love and pistachios of Hope. English Vinglish is not about just English classes, it's just a metaphor or platform to narrate a simple yet very effective story of self determination, self respect and love about family and love about ourselves.English Vinglish is undoubtedly a movie about the Family, the children & their attitude towards their parents, the husband who does not see his wife skills and potential beyond a born Laddu Maker and yes, it's about a mother who lost her identity as a woman in the society after marriage being a house wife, as her world does not go beyond her family.Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a simple middle class housewife living with her husband Satish (Adil Hussain) along with her daughter Sapna and a son named Sagar in Pune, India. She is an excellent cook searching for her own respect among children and husband due to poor understanding of English language. One day she got the call from her sister to visit New York to attend her daughter's wedding, but she was reluctant to go alone because of her poor English language, thou she finally agreed on her husband's persuasion. In New York, during her visit to a café she felt humiliated due to her understanding of English language which brought a reason for her to fight against the odds and make a place for herself. She left from there and suddenly saw an advertisement for four weeks English speaking classes and that's how she got the way to prove herself by learning a language which is global now and a synonym of 'Being Modern' in Indian societies called English, for Her VINGLISH.Overall, English Vinglish is a memorable watch for the genuine script, superb performances, nice music and definitely the feel good factor it has. In Last scene, Shashi requests the air hostess a Hindi newspaper in English Language, and that's we called in Sridevi's MJ Style without getting 'Judgemental' –YoOO.Regards Your's AvAFor complete review Please visit www.thecritiquelab.comReaders' Feedback is appreciated",english vinglish class earning self respect,if we dont love ourselves we use attract towards new things but as soon as we began love ourselves we feel confident old things look prettier again this is one dialogue movies lead protagonist which teaches how one can come back his normal life english vinglish is sweet laddu with almonds logical script cashew nuts nice music raisins love pistachios hope english vinglish is not about just english classes its just metaphor or platform narrate simple yet very effective story self determination self respect love about family love about ourselves english vinglish is undoubtedly movie about family children their attitude towards their parents husband who does not see his wife skills potential beyond born laddu maker yes its about mother who lost her identity as woman society after marriage being house wife as her world does not go beyond her family shashi godbole sridevi is simple middle class housewife living with her husband satish adil hussain along with her daughter sapna son named sagar pune india she is excellent cook searching her own respect among children husband due poor understanding english language one day she got call her sister visit new york attend her daughters wedding but she was reluctant go alone because her poor english language thou she finally agreed her husbands persuasion new york during her visit caf she felt humiliated due her understanding english language which brought reason her fight against odds make place herself she left there suddenly saw advertisement four weeks english speaking classes thats how she got way prove herself by learning language which is global now synonym being modern indian societies called english her vinglish overall english vinglish is memorable watch genuine script superb performances nice music definitely feel good factor it has last scene shashi requests air hostess hindi newspaper english language thats we called sridevis mj style without getting judgemental yooo regards yours avafor complete review please visit www thecritiquelab comreaders feedback is appreciated,0.4071306052438129,0.18658662092624353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,English Vinglish - Beautiful Sheautiful,"English Vinglish is a beautiful journey that a middle class Indian housewife takes, to regain something she lost or probably never really got, ironically enough, in a foreign land with a foreign language as a tool.The movie has a simple plan, and audience gets to know about it right at the beginning. There ain't any surprises or twists therein to wow you, its purely the execution of a simple yet universally appealing plot that makes English Vinglish one of the most beautifully made movie of the year.This is a sort of cinema which has traditionally been oiled with loads of melodrama and any director would have wanted to do that considering the fact that people who are going to relate the most with the central character are most prone to be pleasantly affected by the overdose of melodrama ( Yes, I am being a little 'judgemental' here!). Credit must go to Gauri Shinde for shunning the temptation and going ahead with a recipe where she was able to create delight out of right mix of ingredients rather than putting a coating of sugar on the 'laddoos'. Make no mistake, the feel good factor of the movie isn't there just because all the pieces have been put together in the correct order but also because there are layers attached to the story and the characters. These layers help English Vinglish surpass the expectations that an ordinary viewer would have had with it before stepping into the cinema theatre. These layers have been treated with utmost care and are interwoven in the script with great skill. Even though the plot of the movie doesn't encapsulate many genres, the scenes are successful in generating a range of emotions. Thanks to the central plot, humor becomes a part of majority of the scenes and it is never forced upon you.The entertainment quotient of EV is way more than one would have expected. There are a few sequences which could have easily gone in the zone of 'Oh, thats ridiculous!' but yet they were right there in the 'that will do all right' category and this was only possible because of masterful Sridevi who hasn't lost even an inch of her charm and she still stands way ahead of any of the contemporary actresses when it comes to the art of acting. Her presence is so overpowering that one hardly notices or gets annoyed by certain instances of manufactured dialogues and stereotypical display of characters. The journey, the transformation and its impact on the movie and the audience wouldn't have had half the quality had there not been Sridevi at the helm. Every other actor (and guest actor) plays their part well enough to create the right garnish for this savory meal.Without taking any credit away from Gauri Shinde, everything from costumes, to music and locations to screenplay had impressions of R Balki's(producer) previous works and he would have been of great help in the making of EV as well. The affect that English Vinglish will have on a particular individual will depend on the relationship that he/she has with the one/two women that hold the most important place(s) in their lives. The degree of impact will vary, though one thing is for sure, it will only lie on the right side of the axis. http://imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in/",english vinglish beautiful sheautiful,english vinglish is beautiful journey that middle class indian housewife takes regain something she lost or probably never really got ironically enough foreign land with foreign language as tool movie has simple plan audience gets know about it right at beginning there aint any surprises or twists therein wow you its purely execution simple yet universally appealing plot that makes english vinglish one most beautifully made movie year this is sort cinema which has traditionally been oiled with loads melodrama any director would have wanted do that considering fact that people who are going relate most with central character are most prone be pleasantly affected by overdose melodrama yes i am being little judgemental here credit must go gauri shinde shunning temptation going ahead with recipe where she was able create delight out right mix ingredients rather than putting coating sugar laddoos make no mistake feel good factor movie isnt there just because all pieces have been put together correct order but also because there are layers attached story characters these layers help english vinglish surpass expectations that ordinary viewer would have had with it before stepping into cinema theatre these layers have been treated with utmost care are interwoven script with great skill even though plot movie doesnt encapsulate many genres scenes are successful generating range emotions thanks central plot humor becomes part majority scenes it is never forced upon you entertainment quotient ev is way more than one would have expected there are few sequences which could have easily gone zone oh thats ridiculous but yet they were right there that will do all right category this was only possible because masterful sridevi who hasnt lost even inch her charm she still stands way ahead any contemporary actresses when it comes art acting her presence is so overpowering that one hardly notices or gets annoyed by certain instances manufactured dialogues stereotypical display characters journey transformation its impact movie audience wouldnt have had half quality had there not been sridevi at helm every other actor guest actor plays their part well enough create right garnish this savory meal without taking any credit away gauri shinde everything costumes music locations screenplay had impressions r balkis producer previous works he would have been great help making ev as well affect that english vinglish will have particular individual will depend relationship that he she has with one two women that hold most important place s their lives degree impact will vary though one thing is sure it will only lie right side axis,0.5046849087893863,0.17794065387348973,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"

7.0,Of Soulful Sentiment & Sunny Smiles,"For someone who has been born and brought up on English medium schools, and I don't say this proudly, but for whom English is his first language of thought, it is very hard to put self in Sridevi's shoes. Someone, who doesn't know English, but in all other ways is very competent. Someone, who is constantly the butt of family jokes and jibes, especially by the husband and the rapidly growing daughter. That the film succeeds in making us feel her angst, and her ways of coping with it, showing the kind of situations she encounters, especially when she goes to New York, is a tribute to the story and the performances, especially the virtuoso acting masterclass by Sridevi, who shows, in more ways than one, that she's still got it !The debilitating effect of not knowing the language is brought alive by her mispronounciation of 'Jazz', a visit to her daughter's PTA, her solo trip to New York, handling immigration, her ordeal there buying coffee and various snide ones by both her husband ('She is born to make laddoo's') and her daughter ('Why did you take my book if you cant read ?'). Redemption arrives when she decides to take English lessons, while in New York, visiting her sister to help with her niece's wedding. She finds unlikely allies in the sister's house and a gallant, romantic French fellow student. And suddenly, life is not so bleak anymore. The film tries hard not to get too sentimental, balancing every tear with a chuckle or a smile. Amitabh Bachchan's delightful cameo, the other madcap students in the English class, none as zany as Salman Khan, the Pakistani, the cheerful nature of her son, her own special, sari-clad Michael Jackson impersonation, all serve to smoothen out the various trials and tribulations thrown her way. Sridevi makes you root for her, getting her every expression, every frown, every smile spot on. Most of the other characters are stereotypes – the busy, indifferent husband, the cute son, the gallant Gaul, the bombastic Pakistani etc. But she has shades to her character, moments of weakness followed by instances of strength. Waffling indecision followed by gutsy action. Isn't life about communication, rather than the language ? About the message, rather than the medium ?

10.0,Clap! Clap! Clap!,"Superb! Fantastic! Definitely worth a Standing Ovation! This movie is a winner all the way. Right from the script to the characters, everything falls in place. Very difficult to find faults, in fact there is no need to find faults. This movie takes you on a journey of a typical Indian housewife who can hardly speak English. The treatment of the movie is such that you feel a connection with the movie. The best 'part' of the movie is, of course, Sridevi. Yes, The Sridevi. Her acting is so natural and realistic that you feel the emotions that she is going through in the movie. Sridevi has proved once again (after a break of 15 long years) that she is still the Queen of Bollywood, the so-called Female Amitabh Bachchan (as she was known as in the 80s & 90s). I saw this movie today in an overseas theater and not surprisingly, the theater was mostly full of mature audience, her fans. The movie and Sridevi's performance is worth not only many Filmfare Awards but most definitely an Oscar! Well Done Sridevi!",clap clap clap,superb fantastic definitely worth standing ovation this movie is winner all way right script characters everything falls place very difficult find faults fact there is no need find faults this movie takes you journey typical indian housewife who can hardly speak english treatment movie is such that you feel connection with movie best part movie is course sridevi yes sridevi her acting is so natural realistic that you feel emotions that she is going through movie sridevi has proved once again after break 15 long years that she is still queen bollywood so called female amitabh bachchan as she was known as 80s 90s i saw this movie today overseas theater not surprisingly theater was mostly full mature audience her fans movie sridevis performance is worth not only many filmfare awards but most definitely oscar well done sridevi,0.45336438923395445,0.15191511387163562,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.52}"
8.0,A delightful film that must be appreciated of its simplicity in delivering an important message.,"A delightful film that must be appreciated of its simplicity in delivering an important message.How important are the feelings of those, who do not know a language that we speak so much. Is it right to belittle those for they can be good in something else? Is it right to disrespect parents and feel embarrassed when they do not know English? More than anything else, this is the tale of a mother who is being deserted by her kids and husband for she does not know a language that they all speak. And she learns it to redeem her respect. I loved the way Sridevi carried herself and am so very happy seeing her back on the silver screen which she set ablaze many years ago with films like Chandni, Mr. India and Chaalbaaz to name a few. Sridevi is indeed the best part of this film, as she has a poise that subdues the flamboyance and the stardom of her and gets her into the character. So what I saw here was Shashi (Sridevi) more than Sridevi and that's great to begin my review with.If you loved a movie like PAA, then there are definite chances that you may love this too, coz it takes the simplicty from there and applies the same to a different story. I loved PAA, so I loved this one too. But even if you dislike PAA, try this and you may have a surprise then. The good thing of this movie is it's writing, take that scene in which Shashi gets a call from her daughter when she was looking for her scrapbook, and here it isShashi : ""Maine use chupaya taaki main bhi na padh sakoo"" Daughter :Padhna Aaye tab na"" That is, ""How can you read, when you don't know"" The supporting cast has also done well from a French cook to a Pakistani guy, they all teamed up well, but it has it's share of not so likable or rather preachy moments like the teacher being gay. But I will give in to all that, coz it is done quietly and not making fuss. Be it the climax, it was done in a subdued manner and that is why it was beautiful for me.I love this film for its simplicity and for just one reason ""SRIDEVI"" all the other technical departments did their job superbly but ""SRIDEVI"" did something really beautiful. Even the way she walked on those streets was graceful. Also, a mention to music and Amit Trivedi has given beautiful music.Thanks Gauri and R Balki for giving SRIDEVI back to us with this. And thanks to SRIDEVI for doing this film. A 4/5 for this.",delightful film that must be appreciated its simplicity delivering important message,delightful film that must be appreciated its simplicity delivering important message how important are feelings those who do not know language that we speak so much is it right belittle those they can be good something else is it right disrespect parents feel embarrassed when they do not know english more than anything else this is tale mother who is being deserted by her kids husband she does not know language that they all speak she learns it redeem her respect i loved way sridevi carried herself am so very happy seeing her back silver screen which she set ablaze many years ago with films like chandni mr india chaalbaaz name few sridevi is indeed best part this film as she has poise that subdues flamboyance stardom her gets her into character so what i saw here was shashi sridevi more than sridevi thats great begin my review with if you loved movie like paa then there are definite chances that you may love this too coz it takes simplicty there applies same different story i loved paa so i loved this one too but even if you dislike paa try this you may have surprise then good thing this movie is its writing take that scene which shashi gets call her daughter when she was looking her scrapbook here it isshashi maine use chupaya taaki main bhi na padh sakoo daughter padhna aaye tab na that is how can you read when you dont know supporting cast has also done well french cook pakistani guy they all teamed up well but it has its share not so likable or rather preachy moments like teacher being gay but i will give all that coz it is done quietly not making fuss be it climax it was done subdued manner that is why it was beautiful me i love this film its simplicity just one reason sridevi all other technical departments did their job superbly but sridevi did something really beautiful even way she walked those streets was graceful also mention music amit trivedi has given beautiful music thanks gauri r balki giving sridevi back us with this thanks sridevi doing this film 4 5 this,0.5315873015873016,0.40955026455026455,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,I'm More Than a Laddu Maker!,"For about the last 3 years, i have special interest with Indian movies. I found out that Indian movie is worth to watch, the idea of the story is original, based on India everyday life, problem, dilemma. I know Vinglish was something when I read about the plot. This is not about romance between two countries, love which separated by time and distance, unapproved love. This about a good housewife who was very loyal and serve her family entirely. Her name is Shashi. She had side job as a laddu maker (Indian traditional cake). But one thing which become a family joke all the time was her inability to speak English. A very obvious moment how embarrassed her daughter, Sapna, with her was when she should replaced her husband in school meeting (reports day). This the new information to me, in some schools in India, the daily language is English. Sashi unable talk in English and asked the teacher talked in Hindi, Sapna glared at her and refused talk to her on their way returned home. Not only Sapna, her husband, Sathish somehow disregarded her ability as a laddu maker only. Sashi asked by his sister to help her prepared her wedding's daughter in US, Sashi willing to help, but the consequence was she must leave by herself. The others family member would joined her later. Sashi was afraid because she unable speak English and this is the first time she left her home all by herself. But eventually she left. With full of happiness meeting her sister and nephew, Radha, she's still bothered about the embarrassment of her daughter and what her husband said. One day she saw an ad about learning English fluently on 6 weeks! Sashi showed her interest and memorized the number. She sign up herself for the program secretly. In this course she meet a cute French guy, Laurent, who helped her in the other day. He fancy her which was just too visible! Sashi enjoyed the class very much and followed the lesson well. She gained confidence and decided to follow the class till the end of the program. But Radha found out Sashi walked with Laurent, and asked who was he. Sashi revealed she took an English course and Radha supported her. Will Sashi finish her English course? Which one Sathi choose, Sathis or Laurent? You should find it by yourself by watching this humor-drama movie! Many scenes become my favorites, conversation between Amitabachan and American Immigration officer is one of. Gauri Shinde as a director, was very rigorous present it in a smart way, which is mostly I found in Hollywood movie.

10.0,The Queen Has Returned,"If creative intellectuals have their way, when the history of Indian Cinema is written, it will be written in two parts: Before Sridevi and After Sridevi. With due respect to Dilip Kumar, Kamal Hassan, and even Amitabh Bachchan, Sridevi stands as the sole female actor in a country whose native cinema has historically preferred its women to be little more than ornamental showpieces to equal and even generally outrank and outshine her male counterparts by building a legacy that is as artistically rich as it is historically significant.She has achieved every benchmark befitting a historic thespian who is now commonly referred to as ""India's Meryl Streep"": as the only Indian actor (male or female) to have achieved supremacy in every major regional language of the World's Largest Film Industry, her return to the silver screen is not one that can go unnoticed. This is, to put it mildly, The Return of the Queen.And now, at age 49, she reinvents the wheel yet again, giving audiences reluctant to view women past the age of 35 as anything other than matronly spinsters a fully existential view of middle-aged femininity that is somber, sweet, and wholly unlike anything Indian cinema has ever dared to say about women of a certain age. Fifteen years after her last film, Judaai (in which she triumphantly played a materialistic husband-selling virago), she returns to the big screen with a difficult but simple story of a middle class housewife named Shashi who finds her life, relationships, and identity limited by the fact that she cannot speak English. Summoned to New York by her sister to help with the preparations for her niece's upcoming wedding, Shashi finds herself confronted with ideas, customs, and individuals that, while foreign, are not wholly alien to her. She doesn't mind that strangers offer her wine on planes, or that gay couples stroll hand in hand on the Upper West Side. Shashi should be a narrow-minded and provincial simpleton. She is, instead, a warm and accepting woman with a heart of gold who simply doesn't know the language of the world. Or does she? Like all Sridevi creations, Shashi is complex in both her design and her ambition. Unlike all other Sridevi creations, however, Shashi is firmly rooted in reality. Sridevi has almost exclusively been held to the larger than life standard that has enabled her to play some of the most unique and legendary characters ever enacted by any actress, Indian or otherwise. As Mani Ratnam famously said in 1995, ""Asking Sridevi to play the typical heroine role is like asking Picasso to paint your wall."" With due respect to Picasso's creative process, Sridevi is able to conjure miracles in seconds. Shashi has no grand designs on life. Her only desire is to be taken seriously, to know that she is as important as her family members that converse and operate in English when at the office or at school. For her, there is no tragic event that becomes the impetus for her desire to learn English. It is the cumulative effect of a thousand petty humiliations, borne upon her face day after day, as she is derided, diminished, and dismissed as being less than. Shashi knows that she is capable and intelligent; her mind is as open as her heart; and yet no one will take her seriously.Despite the supporting cast's best efforts, all of the film would be for naught were it not for the heart-poundingly delicate performance from Sridevi who elevates the film as only a master can. That Sridevi is a world-class thespian does not need to be repeated. What does bear pointing out is the utterly flawless way in which Sridevi communicates Shashi's building frustration with her linguistic limitations at every moment when she is derided or disdained by her daughter, husband, or random strangers abroad. It becomes clear to Shashi that no one – not even her loved ones – view her as an individual. She is only to be considered in terms of her social relations- as wife, mother, homemaker. That she is an existential being in her own right, with her own desires and ambitions, is something only Shashi asserts, albeit in complete silence. The look of muted broken heartedness that Sridevi conjures at every slight is something to behold: she swallows her humiliations with bitterness, unsure that this is the way things are supposed to be. Sridevi's frankly perfect performance gives rise to more than just her second innings as an actor: it heralds the beginning of a new Golden Age in Hindi Cinema.Such expectations aside, critics and Sridevi fanatics alike have all been asking the same question: where does her portrayal of Shashi rank among her legendary performances? Is it of the caliber of her greatest achievements Sadma, Chaalbaaz, Mr. India, and Lamhe? Does it deserve the same consideration of her landmark work in movies like Chandni, Gumrah, and Laadla? All I can positively assert without any hesitation is that Sridevi's Shashi allows her to produce a fine and finessed performance that is unassuming and wise at the same time. Sridevi has long been ""afflicted"" by the demand that she play only grandiose women. Even ""ordinary"" women like Chandni became larger-than-life purely because Sridevi was playing them. Her very essence speaks to the isolated, the elevated, and the unique. As R. Balki has recently said of Sridevi, an actress of her ability is born but once in a thousand years, and that she must continue to act, not only for the sake of her own career but for the sake of cinema itself. Some artists are their medium in such definitive ways that their absence means a weakening of the entire medium itself. Sridevi is, almost 50 years since the beginning of her career, the purest distillation of Acting India has ever known. And if the 15 years since Judaai are any indication, she will remain thus.",queen has returned,if creative intellectuals have their way when history indian cinema is written it will be written two

8.0,"A funny, poignant story of a mother's self discovery.","I rarely watch Hindi movies. Rarer still do I come back appreciating them.English Vinglish is worth it, even a bleary-eyed 6 am review, right after seeing the movie.After just about making it across town to the PVR at Oberoi Mall, Goregaon, was amazed to see that most of the invitees were on time, with thousands of eager fans, waiting to glimpse their favourite stars, and of course the star of the film.As if one needed a reminder, large billboards of Sridevi in a saree against the New York skyline, looking lost, stared back at us all the way.The selling point for this film till the opening has been Sridevi's comeback. For people like me, who aren't a big Sridevi fan, it wasn't the most exciting news. But to contrast, my cousin in the US, much younger than me, and surprisingly a huge fan, (after all she had missed the superstar Sridevi days), has been waiting for this with great anticipation.After the movie got over, I too can be counted as one of the fans. For her fantastic performance. Also for being perfectly cast in the lead role.The pre-hype had already got the basics of the plot out - Indian woman in New York who doesn't know the language, has to pick it up double quick with the help of a motley bunch of fellow non-English speakers. I wouldn't blame you for thinking, ""Hey, it must be a 'Mind Your Language' equivalent, I've seen that."" Well it is much more than that.Gauri Shinde the award winning short film director and ad film maker is someone we were familiar with. We knew her passion and the dedication to the craft. Her ability to put the story across with minimum fuss.What was a revelation was Gauri Shinde the script writer.English Vinglish is a tight script. Its sweet without being cloying. It holds a mirror where it has to, and at other moments shows the way. The single mindedness of the story and lack of familiar Bollywood distractions of supporting comedians, songs (there are a couple, but in appropriate places), arch villains and hammy side kicks, is what makes the story click.It is humorous, even in the 'familiar' classroom scenes, it is poignant, well-shot, without making New York a tourism board sponsored promotional video. One could sense the director's familiarity with the city, it was obvious she didn't need much help from location scouts.The casting is bang-on. The two kids are a revelation. Especially the younger one. He could be our version of Dakota Fanning. The elder sister was good too, but given that she has age and much more worldly experience on her side to draw upon, I would judge the sibling's performance higher. But that's just nitpicking. The teacher and the co-students are good too. And they make the film lighter. The rest of the family does really well to make this slightly-more-than-a-month-in-the-life-of Mrs Godbole in Pune / New York shine in a warm familial glow.A couple of surprises in terms of guest appearances. On hindsight, one of them is an obvious one, given that R Balki's produced the movie.There is a nice balance to the struggle of restricting English dialogue in an English language setting for a largely Hindi audience in a mainstream Hindi movie. After all, it is a Bollywood movie, for everyone, including the person who has painted 'Ladis' and 'Gends' at the convenience near Byculla, which I happened to pass by in the morning. So the grammar lessons are few and far between, language is used to convey mood and feelings, not necessarily the exact content, and dialogue only when it's absolutely necessary.The cowering, lost woman transforms into a confident and self-aware person. That too without stretching the limits of believability. She doesn't suddenly become an orator in the newly learnt language. She doesn't lose her shyness either.Special mention here of Sridevi, she allows the director to lead her and doesn't overpower the narrative, with a held back, controlled performance. She could have tried to do a lot more, considering this was 'her' film, after like a zillion years.That is where the film hits you. It's real. You can easily identify with it. And is therefore that much more enjoyable.I don't have stars to dole out. Just hugs for the entire team, because, like many others know, it's not easy to make a good film. That too your first one, and at the same time having the guts to relaunch someone's career after many years.Excellent Vexellent.",funny poignant story mothers self discovery,i rarely watch hindi movies rarer still do i come back appreciating them english vinglish is worth it even bleary eyed 6 am review right after seeing movie after just about making it across town pvr at oberoi mall goregaon was amazed see that most invitees were time with thousands eager fans waiting glimpse their favourite stars course star film as if one needed reminder large billboards sridevi saree against new york skyline looking lost stared back at us all way selling point this film till opening has been sridevis comeback people like me who arent big sridevi fan it wasnt most exciting news but contrast my cousin us much younger than me surprisingly huge fan after all she had missed superstar sridevi days has been waiting this with great anticipation after movie got over i too can be counted as one fans her fantastic performance also being perfectly cast lead role pre hype had already got basics plot out indian woman new york who doesnt know language has pick it up double quick with help motley bunch fellow non english speakers i wouldnt blame you thinking hey it must be mind your language equivalent ive seen that well it is much more than that gauri shinde award winning short film director ad film maker is someone we were familiar with we knew her passion dedication craft her ability put story across with minimum fuss what was revelation was gauri shinde script writer english vinglish is tight script its sweet without being cloying it holds mirror where it has at other moments shows way single mindedness story lack familiar bollywood distractions supporting comedians songs there are couple but appropriate places arch villains hammy side kicks is what makes story click it is humorous even familiar classroom scenes it is poignant well shot without making new york tourism board sponsored promotional video one could sense directors familiarity with city it was obvious she didnt need much help location scouts casting is bang two kids are revelation especially younger one he could be our version dakota fanning elder sister was good too but given that she has age much more worldly experience her side draw upon i would judge siblings performance higher but thats just nitpicking teacher co students are good too they make film lighter rest family does really well make this slightly more than month life mrs godbole pune new york shine warm familial glow couple surprises terms guest appearances hindsight one them is obvious one given that r balkis produced movie there is nice balance struggle restricting english dialogue english language setting largely hindi audience mainstream hindi movie after all it is bollywood movie everyone including person who has painted ladis gends at convenience near byculla which i happened pass by morning so grammar lessons are few far between language is used convey mood feelings not necessarily exact content dialogue only when its absolutely necessary cowering lost woman transforms into confident self aware person that too without stretching limits believability she doesnt suddenly become orator newly learnt language she doesnt lose her shyness either special mention here sridevi she allows director lead her doesnt overpower narrative with held back controlled performance she could have tried do lot more considering this was her film after like zillion years that is where film hits you its real you can easily identify with it is therefore that much more enjoyable i dont have stars dole out just hugs entire team because like many others know its not easy make good film that too your first one at same time having guts relaunch someones career after many years excellent vexellent,0.4777203249425473,0.25343514510181175,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,An uplifting film,"""English Vinglish"" is a film that only a woman could have made. Gauri Shindi lends her feminine sensibilities to the film which is why it is a big success. She captures the nuances in a typical Indian housewife's tryst with her kids and husband. Although there is no true villainous character in the film, it is painful to see the leading lady Shashi (Sridevi) suffer unintentional humiliation at the hands of her teenage daughter and husband because of her inability to converse in English.It is very satisfying to see her grasp the basics of the English language and thereby gain self-confidence. Her English class has an interesting mix of students from across the world including a Frenchman who is besotted with her. The feel-good nature of the film can be attributed to the final scene in particular in which Shashi delivers a thoughtful speech in English. Loved the film but didn't think too much of the soundtrack, especially the track ""Manhattan"". Also felt that her experiences with people in America were sugar-coated.

9.0,Simply beautiful,"Good things come in small packages, and ""English vinglish"" is the best example of that. In my opinion, one of the best ways to judge a movie is by how it makes you feel when you walk out of the theater. To sum-up the experience of watching 'English vinglish' in one word - Beautiful!I had the least expectations from a come-back movie of Sri Devi, but no one could have done a better job for this role. Sri Devi has the most realistic and lively expressions you will get to see in an actress. As my wifey puts it: ""One of the most appealing characteristic of Sri Devi's acting is her ability to talk with her eyes"", and you are going to see a lot of her eyes. Movie shows the ever-young face of Sri Devi for about 80-85% of the time, but you will never get bored of watching her or her ""talking eyes"". For all those people who wonder why Sri Devi still has a big fan following, this movie is the reason :-).The story of 'English vinglish' has a very nice flow to it. You are going to be surprised as to how simple the story is and what a brilliant job the creators have done to shape it into a master-piece. If not for the last scene, this movie would have scored the max points on my ratings, but kudos to the director for keeping it real. Putting aside the acting of Sri Devi, all the co-actors too have done an excellent job in keeping the movie entertaining. Not the mention the unexpected appearance of a guest Super-Star in the movie was a pleasant surprise too. But nothing beats the feeling of an ""expected bad"" movie turning into an awesome one.My suggestion: Perfect for family, couples, and friends, as there is something for everyone to take away from this movie. Just try to not focus on Sri Devi's surgically enhanced nose:-) (Bummer!)",simply beautiful,good things come small packages english vinglish is best example that my opinion one best ways judge movie is by how it makes you feel when you walk out theater sum up experience watching english vinglish one word beautiful i had least expectations come back movie sri devi but no one could have done better job this role sri devi has most realistic lively expressions you will get see actress as my wifey puts it one most appealing characteristic sri devis acting is her ability talk with her eyes you are going see lot her eyes movie shows ever young face sri devi about 80 85 time but you will never get bored watching her or her talking eyes all those people who wonder why sri devi still has big fan following this movie is reason story english vinglish has very nice flow it you are going be surprised as how simple story is what brilliant job creators have done shape it into master piece if not last scene this movie would have scored max points my ratings but kudos director keeping it real putting aside acting sri devi all co actors too have done excellent job keeping movie entertaining not mention unexpected appearance guest super star movie was pleasant surprise too but nothing beats feeling expected bad movie turning into awesome one my suggestion perfect family couples friends as there is something everyone take away this movie just try not focus sri devis surgically enhanced nose bummer,0.5108669108669108,0.29571872571872576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.16}"
8.0,English Vinglish - Sridevi Sweeps it all,"This movie was released in multiple languages. I saw this movie in the Tamil version. This movie is about a typical Indian woman who has trouble with English speaking and her New York expedition. The simple one line story is whether Sashi (Sridevi) succeeds her English learning mission? Coming to the lead role Sridevi has done it picture perfect in her role of a middle aged typical Indian women. She proves us that her acting skills are legendary through her expressions and dialogue delivery. Her casual looks suits the role perfectly. The whole movie we see her domination on screen. Priya Anand comes as Sridevi's niece and helps her to succeed in her mission. She didn't have much screen space yet delivers a decent performance and her casual advice to Sridevi about 'love after marriage isn't wrong' we see her American cultural influence. Other characters like the husband and daughter of Sridevi has fulfilled their roles in humiliating. Perfect group was the classmates of Sridevi all of them were so perfect in choice and did their part very well. The French cook with his love for Sridevi and the unknown language conversation between them was interesting. Surprise element in the Tamil version is Actor Ajith . He travels along with Sridevi to New York and comforts her during her flight with his comic sense. The only drawback we could feel when watching it in Tamil was we could not take the entire faces in the movie to be a Tamil people. The marriage ceremony was done in Marathi style where we cannot take that as Tamil culture. But we have to come face to face with the fact that this was a Hindi movie dubbed in Tamil. Except this cultural point the overall movie was clean in its scope and casting. Nice work by Director Gauri Shinde and team. We feel like when the movie ends as if we are out of the English class. Get in for a feel light entertainment drama from the house of ""Cheeni kum"" and ""Paa"". Verdict: ""English Vinglish"" Mission Spoken English accomplished .Definitely Sridevi sweeps it all.

7.0,"Thoughtful, funny, entertaining... Excellent performance","Bollywood legend Sridevi returns in a starring role as Shashi Godbole, a small time homemaker/ housewife and mother of two who makes and sells laddoos on the side. Her poor grasp on English is ridiculed by her husband, Satish, and teenage daughter, Sapna.Shashi's niece is to get married in New York, where she is settled, and she has to go a few weeks ahead of her family to help her sister with the arrangements. In her time there, she secretly enrolls in a conversational English class geared to help improve her English in four weeks time. She bonds with her fellow students and soon proves to be the most promising student there, watching English movies and reading English newspapers in her spare time.Her husband's ridiculing is irritating, but a realistic scenario that you can find in such a family in India. But her daughter's irreverent and downright rude attitude is atrocious. A few tight slaps could have made the ending a lot better... but that's my opinion.It is a well crafted movie, with a well grounded, realistic premise. The improvement in English is gradual, and Sridevi nails the gradient well, with just a few exceptions (Mid way through her classes, she absent mindedly places an order in perfect English; a perfection her character doesn't master even towards the end of the movie. That was slightly distracting, but I'm nitpicking). At 49, she is stunningly beautiful, and a far better actress than most leading ladies in Bollywood today. Hopefully, we'll get to see more from her.",thoughtful funny entertaining excellent performance,bollywood legend sridevi returns starring role as shashi godbole small time homemaker housewife mother two who makes sells laddoos side her poor grasp english is ridiculed by her husband satish teenage daughter sapna shashis niece is get married new york where she is settled she has go few weeks ahead her family help her sister with arrangements her time there she secretly enrolls conversational english class geared help improve her english four weeks time she bonds with her fellow students soon proves be most promising student there watching english movies reading english newspapers her spare time her husbands ridiculing is irritating but realistic scenario that you can find such family india but her daughters irreverent downright rude attitude is atrocious few tight slaps could have made ending lot better but thats my opinion it is well crafted movie with well grounded realistic premise improvement english is gradual sridevi nails gradient well with just few exceptions mid way through her classes she absent mindedly places order perfect english perfection her character doesnt master even towards end movie that was slightly distracting but im nitpicking at 49 she is stunningly beautiful far better actress than most leading ladies bollywood today hopefully well get see more her,0.40829725829725827,0.11344766344766345,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,English Vinglish (2012)..... fabulous acting and story.......,"Movies don't need to be dramatic all the time. The simple stories around us can be much interesting and engaging. ""English Vinglish"" is such sort of movie. It delves into a simple story of Sashi, who is a housewife and can't speak English properly. As a result she often gets ignored and embarrassed by her children and husband. The whole film revolves around her attempt to regain her dignity and respect in family through joining English learning classes secretly. The story is indeed very simple but along the way touches you and even tickles you. The film gives a sweet message on regaining your self esteem rather than becoming sympathetic about yourself; and hence, is commendable in terms of realizing the values of family and relations. Besides, it also hints on how your small remarks may hurt others.The situations created in the film are simple, yet touches you; like Sashi getting hurt by her children's remarks or her desolation in New York City, or her desperation to create a balance with her family and her self esteem. Every moment leaves an impact, whether the ones in which Sashi appears an ignored mother in India, or her quest to regain self esteem in the English learning classes, or at her sister's house The biggest thing of the film is it's entertaining and yet the same time thought provoking without becoming preachy. The story runs at a moderate pace and even drags a bit at the second half but doesn't lose its interest and every moment becomes wittier. The splendid story gets brilliant carried by Sri Devi as Sashi. In every scene, she steals the show. Perhaps remove her, there is nothing in the movie. Watch it, and you would be able to realize more about understanding your family.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",english vinglish 2012 fabulous acting story,movies dont need be dramatic all time simple stories around us can be much interesting engaging english vinglish is such sort movie it delves into simple story sashi who is housewife cant speak english properly as result she often gets ignored embarrassed by her children husband whole film revolves around her attempt regain her dignity respect family through joining english learning classes secretly story is indeed very simple but along way touches you even tickles you film gives sweet message regaining your self esteem rather than becoming sympathetic about yourself hence is commendable terms realizing values family relations besides it also hints how your small remarks may hurt others situations created film are simple yet touches you like sashi getting hurt by her childrens remarks or her desolation new york city or her desperation create balance with her family her self esteem every moment leaves impact whether ones which sashi appears ignored mother india or her quest regain self esteem english learning classes or at her sisters house biggest thing film is its entertaining yet same time thought provoking without becoming preachy story runs at moderate pace even drags bit at second half but doesnt lose its interest every moment becomes wittier splendid story gets brilliant carried by sri devi as sashi every scene she steals show perhaps remove her there is nothing movie watch it you would be able realize more about understanding your family rating 3 stars out 4,0.4516743060860708,0.1520499108734403,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Beautiful film,"I have seen this movie numerous times till date but tonight while I was watching it again, I felt a sudden urge to write a bit about this movie.English Vinglish is one of the most original, priceless movies to have come along in the recent past.A very big salute to Gauri to have written such a script and for the way Sridevi acted in this film. I am spellbound every time I watch it. There are so many scenes, so many of them in which you will be amazed by Sridevi's expressions.Each and every time I watch it, I love it all the more. English Vinglish emotes numerous feelings: Its about the purest form of love- a mother has for her children. The way she hugs her kid, attends the PTA, does the michael jackson dance, cries on leaving her family back home while traveling to US. Its about fighting your inner fears. Its about respecting your mother and so much more.The entire cast of the movie was superb. Her family and the members in her English class, all were outstanding. Amit Trivedi's music was fantastic and complemented the movie perfectly. Some dialogues were quite impressive especially ""When you don't like yourself, you tend to dislike everything connected to you. New things seem to be more attractive. When you learn to love yourself, then the same old life starts looking new, nice."" That is what life is and couldn't have been put in better words.At the end the only thing I would like to say is that this movie is very close to my heart. Its one of the most refreshing movies you will ever come across and it will leave you with a big smile on your face. And lastly, she deserved the best actress award that year, every bit of it. I am not saying that others didn't deserve, but Sridevi's performance was at par with the rest. Till date whenever I watch this movie I feel extremely disappointed for her not receiving the best actress award for English Vinglish.",beautiful film,i have seen this movie numerous times till date but tonight while i was watching it again i felt sudden urge write bit about this movie english vinglish is one most original priceless movies have come along recent past very big salute gauri have written such script way sridevi acted this film i am spellbound every time i watch it there are so many scenes so many them which you will be amazed by sridevis expressions each every time i watch it i love it all more english vinglish emotes numerous feelings its about purest form love mother has her children way she hugs her kid attends pta does michael jackson dance cries leaving her family back home while traveling us its about fighting your inner fears its about respecting your mother so much more entire cast movie was superb her family members her english class all were outstanding amit trivedis music was fantastic complemented movie perfectly some dialogues were quite impressive especially when you dont like yourself you tend dislike everything connected you new things seem be more attractive when you learn love yourself then same old life starts looking new nice that is what life is couldnt have been put better words at end only thing i would like say is that this movie is very close my heart its one most refreshing movies you will ever come across it will leave you with big smile your face lastly she deserved best actress award that year every bit it i am not saying that others didnt deserve but sridevis performance was at par with rest till date whenever i watch this movie i feel extremely disappointed her not receiving best actress award english vinglish,0.5081106988249846,0.314239332096475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.13}"

,Adventures in the English language,"Arguably, Sridevi might have taken the biggest risk that any actress has ever taken in the history of Bollywood not only by making a comeback in a lead role after 15 years but also by choosing to do so with a first time director in a film that has no other star. She has undoubtedly earned the name of being Bollywood's biggest superstar but in what has been known as an ageist and sexist film industry, the question was whether the audience would accept and appreciate her. And they did. This just goes to prove her star power. But the other thing that Sridevi has done, that many have failed, was give script top priority and have faith in her director.Sridevi had mentioned that, other than liking the script, she had seen R. Balki's (director Gauri Shinde's husband and one of the producers of 'English Vinglish') 'Cheeni Kum' and 'Paa' and loved both films and this further helped make her decision. However, in my opinion, Shinde's film is far superior when compared to her husbands last two films. It's low on melodrama, consistently written never losing focus, has quirky fun characters (even though Shashi's Indian and Pakistani classmates are somewhat of a cliché) and makes good use of its tools (set, cinematography, music etc). There are a few loud and slightly syrupy moments and a few of the jokes are a little overdone but the balance in humour, romance and drama is well-maintained and it has a fresh feel.The characters are easy to relate to. I would have liked to know a little more about Shashi's classmates (with the exception of the Pakistani taxi driver and the Indian IT engineer). I liked that the non-Indian characters weren't portrayed as Bollywood stereotypes.The film is shot in both India and America. The locations are eye-candy but never out of place as the viewer sees it all through Shashi's point of view. Lyrically, the songs are a little awkward but they somehow fit the scenes.Where performance is concerned, needless to say this is Sridevi's film. Her acting is as though she had never left film. Not only is it refreshing to see her after a long time but just the moment she appears on screen, one is reminded why she's one of the most loved actresses of Indian cinema. She is excellently supported by a sincere Mehdi Nebbou, a solid Adil Hussain, a vivacious Priya Anand, a very likable Shivansh Kotia and an energetic Corey Hibbs.Thanks to spellbinding Sridevi, talented Gauri Shinde and the cast and crew who have done a remarkable job in making 'English Vinglish' a wonderful cinematic experience. A film that aims straight for the heart of the viewer and one that reminds of how learning a language and going to such classes can be so much fun. It's one of the best films in recent times that can be watched with the entire family and also works brilliantly as a date movie, a rainy day film and something to enjoy with friends.",adventures english language,arguably sridevi might have taken biggest risk that any actress has ever taken history bollywood not only by making comeback lead role after 15 years but also by choosing do so with first time director film that has no other star she has undoubtedly earned name being bollywoods biggest superstar but what has been known as ageist sexist film industry question was whether audience would accept appreciate her they did this just goes prove her star power but other thing that sridevi has done that many have failed was give script top priority have faith her director sridevi had mentioned that other than liking script she had seen r balkis director gauri shindes husband one producers english vinglish cheeni kum paa loved both films this further helped make her decision however my opinion shindes film is far superior when compared her husbands last two films its low melodrama consistently written never losing focus has quirky fun characters even though shashis indian pakistani classmates are somewhat clich makes good use its tools set cinematography music etc there are few loud slightly syrupy moments few jokes are little overdone but balance humour romance drama is well maintained it has fresh feel characters are easy relate i would have liked know little more about shashis classmates with exception pakistani taxi driver indian it engineer i liked that non indian characters werent portrayed as bollywood stereotypes film is shot both india america locations are eye candy but never out place as viewer sees it all through shashis point view lyrically songs are little awkward but they somehow fit scenes where performance is concerned needless say this is sridevis film her acting is as though she had never left film not only is it refreshing see her after long time but just moment she appears screen one is reminded why shes one most loved actresses indian cinema she is excellently supported by sincere mehdi nebbou solid adil hussain vivacious priya anand very likable shivansh kotia energetic corey hibbs thanks spellbinding sridevi talented gauri shinde cast crew who have done remarkable job making english vinglish wonderful cinematic experience film that aims straight heart viewer one that reminds how learning language going such classes can be so much fun its one best films recent times that can be watched with entire family also works brilliantly as date movie rainy day film something enjoy with friends,0.5056451612903224,0.21720430107526878,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,Sridevi is the ultimate hero!!!,"English Vinglish belongs to the superstar Sridevi and Sridevi only! One could hardly imagine any other actress putting life and soul to the character of Shashi, an Indian housewife who is demeaned by her husband and children for her lack of proficiency in the English language. You could hardly realize that Sridevi is an actress who was inactive in the industry for 14 years. She proves yet again that she hasn't lost the spark that was evident in her Khuda Gawah, Sadma, Gumrah, Laadla, Lamhe, and Chandni days. Of course, Shashi's character was based on the life of the director Gauri Shinde's mother. That may be one reason why it helped the debutante to portray the character on screen so beautifully. Some scenes such as the one where Shashi's daughter was feeling embarrassed in front of her principal because her mother can't speak English really touches your heart. It gives us an insight into the life of mothers who can't speak English. We're made to sympathise with them and we're made to learn instead of feeling embarrassed of our mothers' actions, we must encourage them to face up the challenge to learn a difficult language. I wonder why box office India gave a thumbs down to this masterpiece. Is the box office that dumb? Why can't they distinguish between a good and bad film? English Vinglish is thoroughly entertaining and warm. Sridevi makes the film watchable.

10.0,Sridevi is back with a BANG!!!,"First of all, HATS OFF TO SRIDEVI. While those like me, who have missed her superstar days, this is a movie to experience that. Also kudos to Gauri Shinde for creating a masterpiece out of an average storyline. English Vinglish talks is about the struggle of a regular Indian housewife to keep pace with the rapidly changing Englishified world and, more than that, rebuild her own identity which has been lost in daily household chores. Shashi (Sridevi) is a housewife with two kids, a husband and a mother-in-law in Pune who struggles to be on the same lane as her husband and kids are (the English speaking world in today's offices and schools in India). To add to her worries, she is made to visit New York, ALONE, to help her sister's daughter's wedding. Already under-confident in her own country, the movie beautifully depicts Shashi's road to confidence and building self-identity in a foreign English-speaking country, after awful experiences in the beginning and moments of grief. The movie also depicts the present reality of Indian society where housewifes are often belittled (when her husband calls her ""born to make laddus"" and the daughter scolds her for touching her scrapbook - written in English), mostly because of their little education, especially in English. While the topic of English is just a metaphor, the movie touches upon a woman's determination to get the deserved respect from her own family and support during emotional crisis. The movie is a must-see for a complete family for it has everything for everyone to take away.",sridevi is back with bang,first all hats off sridevi while those like me who have missed her superstar days this is movie experience that also kudos gauri shinde creating masterpiece out average storyline english vinglish talks is about struggle regular indian housewife keep pace with rapidly changing englishified world more than that rebuild her own identity which has been lost daily household chores shashi sridevi is housewife with two kids husband mother law pune who struggles be same lane as her husband kids are english speaking world todays offices schools india add her worries she is made visit new york alone help her sisters daughters wedding already under confident her own country movie beautifully depicts shashis road confidence building self identity foreign english speaking country after awful experiences beginning moments grief movie also depicts present reality indian society where housewifes are often belittled when her husband calls her born make laddus daughter scolds her touching her scrapbook written english mostly because their little education especially english while topic english is just metaphor movie touches upon womans determination get deserved respect her own family support during emotional crisis movie is must see complete family it has everything everyone take away,0.3785048285048286,0.10263798701298701,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.26}"
7.0,A surprise packet of Laddu..............,"Good things come in small packages and ""English Vinglish"" is the latest addition to such a package.Simple,sweet,predictable film which never tries to do more or different, much like its lovable protagonist.Sridevi is terrific in her comeback venture and gives a performance which would rank among her best along with Sadma. Debutant director Gauri Shinde's blotted approach,treatment, casting and crisp editing makes EV a joyride which could be otherwise a saccharine tale of a lost housewife.Adil Hussain, Mehdi Nebbou(remember Munich),the two kids,the niece,the teacher,the class-mates are all perfect in their roles and add so much without trying anything at all.As a feel good movie to bring a smile to your face, I found it way better than Barfi,the latest sensation.You can avoid it if you are not much into sweets but if you try this LADDU without being much JUDGEMENTAL you may end up liking it.Anyway,it does not have much side effects.",surprise packet laddu,good things come small packages english vinglish is latest addition such package simple sweet predictable film which never tries do more or different much like its lovable protagonist sridevi is terrific her comeback venture gives performance which would rank among her best along with sadma debutant director gauri shindes blotted approach treatment casting crisp editing makes ev joyride which could be otherwise saccharine tale lost housewife adil hussain mehdi nebbou remember munich two kids niece teacher class mates are all perfect their roles add so much without trying anything at all as feel good movie bring smile your face i found it way better than barfi latest sensation you can avoid it if you are not much into sweets but if you try this laddu without being much judgemental you may end up liking it anyway it does not have much side effects,0.48553113553113536,0.24230769230769234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.24}"
