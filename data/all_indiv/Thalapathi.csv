10,Best of Rajnikanth,"A fight between two brothers (Rajnikanth and Arvindswamy) is a classy version on Modern Mahabbaratha, is truly unique. Maniratnam has adapted the screenplay to the modern version and it's really awesome. Mammootty as Rajnikanth's friend Deva is amazing. Music and cinematography by Illayaraja and Santosh Sivan (The terrorist) commend each other. For me it's the best gangster movie made in India.

8,The Most Emotionally blended Family Friendly Crime Drama of 90s.,"Thalapathi (1991) : Brief Review -The Most Emotionally blended Family Friendly Crime Drama of 90s. One of the most popular genre in Hollywood Crime Drama didn't get much exploration in Indian Cinema till 80s. Then several crime dramas in masala genre gave hope but ultimately weakened the support of family audience. In early 90s Mani Ratnam brought Thalapathi set in crime world but differently i mean it's affectionate. It's all for people not for just for personal benefits of gangsters so it was meant to create more attraction to the family audience. At the end it becomes a Family drama yet not done with it's crime World to fulfill the hunger of watching a perfect Blockbuster. This was first and may be last time in Indian Cinema that a crime film became an emotional family drama and is likely to remain the one of it's own kind. Rajnikant and Mammootty's brotherhood mania is terrific. Both of them were really acting and not just entertaining and then another great actor Arvind Swamy was joined in a supporting role. Even the female side is filled with rich quality performances of Shobhana, Srividya and Bhanupriya. Overall, the acting department of Thalapathi is far better than any other crime drama i have seen till date. Mani Ratnam is a genius, he knows how to connect a negative film with audience positively and so he makes those negative characters more positive than born positive characters in the film. Many people consider this film as reference to Mahabharata characters which is not totally acceptable. The film is very well set in it's own crime Universe then I don't think there is any need to link it with an epic. Thalapathi should remain the only crime film having emotional intelligence and Blockbuster Family Drama elements for some time more.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",most emotionally blended family friendly crime drama 90s,thalapathi 1991 brief review most emotionally blended family friendly crime drama 90s one most popular genre hollywood crime drama didnt get much exploration indian cinema till 80s then several crime dramas masala genre gave hope but ultimately weakened support family audience early 90s mani ratnam brought thalapathi set crime world but differently i mean its affectionate its all people not just personal benefits gangsters so it was meant create more attraction family audience at end it becomes family drama yet not done with its crime world fulfill hunger watching perfect blockbuster this was first may be last time indian cinema that crime film became emotional family drama is likely remain one its own kind rajnikant mammoottys brotherhood mania is terrific both them were really acting not just entertaining then another great actor arvind swamy was joined supporting role even female side is filled with rich quality performances shobhana srividya bhanupriya overall acting department thalapathi is far better than any other crime drama i have seen till date mani ratnam is genius he knows how connect negative film with audience positively so he makes those negative characters more positive than born positive characters film many people consider this film as reference mahabharata characters which is not totally acceptable film is very well set its own crime universe then i dont think there is any need link it with epic thalapathi should remain only crime film having emotional intelligence blockbuster family drama elements some time more rating 8 10 by,0.5479772727272727,0.22138636363636355,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10,Timeless Masterpiece from Mani!,"For this movie, 10 out of 10 is probably too low. That's how good this movie is. Among Tamil cinema's timeless classics, it came in the late 80's and now its 2010 but still I watch it with the same enthusiasm and clap/whistle at some of the dialogues from this film. Maniratnam had a hard time directing Rajnikanth and Mammootty but if he can give a product like this through such hardships, I pray he goes through such hardships again (Sorry Mani Sir!). Ilayaraja is the life and soul of this film. Rajni's best ever performance along with Mammooty. There were the few Nayagan inspirations (Doing good for 4 people cannot be wrong, the inspector beating the hero and then the inspector getting killed by the same hero, etc). Who else can take the Karna-Duryodhana friendship from the Mahabharatha and weave such a magical story in accordance to today's times?

9,superb till climax!!!!!!!!!!!,"first of all, let me remind u the climax of this film is not the one you've actually seen. In the original climax it was Deva who avenges the death of his 'Thalapathi'. It would be a far better film if it had stayed that way, unfortunately it was not meant to be.....apart from these, it is a real classic....hats of to some brilliant technical and acting performances!!!! Santosh Sivan proves why he is considered among the top class cinematographer with every frame..melody king Ilayaraja is as usual excellent!! the theme music he created was awesome!!! from the acting point of view, undoubtedly this is Rajnikanth's best performance..Mammootty is brilliant as usual. If it had been the original climax, he would have scored more...Arvindswamy, Banupriya and shobana are good too.But the standout performance for me in this film is Srividhya...Maniratnam is the best director in India...",superb till climax,first all let me remind u climax this film is not one youve actually seen original climax it was deva who avenges death his thalapathi it would be far better film if it had stayed that way unfortunately it was not meant be apart these it is real classic hats some brilliant technical acting performances santosh sivan proves why he is considered among top class cinematographer with every frame melody king ilayaraja is as usual excellent theme music he created was awesome acting point view undoubtedly this is rajnikanths best performance mammootty is brilliant as usual if it had been original climax he would have scored more arvindswamy banupriya shobana are good too but standout performance me this film is srividhya maniratnam is best director india,0.5201388888888889,0.40208333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10,One of the best Indian movies ever,"This film is about 15 years old. i watched it quite a few times and it never fails to impress me. As said earlier it is a modern version of the Mahabharata, with Rajni as Karna.Its starts with a 14 year old mother forced to abandon her son and the son grows up in the city slums far away..he befriends a underworld don and swears loyalty to death for him Meanwhile the mother gets married and has a son who becomes a top government official. Nobody knows of her earlier son except for her husband. Thing come to head as her younger son is posted to where the elder(who the mother doesn't know is her son) is dominating.Watch the movie to see what happens.

10,My favorite movie of all time!,"Overall, its no secret that the plot is influenced by Mahabharat, especially the relationship between Karna and Duryodhan, and Karna and Arjun. Mani Rathnam once again proved his brilliance by incorporating a great epic to a real life situation. My favorite scene from this movie are two scenes that is the climax of the movie. The first scene is when Kalyani's husband after realizing Surya was the lost son, was the third person witnessing them at a temple, praying. The most moving moment, was when they both hear the train behind them, and they look back and gets emotional by the significance of the train. The acting done by Rajnikanth and Srividya was excellent in this scene. My second favorite scene, was when Arjun confronts Surya and Deva and asks them to stop. To which Surya replies ""Have you ever been poor? Have you ever been hungry? Without food in the stomach, have you ever tried to make money?...They don't have the money and time to file petitions to get justice, that is why they come to us"". Another good scene is also the confrontation is when Kalyani finally meets with Surya, and apologizes for her mistakes as a child, and asks him to stop being with Deva, to which Surya refuses. This is very reminiscent of Kunti, coming to Karna in the Mahabharat, and asking him to come to the side of Pandavas to which he refuses, since Duryodhan is a friend.The similarities between this movie and Karna's life, is strikingly similar. -Karna being thrown away since Kunti was a teenager, when she had him, which is similar to what happened to Deva. -Deva's stepbrother is Arjun, who is on the side of righteousness and is against Deva for using violence and fear to bring justice, is similar to Karna's stepbrother, Arjun, who was a Pandava, that was against Duryodhan for not giving them what they deserve for being the sons of Pandu. -Surya pledges his life to Deva, for treating him above his status as an orphan which is similar to Karna and Duryodhan, when Duryodhan offers one of his kingdoms to Karna. -Kalyani's husband confronts Surya, and tells him that Kalyani is her mother and Arjun is his stepbrother, and tells him to give up the life of violence and join them, is similar to Krishna approaching Karna and tells him that he is a Pandava, since he is the son of Kunti, and asks him to join the Pandavas, to which he says that he vowed to Duryodhan that he will be with him till death, to which Krishna respects Karna for. -Surya is known for not refusing anyone's demand, which is reminiscent of Karna, not refusing anyone's requests, when he is worshiping the Sun.The greatness of this movie also dwells on certain subtle elements added by Mani Rathnam, like the Sun, that can be seen behind Surya at all times, emphasizing the similarity between him and Karna, son of the Son god. The music by Ilaiyaraaja, was the best music produced by him for any movie. The acting done by Mamooty and Rajnikanth is unparalleled. I think Rajnikanth's acting in this film was superior to Kamal Hassan in Nayagan. This is probably the best acting by Rajnikanth in any of the movies acted by him. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend this movie highly.",my favorite movie all time,overall its no secret that plot is influenced by mahabharat especially relationship between karna duryodhan karna arjun mani rathnam once again proved his brilliance by incorporating great epic real life situation my favorite scene this movie are two scenes that is climax movie first scene is when kalyanis husband after realizing surya was lost son was third person witnessing them at temple praying most moving moment was when they both hear train behind them they look back gets emotional by significance train acting done by rajnikanth srividya was excellent this scene my second favorite scene was when arjun confronts surya deva asks them stop which surya replies have you ever been poor have you ever been hungry without food stomach have you ever tried make money they dont have money time file petitions get justice that is why they come us another good scene is also confrontation is when kalyani finally meets with surya apologizes her mistakes as child asks him stop being with deva which surya refuses this is very reminiscent kunti coming karna mahabharat asking him come side pandavas which he refuses since duryodhan is friend similarities between this movie karnas life is strikingly similar karna being thrown away since kunti was teenager when she had him which is similar what happened deva devas stepbrother is arjun who is side righteousness is against deva using violence fear bring justice is similar karnas stepbrother arjun who was pandava that was against duryodhan not giving them what they deserve being sons pandu surya pledges his life deva treating him above his status as orphan which is similar karna duryodhan when duryodhan offers one his kingdoms karna kalyanis husband confronts surya tells him that kalyani is her mother arjun is his stepbrother tells him give up life violence join them is similar krishna approaching karna tells him that he is pandava since he is son kunti asks him join pandavas which he says that he vowed duryodhan that he will be with him till death which krishna respects karna surya is known not refusing anyones demand which is reminiscent karna not refusing anyones requests when he is worshiping sun greatness this movie also dwells certain subtle elements added by mani rathnam like sun that can be seen behind surya at all times emphasizing similarity between him karna son son god music by ilaiyaraaja was best music produced by him any movie acting done by mamooty rajnikanth is unparalleled i think rajnikanths acting this film was superior kamal hassan nayagan this is probably best acting by rajnikanth any movies acted by him overall this is great movie i would recommend this movie highly,0.4498781838316722,0.178859357696567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,Ommala Moovie!!,"The movie with the combo of Mani and Thala's of neighboring states and with splendid tunes from Illayaraja ,a certain delight is a sure bet !! Trite , crisp dialogues are characteristics of this movie just as any mani ratnam flick is. The scene which stands out for its 'crispness' comes the intensely set one in which Rajni after being imprisoned in the initial scenes is released as somebody else turns in as approval for the crime which he created. Surya,(Rajni) unaware of who has sent him, walks across to him n asks him, "" YYYYEN?"" After a few pauses he gets the reply,"" DEVA!! "". He comes out of the room and walks in the corridor just to witness Deva (Mamooty) and there begins the friendship between Surya and Deva which is so deep, committed and brilliant. The tone of most of the scenes keeps one gripping and with its melodramatic ingredients and songs, contributes to a bit of dilution of its intensity though.

7,Rajnikanth's best and by a mile,"This sets the relationship between Karan and Duryodhana in modern times, in criminal setting and tries to answer the age old question, ""Why was a supposedly good person like Karan adamant on his friendship with Duryodhana? What bonded the two for life?""Maniratnam's story, screenplay, dialogues and direction are meant to make you invest in and care for the protagonists, to pray for them, to be fascinated by them and also to be repelled by their actions and intrigued by their motivations. And he succeeds spectacularly. The drama is of the highest notch, with many a scene guaranteed to make you reach out for your nearest handkerchief or shoulder.The action sequences are particularly intense, with no background score, the only sounds being of fists crashing against different body parts. I haven't experienced such visceral thrills in a long time.Illyaraaja's music and the background score are beautiful. I had to look at the subtitles to understand the words and hence, I was a bit behind the curve on occasion. But, the music has been masterfully created to make you feel pathos and pathos you feel, upon hearing it. However, one of the few grouses with the movie that I had was the frequent song and dance sequences. I understand that this was a commercial potboiler, but, these broke the tension created by the proceedings. And the songs were longer than 5 minutes on most occasions. The acting is, almost surreally, exceptional.Like Kamal Haasan after him, the Hindi movie writers have tried to ""Bollywoodize"" Mr. Kanth rather than letting him be. Those who get surprised by the frenzy and emotions that surround his every release should watch him in this. They would come away enlightened.I have seen only bits and pieces of Rajnikanth's acting prowess, in roles that were under cooked, such as those in ""Hum"" and ""Andha Kanoon"". The intensity of his performance, here, is like a physical thing, which crashed into me and left a mark on my psyche. It is breathtaking and barely believable. It must be easily one of his finest acts. This is all the more appreciable as there was ample opportunity for hamming it up. But, you only have to stare into the depth of his eyes to believe in the credibility of his threat.Mamooty is excellent as the benevolent don. However, Rajnikanth is in such exquisite form, that he outshines Mamooty in almost all the scenes that they have together. Srividya shines in the role of Kunti. Arvind Swamy doesn't have much to do, in terms of acting. Amrish Puri is wasted. The film would not have been poorer, if his role had been completely edited out. The origin or the reason for his animosity with Mamooty is never revealed and that takes away some of the sheen of believability from his actions.The editing could have tighter. Also, there were perhaps too many coincidences that served to drive the story forward. I didn't find a fault in them, as they helped to ratchet up the tension and the drama. But, perhaps, this could have been minimized.Also, the production house / Amazon Prime Videos would do well to upload a better copy of the movie. The video often became pixellated, which wasn't expected. There are many scenes wherein the background score is missing. Thankfully, none of the dialogues have been affected.",rajnikanths best by mile,this sets relationship between karan duryodhana modern times criminal setting tries answer age old question why was supposedly good person like karan adamant his friendship with duryodhana what bonded two life maniratnams story screenplay dialogues direction are meant make you invest care protagonists pray them be fascinated by them also be repelled by their actions intrigued by their motivations he succeeds spectacularly drama is highest notch with many scene guaranteed make you reach out your nearest handkerchief or shoulder action sequences are particularly intense with no background score only sounds being fists crashing against different body parts i havent experienced such visceral thrills long time illyaraajas music background score are beautiful i had look at subtitles understand words hence i was bit behind curve occasion but music has been masterfully created make you feel pathos pathos you feel upon hearing it however one few grouses with movie that i had was frequent song dance sequences i understand that this was commercial potboiler but these broke tension created by proceedings songs were longer than 5 minutes most occasions acting is almost surreally exceptional like kamal haasan after him hindi movie writers have tried bollywoodize mr kanth rather than letting him be those who get surprised by frenzy emotions that surround his every release should watch him this they would come away enlightened i have seen only bits pieces rajnikanths acting prowess roles that were under cooked such as those hum andha kanoon intensity his performance here is like physical thing which crashed into me left mark my psyche it is breathtaking barely believable it must be easily one his finest acts this is all more appreciable as there was ample opportunity hamming it up but you only have stare into depth his eyes believe credibility his threat mamooty is excellent as benevolent don however rajnikanth is such exquisite form that he outshines mamooty almost all scenes that they have together srividya shines role kunti arvind swamy doesnt have much do terms acting amrish puri is wasted film would not have been poorer if his role had been completely edited out origin or reason his animosity with mamooty is never revealed that takes away some sheen believability his actions editing could have tighter also there were perhaps too many coincidences that served drive story forward i didnt find fault them as they helped ratchet up tension drama but perhaps this could have been minimized also production house amazon prime videos would do well upload better copy movie video often became pixellated which wasnt expected there are many scenes wherein background score is missing thankfully none dialogues have been affected,0.5117589893100095,0.2612244897959184,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10,An evergreen classic,"I first saw this movie during Diwali in 1991. I used to be a school student then. This movie got rave reviews during its release and with great difficulty I got tickets to watch this fi;m! At first viewing I just loved it though I had a tough time listening to the dialogues as theatre was packed with Rajni fans who would shout and whistle at almost every dialogue of Thalaivar! I then watched it many years later on TV and then got to watch a very good print on DVD.This is one of the most technically well made Tamil films till date. Mani Ratnam and his team made an all time classic! Wish more of such movies were made these days! The story, direction, screenplay, acting, music, cinematography are all spot on! I especially love this movie's cinematography and background music! I think this is on of the best photographed Tamil movies ever! Every cinematography student should study the photographic style of this movie! The lighting, camera angles, shot composition are just superb! And Then Ilaiyaraja's background music is just awesome! The story of this movie is inspired from Karna's character in Mahabharata. Karna was Kunti's illegitimate son (given to her womb as a boon by the sun god Surya) and had to let go of him as she was unmarried, She later married Pandu and gave birth to the Pandavas while Karna grew up on his own and later became a very good friend of Duryodhana who was a cousin and sworn enemy of the Pandavas. Rajnikanth's character is based on Karna while Mammooty's based on Duryodhana and Aravindswamy character is based on Arjuna.This movie has loose parallels with Mani Ratnam's Nayagan which was about a Don and one of his friends from young age became his main henchman. Thalapathi's story is about the main henchman of a don. Both movies have similar patterns such as the main character getting bruttally hit in the police station and later the police trying to destroy the entire gang of the main character.Like Nayagan Thalapathi is a violent film, In fact more violent. I remember when watching it first in theatre (had an U/A cert) this movie had lots of gory scene. I recollect with horror the scene where Rajni shoots of the fingers of Manoj K Jayan or the climax scene where Amrish Puri's head is blown of by Rajni's gun. THis and many gory moments were later removed for broadcast on TV and surprisingly even the DVD didn't have it! I doubt there any original unrated prints of this today.This movie isn't without its flaws. To start with I wasn't convinced over the way Rajni and Mammooty became friends whereby Rajni swears to give his life for Mammooty. It takes years of understanding and loyalty to develop between friends to get to point where they are ready to give life for each other! Its true in Mahabharata Karna swore life long loyalty the minute Duryodhana saved his honor but over here it just doesn't make sense. Then in the end the Rajni's character is let to go scot free after like killing so many people and his family have no issues with it either, even his mom wants to stay with him in the end! I personally feel this is the best performance ever by Rajni in his entire career. His acting is very convincing and in many scenes he plays the part in an understated manner! I guess it takes a director like Mani Ratnam to bring out the best from a superstar like Rajni! A sad thing associated with this movie was the parting of Mani Ratnam and Ilaiyaraja, as for his next movie he launched AR Rahman who has remained his composer till date! Although Mani and Rahman have given lots of hits together its the combo of Mani and Ilaiyaraja which I cherish and remember even today! Wish they both come together again to weave another magical movie!",evergreen classic,i first saw this movie during diwali 1991 i used be school student then this movie got rave reviews during its release with great difficulty i got tickets watch this fi m at first viewing i just loved it though i had tough time listening dialogues as theatre was packed with rajni fans who would shout whistle at almost every dialogue thalaivar i then watched it many years later tv then got watch very good print dvd this is one most technically well made tamil films till date mani ratnam his team made all time classic wish more such movies were made these days story direction screenplay acting music cinematography are all spot i especially love this movies cinematography background music i think this is best photographed tamil movies ever every cinematography student should study photographic style this movie lighting camera angles shot composition are just superb then ilaiyarajas background music is just awesome story this movie is inspired karnas character mahabharata karna was kuntis illegitimate son given her womb as boon by sun god surya had let go him as she was unmarried she later married pandu gave birth pandavas while karna grew up his own later became very good friend duryodhana who was cousin sworn enemy pandavas rajnikanths character is based karna while mammootys based duryodhana aravindswamy character is based arjuna this movie has loose parallels with mani ratnams nayagan which was about don one his friends young age became his main henchman thalapathis story is about main henchman don both movies have similar patterns such as main character getting bruttally hit police station later police trying destroy entire gang main character like nayagan thalapathi is violent film fact more violent i remember when watching it first theatre had u cert this movie had lots gory scene i recollect with horror scene where rajni shoots fingers manoj k jayan or climax scene where amrish puris head is blown by rajnis gun this many gory moments were later removed broadcast tv surprisingly even dvd didnt have it i doubt there any original unrated prints this today this movie isnt without its flaws start with i wasnt convinced over way rajni mammooty became friends whereby rajni swears give his life mammooty it takes years understanding loyalty develop between friends get point where they are ready give life each other its true mahabharata karna swore life long loyalty minute duryodhana saved his honor but over here it just doesnt make sense then end rajnis character is let go scot free after like killing so many people his family have no issues with it either even his mom wants stay with him end i personally feel this is best performance ever by rajni his entire career his acting is very convincing many scenes he plays part understated manner i guess it takes director like mani ratnam bring out best superstar like rajni sad thing associated with this movie was parting mani ratnam ilaiyaraja as his next movie he launched ar rahman who has remained his composer till date although mani rahman have given lots hits together its combo mani ilaiyaraja which i cherish remember even today wish they both come together again weave another magical movie,0.4847456575682383,0.2411965811965811,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8,Best of Rajini's,"Contains Spoilers! This is one movie that makes me miss Rajini as an actor every time i watch it. Being a die hard fan of Manirathnam its no surprise that this is one of the best all time movies for me, and not to mention Illayaraja's music its just awesome. All said there is one-thing that i couldn't get over with in this movie. The base of the movie is in itself on the friendship between these characters Surya and Devaraj and i felt the formation of this friendship is not solid enough to make it stick i felt. Afterall the only reason Surya says that he would even given his life for Deva is because, Deva has mistakenly made Surya arrested and put in jail for killing one of his men and later realizes that and brings him out of jail (only that Surya did kill Deva's man and Deva only realizes that Surya has killed him for the right reason). Now this is supposed to be the only reason why Surya does anything and everything for Deva is a bit unfair at least to me considering the rest of the movie falls with this friendship as backdrop. Does anyone else felt that way ?
