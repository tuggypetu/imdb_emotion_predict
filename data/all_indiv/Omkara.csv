10,"If you have not seen an Indian movie in a long time, this is the one to break your hiatus with.","I took only the masterline from Othello and sketched it from there on my own. I almost felt as if I had written it Â…only 400 years ago.- Vishal BharadwajHaughty comment of a wannabe or simplistic fascination of an artist? A fairly new and art-house director with a star-cast to challenge any Yash Chopra production and an eight-figure production budget is not just a rarity in Indian cinema, but unheard of. What Vishal ends up delivering is highly-intelligent cinema with all the accessibility of any major commercial release (akin to a Batman Begins as a summer movie). I can't resist quoting from my review of Maqbool: Give Vishal Bharadwaj a solid pat on the back, and sit back waiting for his next movie. This man seethes brilliance in his film-making. His dialogues, his script, his music, and his direction - all are top-notch. This movie proves that Makdee was no fluke.Omkara (Ajay Devgan) is a gang-leader in the semi-lawless state of UP. Bhaisaab's (Naseer's) election win promotes Omi, leaving his ""Youth Leader"" seat empty. In a logical political move, Omi selects Kesu Firangi (Vivek Oberoi) as his successor ignoring his loyal right-hand-man Langda Tyagi (Saif). Green with envy, Langda slowly poisons Omkara's mind against Kesu leading him down a path too dark for anyone's good. Kareena, Konkona & Bipasha play Omi, Langda & Kesu's love interests respectively.The movie starts in the middle of an attempted wedding of a girl and carries on until she gets married. The events that transpire inbetween, the turns that different people take to affect her life and the eventual effect is Vishal Bharadwaj's unique Omkara. The title of his second Shakespearean movie went through a few changes before finally resting on his Othello equivalent. But this movie could easily have also been called ""Dolly Mishra"" or ""Langda Tyagi"". These three characters equally occupy our minds with their unpredictable fates and yet it is the triumph of Saif Ali Khan's powerfully vile performance that his limp Tyagi towers head and shoulders above anybody around him.Vishal writes the Screenplay & Dialogues, composes music, sings and directs in just his fourth movie yet which only strengthens the silent promise his is making to his fans of greater things to come. Missing are the escapist dream sequences and melodramatic dialogues that Hindi movies are generally associated with. He instead roots the movie in realism with even the song-and-dance sequences being what are existent in a real-world Indian lifestyle.Anyone who has followed Indian cinema since the 70s will note the clear influence in Vishal's work-style from his previous two movies. It does help to have this influence (Gulzar) as the lyricist of the movie and (my guess) a quiet adviser too. The most clear indication of this is in the dialogues and the style of sparsely sprinkled humour.My only gripe with the movie was the language spoken by the characters. It is a mix of Hindi & Bhojpuri - something that is indeed spoken in U.P. But this gripe is more to do with my short-coming in not understanding the language rather than a flaw in the movie.If you have not seen an Indian movie in a long time, this is the one to break your hiatus with.My Rating --> 4 of 5P.S: Vishal Bharadwaj has directed, in order, Makdee (original story), Maqbool(Shakespeare's Macbeth), Chatri Chor(Ruskin Bond's Blue Umbrella) and Omkara(Shakespeare's Othello). Chatri Chor remains unreleased although it has been shown in a few festivals around Europe.",if you have not seen indian movie long time this is one break your hiatus with,i took only masterline othello sketched it there my own i almost felt as if i had written it only 400 years ago vishal bharadwajhaughty comment wannabe or simplistic fascination artist fairly new art house director with star cast challenge any yash chopra production eight figure production budget is not just rarity indian cinema but unheard what vishal ends up delivering is highly intelligent cinema with all accessibility any major commercial release akin batman begins as summer movie i cant resist quoting my review maqbool give vishal bharadwaj solid pat back sit back waiting his next movie this man seethes brilliance his film making his dialogues his script his music his direction all are top notch this movie proves that makdee was no fluke omkara ajay devgan is gang leader semi lawless state up bhaisaabs naseers election win promotes omi leaving his youth leader seat empty logical political move omi selects kesu firangi vivek oberoi as his successor ignoring his loyal right hand man langda tyagi saif green with envy langda slowly poisons omkaras mind against kesu leading him down path too dark anyones good kareena konkona bipasha play omi langda kesus love interests respectively movie starts middle attempted wedding girl carries until she gets married events that transpire inbetween turns that different people take affect her life eventual effect is vishal bharadwajs unique omkara title his second shakespearean movie went through few changes before finally resting his othello equivalent but this movie could easily have also been called dolly mishra or langda tyagi these three characters equally occupy our minds with their unpredictable fates yet it is triumph saif ali khans powerfully vile performance that his limp tyagi towers head shoulders above anybody around him vishal writes screenplay dialogues composes music sings directs just his fourth movie yet which only strengthens silent promise his is making his fans greater things come missing are escapist dream sequences melodramatic dialogues that hindi movies are generally associated with he instead roots movie realism with even song dance sequences being what are existent real world indian lifestyle anyone who has followed indian cinema since 70s will note clear influence vishals work style his previous two movies it does help have this influence gulzar as lyricist movie my guess quiet adviser too most clear indication this is dialogues style sparsely sprinkled humour my only gripe with movie was language spoken by characters it is mix hindi bhojpuri something that is indeed spoken u p but this gripe is more do with my short coming not understanding language rather than flaw movie if you have not seen indian movie long time this is one break your hiatus with my rating 4 5p s vishal bharadwaj has directed order makdee original story maqbool shakespeares macbeth chatri chor ruskin bonds blue umbrella omkara shakespeares othello chatri chor remains unreleased although it has been shown few festivals around europe,0.4277080327080328,0.1052059283309283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8,"Omkara, Bhardwaj's victory!","Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Omkara' is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespeare's play 'Othello'. Set in rural Uttar Pradesh, the film deals with everything the original story dealt with, including morality, faith, doubt, love, betrayal and deception. Bhardwaj's direction is marvelous and his portrayal of the rural India is laudable. He skillfully captures the spirit of these wild hinterlands and their effervescent and simple people through his dark narrative style and brilliant writing. The film is very well crafted and is amazingly realistic thanks to the serious proceedings, the authentic dialogues, the simple locations, the lifelike situations and the roundly natural acting. Speaking of acting, I will not stretch it much and will say it straight: Saif Ali Khan did not only outdo everyone in the film, he outdid himself with his performance. As the manipulative Langda (Iago), he is unrecognisable, his dialect and body language are spot-on, and he easily pulls off a role no-one ever expected him to play. Konkona Sen Sharma equals his act totally, and though her part is relatively small, she is absolutely astonishing as the vivacious and sassy Indu (Emilia) and steals every scene she appears in. Again, her dialect and mannerisms were incredible. Kareena Kapoor is very pretty in her deglamorised role of Dolly (Desdemona) and her acting is excellent throughout. Vivek Oberoi is very effective. Ajay Devgan is good as Omkara (Othello) but is very disappointing mainly because though his is the central character, you almost forget about him at the end of the show. Bipasha Basu looks stunning and acts well but she hardly has a role to speak of. Other cast members do a fine job. The film's soundtrack, composed by Bhardwaj himself (another proof to his craftsmanship), is outstanding. My favourite songs include ""Beedi"", ""Namak"" and ""O Saathi Re"". The film's climax is thrilling and the ending is bittersweet, very tragic and sad but still conveys the irony and provides the much-needed catharsis. 'Omkara' is an interesting and artistic movie and truly a gem where Hindi cinema is concerned. I recommend.",omkara bhardwajs victory,vishal bhardwajs omkara is modern day adaptation shakespeares play othello set rural uttar pradesh film deals with everything original story dealt with including morality faith doubt love betrayal deception bhardwajs direction is marvelous his portrayal rural india is laudable he skillfully captures spirit these wild hinterlands their effervescent simple people through his dark narrative style brilliant writing film is very well crafted is amazingly realistic thanks serious proceedings authentic dialogues simple locations lifelike situations roundly natural acting speaking acting i will not stretch it much will say it straight saif ali khan did not only outdo everyone film he outdid himself with his performance as manipulative langda iago he is unrecognisable his dialect body language are spot he easily pulls off role no one ever expected him play konkona sen sharma equals his act totally though her part is relatively small she is absolutely astonishing as vivacious sassy indu emilia steals every scene she appears again her dialect mannerisms were incredible kareena kapoor is very pretty her deglamorised role dolly desdemona her acting is excellent throughout vivek oberoi is very effective ajay devgan is good as omkara othello but is very disappointing mainly because though his is central character you almost forget about him at end show bipasha basu looks stunning acts well but she hardly has role speak other cast members do fine job films soundtrack composed by bhardwaj himself another proof his craftsmanship is outstanding my favourite songs include beedi namak o saathi re films climax is thrilling ending is bittersweet very tragic sad but still conveys irony provides much needed catharsis omkara is interesting artistic movie truly gem where hindi cinema is concerned i recommend,0.5699503968253969,0.18628472222222225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8,Can Raw be Gorgeous ?...its Omkara !,"Can Raw be Gorgeous ? Well here we have for that one rare spectacular treat. Vishal Bhardwaj visualizes and presents a mesmeric manifestation out of rustic, rural, and wild backdrop. Omkara is an adaptation from Othello, one of the four great tragedies written by Shakespeare that includes Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth. Vishal has made all possible efforts to recreate the magic of the powerful script and he has succeeded to a great extent. However he has changed background from one that at royals in Europe to pastoral countryside in western Uttar Pradesh. The movie has an extravagant treatment and every aspect from costumes to sets and dialect to music has been designed to near exactness. The beginning takes you straight into the heartland of India where politics and power equations are bread and butter of the inhabitants. The color of muscle-power, sex, and jealously makes perfect ingredients for a Bollywood potboiler. It surely have been a laudable effort by the filmmaker after depicting his genius with Maqbool in 2003 (another adaptation from Shakespeare's Macbeth). Omkara stays true to its spirit, (the original word is a spiritual vibration from Sanskrit) it's an impersonal and formless representation of the absolute truth. Ajay Devgan playing the lead gives the right tone and shade to the character. His intense expressive eyes and deep throat say it all. It is indeed a quantum leap over his last negative portrayal in Ram Gopal Verma's ""Company"". He stays in focus from the first action sequence and the title song gives him a fitting introduction on the canvas. The whole drama revolves around his emotions and his weaknesses. His love interest in the film is played by Kareena Kapoor and to say the least she has been a complete revelation to watch. She looks stunning and emotes with ease in some very delicate parts of the show. Vivek Oberoi tries his hand again on some quality stuff after a string of flops recently but unfortunately he is one of the rare weak parts of this plot. He looked very vulnerable and the character never gave him an opportunity to come to the forefront. Konkona Sen Sharma is always full of surprises and her versatility is her strength. The variety of roles she does will be envy for any actor. She plays with simple elegance for a common house villager and without a doubt impresses one and all. Another high was from Bipasha Basu, playing a sultry siren and absolutely ignites the screen with couple of dance numbers. Apart from illustrating her well toned figure there was not much of performance meat in her presence. However the most sumptuous role was bagged by none other than brilliant Saif Ali Khan. He is the fulcrum for the whole movie and he is one who raises the bar of quality for many others around him. One could essentially feel the frustration and resentment in Saif's depiction. The way he hatches the plot and then makes his wicked moves one by one develops the much needed interest for the viewer. He is very slow to start with by staying in shadows of Devgan but then came the string of frames where he outclassed the former. Omkara should well be appreciated for its technical brilliance. With bulk of shooting at Wai and Lonavala in Maharashtra, it would have been a real big challenge to structure an authentic North Indian village. The cinematography was sheer pleasure and many shots were so aesthetic that it felt like watching mesmeric work of art in motion. The frames were large and the theme of boisterous merrymaking was captured with meticulous vividness. The script is just right and director do not waste any reels on explaining irrelevant details. Though large hearted shower of local offensive words can get jarring for some audience. Music did not have much to do in this tight screenplay and the director could have done better without couple of songs. Although ""Jag Ja Ri Gudia"" composition sung by Suresh Wadkar is a pure melody and the veteran made his presence felt in crop of new singers. The song has special relevance with the storyline and thus goes along well. All accolades to the director for feasting us on an outstanding cinema. He is a showcase of the new genre of Indian film makers and he has all his fundamentals in the right place. The movie leaves us with heavy thoughts and a lot to ponder in the end. It could have been very easy for anyone to go awry with such a radiant cast line but Vishal not only develops the individual characters skillfully but also creates the magic of making Raw look Gorgeous",can raw be gorgeous its omkara,can raw be gorgeous well here we have that one rare spectacular treat vishal bhardwaj visualizes presents mesmeric manifestation out rustic rural wild backdrop omkara is adaptation othello one four great tragedies written by shakespeare that includes hamlet king lear macbeth vishal has made all possible efforts recreate magic powerful script he has succeeded great extent however he has changed background one that at royals europe pastoral countryside western uttar pradesh movie has extravagant treatment every aspect costumes sets dialect music has been designed near exactness beginning takes you straight into heartland india where politics power equations are bread butter inhabitants color muscle power sex jealously makes perfect ingredients bollywood potboiler it surely have been laudable effort by filmmaker after depicting his genius with maqbool 2003 another adaptation shakespeares macbeth omkara stays true its spirit original word is spiritual vibration sanskrit its impersonal formless representation absolute truth ajay devgan playing lead gives right tone shade character his intense expressive eyes deep throat say it all it is indeed quantum leap over his last negative portrayal ram gopal vermas company he stays focus first action sequence title song gives him fitting introduction canvas whole drama revolves around his emotions his weaknesses his love interest film is played by kareena kapoor say least she has been complete revelation watch she looks stunning emotes with ease some very delicate parts show vivek oberoi tries his hand again some quality stuff after string flops recently but unfortunately he is one rare weak parts this plot he looked very vulnerable character never gave him opportunity come forefront konkona sen sharma is always full surprises her versatility is her strength variety roles she does will be envy any actor she plays with simple elegance common house villager without doubt impresses one all another high was bipasha basu playing sultry siren absolutely ignites screen with couple dance numbers apart illustrating her well toned figure there was not much performance meat her presence however most sumptuous role was bagged by none other than brilliant saif ali khan he is fulcrum whole movie he is one who raises bar quality many others around him one could essentially feel frustration resentment saifs depiction way he hatches plot then makes his wicked moves one by one develops much needed interest viewer he is very slow start with by staying shadows devgan but then came string frames where he outclassed former omkara should well be appreciated its technical brilliance with bulk shooting at wai lonavala maharashtra it would have been real big challenge structure authentic north indian village cinematography was sheer pleasure many shots were so aesthetic that it felt like watching mesmeric work art motion frames were large theme boisterous merrymaking was captured with meticulous vividness script is just right director do not waste any reels explaining irrelevant details though large hearted shower local offensive words can get jarring some audience music did not have much do this tight screenplay director could have done better without couple songs although jag ja ri gudia composition sung by suresh wadkar is pure melody veteran made his presence felt crop new singers song has special relevance with storyline thus goes along well all accolades director feasting us outstanding cinema he is showcase new genre indian film makers he has all his fundamentals right place movie leaves us with heavy thoughts lot ponder end it could have been very easy anyone go awry with such radiant cast line but vishal not only develops individual characters skillfully but also creates magic making raw look gorgeous,0.5480624993693174,0.1736059584355038,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9,Excellent piece of craftsmanship,"I caught the first screening of Omkara, and I must say that I am astounded. Vishal Bharadwaj had previously carved a niche for himself in the industry, with the likes of Makdee and Maqbool, but Omkara puts him in a league of his own. It is an exquisite work of art, with each person putting in their best. Everyone knows Omkara to be an adaptation of Othello, and I frankly expected Omkara to be just that. At best, I thought it would be Vishal's homage to Shakespeare. I was terribly wrong. Omkara is a poem in itself. Every aspect of the movie has the dedication and tenacity of the director stamped on it (considering he has handled direction, dialogues, screenplay, music, and even sung a song). The beauty of Omkara lies not in its portrayal of Othello, but the fact that it uses Othello as a platform to weave an intricate tale of love, obsession, treachery and tragedy. Yes, Omkara is an adaptation of Othello, but that is not the strength of the movie. The real strength of the movie lies in the performances of all the characters, and the gripping narrative. From the word go, Omkara has you by the crotch (pardon the usage), and lets go only after the last credits have rolled off. Vishal's Omkara (Othello) is the chieftain of a band of outlaws in a semi-lawless rural area in Uttar Pradesh. His brother and right hand man is Langda Tyagi (Iago), named so for his limp. Another prominent figure in this gang is Keshu Firangi(Michael Cassio), the only member to have a college education. Omkara is in love with the bewitchingly beautiful Dolly (Desdemona), and she with him. At her behest, he and his gang interrupt her wedding and bring her to his village. In the village, Langda's wife Indu(Emilia) takes Dolly under her wing, becoming companion and friend. When Omkara appoints Keshu as the youth leader of the gang, Langda (who anticipated the post) feels jealous and overlooked, and seeks revenge by convincing Omkara that Dolly is having an affair with Keshu behind his back. For most part the story is the same as that of Othello, with just the background of each character adapted to suit the Indian temperament. Also, the language used a mix of Hindi and Bhojpuri, which adds to the aesthetics of the movie.Ajay Devgan as Omkara ascends to new heights of emoting, using his eyes to convey so much more than he could ever say. The obsessive lover, the ruthless gang leader, a man eaten up by his inferiority complex and the doubts borne thereof, Ajay lives every moment of his character. Viveik Oberoi is seen after a bit of a hiatus, and does considerably well. As the childlike Keshu, with his boyish grin and charm, you can't help liking him, and feeling sorry for him. Kareena Kapoor has always been an actress to reckon with in my books, since her 'Refugee' 'Chameli', and 'Dev' days, and proves her mettle as the devoted and loving Dolly. Quality work from a largely underrated actress, proving that she's a lot more than the glam girl she often portrays. The surprise of the pack was Bipasha, who does a considerably extended 'special' appearance and ample justice to her role as Billo, Keshu's love interest. Neseeruddin Shah as the overlord Bhaisaab, is a treat to watch. To say anything more would take away from the essence of his performance. Konkana Sen-Sharma as the simple, yet shrewd Indu is brilliance personified. With her natural accent and looks, she suits the role to a T. You instantly see in Indu a strong and loving woman. Be it as Dolly's friend, Lagda's wife, or as a bhabhi to the younger members of the gang, Konkana has the role down pat. Particularly endearing is her 'kheiin', akin to an 'arre'. Each of these actors has portrayed their characters faultlessly, and no other actor could have done them better. Yet they all pale in comparison to Saif Ali Khan, as the cunning, devious, and calculating Langda Tyagi. This man is simply too good an actor. Sly and manipulative, his persona exudes pure evil,without even the stereotype evil laugh. His eyes strike a fear that resonates deep in your soul, and even hours after the movie is over,Langda is the character you keep thinking of, and is easily the pick of the lot. If Saif deserved a National Award for HUM TUM, then an award for this is a no-brainer.Hats off to all the cast and crew members of Omkara, and to Vishal Bharadwaj, for creating this masterpiece of contemporary Hindi cinema.SurajPS- Watch out for the expletives used freely in the movie.

9,Cinema at its finest.,"If you like cinema, it's beyond me how you can not like this movie.There's so much to love here. The precision and nuance the director employs is beautiful. There are so many scenes that only last a few seconds, but they leave such an indelible effect. Like cinematic poetry. So many opportunities for extended conflicts and contrived drama is eschewed in favor of a shot that lingers for just a few moments, letting you know everything you need to.The director really gets it. And because he gets it, the actors are free to act, all doing much better work than we're used to seeing. Saif steals the show. Othello, the play, needs Iago.And Saif takes that ubermensch archetype and runs with it, from the broad strokes of the character, the obvious facets embodied in his physicality and his his presence, to the more subtle notes like that glimmer of lonely angst in his eyes. And he does it without ever trying to upstage anyone, or at least does a good job of giving that impression.The birthday party scene, where he quietly begs for some sign of affection from anyone gathered and finds himself all alone, was touching in a surprising way - I've seen a lot of movies, and I think I even pride myself on not falling prey to the usual appeals to emotion; the same techniques that directors and actors use over and over again. But, this caught me off-guard. There's a level of depth to the verisimilitude and nuance that's hard to come by.The role that music plays in all this is also amazing. Not surprising because the director, Vishal Bharadwaj, comes from an accomplished musical background. It rarely calls attention to itself and always seems to complement the visuals and action in perfect sync. A thing of beauty, really.Anyway, reading what I've written so far, you might think that this movie is only for people who take movies too seriously, maybe. People who're very concerned with the technical aspects of it etc.But, that's really not the case. It is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello, and it never strays too far from it's source. It's Shakespeare, that yardstick of universally applicable human experience.I found myself relating to every character in the movie, even the minor ones. It engages you on a level that few movies ever do and does it without asking too much. Because there are no long monologues. The dialogue is succinct and apt. The visuals are always pretty, many of the frames like paintings taken by themselves. In other words, despite belonging to that post-Tarantino MTV generation, expecting constant stimulation and engagement to be provided to you instead of actively investing it, I had no trouble with this movie.The film doesn't have the arrogance to ask you to sacrifice your viewing pleasure because it's Shakespeare and invest extra amounts of energy and attention. Without using the word in a bad way at all, there's plenty of entertainment here. And that's Shakespeare too.",cinema at its finest,if you like cinema its beyond me how you can not like this movie theres so much love here precision nuance director employs is beautiful there are so many scenes that only last few seconds but they leave such indelible effect like cinematic poetry so many opportunities extended conflicts contrived drama is eschewed favor shot that lingers just few moments letting you know everything you need director really gets it because he gets it actors are free act all doing much better work than were used seeing saif steals show othello play needs iago saif takes that ubermensch archetype runs with it broad strokes character obvious facets embodied his physicality his his presence more subtle notes like that glimmer lonely angst his eyes he does it without ever trying upstage anyone or at least does good job giving that impression birthday party scene where he quietly begs some sign affection anyone gathered finds himself all alone was touching surprising way ive seen lot movies i think i even pride myself not falling prey usual appeals emotion same techniques that directors actors use over over again but this caught me off guard theres level depth verisimilitude nuance thats hard come by role that music plays all this is also amazing not surprising because director vishal bharadwaj comes accomplished musical background it rarely calls attention itself always seems complement visuals action perfect sync thing beauty really anyway reading what ive written so far you might think that this movie is only people who take movies too seriously maybe people whore very concerned with technical aspects it etc but thats really not case it is adaptation shakespeares othello it never strays too far its source its shakespeare that yardstick universally applicable human experience i found myself relating every character movie even minor ones it engages you level that few movies ever do does it without asking too much because there are no long monologues dialogue is succinct apt visuals are always pretty many frames like paintings taken by themselves other words despite belonging that post tarantino mtv generation expecting constant stimulation engagement be provided you instead actively investing it i had no trouble with this movie film doesnt have arrogance ask you sacrifice your viewing pleasure because its shakespeare invest extra amounts energy attention without using word bad way at all theres plenty entertainment here thats shakespeare too,0.46878654970760236,0.10913742690058478,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8,The power of Omkara,"One of the questions that the director and the scriptwriter have to deal with when making a film adaptation of a classic is that of balance. One would like to remain true to the original story, yet each medium has its own modes of expression and a literal translation of a story would usually result in a long, incoherent, and ultimately powerless film. ""The trick is,"" as director Trevor Nunn says in an interview about The Merchant of Venice, ""to make a completely new piece of work while preserving the original piece of work."" And Omkara, Vishal Bharadwaj's adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello is that rare beast. It is stunningly true in details and spirit to the original play (despite the substantial changes necessitated by transferring medieval Europe to modern day Bihar) and also be one of the finest Hindi movies made in recent times. The reason for Shakespeare's huge popularity and general regard as one of the greatest playwrights ever is the timelessness of his themes- love, relationships, race, class, gender, jealousy, hatred, betrayal and death. He created unforgettable characters who remained people we can relate to. The basic premise of all his plays is usually simple. Shakespeare was a master who wrote for everyone, a fact that is sometimes forgotten by those intimidated by his high-brow reputation. And Omkara stays true to that spirit by making no attempt to intellectualize itself. The characters are crude and their language is coarse, in a way that compliments the feel of the film perfectly. Some of the elements of the film are deliberately over-the-top or violent and the scene in which Omkara smothers Dolly is extremely long and vivid; it is to Bharadwaj's credit that he turns this lack of subtlety into an asset. Indeed Omkara couldn't have been made any other way.The acting throughout the film is splendid. Saif Ali Khan, in particular, is extraordinary as the wily, manipulative Langda Tyagi. Khan is one of the most versatile actors in Bollywood and it hard to believe this is the same guy who so brilliantly played 'Sameer' in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. And oh, the ambiance!

10,Omkara: A Classic Of International Standards,"Traditionally in Bollywood you narrate fantasy and try to make it an art form, thankfully it doesn't work. Real life is harsh, as a nation we are in the first phase of seeing reality taking art form on screen. It used to happen before but sadly those movies used to get buried under the tag of ""art movie"". I think as a culture we tend to have a strong disdain for reality and we love flirting with surrealism of lowest standards.Omkara would be a cult classic, like Maqbool, its for people who like to see smart cinema, yes cinema as in international cinema and not films. I don't think Othello is a subject that will go down well with ""junta"" they like singing, dancing, crying. Omkara has singing, dancing and crying, but it is similar to things in our lives. We don't like it, we like entertainment through escapism, surrealism and at times sadomaschoism. Thats Us, Indias, we are like this. It's not good, it's not bad. After weeks Omkara may not become a successful product, Omkara would be a successful Cinema.The movie is a stand out from a technical point of view, you can count the flaws on two fingers which is exceptional for Bollywood.The creative team has achieved a new high, so congratulations to them.The movie fits well in the location, it has an authentic feel and associates nicely with he play.The rustic and rough feel of the movie nicely captures the ambiance, never for a moment things get too comfortable and I guess if you're surrounded by political mafias there can never be a real sense of ease about any thing.I think acting from Ajay Devgan was a bit disappointing. I am not criticizing him maybe I was expecting too much, but sadly for me, he couldn't deliver anything new. You could always see shades of his character from Yuva and Apaharan. I kept wondering isn't Omi the same guy? I mean same stare, same approach, even the same way looks into the eyes of his lover. Strange. But overall I think in context of the story he has done a wonderful job. He's been solid and that does it for the movie so you cant be critical of him. Kareena Kapoor has been made to look really good, thanks to director. It's good to see she is improving. Konkona Sen, she is a beautiful actor a genuine talent. Sadly she was a bit wasted in a limited screen time but had emphatic presence. Vivek Oberoi, sadly he lost out. He did his usual boy-next-door-charm but you never felt for his character. He looked more idiotic than brave and loyal, not for a moment you could sympathize with him while he was being victimised. Vishal hid him very well in the script. Naseer Sab was good. He is too big now for such roles and he managed to give credibility to this character.The soul of the movie is Saif Ali Khan. I think since DilChahta Hai he's shown that he is one Indian actor who is ready to imply world standards to his approach and methods. His work ethics have been fantastic. I respect him for that. Personally I think Langda Tyagi is the most inspired performance since Paresh Rawal's Sardar. In between I can't think of any actor getting in the soul of a character like this. He did in this movie what Pankaj Kapoor did in Maqbool with Abba Ji, which is to re-invent how a character is portrayed, it can only be achieved by legends. Langda is a bit of Jack Sparrow and Bill the Butcher at the same time, which means quality. The best thing was, for the entire movie Saif killed himself to become Langda. When he called SMS ""assum kar dena"" in Car with Omi that sealed it for him.It wasn't an easy task following Maqbool. Vishal has done an absolutely incredible job in stretching his high standards. He is a certified genius now, a rare breed, a original of the species. His story telling, dialogues, the whole presentation was flawless. I am sure those who are not familiar with Othello will have a different view. But I don't see how could have Othello be re-worked better as a movie. It's a tragedy so the end was glum and depressing. I am impressed and awed by Vishal Bharadwaj's work. He stuck to his beliefs and made a movie that he wanted to make never bothering about crowd, money or critics. It rarely happens in Bollywood. Kumar Mangat should also be thanked for encouraging him and giving him his space. Right now Vishal Bharadwaj is the best, much better than Pretentious Leela Bhansali. Take a bow for giving a Classic of International Standards.",omkara classic international standards,traditionally bollywood you narrate fantasy try make it art form thankfully it doesnt work real life is harsh as nation we are first phase seeing reality taking art form screen it used happen before but sadly those movies used get buried under tag art movie i think as culture we tend have strong disdain reality we love flirting with surrealism lowest standards omkara would be cult classic like maqbool its people who like see smart cinema yes cinema as international cinema not films i dont think othello is subject that will go down well with junta they like singing dancing crying omkara has singing dancing crying but it is similar things our lives we dont like it we like entertainment through escapism surrealism at times sadomaschoism thats us indias we are like this its not good its not bad after weeks omkara may not become successful product omkara would be successful cinema movie is stand out technical point view you can count flaws two fingers which is exceptional bollywood creative team has achieved new high so congratulations them movie fits well location it has authentic feel associates nicely with he play rustic rough feel movie nicely captures ambiance never moment things get too comfortable i guess if youre surrounded by political mafias there can never be real sense ease about any thing i think acting ajay devgan was bit disappointing i am not criticizing him maybe i was expecting too much but sadly me he couldnt deliver anything new you could always see shades his character yuva apaharan i kept wondering isnt omi same guy i mean same stare same approach even same way looks into eyes his lover strange but overall i think context story he has done wonderful job hes been solid that does it movie so you cant be critical him kareena kapoor has been made look really good thanks director its good see she is improving konkona sen she is beautiful actor genuine talent sadly she was bit wasted limited screen time but had emphatic presence vivek oberoi sadly he lost out he did his usual boy next door charm but you never felt his character he looked more idiotic than brave loyal not moment you could sympathize with him while he was being victimised vishal hid him very well script naseer sab was good he is too big now such roles he managed give credibility this character soul movie is saif ali khan i think since dilchahta hai hes shown that he is one indian actor who is ready imply world standards his approach methods his work ethics have been fantastic i respect him that personally i think langda tyagi is most inspired performance since paresh rawals sardar between i cant think any actor getting soul character like this he did this movie what pankaj kapoor did maqbool with abba ji which is re invent how character is portrayed it can only be achieved by legends langda is bit jack sparrow bill butcher at same time which means quality best thing was entire movie saif killed himself become langda when he called sms assum kar dena car with omi that sealed it him it wasnt easy task following maqbool vishal has done absolutely incredible job stretching his high standards he is certified genius now rare breed original species his story telling dialogues whole presentation was flawless i am sure those who are not familiar with othello will have different view but i dont see how could have othello be re worked better as movie its tragedy so end was glum depressing i am impressed awed by vishal bharadwajs work he stuck his beliefs made movie that he wanted make never bothering about crowd money or critics it rarely happens bollywood kumar mangat should also be thanked encouraging him giving him his space right now vishal bharadwaj is best much better than pretentious leela bhansali take bow giving classic international standards,0.5251800404635455,0.17705233483584004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9,Langda Tyagi Bahu Bhalli!!!,"Omkara starts out with a few colorful lines uttered by Langda Tyagi that catch your attention from the start. From there on, the viewer is glued to a story with hard hitting drama and even some out of life situations. Vishal Bharadwaj makes a desi Othello and he does full justice to the Shakespeare play. Honestly, nobody could have done a better job.In modern day UP, India where there is outlaw rule. Omkara, a half Brahmin is out to marry a full Brahmin Dolly against her father's wishes. Alongside this, Omi is also to pick the new ""Bhau Bhalli"" since he is being promoted. When Omi picks Kesu, a youngster over his right hand man Langda - starts a story that consists of jealousy, intensity, drama, and passion.There are too many brilliant sequences in Omkara. The first scene featuring Langda and Rajju is sheer brilliance. Not to forget the scene when Omi takes Dolly and the scenes between Omi and Dolly's father. The planning by Langda is first rate. The climax is of course shocking.The screenplay in the second half does get a bit slow but the climax makes up for it.Vishal Bharadwaj's music is underrated. Beedi being the best. However, other numbers are also excellent.One of the best things about Omkara is the writing. Not just story and screenplay but also the dialogue. So real and yet hard hitting. Some of the best lines ever written.Bharadwaj is a brilliant director and there is no question. However, with Omkara he proves he's unstoppable given an excellent story. His best work yet. One also has to give it up to him for casting every actor properly.Ajay Devgan is perfect for the role and he shows dominance through the film. A terrific role for one of the finest actors India has ever produced. Brilliant. Vivek Oberoi is Effective but takes a backseat in the second half. Kareena Kapoor is subtle yet says so much with her character. Excellent. Konkona is another fabulous actress and here too she gives a first rate act. Naseer is as always. Bipasha is okay. Komal Tiwari is efficient as Dolly's father.Another actor worth mentioning is Deepak Dobriyal as Rajju. Such a talent he is.All said and done, taking Langda Tiyagi out of Omkara would make this film not even half as good. Saif Ali Khan gives his career best performance as the crippled evil mastermind. The dialect, expressions, lines, look - it's one of the best characters written in the Hindi film industry. There really isn't an adjective one can use to describe his performance. All I will say is that this act takes the movie notches higher than it already was.Overall, a drama worth every penny. Watch it for the dialogue, the screenplay, the music, the actors - whatever you want. I do know that once you see it, you will watch it again just for Langda Tiyagi.",langda tyagi bahu bhalli,omkara starts out with few colorful lines uttered by langda tyagi that catch your attention start there viewer is glued story with hard hitting drama even some out life situations vishal bharadwaj makes desi othello he does full justice shakespeare play honestly nobody could have done better job modern day up india where there is outlaw rule omkara half brahmin is out marry full brahmin dolly against her fathers wishes alongside this omi is also pick new bhau bhalli since he is being promoted when omi picks kesu youngster over his right hand man langda starts story that consists jealousy intensity drama passion there are too many brilliant sequences omkara first scene featuring langda rajju is sheer brilliance not forget scene when omi takes dolly scenes between omi dollys father planning by langda is first rate climax is course shocking screenplay second half does get bit slow but climax makes up it vishal bharadwajs music is underrated beedi being best however other numbers are also excellent one best things about omkara is writing not just story screenplay but also dialogue so real yet hard hitting some best lines ever written bharadwaj is brilliant director there is no question however with omkara he proves hes unstoppable given excellent story his best work yet one also has give it up him casting every actor properly ajay devgan is perfect role he shows dominance through film terrific role one finest actors india has ever produced brilliant vivek oberoi is effective but takes backseat second half kareena kapoor is subtle yet says so much with her character excellent konkona is another fabulous actress here too she gives first rate act naseer is as always bipasha is okay komal tiwari is efficient as dollys father another actor worth mentioning is deepak dobriyal as rajju such talent he is all said done taking langda tiyagi out omkara would make this film not even half as good saif ali khan gives his career best performance as crippled evil mastermind dialect expressions lines look its one best characters written hindi film industry there really isnt adjective one can use describe his performance all i will say is that this act takes movie notches higher than it already was overall drama worth every penny watch it dialogue screenplay music actors whatever you want i do know that once you see it you will watch it again just langda tiyagi,0.47755017709563174,0.29843171979535615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9,OMKARA.....A Brilliant movie,"When someone makes an adaptation of one of the greatest Shakespearan tragedies, you have to stand up and take notice. And especially Vishal Bhardwaj, someone who had made Maqbool the toast of the festival circuit and on par with some of Kurosawa's best work. Akira Kurosawa, one of the best directors the world has ever seen, has made quite a few Shakespearean stories brilliantly( See Throne of blood, Ran).Vishal Bhardwaj has again changed the setting to the underworld, this time in rural India...more precisely UP. Naseeruddin Shah plays a crooked MP 'Bhaisaab' who employs a local goon 'Omkara' (Ajay Devgan essaying the lead role) to do his evil deeds. Happy with Omkara's work he gives him a ticket to contest in the Assembly. So now a successor to Omkara has to be chosen. There are two main choices, the foreign returned, guitar wielding suave Keshu firangi ( Vivek Oberoi) and the yellow toothed, son of the soil Langda Tyagi ( Saif Ali Khan). Ajay Devgan decides to choose Keshu firangi. Now this is where the real story begins. Langda tyagi obviously gets incensed and decides to get Keshu removed. He craftily builds up an imaginary affair between Dolly, Omkara's soon to be wife ( Kareena Kapoor) and Keshu in Omkara's mind. By the time Omkara realizes this it is too late. Tyagi's wife Indu( Konkona Sen Sharma) unknowingly plays a pawn in her Husband's Plans.The question is, how is Omkara??? Well it's just Brilliant. After seeing Maqbool, i knew that i had seen one of the best Hindi movies ever made. This goes one better. There are some directors like Vishal Bhardwaj which are keeping the bollywood's ( OK, the Indian film industry's) flag flying high. He performs a Multitude of roles - Director, Scriptwriter, Dialogue writer, composer...phew, and he does them all to perfection. Of course it helps when you have people like gulzar assisting you. The stand out part- the direction. The film is very tautly made, its very engrossing. You wont realize that its already two and a half hrs when the movie ends. The script and the dialogues are also top notch. Of course if you have the bard's one of the greatest tragedies as your basis, you cant go wrong. The dialogues are very rustic. Normally this movie's audience would have been restricted to the multiplex going crowd. But by using Hindi as is spoken in UP, with all the profanities that creep up in normal day use, it will ensure that the theaters in the Hindi speaking northern belt will run to packed houses.The songs are quite good too. The title track is extremely good and so is 'Bidi Jaliye le'. It will become the rage among the masses.Performance wise, Ajay Devgan excels again as Omkara delivering a brooding performance he is so adept at delivering. Kareena Kapoor disappoints as usual. Vivek Oberoi is efficient. Konkona Sen sharma is brilliant. She delivers the performance one has come to expect from her. Bipasha as the dancer Billo, had a role of an eye candy and she looks really hot. But the real show stealer is Saif ali Khan, who enacts with panache the Role of Iago( one of the greatest villains in English literature). He is mean, cruel, ingenuous and his performance is truly brilliant. He carries off a negative character quite well in Ek Hasina Thi, but here he excels himself.All in all a must see movie, and especially for people who like dark, intense, dramatic movies.",omkara brilliant movie,when someone makes adaptation one greatest shakespearan tragedies you have stand up take notice especially vishal bhardwaj someone who had made maqbool toast festival circuit par with some kurosawas best work akira kurosawa one best directors world has ever seen has made quite few shakespearean stories brilliantly see throne blood ran vishal bhardwaj has again changed setting underworld this time rural india more precisely up naseeruddin shah plays crooked mp bhaisaab who employs local goon omkara ajay devgan essaying lead role do his evil deeds happy with omkaras work he gives him ticket contest assembly so now successor omkara has be chosen there are two main choices foreign returned guitar wielding suave keshu firangi vivek oberoi yellow toothed son soil langda tyagi saif ali khan ajay devgan decides choose keshu firangi now this is where real story begins langda tyagi obviously gets incensed decides get keshu removed he craftily builds up imaginary affair between dolly omkaras soon be wife kareena kapoor keshu omkaras mind by time omkara realizes this it is too late tyagis wife indu konkona sen sharma unknowingly plays pawn her husbands plans question is how is omkara well its just brilliant after seeing maqbool i knew that i had seen one best hindi movies ever made this goes one better there are some directors like vishal bhardwaj which are keeping bollywoods ok indian film industrys flag flying high he performs multitude roles director scriptwriter dialogue writer composer phew he does them all perfection course it helps when you have people like gulzar assisting you stand out part direction film is very tautly made its very engrossing you wont realize that its already two half hrs when movie ends script dialogues are also top notch course if you have bards one greatest tragedies as your basis you cant go wrong dialogues are very rustic normally this movies audience would have been restricted multiplex going crowd but by using hindi as is spoken up with all profanities that creep up normal day use it will ensure that theaters hindi speaking northern belt will run packed houses songs are quite good too title track is extremely good so is bidi jaliye le it will become rage among masses performance wise ajay devgan excels again as omkara delivering brooding performance he is so adept at delivering kareena kapoor disappoints as usual vivek oberoi is efficient konkona sen sharma is brilliant she delivers performance one has come expect her bipasha as dancer billo had role eye candy she looks really hot but real show stealer is saif ali khan who enacts with panache role iago one greatest villains english literature he is mean cruel ingenuous his performance is truly brilliant he carries off negative character quite well ek hasina thi but here he excels himself all all must see movie especially people who like dark intense dramatic movies,0.5955188679245282,0.27772012578616345,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"

8,Vishal Bhardwaj at his Best,"Omkara - 2006It needs a different level of guts to adapt and make a movie out of ""Othello"" by Shakespeare. And yes! Vishal Bhardwaj did it very responsibly, making Omkara one of its best adaptations. So, what makes it that great?Shakespeare was popular because he wrote about humans and their common natures such as love, humanity, jealousy, revenge, and that's what we see in Omkara, beautifully written and directed by Vishal Bhardwaj. All the performances are up to the mark whether its the main man Omkara(Ajay Devgun) doing a great job as always, Dolly(Kareena Kapoor) doing not so ordinary but great, Vivek Oberoi, Konkana Sen, Naseeruddin Shah, and the new guy Deepak Dobriyal, fits best in their character and did a decent job. But the show-stealer is Langda Tyagi( Saif Ali Khan), in his never seen before avatar and brilliantly playing the role of the antagonist with that tone and body language, it was really wow! That all was supported by the theme created by the team in a small village type place with the dialogues one after another with that hardcore tone in the language followed by the music by Vishal Bhardwaj as well. The colors of the movie are warm at most of the places and some backlit shots did the wonders on the screen, that was a piece of good editing, and here is the great work by DOP with some long shots and the unforgettable last shots of the film where Omkara shoots himself and then we see both Omkara and Dolly dead, that was the just an example of brilliant cinematography.Kudos to the whole team of Omkara for creating such a masterpiece with almost perfect work in all the departments.

8,Vishal Bharadwaj and Saif Ali Khan excel,"I didn't have much expectations of Omkara; had never heard of Vishal Bharadwaj; expected another violent Bollywood pot-boiler. Turned out, it's one of the most accomplished Bollywood films of all times. Vishal Bharadwaj is an artiste of highest caliber, and succeeded beyond expectations in all the areas - direction, screenplay and music - he has put his stamp on. The screenplay, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello in the rustic setting of Uttar Pradesh's crime-ridden politics, is spell-binding, and could match the best of Kurosawa. The dialogues in Bhojpuri dialect are no doubt foul and vulgar in the extreme to match the setting, but to those who can understand the dialect, the humour is fascinating, and the dialogues possibly the best ever in the history of Hindi films. Unfortunately, the subtitles can't do justice to all the nuances of the dialogues. The most awe-inspiring aspect of the movie is the fantastic performances from all the cast, but above all by Saif Ali Khan as Langda Tyagi (Iago). From what I had seen of Saif Ali Khan in Dil Chahta Hai, Salaam Namaste, Ham Tum, Parineeta and others before this movie, I would never ever have imagined him in this role, let alone expect an epoch-making performance. He was more famous for his lineage - the incredibly gifted Sharmila Tagore who withered away her talent in Bollywood, her more famous Nobel-laureate grandfather Rabindra Nath Tagore, and Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi the notable Indian cricket captain of yester years - than for his acting prowess. Well, am I surprised? To put it in perspective, I could recall 2 past performances in Hindi cinema, which were bolts out of the blue - Amjad Khan in Sholey and Kanhaiya Lal in Gunga Jamuna. The one from Saif Ali Khan in Omkara is a volcanic eruption. Mind you, Ajay Devgan has given the best performance of his career in the title role, so it's not as if there was no competition. The credit must go to the director as well - it was an inspired casting. I can't wait to see other movies of Vishal Bharadwaj, and of Saif Ali Khan, even though I know I'll probably be disappointed.",vishal bharadwaj saif ali khan excel,i didnt have much expectations omkara had never heard vishal bharadwaj expected another violent bollywood pot boiler turned out its one most accomplished bollywood films all times vishal bharadwaj is artiste highest caliber succeeded beyond expectations all areas direction screenplay music he has put his stamp screenplay adaptation shakespeares othello rustic setting uttar pradeshs crime ridden politics is spell binding could match best kurosawa dialogues bhojpuri dialect are no doubt foul vulgar extreme match setting but those who can understand dialect humour is fascinating dialogues possibly best ever history hindi films unfortunately subtitles cant do justice all nuances dialogues most awe inspiring aspect movie is fantastic performances all cast but above all by saif ali khan as langda tyagi iago what i had seen saif ali khan dil chahta hai salaam namaste ham tum parineeta others before this movie i would never ever have imagined him this role let alone expect epoch making performance he was more famous his lineage incredibly gifted sharmila tagore who withered away her talent bollywood her more famous nobel laureate grandfather rabindra nath tagore mansur ali khan pataudi notable indian cricket captain yester years than his acting prowess well am i surprised put it perspective i could recall 2 past performances hindi cinema which were bolts out blue amjad khan sholey kanhaiya lal gunga jamuna one saif ali khan omkara is volcanic eruption mind you ajay devgan has given best performance his career title role so its not as if there was no competition credit must go director as well it was inspired casting i cant wait see other movies vishal bharadwaj saif ali khan even though i know ill probably be disappointed,0.6043103448275863,0.1810344827586207,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9,The resurgence of quality cinema...and how! Watch it for Saif!,"It seems that Bollywood is coming of age. To tackle something like Shakespeare...is no mean feat and in Hindi...wow! Being a bit of a literati, I went into the movie hall, well armed with 'Othello' knowledge, ready to slam the film, however I was the one totally slammed. Vishal Bharadwaj has done the unthinkable, like a druid has he imbibed the soul of the quixotic 'Othello:The Moor of Venice' into the heartland of rustic India. The process is almost like a heart transplant...a highly successful one nevertheless as 'Omkara' seems to throb with a restless energy that overwhelms the viewer. The nuances are subtle and therefore impactful. The dialogues are first-rate and the songs brim with bucolic poetry. 'O Saathi re' is one track that feels as refreshing as the country air. Performance-wise, Ajay Devgan as Omkara has outdone himself, Kareena Kapoor gives a kindred performance, her innocence is truly touching. Konkana Sen-Sharma is wan, like Emilia of the original and hence one enjoys watching her. Viveik Oberoi succeeds clearly because he's more sub-dued and not cantankerous (ref.Pyare Mohan). But it is Saif Ali Khan who packs a punch as Iago. Personally, my favorite Shakespearan antagonist is Iago and I'd have been devastated if hi character had been miscast.

8,"If you live on a diet of Karan Johar movies, stay away.","Macbeth became Maqbool And Othello became Omkara Both these movies are oh! so cool This marks the beginning of Vishal's eraFortunately, the movie has no similarities with my rhyme!Omkara is a tragic love story set at the backdrop of political turmoil in the rustic locales of UP (actually shot in Beed, Maharashtra). Omkara Shukla (Ajay ""I still cant shake off my brooding image"" Devgun) is the main henchman of a political bigwig (Naseeruddin ""somebody gimme a meatier role"" Shah). Omkara's trusted sidekicks are Langda Tyagi (Saif ""I can do any role"" Ali Khan) & Kesu (Vivek ""Kisna screwed my career"" Oberoi). Dolly (Kareena ""Im pretty impressive"" Kapoor) is Omi bhaiyya's love interest but was supposed to marry one Mr. ""always in suit, even in the scorching sun"" but is kidnapped in the first frame itself by Omi. They stay together, waiting for the auspicious day to get married. Everything goes fine from then on - the usual politics and the occasional shootouts. Things take a turn for worse when Kesu is named the baahubali in place of Langda as he is the educated one. Jealousy drives Langda to malign poor Kesu's image in front of Omkara and that forms the plot of the movie.Omkara banks on superb performances and a solid screenplay. The proceedings keep to interested, especially whenever Langda is on the screen. The dialogues are witty when required else pretty harsh with all the imaginable profanities thrown in. Moreover every now and then you struggle to keep up with the dialect but then the effect wouldn't have been the same without it. Music is in sync with the movie and the tracks make for a neat compilation. ""Beedi"" - the desi dance number with rhythm guitars stands out as one of the most innovative songs of the year. Vishal the composer deserves applause here.Talking about performances, Ajay Devgun gets the role he is used to playing and expectedly he does fine. Kareena gets to display a wide range of emotions are she does a neat job (read: a couple of nominations for sure). Naseeruddin Shah's role is small, plus he doesn't get a chance to display his potential. Vivek Oberoi does okay, actually you hardly notice him in the movie. Bipasha (special appearance), leaves her mark with two dance numbers. Kokana Sen does a fantastic job playing Langda's wife but its Saif who yet again proves that he has got a trick or two up his sleeve. He gets into the skin of Langda Tyaagi and rocks the movie completely and walks away with the best lines. The guy never fails to surprise. Overall, Omkara is pretty dark and it will be remembered as a worthy adaptation of the tragic Shakespearean love story. Hats off to Vishal Bharadwaj for making a genuinely good movie.He wove the political uncertainties and love story neatly without any loose ends showing off.If you live on a diet of Karan Johar movies, stay away.

7,Saif Reigns Supreme,"Based on the Shakespearean tragedy 'Othello', 'Omkara' is an imaginative adaptation by director Vishal Bhardwaj, enriched with rustic characters in a politically simmering village setting. Though the film is titled 'Omkara', the character that truly calls the shots and drives the meaty, yet lethargically paced plot is Saif Ali Khan playing Langda. The foul-mouthed Langda, a loyalist turned traitor and a schemer who must manipulate the hand of chance when it favors his inferior, with innocent lives and streams of blood. Saif truly is the backbone of the film and has delivered the most smashing performance of his career. Unflinching in plotting revenge against his offenders, the original character created by the bard has been magnificently recreated by Vishal and its villainy comes to life only because Saif Ali Khan spewed it with unassuming poison of the proverbial snake that takes the form of man. And it's no exaggeration to state that no other actor could have played that part better than Saif. Moving onto other actors, Kareena Kapoor is the other top runner in performances. She acts with staunch realism and credibility, her face and eyes ooze with a flood of unambiguous emotions that simply take your breath away. Her character beams with a brighter shining spark as she performs the part of Dolly than was last seen in 'Dev', 'Yuva' or even 'Chameli'. Konkona Sen Sharma also wins brownie points, transforming from the character of urban educated girl in her previous films like 'Page-3' or most recent 'Yun Hota To Kya Hota' into an unsophisticated, almost boorish yet headstrong woman who mouths unflattering expletives with a natural ease. Ajay Devgan hangs tough in an effort to take his character to the next level, but only succeeds marginally. The character which is perhaps the weakest on writing board as well as in execution is that of Viveik Oberoi playing Kesu Firangi. Other characters that are half-etched are that of Naseeruddin Shah and Bipasha Basu. A good screenplay that unfolds the plot effectively is always supported by compelling dialogues. This is where 'Omkara' glaringly falls short. The dialect is difficult to comprehend even for the audience that has in the past appreciated films like 'Gangajal' or 'Apharan' for their dialogues. The editing of the film also suffers and the length of the film renders some of the scene ineffective making them lose their sheen or the razor edged drama that was infused in the original play. The unimaginative camera work and background score also neglects a stronger need for creating a sense of drama and mystery required for an adaptation of this stature. The song 'Bidi' is the only one with the recall value for its music by Vishal, raunchy lyrics by Gulzar and for newly crowned Goddess of oomph Bipasha Basu. In a nutshell, 'Omkara' is not everyone's cup of tea and will have more efficiency in the film festivals and for those with a seriously cultivated taste. In other words, for 'Omkara' to touch the finishing line at the end of the race at the box-office is highly wishful.",saif reigns supreme,based shakespearean tragedy othello omkara is imaginative adaptation by director vishal bhardwaj enriched with rustic characters politically simmering village setting though film is titled omkara character that truly calls shots drives meaty yet lethargically paced plot is saif ali khan playing langda foul mouthed langda loyalist turned traitor schemer who must manipulate hand chance when it favors his inferior with innocent lives streams blood saif truly is backbone film has delivered most smashing performance his career unflinching plotting revenge against his offenders original character created by bard has been magnificently recreated by vishal its villainy comes life only because saif ali khan spewed it with unassuming poison proverbial snake that takes form man its no exaggeration state that no other actor could have played that part better than saif moving onto other actors kareena kapoor is other top runner performances she acts with staunch realism credibility her face eyes ooze with flood unambiguous emotions that simply take your breath away her character beams with brighter shining spark as she performs part dolly than was last seen dev yuva or even chameli konkona sen sharma also wins brownie points transforming character urban educated girl her previous films like page 3 or most recent yun hota kya hota into unsophisticated almost boorish yet headstrong woman who mouths unflattering expletives with natural ease ajay devgan hangs tough effort take his character next level but only succeeds marginally character which is perhaps weakest writing board as well as execution is that viveik oberoi playing kesu firangi other characters that are half etched are that naseeruddin shah bipasha basu good screenplay that unfolds plot effectively is always supported by compelling dialogues this is where omkara glaringly falls short dialect is difficult comprehend even audience that has past appreciated films like gangajal or apharan their dialogues editing film also suffers length film renders some scene ineffective making them lose their sheen or razor edged drama that was infused original play unimaginative camera work background score also neglects stronger need creating sense drama mystery required adaptation this stature song bidi is only one with recall value its music by vishal raunchy lyrics by gulzar newly crowned goddess oomph bipasha basu nutshell omkara is not everyones cup tea will have more efficiency film festivals those with seriously cultivated taste other words omkara touch finishing line at end race at box office is highly wishful,0.4982544836116265,0.12388828763828766,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9,bollywood needs movies like these,"First of all, I'll start off by saying that Omkara isn't a classic or a masterpiece, but came awfully close to being one. It has a great story, adapted from Shakespeare's brilliant 'Othello', great dialogues, a good screenplay, excellent performances, and great music. It starts off quite well, and the ending is a thing of class. But the middle act seems muddled and a little slow. What I appreciate the most, however, is the effort put forth by director Vishal Bhardwaj and his team. Each and every single shot seems carefully thought out, and orchestrated. Tassaduq Hussain makes his debut as DP here but you wouldn't know it..the great Conrad Hall would've been proud had he watched this movie if he was still alive. The music by Bhardwaj has a great vibe to it, and editing is certainly on par, even though some scenes seem way too long. I read a comment by a user saying that Bhardwaj embellished his dialogues with profanity to attract the college going crowd. I vehemently disagree with that. Bhardwaj simply tried to make the movie seem as authentic and realistic as possible because the story is set in UP -- a state we all know is not especially known for law & order. The performances are brilliant. Ajay Devgan does it again, and although you might have a feeling of 'seen-him-do-that-before', he's understated & solid throughout the movie. Vivek Oberoi doesn't have a whole lot to do, but I thought he shined in the scenes where he's given the opportunity. The scene where he bashes up the guy in the car when he's not exactly in the greatest frame of mind is well executed from a technical standpoint. I went into the movie thinking I needed Kareena Kapoor to impress me, and wow! she did. She displays an entire plethora of emotions & expressions and delivers a standout performance. Never thought she had it in her. Konkona Sen Sharma is her usual brilliant self. She doesn't have a lot of scenes, but manages to leave us in awe of her enormous acting talent. Bipasha Basu & Naseeruddin Shah have what you can call 'extended guest appearances', but are adequate nonetheless. The real standout here, though, is Mr Saif Ali Khan. Never been a great fan of him, although I certainly knew he was quite a capable actor after watching Dil Chahta Hai, Ek Hasina Thi, Hum Tum, & Parineeta. But here, he delivers a powerhouse performance that is the stuff of Bollywood history! His performance is the kind of rare tour-de-force that you don't get to see that often from actors. To be honest, he has the best character to play with in Iago - certainly one of the most fascinating Shakespearean characters. But his raw, spellbinding performance will leave you speechless. Within minutes into the initial reels in the movie, you'll know you're in for a treat. Watch Omkara because it is something different from the usual crap-fest that Bollywood serves up. After Rang De Basanti & Gangster, this is the best Bollywood movie to come out this year. Watch Omkara, because Vishal Bhardwaj is a class apart from peers like Karan Johar & Sanjay Gupta. Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna is still unreleased, but I can assure you that you'll find Omkara to be ten times better than KANK.",bollywood needs movies like these,first all ill start off by saying that omkara isnt classic or masterpiece but came awfully close being one it has great story adapted shakespeares brilliant othello great dialogues good screenplay excellent performances great music it starts off quite well ending is thing class but middle act seems muddled little slow what i appreciate most however is effort put forth by director vishal bhardwaj his team each every single shot seems carefully thought out orchestrated tassaduq hussain makes his debut as dp here but you wouldnt know it great conrad hall wouldve been proud had he watched this movie if he was still alive music by bhardwaj has great vibe it editing is certainly par even though some scenes seem way too long i read comment by user saying that bhardwaj embellished his dialogues with profanity attract college going crowd i vehemently disagree with that bhardwaj simply tried make movie seem as authentic realistic as possible because story is set up state we all know is not especially known law order performances are brilliant ajay devgan does it again although you might have feeling seen him do that before hes understated solid throughout movie vivek oberoi doesnt have whole lot do but i thought he shined scenes where hes given opportunity scene where he bashes up guy car when hes not exactly greatest frame mind is well executed technical standpoint i went into movie thinking i needed kareena kapoor impress me wow she did she displays entire plethora emotions expressions delivers standout performance never thought she had it her konkona sen sharma is her usual brilliant self she doesnt have lot scenes but manages leave us awe her enormous acting talent bipasha basu naseeruddin shah have what you can call extended guest appearances but are adequate nonetheless real standout here though is mr saif ali khan never been great fan him although i certainly knew he was quite capable actor after watching dil chahta hai ek hasina thi hum tum parineeta but here he delivers powerhouse performance that is stuff bollywood history his performance is kind rare tour de force that you dont get see that often actors be honest he has best character play with iago certainly one most fascinating shakespearean characters but his raw spellbinding performance will leave you speechless within minutes into initial reels movie youll know youre treat watch omkara because it is something different usual crap fest that bollywood serves up after rang de basanti gangster this is best bollywood movie come out this year watch omkara because vishal bhardwaj is class apart peers like karan johar sanjay gupta kabhi alvida na kehna is still unreleased but i can assure you that youll find omkara be ten times better than kank,0.5834296450675761,0.24689355185044837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"

I felt that his portrayal of Othello was one dimensional and I didn't see the multi dimensional portrayal of Othello which is a crucial aspect of the character Othello. In Shakespeare's works, the characters tend to quite multi dimensional, and have layers of emotion which I didn't see in Ajay Devgan's performance.

9,Great film....and an evil DVD production company.,"Before I get to reviewing the actual movie, I have a few words about the production company that has released this movie here and in the UK...I hate them and will avoid movies that they release! The people selling this DVD have managed to cram more commercials into the film when the DVD begins than I have ever seen before AND you cannot skip through them to get to the movie (it disables this feature on your DVD machine). This is obnoxious....but it gets worse. AFTER you start the actual film for the main menu, it stops to show you a commercial for Western Union!!! Unless the movie is free, I see no reason for these people to do this and I pray that other sleazy DVD producers don't begin this slimy process. Imagine--being forced to wait through about 10 minutes of ads before you can even watch the movie itself! ""Omkara"" is a Bollywood film whose plot is derived from Shakespeare's ""Othello"". Naturally, it is significantly different in many ways---such as being set in modern day India. Omkara (Othello) is also quite different--instead of a prince of the Moors, he's a second in command for the mob! I had high hopes for this, as two Indian films I've seen based on Jane Austin films were wonderful re-vamps of the old tales. I also have loved Akira Kurosawa's Japanese versions of Shakespeare (such as ""The Bad Sleep Well"" and ""Throne of Blood"").In this Indian film, Omkara (Othello) takes Dolly (Desdemona) from her fiancÃ© when the film begins. There are lots of hurt feelings, but when Omkara chooses Kesu (Cassio) as his successor instead of Landga (Iago), things REALLY go downhill. Langda is NOT happy and begins cleverly manipulating those around him. And, he makes it appear as if Kesu and Dolly are having an affair and that Kesu is disloyal. As you can see, it's pretty much the same plot and the original story--just dressed up in a modern Indian guise. However, there are lots of subplots and elements that make this unique--not just a thinly veiled copy.Considering the source material, it's not surprising that this isn't some syrupy Bollywood film. It's very gritty and violent--especially the murder scenes near the end of the film . Yet, like so many films from India, it still takes time out for a small number of songs--a peculiarity of Bollywood films that I usually enjoy quite a bit. And although adult and violent, compared to some American films it's relatively tame--though very tough for an Indian film and still NOT a film for younger audiences. Overall, a very good film--one lovers of Shakespeare and haters of Shakespeare can both enjoy. The acting is nice and it's a first-class production all around...see this one.By the way, although I am not a ballistics expert, in the final scene, shouldn't the bullet have come out the other side--especially with such a large caliber gun? Just wonderin'.",great film evil dvd production company,before i get reviewing actual movie i have few words about production company that has released this movie here uk i hate them will avoid movies that they release people selling this dvd have managed cram more commercials into film when dvd begins than i have ever seen before you cannot skip through them get movie it disables this feature your dvd machine this is obnoxious but it gets worse after you start actual film main menu it stops show you commercial western union unless movie is free i see no reason these people do this i pray that other sleazy dvd producers dont begin this slimy process imagine being forced wait through about 10 minutes ads before you can even watch movie itself omkara is bollywood film whose plot is derived shakespeares othello naturally it is significantly different many ways such as being set modern day india omkara othello is also quite different instead prince moors hes second command mob i had high hopes this as two indian films ive seen based jane austin films were wonderful re vamps old tales i also have loved akira kurosawas japanese versions shakespeare such as bad sleep well throne blood this indian film omkara othello takes dolly desdemona her fianc when film begins there are lots hurt feelings but when omkara chooses kesu cassio as his successor instead landga iago things really go downhill langda is not happy begins cleverly manipulating those around him he makes it appear as if kesu dolly are having affair that kesu is disloyal as you can see its pretty much same plot original story just dressed up modern indian guise however there are lots subplots elements that make this unique not just thinly veiled copy considering source material its not surprising that this isnt some syrupy bollywood film its very gritty violent especially murder scenes near end film yet like so many films india it still takes time out small number songs peculiarity bollywood films that i usually enjoy quite bit although adult violent compared some american films its relatively tame though very tough indian film still not film younger audiences overall very good film one lovers shakespeare haters shakespeare can both enjoy acting is nice its first class production all around see this one by way although i am not ballistics expert final scene shouldnt bullet have come out other side especially with such large caliber gun just wonderin,0.5201951600312256,0.03599011189175123,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9,Another excellent Shakespeare adaptation by Bhardwaj,"Another excellent Shakespeare adaptation by Bhardwaj, this time moving the story of ""Othello"" to the modern Indian underworld, and making Othello (here called Omkara) not black, but a half-caste. The acting is all of a very high order -- understated but intense, and even a familiarity with the events of the play didn't keep this from feeling suspenseful, intense and occasionally quite emotional. If you have the clichÃ© vision of a Bollywood film in mind, you're in for a pleasant surprise. The acting is naturalistic, not histrionic (with only one or two exceptions in supporting roles). There is a song or two, but they flow naturally out of the action, in situations where singing is appropriate (e.g. a performance by one of the characters at a party, where others join in). Note: this is an adaptation of the story, the language is not Shakespeare's. The dialogue is contemporary, and story elements are changed, so this isn't for purists. On the other hand, no familiarity with the original is needed to fully enjoy this complex tale of passion, politics and betrayal. It is alive, and filled with social commentary, romance, and ever evolving alliances. The film also looks great. Ironically the regular Eros DVD of this film looks better than the Eagle blu-ray of it's twin Maqbool (Bhardwaj's take on Macbeth).",another excellent shakespeare adaptation by bhardwaj,another excellent shakespeare adaptation by bhardwaj this time moving story othello modern indian underworld making othello here called omkara not black but half caste acting is all very high order understated but intense even familiarity with events play didnt keep this feeling suspenseful intense occasionally quite emotional if you have clich vision bollywood film mind youre pleasant surprise acting is naturalistic not histrionic with only one or two exceptions supporting roles there is song or two but they flow naturally out action situations where singing is appropriate e g performance by one characters at party where others join note this is adaptation story language is not shakespeares dialogue is contemporary story elements are changed so this isnt purists other hand no familiarity with original is needed fully enjoy this complex tale passion politics betrayal it is alive filled with social commentary romance ever evolving alliances film also looks great ironically regular eros dvd this film looks better than eagle blu ray its twin maqbool bhardwajs take macbeth,0.5186749379652605,0.23090322580645162,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.45}"

The ensemble cast is brilliant in outperforming each other at every given opportunity it's impossible to praise just one of them. Music by Bharadwaj himself is atmospheric along with the cinematography. The lyrics to the songs were also amazing as in they all foreshadow the coming events of this version of Othello. The only small problem I felt was in the editing and the fact that I am not a big fan of Othello itself. Even though I understand Hindi, due to heavy dialects used I was missing some words and used an English subtitle and it does no justice to the wonderful dialogue in the film.

9,excellent...intense...long for a western viewer...and worth it,"Saif Ali Khan's characterization of Langda, the Iago-like role, is outstanding. From tiny bits of business like having one long, sharp fingernail that he keeps immaculately shaped and polished, to his ugly-face makeup, to his always-excellent timing and mix of vulnerability and toughness, I can't think of a better actor from India for this role. In fact, there may be few actors worldwide who could do this role better than SAK did. There are three SAK scenes I think are destined to become film classics: His bridge-sitting and drinking scene, with Deepak Dobriyal as Raju, the hapless former fiancÃ© of Dolly (Kareena Kapoor in the Desdemona role).The scenes of his shock, and subsequent handling of himself, at being ignored and underestimated by Omi Shukla, aka Omkara (Ajay Devgan in the Othello role). His hilarious, poignant and deeply revealing after-romance scene, with Indu (Konkana Sen Sharma in the Emilia role).Ajay Devgan is quietly powerful as always, and once again I think I know why Kajol married him. Kareena Kapoor is outstanding as a spoiled but innocent and sincerely in-love young woman, who gives up everything for her lover, and is ready to live according to her best dreams, but is also unequipped and too naive to handle the real world and all the deceptions that swirl around her. Naseeruddin Shah as Bhaisaab, the Brabanzio role, is essence of casual intensity -- he vibrates with meaning with every move he makes, and every breath he takes (yeah, I know that's kind of from a song). Vivek Oberoi, as Kesu (the Cassio role), may be labeled merely adequate here, but I think that's the nature of the role itself (as written in Othello), and echoes of his past choices in film and life. He is really quite excellent in this film. Konkana Sen Sharma's smallish role is something she makes the most of. Every minute of her on-screen presence is memorable. Deepak Dobriyal is funny and moving as a hapless jerk and target of Lambda's casual cruelties. And for the guys, Bipasha Basu is stunning as Billo (the Bianca role), a dancing girl who can really dance, and who really loves her Kesu.The only reason for a vote below 10 is the length of the film. While 146 minutes may not be long for a BW film in India, it's long for everywhere else. It's clear that tighter editing would have helped the pace in lots of spots. For example: In the last scene, right before the credits, count the number of times the action repeats, and think about how much better those 90 seconds would have been if the count had been reduced by two.And please do yourself a favor, if you're not from India: See the film in a theater that draws a big Indian crowd. The reason for long Indian films will become organically obvious, and you'll enjoy the humor and understand the ethos of the film better, too. I saw the film twice, and it held up superbly through the second watching. It was better, in fact.Excellent direction from Vishal Bharadwaj.Oh, and I almost forgot, and it would have been a sin to forget this: Superb music! Lyrics by the unsurpassed Gulzar (thank you, dear friends from India, for teaching me about Gulzar), and music by the director himself, Vishal Bharadwaj. Bharadwaj sings on one song; other singers include the legendary Sukhwinder Singh of Chaiyya Chaiyya and other fame, Shreya Goshal (she of the honeyed voice), Sunidhi Chauhan, Rakesh Pandit, Rekha Bardwaj, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, and Suresh Wadekar. My favorite songs are Omkara, O Saathi Re, and Beedi. Excellent choreography, better integrated with the film than is often the case with BW movies. The choreographer is Ganesh Acharya, who's done work in films such as Shakti and Khakee.Excellent sets, locations and costuming.

8,Powerful tribute to a tragic story.,"Powerful tribute to a tragic story. This is an adaptation of ""Othello"" and indeed it is Indianised and is made interesting too. Before, I even begin reviewing this, let me talk about the performance of Saif Ali Khan as Langda Tyagi. He is given the best performance of his life here. It is a flawless performance, from the cunning giggle to the broken trudge. He has the tenacity and the anguish in his eyes and his demeanor. From costumes to accent to the body language, he fits the role perfectly and also adds a new dimension to it. The greed for power exhibited by him is a rarity to see in a film that is powered by many genuine actors, be it Konkona Sen, Ajay Devgan or Naseeruddin Shah. They are considered to be superior with the body of work they have done prior to this film. Yet, it is for Saif Ali Khan alone you can watch the film. The film starts with him and ends with him. The opening dialog ""Chootiye aur Bewakoof mein, dhaage ka farak hota hai"" means so much as the film goes on. Wonderful Saif for what you have done. The next most important person is the director Vishal Bharadwaj. I placed Saif above him, because I suppose Saif has added a new dimension to this. Vishal enabled Saif to do so, and Saif took it way further. So thanks to Saif and to Vishal too. This is a rare instance where I place an actor before the director. I loved the film, but I did not like the ending which was not like the original ""Othello"" what if evil wins over good and Langda Tyagi becomes ruler. Ah, I wish that was the kind of ending it had. This has strong dialog from Bharadwaj and his writers, who have wonderfully incorporated the dialect that is mostly not used in the mainstream Hindi Films. It works and brings a kind of authenticity too. The music is one that has to be praised. With wonderful tunes from Vishal Bharadwaj and superb lyrics from Gulzar, this is an album where all songs are good. My favorites are ""O Saathi Re"" and ""Naina"" and ""Laakad"". I am giving a 4/5 simply for the performance of Saif and for the music direction and film direction itself. Thanks Vishal for a wonderful adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Othello"".",powerful tribute tragic story,powerful tribute tragic story this is adaptation othello indeed it is indianised is made interesting too before i even begin reviewing this let me talk about performance saif ali khan as langda tyagi he is given best performance his life here it is flawless performance cunning giggle broken trudge he has tenacity anguish his eyes his demeanor costumes accent body language he fits role perfectly also adds new dimension it greed power exhibited by him is rarity see film that is powered by many genuine actors be it konkona sen ajay devgan or naseeruddin shah they are considered be superior with body work they have done prior this film yet it is saif ali khan alone you can watch film film starts with him ends with him opening dialog chootiye aur bewakoof mein dhaage ka farak hota hai means so much as film goes wonderful saif what you have done next most important person is director vishal bharadwaj i placed saif above him because i suppose saif has added new dimension this vishal enabled saif do so saif took it way further so thanks saif vishal too this is rare instance where i place actor before director i loved film but i did not like ending which was not like original othello what if evil wins over good langda tyagi becomes ruler ah i wish that was kind ending it had this has strong dialog bharadwaj his writers who have wonderfully incorporated dialect that is mostly not used mainstream hindi films it works brings kind authenticity too music is one that has be praised with wonderful tunes vishal bharadwaj superb lyrics gulzar this is album where all songs are good my favorites are o saathi re naina laakad i am giving 4 5 simply performance saif music direction film direction itself thanks vishal wonderful adaptation shakespeares othello,0.6377943195016366,0.3422209903917221,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
