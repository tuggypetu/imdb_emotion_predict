10.0,The People's War Veterans Return Home,"One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on V-E or V-J day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.And while we don't often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell who you see here.All three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa.War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March, soda jerk Andrews, and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.March is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.I also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch March's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. You can feel him read the man's soul. It's what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great good fortune to have March's daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. They're the main story of the film, Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill.Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.By the way, the film Capra had hopes for was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that.",peoples war veterans return home,one great things about best years our lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly post world war ii era issues it talks about are as real today as they were v e or v j day 1945 problem how assimilate returning war veterans is as old as written history our planet while we dont often learn history we can be thankful that once united states america did learn what happened with its veterans after previous world war gi bill rights is mentioned passing best years our lives was possibly greatest piece social legislation last century so many veterans did take advantage it as do veterans like fredric march dana andrews harold russell who you see here all three those actors played archetypal veterans characters that every corner usa could identify with they all meet army transport plane flying home town all them boone city iowa war is great leveler class distinction bank employee march soda jerk andrews high school football star russell probably would never meet real life even small town like boone city but they do meet war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken march is oldest man with two children hollywoods perfect wife myrna loy he settles first best he has some wonderful scenes getting cockeyed drunk his return later with little bit liquor him tells bank officials at banquet off no uncertain terms i also love his scene where another returning veteran sharecropper wants get bank loan his own piece land watch marchs expressions as he listens mans pitch money you can feel him read mans soul its what got him his second best actor oscar this film harold russell was real veteran who lost both his hands during service pacific he got special recognition oscar his performance because that it was probably unfair nominate him supporting actor category which he also won his performance especially his scenes with cathy odonnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting dana andrews is only officer three bombardier army air corps group them maybe he should have stayed he also comes poorest background group he was officer gentleman that uniform that uniform those monthly allotment checks are what got virginia mayo interested enough marry him problem is that hes considerably less her eyes as civilian while mayo is fooling around with steve cochran andrews has great good fortune have marchs daughter teresa wright take interest him theyre main story film andrews adjustment civilian life adjusting fact he married wrong woman not all veterans problems were solved with gi bill myrna loy gets little recognition best years our lives my guess is that its because her role as wife was too much like stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at mgm still as wife march mother wright she really is glue that holds that family together best years our lives won best picture sam goldwyn best director william wyler few others besides two acting oscars it got it was critical popular success possibly best film sam goldwyn ever produced it remains this day endearing enduring classic will be so centuries its almost three hours length but never once will your interest wane best tribute this film received came frank capra who had film his own oscar sweepstakes that year several categories his memoirs he said that he was disappointed be skunked at oscars that year but that his friend colleague william wyler had created such masterpiece he deserved every award he could get it by way film capra had hopes was its wonderful life beat years our lives cant get better praise than that,0.45091684434968027,0.2936638237384506,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Highly structured but flawless and really moving drama about returning G.I.s,"The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)The whole point of this film when it was released still makes perfect sense today, though I'm sure it doesn't have the same impact it did in those first years after World War II ended. Returning servicemen, with all kinds of backgrounds before and during the war, hit a wall coming home: wives who no longer loved them, jobs that had dried up, a culture that was foreign to them and that found them, these men, to be foreign themselves.It wasn't a crisis to take lightly. These were the guys who were drafted to fight the enemy, and in going overseas they lost some of the best years of their lives, if not their lives. The country knew its debt in the abstract, but it also knew it in sons and husbands who really did come home and who had to face it all. This movie was both a reckoning for the sake of national healing and a brilliant drama that would be beautifully pertinent and therefore successful. And what a success, then and now.The consummate Hollywood director William Wyler shows in this fast, long movie just what a master he is at working the medium. With Gregg Toland at the camera, Wyler makes a highly fluid movie, visual and dramatic and weirdly highly efficient. With the three main plots interweaving and depending on each other, the drama (and melodrama) build but never beyond plausibility. Wyler knew his audience wouldn't put up with pandering or cheap mistakes. Casting Harold Russell as Homer, knowing the audience would hear about how Russell really was a soldier who lost both hands in the war, was a huge step toward creating both empathy and credibility. It even practices a key theme in the move--to go beyond your bounds to make a difference, to give these guys a break and help them assimilate.It's interesting how singular this movie is, trying to show the truth in these kinds of situations. The other post-war films about army and navy men fall into two large and dominating categories--war films and film noir. And it is film noir that comes closest to getting at the problem of the G.I. not reintegrating well, making it a whole style, brooding and spilling over with violence. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" has a highly controlled and even contrived plot structure, but it aims to be honest and representative. That it's remarkable formally--the way it is shot and edited and acted, top to bottom--is not surprise, given the heights that Hollywood had reached by then, and given that Wyler is easily the slickest of them all, in the best sense. That the movie makes such beautiful sense and really works as a story, a moving and heartwarming story without undue sappiness, is a whole other kind of achievement.

10.0,Over 60 years old and still a classic!,"In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: ***** To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. I think in many ways ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII. I believe ""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"".What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.This movie still packs a wallop and I'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****I'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI.

8.0,Those Left Behind,"Three WWII veterans return home to small-town America to discover that they and their families have been irreparably changed.Such a powerful film. At first the new lives of the soldiers seem to be facing small adjustments, such as their children's interest in ""atomic energy"" and ""scientific efficiency"". But soon we find that jobs are hard to find, and the wives and girlfriends sometimes met new people while the battles were fought.Although a serious topic, the film has the right balance of entertainment and drama. It never gets outright depressing, and things like depression and suicide are overlooked. But it still remains a valuable lesson: as bad as dying in the war is, sometimes the transition back to normalcy can be just as damaging.Although not one of the better known movies today (2014), ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" won seven Academy Awards in 1946, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert Sherwood), and Best Original Score (Hugo Friedhofer).

10.0,Window on an era,"This is one of the important movies. It was when it was first released in 1946, addressing as it did the issue of veterans returning from WW2, and the affect it had on them and their families. It focused on three men, all psychologically scarred, and one who has lost both arms. They return to a small city in the U.S., but the themes of the film were universal.That was 70 years ago, and over the years, the movie has tended to move into the background - there have been more wars and more veterans returning with their own issues.However, I think the importance of this movie can't be underestimated now that the WW2 generation is fading away.WW2 was well covered; we have millions of feet of newsreel film as well as towering stacks of history books. However, movies from the era do something quite unique; they get inside the emotions and the feelings - they represent the mindset of the time. Audiences identified with the issues through the stars in a way that was very personal. Hollywood did this job best - it was entertainment, but it was also a commitment to a generation.At the end of the war and into the 50's, Hollywood addressed the aftermath - ""Till the End of Time"", ""The Men"", ""My Foolish Heart"", ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" and others, but ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" towers above them all.The film could never really be remade. It was created by people who had experienced the war either in combat or on the home front. Many behind the camera had served including director William Wyler who had flown dangerous missions making documentaries about the U.S. Air Force; he was left nearly deaf from the experience.The film tackled tough issues and attitudes. Sergeant Al Stephenson (Frederick March) returns from the Philippines, but he hasn't seen his kids for years and he seems out of step with them. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns to an unfaithful wife and an uncertain future, he was good at war but what now? Real-life amputee Harold Russell plays Homer Parrish. He has much to overcome, but his girlfriend remains loyal, and he emerges as possibly the best adjusted of them all; he accepts what he can't change, and just gets on with it.The film has a powerful score by Hugo Friedhofer. Friedhofer was not as famous as Newman, Korngold or Steiner but he was as good. He surpassed himself here; his music helped express the unspoken thoughts of the actors - there are sections of this score that bring a lump to the throat.This was my parent's generation; my father was in the Australian army and fought in the war. And although this movie was about Americans, the story resonated far wider.Of course you could argue that some issues were not tackled - and that also gives an insight into an era, but with that said, this film is a window on the ideas and forces that were shaping society at a critical time in modern history. Seen that way, it's a movie that may never lose its relevance.",window era,this is one important movies it was when it was first released 1946 addressing as it did issue veterans returning ww2 affect it had them their families it focused three men all psychologically scarred one who has lost both arms they return small city u s but themes film were universal that was 70 years ago over years movie has tended move into background there have been more wars more veterans returning with their own issues however i think importance this movie cant be underestimated now that ww2 generation is fading away ww2 was well covered we have millions feet newsreel film as well as towering stacks history books however movies era do something quite unique they get inside emotions feelings they represent mindset time audiences identified with issues through stars way that was very personal hollywood did this job best it was entertainment but it was also commitment generation at end war into 50s hollywood addressed aftermath till end time men my foolish heart man grey flannel suit others but best years our lives towers above them all film could never really be remade it was created by people who had experienced war either combat or home front many behind camera had served including director william wyler who had flown dangerous missions making documentaries about u s air force he was left nearly deaf experience film tackled tough issues attitudes sergeant al stephenson frederick march returns philippines but he hasnt seen his kids years he seems out step with them fred derry dana andrews returns unfaithful wife uncertain future he was good at war but what now real life amputee harold russell plays homer parrish he has much overcome but his girlfriend remains loyal he emerges as possibly best adjusted them all he accepts what he cant change just gets with it film has powerful score by hugo friedhofer friedhofer was not as famous as newman korngold or steiner but he was as good he surpassed himself here his music helped express unspoken thoughts actors there are sections this score that bring lump throat this was my parents generation my father was australian army fought war although this movie was about americans story resonated far wider course you could argue that some issues were not tackled that also gives insight into era but with that said this film is window ideas forces that were shaping society at critical time modern history seen that way its movie that may never lose its relevance,0.5115277777777778,0.21859567901234567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,Among Best Films Of Our Lives,"Not seldom have we seen veterans returning from wars in movies and certain assumptions are likely, but THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES occurs to be an exceptionally memorable treatment of the theme. Bosley Crowther in New York Times, soon after the premiere of William Wyler's gripping work, pointed out accurately that the film ""visions the overflowing humors and the curious pathos of such returns, and it honestly and sensitively images the terrible loneliness of the man who has been hurt."" One of the major strengths of this film, therefore, does not lie in entertainment (though it does not lack it whatsoever) or any sort of heroic deeds worn in glorified patriotism (something that many movies of the time did not resist), but in the very empathy it employs to the theme and the characters. William Wyler speaks to the generation with clarity and modesty derived from his very experience with the men of Air Forces. Roger Ebert develops the thought labeling the central theme as ""sobering at the problems veterans faced."" He adds that ""Wyler doesn't pump in superfluous drama"" but actually IS with his characters and with/for his audiences. As a result, the story does not resort to the specific time of history but concludes in a rather universal, timeless insight into psychological and moral aspects of those troublesome torments and alienation therein endured. Ebert explains the fact why the movie so wonderfully passed a test of time with three adjectives applied to it: ""lean, direct, honest."" Let me highlight those features from the standpoint of the three veterans herein depicted.The main cast do not only come from various backgrounds, do not only portray different personalities with common experience yet diverse backgrounds but truly surprise us at multiple levels. All of them truly deservedly credit.FREDRIC MARCH, a very famous actor at the time, does a splendid job as sergeant Al Stephenson coming back home to his wife Milly (played with bravura and charm by Myrna Loy) and two kids, a daughter Peggy (played with subtlety by Teresa Wright) and a son Rob (Michael Hall). He is 'lean, direct and honest' in both merry-go-round scenes and serious moments but most captivating at the very adjustment to the family after the years of absence. The terrific ability to balance the hilarious with the serious is something that makes March's performance deserve particular attention. Although he has come back from war, much is at war within him...DANA ANDREWS as a former bombardier Fred Derry is a totally different character to analyze and perceive in the very context of pre-war vs. post-war reality - something many viewers of the time could identify with and most viewers of our time can fully understand. His destiny is shaped in direction towards Al's family (he is in love with Peggy) and yet, distorted by the haunting past and wrong choices. Here, who calls our attention is his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), a conceited, vain woman occupied with what one looks like rather than bothering to consider what one feels. Andrews is given much freedom on the screen to develop the character on a great scale for the time. He does well. But the most intriguing and perhaps the most identifiable character among them is...HAROLD RUSSELL as Homer Parrish, a sailor most hurt by the war. His artificial hands, steel hooks have become almost a symbol of the movie's most powerful anti-war aspect, and, at the same time, the reason why the story may be called ""food for quiet and humanizing thought"" (Crowther). His character moves us most and leaves us almost reflective because it embodies honesty. Homer Parrish is a living statement that evokes the indifference and arrogance of war. He is in love with Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) but he has to confront the reality the war experience has given to him. He is no longer the way he dreamed to be. Yet, the awareness of being loved helps him go on. Consider the bedroom scene with Wilma and the genuine tears of joy at having heard she loves him. Deservedly Mr Russell got the Oscar for the role and there is no question about one thing: such a screen achievement may be considered one among the very best roles of one's life. In this character lies quiet, subtle, captivating heroism.Among the female characters, great performances are delivered by Myrna Loy as Al's wife whose acting Crowther labels as ""charmingly reticent"" and Teresa Wright as Peggy who highlights trustworthy enthusiasm and youthfullness in difficult times.

10.0,wonderful post-war epic,"This is a home-coming tale of three WWII veterans, returning to the same small town. One was a bank clerk who rose through the military ranks (Fredric March, who got the Best Actor Oscar for this, well-deserved) with an understanding wife (Myrna Loy, excellent) and daughter (Teresa Wright). One has lost his hands (Harold Russell, real-life veteran, putting in a touching performance) and struggles to cope with this and with his relationship with his girlfriend (Cathy O'Donnell). The other was a soda jerk but has flown bomber planes throughout the conflict (Dana Andrews, in one of his best roles) and is now heading back to his pin-up wife (Virginia Mayo, a small role but an interesting one).We follow them on their respective journeys, often meeting up in Butch's bar (run by Hoagy Carmichael, who gets the chance to play piano, etc.) and often finding their paths cross.

9.0,The Troops are Coming Home.....,"Though we had a plethora of films about troops returning from the Vietnam war and trying to re-integrate back into their societies, most of which were hard-hitting, angry voices against War, here is arguably the original - and best.Definitely a family orientated movie (Cert U) this will appeal to and find favour with all ages, but don't start thinking that this is all gooey, slushy nonsense. There's some quite hard-hitting topics covered, even by today's standards and of course, with our minds on our current troops in Iraq/Afghanistan, equally relevant.Multi-stranded, which each of the three G.I.'s immediate and extended families and friends being examined, it's about them coping, with varying degrees of success, with home life and getting jobs, now that the War is ended. It's the little observations and stories around them that are so fascinating, as the Heroes of yesterday are now anything but when it comes finding new purpose in a changed world.The cast is exemplary, not necessarily the biggest stars of the day but the most believable and natural for their roles. Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy and Fredric Marsh are the ones most easily recognisable and their appearances convey a sort of reassuring familiarity and normality. They're all excellent, of course.Though long, at nearly 3 hours, William Wyler's easy going but assured and tight direction keeps things flowing nicely and it never drags. This, my second viewing, is an enjoyable one as the first and if anything I'm more at ease with it.Though obviously not as exciting or dramatic as other 'normal' war films, it's a tragedy that it's not more well known. I've never seen it to ever have been on TV, or to my recollection, even Sky Movies, for that matter. Any movie that won 7 Oscars and is currently no. 180 in the top 250 IMDb's films of all time, voted by its voters (us, the public) is hardly one of minority interest.A friend I lent my DVD to watched it with his family and normally they only go for current films, or ones they know, but they not only enjoyed it, but felt enormously moved by it, too.If you haven't seen The Best Years... yet, make a mental note to do so. Your life won't change by doing so, but it really is worth the 3 hours of it that it will take. You certainly can't say the same about every film out there....",troops are coming home,though we had plethora films about troops returning vietnam war trying re integrate back into their societies most which were hard hitting angry voices against war here is arguably original best definitely family orientated movie cert u this will appeal find favour with all ages but dont start thinking that this is all gooey slushy nonsense theres some quite hard hitting topics covered even by todays standards course with our minds our current troops iraq afghanistan equally relevant multi stranded which each three g i s immediate extended families friends being examined its about them coping with varying degrees success with home life getting jobs now that war is ended its little observations stories around them that are so fascinating as heroes yesterday are now anything but when it comes finding new purpose changed world cast is exemplary not necessarily biggest stars day but most believable natural their roles dana andrews myrna loy fredric marsh are ones most easily recognisable their appearances convey sort reassuring familiarity normality theyre all excellent course though long at nearly 3 hours william wylers easy going but assured tight direction keeps things flowing nicely it never drags this my second viewing is enjoyable one as first if anything im more at ease with it though obviously not as exciting or dramatic as other normal war films its tragedy that its not more well known ive never seen it ever have been tv or my recollection even sky movies that matter any movie that won 7 oscars is currently no 180 top 250 imdbs films all time voted by its voters us public is hardly one minority interest friend i lent my dvd watched it with his family normally they only go current films or ones they know but they not only enjoyed it but felt enormously moved by it too if you havent seen best years yet make mental note do so your life wont change by doing so but it really is worth 3 hours it that it will take you certainly cant say same about every film out there,0.5340670995670996,0.15785822510822511,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,"""Last year it was killing Japs and this year it's... make money.""","Some months ago, a co-worker and I were discussing our favorite movies, and his happened to be ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". I had certainly heard of it before, and knew it ranked highly on the IMDb and AFI lists of all time top movies. Up till now though, it had remained low on my radar, but I requested it through my local library system and got a chance to see it today. The film has to be one of the best ever in dealing with the return of military soldiers to civilian life, certainly the best regarding servicemen from World War II. It wisely stays away from battle scene flash backs to concentrate on the human drama of three ordinary men thrust back into a world they have to familiarize themselves with all over again. Their experiences range from the happiness of friends and family to have them back home, to the wrenching adjustments they must make individually as befits their respective situations. Perhaps the most heart wrenching is the personal ordeal of sailor Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), a real life veteran who lost his hands in an accident while training paratroopers at Camp MacKall, North Carolina. You would never know Russell wasn't an accomplished actor of his own accord, and for his effort in the film, was recognized as the only actor in history to win two Oscars for the same role in a picture (Best Supporting Actor and an Honorary Award for bringing hope and courage to fellow veterans).All of the performances by the principals are uniformly believable and consistent, with Fredric March and Dana Andrews rounding out the wartime trio who hook up by chance for a flight home to Boone City, a fictional city set in the Midwest. Young viewers probably won't believe the visibility offered by the nose of a B-15 bomber, just like I couldn't get over it when I saw the real thing at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center. There, the cockpit and nose section of the Enola Gay (actually a B-29 bomber) is on display, and seeing it, I earned an even greater appreciation and respect for the combat fliers who went to war for their country.Watching the film today, it's surprising how daring director William Wyler was in executing the story. The first example of course was using Harold Russell in a lead role, but you also have themes that were downright shocking in the 1940's. When Peggy Stephenson (Teresa Wright) declares that she's going to cause the divorce of Fred Derry (Andrews) and his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), you can almost hear the gasps of movie patrons back in the day. And even though it's played for laughs, I had to wonder about the scene when Fred and Al Stephenson (March) were bundled up in the back seat of the family car in a drunken stupor. Speaking of which, stay attentive to the scene at Butch's tavern; Al introduces Fred and Homer to his family using each other's names. Of course by that time he was already a bit pie-eyed, so if it was a mistake, at least it was a credible one.If you never saw the credits for the movie, I think you'd be hard pressed to rank the actors in the story, so good are the performances and the screen time shared by the leads. To my mind, Harold Russell and his story are the standouts, but one could make as good a case for Dana Andrews and his conflicted relationship with wife Marie and the love he finds with Peggy. I'd have to surmise that Myrna Loy and Fredric March are top billed because they were the biggest names at the time, but that takes nothing away from their roles either, ones in which they attempt to rekindle a marriage following the strain of war and separation. You know, there were times that Myrna Loy seemed to have a devilish look in her eye like she was itching to go into a Nora Charles characterization, but had to restrain herself for the more sedate role she had. She probably should have had a scene where she could cut loose, but that wasn't the mission so to speak. You've also got Hoagy Carmichael aboard for a few musical numbers, which leads into the wedding march that helps close the story.It's hard today to try to imagine the kind of things returning servicemen had to endure returning to civilian life. The story helps set that tone with the men attempting to get back into the work force. I found it to be quite a disparity for Fred to be employed as a soda fountain clerk at $32.50 a week, while Al goes back to his bank with a promotion and a raise to twelve thousand a year, roughly two hundred fifty dollars a week. When Al took sympathy and a chance on a loan for a deserving veteran, it leads to some wonderful dialog about the kind of collateral a man brings to the table, the kind that can't be measured in money and property, but the kind that comes from the hands, the heart and the guts. That's what the true spirit of America was once, and is still if you can find it underneath all the garish headlines and muck that passes for news today. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" works because it portrays everyday heroes doing courageous things off the battlefield, where for most of us, that's where it really counts.",last year it was killing japs this year its make money,some months ago co worker i were discussing our favorite movies his happened be best years our lives i had certainly heard it before knew it ranked highly imdb afi lists all time top movies up till now though it had remained low my radar but i requested it through my local library system got chance see it today film has be one best ever dealing with return military soldiers civilian life certainly best regarding servicemen world war ii it wisely stays away battle scene flash backs concentrate human drama three ordinary men thrust back into world they have familiarize themselves with all over again their experiences range happiness friends family have them back home wrenching adjustments they must make individually as befits their respective situations perhaps most heart wrenching is personal ordeal sailor homer parrish harold russell real life veteran who lost his hands accident while training paratroopers at camp mackall north carolina you would never know russell wasnt accomplished actor his own accord his effort film was recognized as only actor history win two oscars same role picture best supporting actor honorary award bringing hope courage fellow veterans all performances by principals are uniformly believable consistent with fredric march dana andrews rounding out wartime trio who hook up by chance flight home boone city fictional city set midwest young viewers probably wont believe visibility offered by nose b 15 bomber just like i couldnt get over it when i saw real thing at national air space museums udvar hazy center there cockpit nose section enola gay actually b 29 bomber is display seeing it i earned even greater appreciation respect combat fliers who went war their country watching film today its surprising how daring director william wyler was executing story first example course was using harold russell lead role but you also have themes that were downright shocking 1940s when peggy stephenson teresa wright declares that shes going cause divorce fred derry andrews his wife marie virginia mayo you can almost hear gasps movie patrons back day even though its played laughs i had wonder about scene when fred al stephenson march were bundled up back seat family car drunken stupor speaking which stay attentive scene at butchs tavern al introduces fred homer his family using each others names course by that time he was already bit pie eyed so if it was mistake at least it was credible one if you never saw credits movie i think youd be hard pressed rank actors story so good are performances screen time shared by leads my mind harold russell his story are standouts but one could make as good case dana andrews his conflicted relationship with wife marie love he finds with peggy id have surmise that myrna loy fredric march are top billed because they were biggest names at time but that takes nothing away their roles either ones which they attempt rekindle marriage following strain war separation you know there were times that myrna loy seemed have devilish look her eye like she was itching go into nora charles characterization but had restrain herself more sedate role she had she probably should have had scene where she could cut loose but that wasnt mission so speak youve also got hoagy carmichael aboard few musical numbers which leads into wedding march that helps close story its hard today try imagine kind things returning servicemen had endure returning civilian life story helps set that tone with men attempting get back into work force i found it be quite disparity fred be employed as soda fountain clerk at 32 50 week while al goes back his bank with promotion raise twelve thousand year roughly two hundred fifty dollars week when al took sympathy chance loan deserving veteran it leads some wonderful dialog about kind collateral man brings table kind that cant be measured money property but kind that comes hands heart guts thats what true spirit america was once is still if you can find it underneath all garish headlines muck that passes news today best years our lives works because it portrays everyday heroes doing courageous things off battlefield where most us thats where it really counts,0.418544946044946,0.24703643203643202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,A deeply personal motion picture...,"This American masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be, from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by William Wyler from the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell The film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar world This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience But, unlike contemporary and preceding ""message"" pictures, it was not a preachment It showed Americans as they are, presented their problems as they themselves see them, and provided only such solutionspartial, temporary, personalas they themselves would accept The picture's values are the values of the people in itWilliam Wyler, an outstanding director, triple winner of the best picture Oscar, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and Westerns... With his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material, he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist... Wyler's most adept use of deep-focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content...The film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle-American community, and find it variously difficult to pick up where they left off... The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family; an incisive Air Force captain (Dana Andrews) returning to an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who has lost both hands in service, replaced by hooks in real life...Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes: The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly: ""I look terrible! It isn't fair of you to burst in on us like this.""The involuntarily sob of the sailor's mother when she first sees her son's mechanical hands... She blurts out: ""It's nothing!""With her dry-martini voice, Myrna Loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones; Teresa Wright is lovely as the sergeant's nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is harsh as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life; and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's fiancée...The situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious, but this is a superb example of high-quality film-making in the forties, with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject...",deeply personal motion picture,this american masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives be its beautifully equivocal suggestive title magnificent performance elicited by william wyler nonprofessional amputee harold russell film epitomized both dream reality postwar world this intimate engagement with psychological facts american life gave it almost universal audience but unlike contemporary preceding message pictures it was not preachment it showed americans as they are presented their problems as they themselves see them provided only such solutions partial temporary personal as they themselves would accept pictures values are values people it william wyler outstanding director triple winner best picture oscar adds air distinction melodrama epic westerns with his distinguishing visual style his taste solemn material he gained reputation as meticulous serious artist wylers most adept use deep focus reveals real commitment emotional content film tells story three men coming home war small middle american community find it variously difficult pick up where they left off three heroes are middle aged sergeant fredric march magnificent as devoted family man who succeeds breaking ice with his family incisive air force captain dana andrews returning unfaithful wife tormented sailor harold russell who has lost both hands service replaced by hooks real life winner 7 academy awards including best picture best years our lives is eloquent compassionate deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes first words sergeants loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly i look terrible it isnt fair you burst us like this involuntarily sob sailors mother when she first sees her sons mechanical hands she blurts out its nothing with her dry martini voice myrna loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones teresa wright is lovely as sergeants nice daughter who falls love with pilot virginia mayo is harsh as disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money high life cathy odonnell is wonderful sensitive as sailors fianc e situations even some characters seem little obvious but this is superb example high quality film making forties with smiles tears cunningly spaced film which says what is needed vital subject,0.5101767676767677,0.19518939393939394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"

This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute.

9.0,Please Make It All Right,"One can't watch this without thinking of our present coming home soldiers. Consider the rampant PTSD and all the other factors that affect the lives of these young men and women. Some are maimed and some are psychologically damaged as they try to resume their lives. This film brings a portrait of three men who have left the same war, World War II, with various handicaps. One has lost his hands in an accident, one has become bitter and dissatisfied with the treatment of his fellow military comrade, and the third goes back to his wife, who has no interest in him anymore, who is only interested in a meal ticket. We get to see how war has changed these people. The handicapped man is the most obvious, as he longs for normalcy, yet watches as his family and friends drop into a depressed state, utterly aware of his limitations. They don't mean to, but they take away his humanity. He falls into the pits of depression, almost driving away the one who loves him most. The other two wrestle with their own demons. This is beautifully presented in a subtle way, without being maudlin. Of course, Hollywood requires a sappy ending. Still, the rest of the movie, including the great Hoagie Carmichael as a piano playing bar owner, stands on its own merit. I hadn't seen this movie in nearly forty years and it was a delight.",please make it all right,one cant watch this without thinking our present coming home soldiers consider rampant ptsd all other factors that affect lives these young men women some are maimed some are psychologically damaged as they try resume their lives this film brings portrait three men who have left same war world war ii with various handicaps one has lost his hands accident one has become bitter dissatisfied with treatment his fellow military comrade third goes back his wife who has no interest him anymore who is only interested meal ticket we get see how war has changed these people handicapped man is most obvious as he longs normalcy yet watches as his family friends drop into depressed state utterly aware his limitations they dont mean but they take away his humanity he falls into pits depression almost driving away one who loves him most other two wrestle with their own demons this is beautifully presented subtle way without being maudlin course hollywood requires sappy ending still rest movie including great hoagie carmichael as piano playing bar owner stands its own merit i hadnt seen this movie nearly forty years it was delight,0.44608516483516486,0.14384157509157508,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,The perfect tribute to our veterans,"""How many times have I said I hated you and believed it in my heart? How many times have you said you were sick and tired of me, and that we were all washed up? How many times have we had to fall in love all over again?""One of the many reasons to love The Best Years of Our Lives is because there are so many different characters, ensuring that everyone in the audience can identify with someone. This is a story that touches you, no matter how old you are. It may be the most beloved movie celebrating our veterans, but it isn't necessarily a ""coming home"" movie. This is a movie that shows how different people cope with the same problem: What do you do when the best years of your life are behind you?Another of the many reasons to love this movie is Hugo Friedhofer's Academy-Award winning score. This is one of the few movies ever made where each character has his or her own theme. His music evokes so many emotions from his listeners, the perfect mixture of nostalgia, tragedy, hope, love, resignation, patriotism, and perseverance. One of the many times you watch the film-because I'm sure you'll buy a copy and watch it all the time-try and imagine how terribly Max Steiner or Franz Waxman would have ruined the tender scenes.Three veterans, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell, return to the same hometown at the end of WWII. They're extremely different, and had they not been travelling companions on the way back, they probably wouldn't have even met. As it is, they make a fast friendship, and it changes the course of their lives. Freddie returns home to two grown children and must readjust to life at home with his wife and work at the bank. Dana left for the war a hotshot soda jerk, and he married just before shipping out. When he comes home, he's in for two rude awakenings: he's not qualified for civilian work, and his wife wants everything to be fun and carefree as it was before. Harold has to make the greatest adjustment of all: he lost his hands. His character, Homer, was different in the original novel; director William Wyler rewrote the character to have lost his hands because he'd met veteran Harold Russell and wanted him to act in the movie. There are no special effects in this film; the hooks you see are really Harold's hooks. It's no wonder he won Best Supporting Actor in 1947 and also took home a second Oscar for inspiring our veterans!It's impossible to choose a favorite of the three veterans' stories, because they're all relatable, cleverly written, and realistically acted. Even the smallest roles are acted beautifully. For example. Dana Andrew's father and stepmother, Roman Bonnen and Gladys George, are only onscreen for about five minutes, but their scene is one of the most touching for parents in the audience to watch. Fredric March won his second Oscar for this movie, and it's not hard to see why. He gives yet another incredible performance, and as his character frequently uses alcohol to help him adjust to his new life, his levels of intoxication are flawlessly realistic. Myrna Loy, Freddie's wife, is one of the most underrated classic actresses, and she gives the perfect portrayal of ""the wife"". Donna Reed and June Allyson were often cited as ideal wives during that time period, but they've got nothing on Myrna Loy. Dana Andrews wasn't often given roles to show off his dramatic talents, but he was able to show them off in The Best Years of Our Lives. His character in the original novel is the lead, and in the film, he's given many choice scenes to show other veterans they're not alone in their disappointments, regrets, and recurrent nightmares from the battlefield.As usual, William Wyler's impeccable directions adds to the dramatic essence of the film. He knows how to get to the core of the scene and never uses the camera to distract the audience. Equal to his talent is that of screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. He took one of the most depressing, morbid novellas The Bishop's Wife and turned it into a delightful Christmas classic, and he adapted the novel Glory for Me, written entirely in verse, into a three hour masterpiece. I've read Glory for Me, and it's incredibly moving in its own right, but the talent it took to turn it into a screenplay is mindblowing.This is not only a wonderful tribute to our veterans, but it shows the serious adjustments they make when they come home, without ever becoming overly dramatic. This is not only one of the best old movies ever made, but it's one of the greatest films of all time.

,"An extraordinary, moving post-war film","I first saw this film (one of my top ten favorites) in 1995 on the big screen, as part of the commemorations for the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII. It had an impact that was so strong that it's never left me--I've seen it many times since, and with each viewing the film seems to reveal new artistic richness and spiritual depth.William Wyler's direction is breathtaking. One of the most moving scenes occurs early on in the film, when Homer, the young disabled Navy veteran, arrives at his family home and stands for a moment on the front lawn. For that one second there is an exquisite stillness that communicates a depth of emotion that can't be expressed physically. Then, just as the tension becomes almost unbearable, Homer's little sister Louella comes to the front door and runs out to greet him. In a similar way, the scene where Al Stephenson comes home to his wife and children is so finely directed you can almost feel that you're in the apartment with them--that it's your husband or father come home to you from the war--and you're experiencing the sheer elation of their physical nearness.This aspect of the film--its portrayal of the joys and hardships of post-war readjustment and the veterans' experience--is what makes it so enlightening, honest and powerful. As a young woman, I have never experienced wartime or had my father, brothers or friends go off to fight. The film moves swiftly but seamlessly from the initial joy of homecoming and reunion to the problems, anxieties and humiliations that the three veterans encounter as they attempt to build a new life for themselves and their families. I found it interesting how the film tries to give a picture of the different socio-economic backgrounds of the three men, and show the emergence of an affluent, market-driven economy. While this in itself is not bad, different episodes in the film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity and justice. Al's dealings with the young veteran Mr Novak, who comes to him for a service loan to buy a farm, and his later (slightly tipsy) speech to a business gathering show this. Al declares at the end of his speech that when the bank lends money to poor veterans it will be a financial gamble but ""we'll be gambling on the future of this country"".The film's interweaving of the characters and their struggles never falters and is deeply satisfying. Even as Al and Milly, Homer and Wilma gradually move towards a happy resolution of their difficulties this positive strand of the film is counter-balanced by the focus on Fred, the courageous Air Force captain who, in the eyes of the commercial world is ""unqualified"", suitable only for a job at a soda fountain, and in the eyes of his war bride, Marie, is only wonderful when he's dressed up in his officer's uniform. Fred's situation seems only to deteriorate and at one point in the film, after he farewells his elderly father to leave town and look for work, the father finds the citations for Fred's medals and sits down to read them. As he reads the words describing Fred's bravery and dedication to duty while he was terribly wounded in his aircraft, Pat Derry's voice nearly breaks with pride and love for his son. The film beautifully juxtaposes Fred's unselfish conduct and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice with the cold indifference of a country in peacetime that does not want him and seemingly has no place for him.The actors are uniformly impressive and really make their characters come alive. Dana Andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell, as Homer and Wilma. Personally, I loved Homer and Wilma's story the best among those of all the characters,and the resolution is a simple, sensitively shot scene that lifts the whole film to a new point of happiness, gratitude and release. Both Cathy O'Donnell and Teresa Wright are lovely, gifted actresses with a slightly understated style, that is perfectly suited to the film's restrained but powerful tenor. This is demonstrated especially well in the tense scene where Wilma tries to talk to Homer in the shed, and in the scene where Peggy confides her heartache to her parents.One feature that adds significantly to the film's quality is Hugo Friedhofer's score. The music is remarkably fresh and undated, has a strong, classic sound, and is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental (a flaw often found in other 1940s film scores).The producer, Samuel Goldwyn, reportedly said of this film: ""I don't care if it doesn't make a nickel...I just want every man, woman and child in America to see it"". Although I'm not American (I am Australian) I found this film, with its universal human themes and its portrayal of post-war readjustment, speaks to anyone who shares in this heritage of WWII. Tell others about this film--it is breathtaking, beautiful and brave. See it and remember.",extraordinary moving post war film,i first saw this film one my top ten favorites 1995 big screen as part commemorations 50th anniversary end wwii it had impact that was so strong that its never left me ive seen it many times since with each viewing film seems reveal new artistic richness spiritual depth william wylers direction is breathtaking one most moving scenes occurs early film when homer young disabled navy veteran arrives at his family home stands moment front lawn that one second there is exquisite stillness that communicates depth emotion that cant be expressed physically then just as tension becomes almost unbearable homers little sister louella comes front door runs out greet him similar way scene where al stephenson comes home his wife children is so finely directed you can almost feel that youre apartment with them that its your husband or father come home you war youre experiencing sheer elation their physical nearness this aspect film its portrayal joys hardships post war readjustment veterans experience is what makes it so enlightening honest powerful as young woman i have never experienced wartime or had my father brothers or friends go off fight film moves swiftly but seamlessly initial joy homecoming reunion problems anxieties humiliations that three veterans encounter as they attempt build new life themselves their families i found it interesting how film tries give picture different socio economic backgrounds three men show emergence affluent market driven economy while this itself is not bad different episodes film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity justice als dealings with young veteran mr novak who comes him service loan buy farm his later slightly tipsy speech business gathering show this al declares at end his speech that when bank lends money poor veterans it will be financial gamble but well be gambling future this country films interweaving characters their struggles never falters is deeply satisfying even as al milly homer wilma gradually move towards happy resolution their difficulties this positive strand film is counter balanced by focus fred courageous air force captain who eyes commercial world is unqualified suitable only job at soda fountain eyes his war bride marie is only wonderful when hes dressed up his officers uniform freds situation seems only deteriorate at one point film after he farewells his elderly father leave town look work father finds citations freds medals sits down read them as he reads words describing freds bravery dedication duty while he was terribly wounded his aircraft pat derrys voice nearly breaks with pride love his son film beautifully juxtaposes freds unselfish conduct willingness make ultimate sacrifice with cold indifference country peacetime that does not want him seemingly has no place him actors are uniformly impressive really make their characters come alive dana andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut harold russell cathy odonnell as homer wilma personally i loved homer wilmas story best among those all characters resolution is simple sensitively shot scene that lifts whole film new point happiness gratitude release both cathy odonnell teresa wright are lovely gifted actresses with slightly understated style that is perfectly suited films restrained but powerful tenor this is demonstrated especially well tense scene where wilma tries talk homer shed scene where peggy confides her heartache her parents one feature that adds significantly films quality is hugo friedhofers score music is remarkably fresh undated has strong classic sound is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental flaw often found other 1940s film scores producer samuel goldwyn reportedly said this film i dont care if it doesnt make nickel i just want every man woman child america see it although im not american i am australian i found this film with its universal human themes its portrayal post war readjustment speaks anyone who shares this heritage wwii tell others about this film it is breathtaking beautiful brave see it remember,0.5307362809789993,0.21279910758066095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,My vote for best American film of all-time,"Wow. I have a ton of reviews and never got around to reviewing one of my very favorite films. While I know you can't really say which movie is best, I really can't think of another film off the top of my head that is better. I can easily see how it made the top 250 and think it would probably be rated a lot higher if it had come out recently--as the 250 is very much skewed towards newer films.I think the biggest reason I love the film is the casting. While Frederic March and Dana Andrews were genuine stars at the time, they were not huge names like Gable, Stewart or Grant. I love these three actors but think the film benefited from March (who was no longer the handsome matinée idol he'd been in the 30s) and Andrews (who played an ""everyman""-type guy in most of his films). Plus, the genius of casting Harold Russell as the third returning serviceman cannot be minimized. While I hate movies that patronize the handicapped (I have a deaf daughter and cringe at patronizing), Russell's performance was anything but and was amazingly honest and powerful--earning him a very well-deserved special Oscar for his performance, not his disability. The family and friends of these men also worked out so very well. I just can't say enough positive about it.And, of course, the choice of actors and the type performance they gave was due in large part to William Wyler--my vote as the greatest director ever. Why he is not recognized as every bit the genius that Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kurosawa or Kubrick were, I don't know (actually, I think he was far better than all these directors with the exception of Kurosawa, but that's a discussion for another place). If you don't believe me about his genius, do an IMDb search on the films he made--no other director comes close in the sheer number of great films. Plus, watch the film at least two or three times and you'll notice all the fantastic scenes--wonderful camera shots (like the ones in the nosecone of the airplane) or scenes involving real people (such as the one with Harold Russell with his fiancé as she tucks him into bed--I am fighting off tears now just thinking about it).This film also has an unbelievable script--pure, real and captivating throughout! A film about returning war vets could have been trite or jingoistic, but this one maintains it dignity and humanity throughout. I challenge you to watch this and not be impressed. Unless you are a member or Al-Qaeda or a 100% America-hater, you will be hooked. And this means that French or British or Italians or those of any other nationality should be able to find so much to love and appreciate from this film than transcends nations.",my vote best american film all time,wow i have ton reviews never got around reviewing one my very favorite films while i know you cant really say which movie is best i really cant think another film off top my head that is better i can easily see how it made top 250 think it would probably be rated lot higher if it had come out recently as 250 is very much skewed towards newer films i think biggest reason i love film is casting while frederic march dana andrews were genuine stars at time they were not huge names like gable stewart or grant i love these three actors but think film benefited march who was no longer handsome matin e idol hed been 30s andrews who played everyman type guy most his films plus genius casting harold russell as third returning serviceman cannot be minimized while i hate movies that patronize handicapped i have deaf daughter cringe at patronizing russells performance was anything but was amazingly honest powerful earning him very well deserved special oscar his performance not his disability family friends these men also worked out so very well i just cant say enough positive about it course choice actors type performance they gave was due large part william wyler my vote as greatest director ever why he is not recognized as every bit genius that fellini bergman hitchcock kurosawa or kubrick were i dont know actually i think he was far better than all these directors with exception kurosawa but thats discussion another place if you dont believe me about his genius do imdb search films he made no other director comes close sheer number great films plus watch film at least two or three times youll notice all fantastic scenes wonderful camera shots like ones nosecone airplane or scenes involving real people such as one with harold russell with his fianc as she tucks him into bed i am fighting off tears now just thinking about it this film also has unbelievable script pure real captivating throughout film about returning war vets could have been trite or jingoistic but this one maintains it dignity humanity throughout i challenge you watch this not be impressed unless you are member or al qaeda or 100 america hater you will be hooked this means that french or british or italians or those any other nationality should be able find so much love appreciate this film than transcends nations,0.5565151515151515,0.2945926989676989,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10.0,Intense and compelling. Kudos to Dana Andrews for an incredibly great performance.,"This is a great movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Dana Andrew's and Harold Russell's. Although released just after World War Two the movie has survived the test of time, principally because of the the nature of the story which deals with issues that are timeless in their relevancy. This movie is proof that ""they don't make 'em like that anymore."" It is hard to imagine Hollywood being able to recreate this movie today. The audience would be able to relate to the story - who couldn't?. But who'd play the roles? Could any actor today play Fred Derry without it becoming a laughable caricature of the returning war vet? Could any actor today play an Al Stephenson without coming off as being a bloated middle-aged phony? The trouble with Hollywood today is that when it tries to make a movie about a serious subject, especially one based on actual events, it usually becomes a confused jumble of special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away from the actual historical event which is shunted to the background. There are exceptions. ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese deals in part with the subject of returning war vets, but that is not the main theme of the movie. ""Saving Private Ryan"" with Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore must get high marks for its excellent portrayals of soldiers in combat, but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting, not the postwar aftermath. ""Dear Hunter"" with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken, ""Born on the Fourth of July"" with Tom Cruise and ""Coming Home"" with Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, are about postwar adjustment issues and all three are very good, very powerful movies. But even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy, with more focus on interpersonal dysfunctionality than on the actual events that may have contributed to the problematic behavior. The closest that Hollywood comes to approaching Best Years in terms of artistic style and thematic content is ""The Men"" with Marlon Brando, made in 1950. Filmed in a film-noir style, Best Years is far more subdued, far more intense, far more sophisticated, far less hysterical and therefore far more compelling than the other aforementioned movies. Anyway, go watch the movie.One other item. This movie is proof that Dana Andrews was one of the greatest actors ever in the history Hollywood. The entire movie centers around his performance as Fred Derry, a character which Mr. Andrews brings to life and which has become a symbol for all soldiers who return home.",intense compelling kudos dana andrews incredibly great performance,this is great movie with outstanding performances by entire cast especially dana andrews harold russells although released just after world war two movie has survived test time principally because nature story which deals with issues that are timeless their relevancy this movie is proof that they dont make em like that anymore it is hard imagine hollywood being able recreate this movie today audience would be able relate story who couldnt but whod play roles could any actor today play fred derry without it becoming laughable caricature returning war vet could any actor today play al stephenson without coming off as being bloated middle aged phony trouble with hollywood today is that when it tries make movie about serious subject especially one based actual events it usually becomes confused jumble special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away actual historical event which is shunted background there are exceptions forrest gump with tom hanks gary sinese deals part with subject returning war vets but that is not main theme movie saving private ryan with tom hanks vin diesel tom sizemore must get high marks its excellent portrayals soldiers combat but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting not postwar aftermath dear hunter with robert deniro christopher walken born fourth july with tom cruise coming home with jon voight jane fonda are about postwar adjustment issues all three are very good very powerful movies but even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy with more focus interpersonal dysfunctionality than actual events that may have contributed problematic behavior closest that hollywood comes approaching best years terms artistic style thematic content is men with marlon brando made 1950 filmed film noir style best years is far more subdued far more intense far more sophisticated far less hysterical therefore far more compelling than other aforementioned movies anyway go watch movie one other item this movie is proof that dana andrews was one greatest actors ever history hollywood entire movie centers around his performance as fred derry character which mr andrews brings life which has become symbol all soldiers who return home,0.5689642857142858,0.17344047619047617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.48}"

10.0,The Best Years of Our LIves is the perfect movie to watch on Veterans' Day,"Before I review the movie proper, I have to first acknowledge two players that were in both this and fellow 1946 Best Picture Oscar nominee It's a Wonderful Life (my all-time favorite): Charles Halton who was Mr. Carter, the bank examiner in IAWL was a banker named Prew here, and Harry Cheshire who was Dr. Campbell there is a Minister at Wedding here. Okay, this is just only my second time watching this film and both times it was during Veterans' Day. So it's a very touching story of three former military men coming home to a much changed world that they have to adjust to. Fredric March is an Army sergeant who takes back his bank job, Dana Andrews was a bombadier pilot who reluctantly goes back to his drugstore job, and Harold Russell is a sailor who has to live with his hooks for hands. Russell was actually a nonactor who got picked because director William Wyler saw him in an Army short called Diary of a Sergeant where Harold silently performed his way with how he functioned with his hooks. He's actually good bringing his emotions to his characterization as when he confronts someone he disagrees with or has to show and tell his high school sweetheart about his condition. So much so that he ended up getting two Oscars: a special one ""for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance"" and Best Supporting Actor. In fact, everyone is excellent in their roles. I especially liked Cathy O'Donnell as Homer's (Russell's role) girlfriend and Teresa Wright as March's grown daughter who takes a shine to Andrews. In fact, while I still consider It's a Wonderful Life my favorite movie, I'm now very glad the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave this one the BP award! And now that I watched both Diary of a Sergeant and this, I'll review the rest of Harold Russell's acting performances for the next few days...",best years our lives is perfect movie watch veterans day,before i review movie proper i have first acknowledge two players that were both this fellow 1946 best picture oscar nominee its wonderful life my all time favorite charles halton who was mr carter bank examiner iawl was banker named prew here harry cheshire who was dr campbell there is minister at wedding here okay this is just only my second time watching this film both times it was during veterans day so its very touching story three former military men coming home much changed world that they have adjust fredric march is army sergeant who takes back his bank job dana andrews was bombadier pilot who reluctantly goes back his drugstore job harold russell is sailor who has live with his hooks hands russell was actually nonactor who got picked because director william wyler saw him army short called diary sergeant where harold silently performed his way with how he functioned with his hooks hes actually good bringing his emotions his characterization as when he confronts someone he disagrees with or has show tell his high school sweetheart about his condition so much so that he ended up getting two oscars special one bringing hope courage his fellow veterans through his appearance best supporting actor fact everyone is excellent their roles i especially liked cathy odonnell as homers russells role girlfriend teresa wright as marchs grown daughter who takes shine andrews fact while i still consider its wonderful life my favorite movie im now very glad academy motion picture arts sciences gave this one bp award now that i watched both diary sergeant this ill review rest harold russells acting performances next few days,0.4584217687074829,0.35010018552875705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,A Great Film,"The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.The moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people.
