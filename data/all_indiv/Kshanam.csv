,Kshana Kshanam,"By the time I finally got to watch this, it had become the nouveau critical darling, as well as made some noise at the box-office, and I was a little worried if it was just hype and nothing else. The first 15 minutes/so did not put my mind to rest, with some amateurish acting (not from the lead, but the ones supporting him) and stilted some story-telling. However, and this was pleasant, when the lead character settles down in his role as protector/protagonist, and we're done with 1 of the alternating flashbacks, the I felt the movie found its edge, and stuck with it. While it begins and continues the peeling of (thin) layer-after- layer, there are a few surprises, even for seasoned twist-laden movie-watchers, that are a pleasure to behold, with each actor beginning to get comfortable in the skins of the various characters they are inhabiting. The eponymous title refers to a 'moment' that is revealed only at the end, which is not much of a surprise, but it was kinda funny to listen to the debates of a few audience-members who claimed they did not 'get' it, or not wanting to discuss it, since they come from, and inhabit, a conservative atmosphere. As far as I thought, there was no ambiguity in that whatsoever, and kudos to the team for make it the title of this little flick. The background score is solid, and though there's absolutely no necessity for a foreground score in a flick like this one (which, in my head, moved this from the realm of Indies, firmly into that of mainstream fare), 1 of the foreground songs really stood out, both with its mixing and sound design, not just its composition. The makers wisely resist the temptation to go overboard in action scenes, but do that subtly, with there being absolutely no explanation for our protagonist's skills in that department/area. In spite of that, shootouts are dealt with in a sledgehammer fashion (not being drawn out painfully, the way most mainstream movies are wont to do). Shot composition, throughout, with/without support from the editing, has been stitched together in a very smooth fashion, and the jerky storytelling at the beginning gives way to surer/smoother narration over time. Clarity wise, for most of its running time, the frame contains grains, and I do not know if it was because of poor projection, or the makers wanted that grain in, purposefully, in a time where most low budget movies are going for pristine/clean frames for every shot. Sure that most of the audience didn't notice it, but disappointing that it existed, for any reason at all.Performance-wise, Adivi Sesh, pulling double duties as the writer as well, comes into his own gradually, but has a stock series of expressions that are sometimes (unintentionally) funny to behold, detracting from the seriousness of a few scenes. He has been trying to catch a break as solo hero plus writing talent for a while now, and seems to have hit pay dirt with this one. He has tried breaking into big roles (Dongaata) and doing multiple duties earlier (Karma, which he wrote/directed/acted in, KISS which he wrote/acted in, like this one, with someone else directing....). Adah Sharma, Rajesh, Kishore and Anasuya Bhardwaj all own their characters, and the casting of a few known names in non-typical roles (for them) makes sense, and provides dividends for those in the audience who can appreciate their range. The use of real, local locations, also adds its own set of charms, calling to mind the good (I'm lamenting here, since those works seem to be few and far between nowadays) works of filmmakers like Chandrashekhar Yeleti (Anukokunda Oka Roju) or RGV (Kshana Kshanam, Shiva) or Krishnavamsi (Gulabi), in a nice way. However, one of the main characters, who has a last-minute reveal, did not seem to be characterized consistently in all the scenes he/she was in, and that detracted loudly from what the flick aspired to be, especially since it seemed to take care about all the other characters until the time this one was introduced. To me, it stood out like a sore thumb (of sorts), and I'd blame the writing (mostly, though it could have been taken care of during production as well).I'll be honest - though I enjoyed this one, I did feel that it could have been much, much better than what ultimately ended up in theatrical release. Since Sesh has been growing as a writer though, my fingers are crossed for his next to be even better, and perhaps more polished than this one.",kshana kshanam,by time i finally got watch this it had become nouveau critical darling as well as made some noise at box office i was little worried if it was just hype nothing else first 15 minutes so did not put my mind rest with some amateurish acting not lead but ones supporting him stilted some story telling however this was pleasant when lead character settles down his role as protector protagonist were done with 1 alternating flashbacks i felt movie found its edge stuck with it while it begins continues peeling thin layer after layer there are few surprises even seasoned twist laden movie watchers that are pleasure behold with each actor beginning get comfortable skins various characters they are inhabiting eponymous title refers moment that is revealed only at end which is not much surprise but it was kinda funny listen debates few audience members who claimed they did not get it or not wanting discuss it since they come inhabit conservative atmosphere as far as i thought there was no ambiguity that whatsoever kudos team make it title this little flick background score is solid though theres absolutely no necessity foreground score flick like this one which my head moved this realm indies firmly into that mainstream fare 1 foreground songs really stood out both with its mixing sound design not just its composition makers wisely resist temptation go overboard action scenes but do that subtly with there being absolutely no explanation our protagonists skills that department area spite that shootouts are dealt with sledgehammer fashion not being drawn out painfully way most mainstream movies are wont do shot composition throughout with without support editing has been stitched together very smooth fashion jerky storytelling at beginning gives way surer smoother narration over time clarity wise most its running time frame contains grains i do not know if it was because poor projection or makers wanted that grain purposefully time where most low budget movies are going pristine clean frames every shot sure that most audience didnt notice it but disappointing that it existed any reason at all performance wise adivi sesh pulling double duties as writer as well comes into his own gradually but has stock series expressions that are sometimes unintentionally funny behold detracting seriousness few scenes he has been trying catch break as solo hero plus writing talent while now seems have hit pay dirt with this one he has tried breaking into big roles dongaata doing multiple duties earlier karma which he wrote directed acted kiss which he wrote acted like this one with someone else directing adah sharma rajesh kishore anasuya bhardwaj all own their characters casting few known names non typical roles them makes sense provides dividends those audience who can appreciate their range use real local locations also adds its own set charms calling mind good im lamenting here since those works seem be few far between nowadays works filmmakers like chandrashekhar yeleti anukokunda oka roju or rgv kshana kshanam shiva or krishnavamsi gulabi nice way however one main characters who has last minute reveal did not seem be characterized consistently all scenes he she was that detracted loudly what flick aspired be especially since it seemed take care about all other characters until time this one was introduced me it stood out like sore thumb sorts id blame writing mostly though it could have been taken care during production as well ill be honest though i enjoyed this one i did feel that it could have been much much better than what ultimately ended up theatrical release since sesh has been growing as writer though my fingers are crossed his next be even better perhaps more polished than this one,0.5486861861861863,0.1328528528528528,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,Brilliant,"Very rarely does a movie hook you from the first scene and this is one such gem. And it makes even more fun that i watched this by fluke looking at the interesting title, even though it had unknown cast and a so-called low-budget. But as we have seen often, the finest movies have come from little known small budget movies. Also rare is the genre of true suspense without distraction of garish masala and Kshanam fits this bill of a real suspense thriller. No meaningless songs or comedy track etc to play to the gallery. Again, another rare for a telugu movie.Guy living in US gets called by his ex-Girlfriend for urgent help. Landing in India, he finds himself in middle of inexplicable happenings while trying to help solve her problem. Saying another more will spoil the fun of watching. So, check it out.The Script and screenplay are the super strengths of the movie. Hardly any dull moment, clever use of flashbacks and revealing just enough at the right time, keeping one step ahead of the viewer in the guessing game of what is really going on. And acting from the new faces is excellent, matching the script. Also, the background score is wisely subdued. Overall, a must watch movie.

10.0,"""A film which has all ingredients for a thriller movie making it a must watch film for everyone""","""A film which has all ingredients for a thriller movie making it a must watch film for everyone""My rating- 5/5 (one of the best edge of the seat thriller)Positives-1.)Direction,script and story- Outstanding direction. Movie becomes a variety thriller only because of Ravikanths direction. He fuses flashback in present scenes at right places making it a non linear film. I don't know if its a directors idea or scriptwriters idea but the mixing was one of the main thing i found it as amazing in this thriller film which made us excited at certain scenes. Story was an ordinary one and it comes to the point nearing to end. In start and middle the movie was slightly lagging with clichéd scenes but that doesn't matter much because of direction and script. Script was superb and as i said before fusing of flashback in present was excellent idea in narration. I have seen the fusing in many films but in this one it had uniqueness maybe because of the outstanding direction. It had many dialogues which were apt to the story and it also helped in thrilling scenes.2.) Adivi,adah and anusuya- Adivi as main character nailed it with his noticing acting skills. His acting was apt and no faults in it. Next is adah the female main character was also superb. All emotions as a mother and girlfriend was rightly portrayed. Anusuya was good and rest of the cast was also good.3.) Bgscore- Bgscore was excellent and suited well especially in thrilling scenes and emotional scenes. It was also variety one and it succeeded in giving us feel to the movie. 4.)Cinematography5.)Suspense and twistsNegatives- (nothing)Is it a must watch movie? YesOverall- This movie deserves 5/5 because it has all the ingredients for it. Its surely a must watch movie. I am sad that only Telugu audience will be watching it but I recommend that it requires a remake so that many people will notice it. I hope it gets remaked. In short I loved it.

9.0,What does the title implies?,"It's a great movie, but why titled ""Kshanam""? Does it mean, the protagonist Rishi and Swetha's mistake in that weak moment (Kshanam) gave birth to Riya and that leads the story?The script is neatly tailored, efficient screenplay and great performances. I appreciate casting. But I don't understand the title and a few flaws. Why did they name it ""Kshanam""? The couple made a great mistake right before they break up ignoring what might happen in future. And another mistake by Swetha was not saying she is his daughter when she called him back to find her.Had Swetha tell the protagonist that Riya is his daughter, there won't be a question of disbelief about her health condition and say she is lying about the existence of Riya. What stopped her to tell him the truth? Also, if Karthik really wants to torture Swetha there are other chances rather than killing the little baby. And many of those chances are legal.",what does title implies,its great movie but why titled kshanam does it mean protagonist rishi swethas mistake that weak moment kshanam gave birth riya that leads story script is neatly tailored efficient screenplay great performances i appreciate casting but i dont understand title few flaws why did they name it kshanam couple made great mistake right before they break up ignoring what might happen future another mistake by swetha was not saying she is his daughter when she called him back find her had swetha tell protagonist that riya is his daughter there wont be question disbelief about her health condition say she is lying about existence riya what stopped her tell him truth also if karthik really wants torture swetha there are other chances rather than killing little baby many those chances are legal,0.4284438775510204,0.17040816326530614,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
7.0,An instantly believable thriller nicely blended with emotional quotient. An Adivi Sesh trademark!,"Kshanam (2016) : Brief Review -An instantly believable thriller nicely blended with emotional quotient. An Adivi Sesh trademark! Kshnam has been remade in 3 languages so far and watching the original after like 5 years Post its release was meant to take away a bit of impact. Generally, this doesn't happen to me because i have seen many original films after watching the remade versions but with this film it was bit different. I remember watching Baaghi 2 FDFS and was blown away by such a good storyline in highly commercial action-packed bollywood film. Then, i learnt that it was a remake of Kshanam so of course the credit is due here. Kshanam is not out an out action film but that's why it is very reliable and believable. Rishi, a non-resident Indian, returns to India to help his ex-lover find her kidnapped daughter. The deeper he goes into the search, the more secrets and mess is found waiting for him. The film has a runtime of around 2 hours but those thrilling moments actually appear only in last 30 minutes. It has few twists in the first half but that too just before the interval point. This dragging before real thrills has hurt the film. It can be said that the drags or should i say ordinary scenes have been used intentionally just to provide enough anticipation for those unpredictable twists in the end but still in repeat viewing who cares about it? Excluding this one fault Kshanam doesn't go wrong anywhere. It keeps you on edge of your seats and has enough wow elements to surprise you. Adivi Sesh and Anasuya Bharadwaj are fantastic in their roles whereas Adah Sharma looks gorgeous in every scene. Ravikanth Perepu keeps the film simple and close to reality rather than going for unrealistic mass elements like action and explosion. Overall, a Solid Mysterios ride.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",instantly believable thriller nicely blended with emotional quotient adivi sesh trademark,kshanam 2016 brief review instantly believable thriller nicely blended with emotional quotient adivi sesh trademark kshnam has been remade 3 languages so far watching original after like 5 years post its release was meant take away bit impact generally this doesnt happen me because i have seen many original films after watching remade versions but with this film it was bit different i remember watching baaghi 2 fdfs was blown away by such good storyline highly commercial action packed bollywood film then i learnt that it was remake kshanam so course credit is due here kshanam is not out out action film but thats why it is very reliable believable rishi non resident indian returns india help his ex lover find her kidnapped daughter deeper he goes into search more secrets mess is found waiting him film has runtime around 2 hours but those thrilling moments actually appear only last 30 minutes it has few twists first half but that too just before interval point this dragging before real thrills has hurt film it can be said that drags or should i say ordinary scenes have been used intentionally just provide enough anticipation those unpredictable twists end but still repeat viewing who cares about it excluding this one fault kshanam doesnt go wrong anywhere it keeps you edge your seats has enough wow elements surprise you adivi sesh anasuya bharadwaj are fantastic their roles whereas adah sharma looks gorgeous every scene ravikanth perepu keeps film simple close reality rather than going unrealistic mass elements like action explosion overall solid mysterios ride rating 7 5 10 by,0.5160714285714285,0.12765151515151513,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.26}"
