10.0,One of the most successful movies of all time (and I'm not talking about the Box Office take),"What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the ""prequel"" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly ""sell out,"" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most ""princess"" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi ""storm troopers."" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.",one most successful movies all time im not talking about box office take,what made this hugely successful triumph it was was it casting music imagination ingenuity or luck i remember opening day at theaters i was old enough remember every scene every character every nuance this film having committed it memory forever as if i would never again be able see this beloved instantly loved masterpiece i also remember that hit factor this movie was so unexpected that you had wait literal months get action figures promised cereal boxes pieces were still manufacturing process we had settle coupons promising our toys few months i wound up seeing this theaters grand total 36 times much my mothers dismay she loved movie as i did but felt i was obsessed today thirty years later sitting here writing this review i realize how right she was im still obsessed with this movie with subsequent movies which followed i wait great anticipation episode 3 im fan i dont care what other people say about episodes 1 2 i dont even mind prequel factor as situation at time dictated lucas which movies he would do first see i remember studios saying him that he had choose three central climactic books trash rest or just trash whole idea he didnt exactly sell out he did what he had do get his movie his vision out there us see experience i admired his decision then i admire it now episodes 1 3 are being filmed now because lucas had clout money patience give us his vision his complete vision not just three center books 9 book series i realize that now there are dozens books but at time there were nine while most us were happy with episodes 4 6 would not have missed 1 3 7 9 i personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself give us his full vision i have enjoyed each every installment with same sense awe joy as i did this one casting was first triumph this cinematic milestone ford is charismatic magnetic personality portrayed han with professionalism that youd expect more seasoned actors sir alec guiness is absolute joy as obi wan his casting was precise excellent that part carrie fisher portrayed leia way that up until then had never been experienced most princess types before her were whining whimpering little snots who were incapable anything beyond tripping twisting their ankle times peril while fisher portrayed her character as bold brazen yet sophisticated educated woman who was aware her surroundings capable defending herself her realm with utmost authority mark hamil he was perfectly cast as whining little boy who wanted more but was afraid reach it he grows up quite well film these three installments endears himself audience so much more it but cast member who is almost always left out these reviews is peter mayhew chewbacca his character as supporting character hans was exemplary its not easy portraying walking carpet yet holding attention admiration love virtual millions i am very happy about his being cast as chewy episode 3 couldnt happen more deserving or capable fellow bravo james earl joness voice being used as voice darth vader was pure genius his commanding voice haunted dreams countless thousands star struck children generations come i also have say that this movie would not have had charm it does had it not been anthony daniels c3p0 he is gift joy musical score by john williams featured this masterpiece was one contributing factors but honestly this movies success was such total surprise everyone including lucas that nothing could prepare world aftermath having witnessed this bona fide legend first hand story itself replete with sub plot after sub plot rich dialog detail was beyond anyones greatest expectations everyone including lucas expected this movie fail it is timeless classic which i will not repeat here there are too many movie reviews giving full details plot i wont be redundant beyond what i have already said however that being said there are few points i would like make concerning symbolism this endeavor force is metaphor psychic abilities with which we are all born it was also metaphor hope faith dedication commitment greater state being empire is said have been metaphor germanic nazi storm troopers while rebellion is said have been symbolic what would later become nato forces who defeated them then there are effects effects were 1977 so awesome so creative so ahead their time as ensure this movies vast success next forty years george lucas enjoys almost god like status among sci fi fantasy fans worldwide this movie does not rate rating usually when i say that it is because movie is so bad or disappointing that i dont have heart rate it but this case it far surpasses any 10 10 rating i could give it fiend,0.5325689223057642,0.2569298245614036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,"A classics, phenomenal and arguably the best sci-fi flick masterpiece!","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P.

10.0,A milestone in film-making- a superlative sci-fi movie,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",milestone film making superlative sci fi movie,i couldnt have asked anything more star wars new hope had it all if i had sum it up one word superlative would be my answer i saw film first time three months ago loved it since then i have watched all star wars movies i was disappointed with prequels attack clones was my least favourite but this return jedi empire strikes back were perfection i have say that film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years with highly imaginative sets dazzling special effects action sequences were superbly choreographed brisk death star climax was knockout music by john williams is absolutely outstanding by far one his more exciting rousing scores story is fast paced intelligent has essence sophistication screenplay is sharp decisive performances were flawless prequels i had problems relating some performers namely hayden christensen as anakin here all actors played their parts with superlative skill alec guiness one fine actor will be sorely missed was standout likewise with peter cushing harrison ford hilarious here carrie fisher was fine princess leia spunky beautiful sexy mark hamill was completely likable luke villain darth vader without doubt one best depth villains cinematic history james earl joness deep booming voice was perfect character all all definite sci fi classic that blew me away 10 10 bethany cox,0.6363931523022432,0.38086383313656036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times","Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time.

10.0,"The Force will be with you, always.","""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""Pre review:Its writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...Review:Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray."" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human,

,The original version was brilliant...,"I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.",original version was brilliant,i was actually born about year after this film first premiered but being member family that was first block get such things as vcr proper hi fi system allowed me catch this film number different formats years ranging 1982 1997 i think it is safe say that without this film i would have had no idea how truly evil thing pan scan is or why multi channel audio is such damned important thing have home theatre environment course i also knew that film wasnt perfect i could see number small problems where lucas budget just didnt quite go far enough or where there just wasnt enough time accomplish what was wanted so when announcement was made that 1997 each film would be presented with improved special effects footage that could not be integrated original cut reasons budget or practicality i was excited most part i was overjoyed see new footage or effects mos eisley now looks like real city or port commerce without viewers sense disbelief at seemingly deserted streets needing be suspended flight x wings towards death star its original form was very good marvel its time but when george finally got show it way he wanted it was almost equivalent watching helicopters apocalypse now decimating village tune ride valkyries wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made battle look almost as if it really happened lucas was just there take pictures jabba well he doesnt look all that real granted but it was just nice have that one piece footage order make appearance boba fett episode v entire prologue episode vi make bit more sense especially dullards unfortunately there are number times when lucas just goes too far his quest improve his work sometimes you can only do so much anything before it starts look overdone course i am talking about scene between han greedo cantina original version we are led believe han is scoundrel who only cares about himself giving us one best character arcs whole trilogy it is also great tribute sergio leone nice reference when tuco shoots potential assassin his bathtub tells corpse when you have shoot shoot dont talk modifying this scene so it looks like greedo shot first is insult few levels it insults greedo as character making him look like one most incompetent bounty hunters galaxy it insults audience who even at age six should no that youd have be blind drunk brain damaged or all three miss that distance lastly it insults character han solo by destroying vital piece said character arc watching han go scum leader men space age version king aragorn even was one best things about original star wars trilogy story itself is stuff classics that it shows most unlikely heroes doing things that everyone else claims be impossible what lucas got right terms pacing plot here is exactly where he went wrong prequels that he makes jump location location seem important plot totally natural rather than forced choppy story sense adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than inside space ship overall original star wars rates eight out ten if lucas had applied some common sense conjunction with his rampant desire revisionism i would give it ten but as one critic who is famous his negativity once said about episode ii when was last time anyone told george lucas no still this is classic that should be shown future generations as example how imagination enough literacy realise it will open doors you when nothing else will,0.5660496499385389,0.13891013307679975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,Where It All Began-----10/10,"I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10",where it all began 10 10,i can never pick favorite movie because different movies have different effects goodfellas is my favorite drama face off is my favorite actioner but when it comes pure amazement nothing beats star wars we are introduced whole other universe with different creatures different lifestyles different history we are dropped middle intergalactic war between empire rebellion that has raged years left universe ruin it was most fascinating thing see when i was eleven but this day i am still star wars nerd cast characters includes some coolest funniest most tragic film actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe alec guiness is flawless as obi wan kenobi jedi run evil empire harrison ford is awesome as han solo smuggler thief who helps gang rescue princess but my favorite character all time is darth vader not only is he coolest bad guy but we learn later films why he is evil start feel sympathetic him not mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering pizza sound threatening this was not only beginning best movie series ever but it was beginning my love movies george lucas is genius being able come up with great story incredible backdrop what was supposed be flop but turned into one best films ever 10 10,0.6189792663476874,0.225674982911825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.,"Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.",greatest cinematic epic all time begins here,here begins greatest cinematic epic all time arguably one greatest stories ever told originally conceived as serialized popcorn movie manner old action movies that lucas grew up with star wars surpassed even georges keen bombastic imagination become central part movie history there are countless tales making this movie how lucas never believed he would get chance complete series how it spawned industry made name nearly everyone who touched it household word but what that does not reveal nor do much diminished prequels is sheer joy excitement these movies generated it was once lifetime experience you could feel it opening day earlier if you paid attention such things we had never seen anything like it we are not likely again this episode finds young luke skywalker yearning leave agrarian life he has with his aunt uncle chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done what adventure there is galaxy is grip massive rebellion against tyrannical oppressive empire but lukes home planet its something you only dare speak whisper along come two robots droids short who inadvertently involve luke stellar attempt contact old wizard named ben kenobi who lives caves near lukes home rest is history there isnt person alive civilized world who doesnt have at least some awareness epic story that unfolds lukes rise adolescent obscurity tatooine leading role greatest struggle all time is told with humor action adventure always sense story that is unmatched screen or page with completion prequel trilogy these films are enjoying renewed popularity among generation that never saw films big screen theatric revivals are almost guaranteed go get some popcorn may force be with you,0.49714285714285733,0.2121428571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9.0,A long time ago in a decade without CGI...,"When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him.",long time ago decade without cgi,when i first watched this cinema i was ten it was 1977 id never seen anything like it it had me gripped start when small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed take ages pass over viewer unlike recent prequels scenes such as this werent cluttered with excessive cgi activity but instead showed what was needed way that hadnt been seen before special effects used throughout film were ground breaking time still look great this day there is something more real looking about models used when compared todays cgi main character are all interesting likable acting was all pretty good both veteran actors like alec guinness peter cushing who brought suitable gravitas film younger actors harrison ford mark hamill carrie fisher who brought sense youthful energy unlikely event that somebody doesnt know what film is about ill give brief synopsis set distant galaxy forces evil galactic empire are hunting down rebels who are attempting restore old republic they are about capture rebel ship which has stolen plans empires latest weapon death star when they are hidden small robot droid by name r2 d2 by princess leah he escapes one ships escape pods along with his companion c3po they escape desert world tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called jawas who sell pair farmer who gets his nephew luke clean them while doing so he stumbles across holographic message addressed one obi wan kenobi while luke is off having his dinner r2 d2 escapes seeking obi wan next day luke sets off find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by sand people who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by robed figure who turns out be obi wan he explains luke that he was once jedi knight friend his late father who had been killed by another jedi called darth vader who had turned dark side force they also see full message that r2 is carrying which requests that obi wan takes r2 planet alderaan get plans rebels while this is happening vader who is ship searching plans dispatches troops search two missing droids by time luke returns home it is too late place is burn out ruin his aunt uncle are dead he decides that he will join obi wan his mission alderaan they hire ship called millennium falcon smuggler called han solo who needs money pay off debt avoid various bounty hunter who are after him when they arrive at alderaan they find it is no longer there it has fact been destroyed by death star attempt get princess leah tell them where rebels are based soon after arriving millennium falcon is captured after it goes investigate small moon that turns out be death star while obi wan is off trying disable tractor beam that captured them han luke discover that princess leah is being held detention area set off rescue her i wont say any more as i dont want spoil ending i think this is film every body should see at least once it might not be perfect but if it wasnt this recent cinematic history would be quite different it kick started revival science fiction that lead things like battlestar galactica return star trek alien was possibly first block buster film many ways it was more than just film it was event everybody at my school was talking about it little else till one watched it you were completely out loop characters there adventures this other films franchise have become part modern folklore these comments were made based video released 80s so no extra cgi greedo didnt even attempt fire before han killed him,0.39855859010270767,0.025819911297852476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,In A Galaxy Far Away................A Franchise Was Born,"The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations.

10.0,"In 1977, in a galaxy far, far away...","This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice ""scoundrel""), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece.

10.0,From the Lucasian Chair of Entertainment - a masterpiece,"I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed.

10.0,"""May the Force be with you.""","I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie.

10.0,"A Long, Long Wait For A Movie Far, Far Away","This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher: ""When's 'Star Wars' coming round here?"" to which he replied: ""It'll be some time I expect."". His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. ""I have seen 'Star Wars'"", I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster.",long long wait movie far far away,this is not review first best star wars movie i take it fellow i m d b users that you are already familiar with plot characters production history how its success changed face cinema overnight so rather than rehash all known facts i want instead recount personal memory i first learnt star wars thanks granadas krypton factor long running game show designed test contestants intelligence physical fitness powers observation so i liked latter round as it often gave one chance catch sneak preview new movie one week they ran clip han solo luke skywalker r2d2 c2po escaping death star millennium falcon being shot at by pursuing t i e fighters i fell off my chair what was this 1970s sci fi movies were mostly depressing affairs predicting gloomy futures mankind now here was something fast colourful lively with lasers zapping about outer space explosions right up my street i had see it but film was not yet release here there was no internet then so i got my movie information local paper i kept checking news impending screening at my local cinema but no there was nothing i began wonder if movie actually existed or not had granada pulled off greatest hoax all time i read sphere book voraciously until i knew story backwards i played meco disco single at every opportunity when marvels comic adaptation went sale i was almost thrown out newsagent jumping up down sheer joy at my school star wars was dirty word sci fi fans mainly because it was not close encounters spielberg picture was regarded as adult intelligent while lucas movie was deemed kiddie stuff starring weirdos fancy dress running around with bloke dressed as big teddy bear wait dragged episode coronation street gail helen worth asked her then boyfriend steve fisher whens star wars coming round here which he replied itll be some time i expect his words encapsulated sheer frustration impatience felt by all us u k fans highest grossing film all time we cant see it what is hold up are they redoing bits benefit british audiences peter cushing alec guinness are it so this cannot be right desperation i told blatant lie my best friend i have seen star wars i proclaimed he looked about as shocked as if id said id spent night with carrie fisher i claimed that my uncle eric worked twentieth century fox another lie he drove taxi cabs living as assistant editor george lucas had been so impressed with his work film he had generously given him print back up my claim i reeled off long list plot details scene descriptions i got few things wrong such as jabba hut biggs darklighter both whom were excised final cut but by time my friend saw film he had forgotten these he did beg me ask my uncle run film specially him sunday afternoon but i deflected this by stating that uncle erics projector had broken down he never asked again being about fifteen i was too old toys hence christmas day 1977 i was denied pleasure reenacting assault death star my garden shed with aid elastic bands old subbuteo figures john williams soundtrack thumping out my hitachi tape recorder after what felt like eternity movie finally opened here suddenly it became fashionable denounce it as overrated it was childish when they were playing trumpets cantina was my best friends verdict that was all he had say subject he would have made great film critic many people felt that film had not been worth six month wait i was one few speak its defence i was glad that sci fi movies were fun again nobody left theatre with spring their step after seeing milo baby chimps parents brutally murdered by u s government at end escape planet apes star wars spawned two sequels neither as good inspired likes alien black hole star trek motion picture countless others without lucas these would simply not have been made i am not big fan prequels but then im not young anymore so cant enjoy that kind movie same way star wars brought new hope those us wanting old fashioned escapism silver screen again i envy kids today not having wait until winter latest summer blockbuster,0.4432818834604549,0.10819590462447601,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Just plain fun!,"Star Wars seems to lack the sense of importance that all of the sequels and prequels had. This one just seeks to entertain, and there's nothing wrong with that! Star Wars is one of those miracle movies (a term borrowed from Leonard Maltin) where everything went wrong but it all came together in the end, like Jaws and The Wizard of Oz. The movie was plagued by budget problems, and Lucas was so behind schedule he suffered a few panic attacks, which is probably why he did not direct the sequels. Star Wars takes the audience on a series of adventures, from encountering sand people in the desert to rescuing a princess on a space station. The special effects and production design is amazing. It takes you into a whole new galaxy and makes you believe it's real. I liked how everything looked old and dirty; prior to Star Wars everything in Sci-fi movies looked brand new. John William's Star Wars score adds a whole new element of fun and is arguably the best work of his career. I can't imagine what Star Wars would be like without his music.The main characters are all familiar archetypes. Luke is the restless, immature boy who wants to get off the farm and have an adventure. Han Solo is the rugged pirate who only cares for himself. Harrison Ford really steals every scene he's in with his wise guy attitude. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the Sorcerer/Mentor stereotype, like Merlin. Alec Guinness brings a certain classiness to the role, even though this is not even close to his best performance. His final lightsaber battle is slow and boring due to the limitations of the weak lightsabers (David Prowse kept breaking them!) and his old age, but he delivers his verbal quips quite nicely, as does James Earl Jones. The scene where he dies is still very powerful; I love how Vader steps on his empty robe, it's like he's thinking ""hey, where are you hiding?"" Carrie Fisher plays the kidnapped princess; her performance is tougher and feistier in this movie. She loses those qualities to a certain extent in the following movies.Hammer Horror film veteran Peter Cushing played the sinister Imperial Officer, Grand Moff Tarkin. It's amazing how Cushing was able to slip into the role of the villain so easily (he certainly looks evil), considering the fact he was most famous for playing protagonists like Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein. I cannot give enough praise to James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, one of the greatest villains of all time. Some of the dialog is embarrassing but the cast was able to bring the characters alive. That is the most important difference between the originals and the prequels. These characters were not complex in any way, but they had good chemistry with each other. The prequel's characters felt like cardboard. I used to think this was the most boring Star Wars film, and I just don't understand why anymore. I've noticed this film gets criticized for bad pacing, and I could not disagree more. Star Wars has the best pacing of the original trilogy. Empire's plot stopped moving in the middle of the movie, and the first 35-40 minutes of Jedi were a total pit stop. Star Wars on the other hand smoothly builds up to the final climax at the Death Star, without any long story lags. The Battle of Yavin has been criticized for being too long (by Alec Guinness and Roger Ebert), but I don't mind. The Death Star's destruction is an exhilarating moment. Star Wars is also the funniest movie in the series. The bickering between the three heroes on the Death Star is hilarious.In 2004 the Star Wars movies were revised yet again for the DVD release. I have to say I'm disappointed with how the original trilogy has been treated by Lucas. He seems to support film preservation in every case, except when it comes to his own movies. To me, replacing actors and revising special effects is just as bad as colorizing a black and white movie. It eliminates all of the historical significance. I hope one day the original trilogy will receive better treatment in the future. I would recommend buying the original trilogy on DVD now while you still can. It might not be released again, but with Lucas you can never tell.",just plain fun,star wars seems lack sense importance that all sequels prequels had this one just seeks entertain theres nothing wrong with that star wars is one those miracle movies term borrowed leonard maltin where everything went wrong but it all came together end like jaws wizard oz movie was plagued by budget problems lucas was so behind schedule he suffered few panic attacks which is probably why he did not direct sequels star wars takes audience series adventures encountering sand people desert rescuing princess space station special effects production design is amazing it takes you into whole new galaxy makes you believe its real i liked how everything looked old dirty prior star wars everything sci fi movies looked brand new john williams star wars score adds whole new element fun is arguably best work his career i cant imagine what star wars would be like without his music main characters are all familiar archetypes luke is restless immature boy who wants get off farm have adventure han solo is rugged pirate who only cares himself harrison ford really steals every scene hes with his wise guy attitude obi wan kenobi is sorcerer mentor stereotype like merlin alec guinness brings certain classiness role even though this is not even close his best performance his final lightsaber battle is slow boring due limitations weak lightsabers david prowse kept breaking them his old age but he delivers his verbal quips quite nicely as does james earl jones scene where he dies is still very powerful i love how vader steps his empty robe its like hes thinking hey where are you hiding carrie fisher plays kidnapped princess her performance is tougher feistier this movie she loses those qualities certain extent following movies hammer horror film veteran peter cushing played sinister imperial officer grand moff tarkin its amazing how cushing was able slip into role villain so easily he certainly looks evil considering fact he was most famous playing protagonists like van helsing dr frankenstein i cannot give enough praise james earl jones as voice darth vader one greatest villains all time some dialog is embarrassing but cast was able bring characters alive that is most important difference between originals prequels these characters were not complex any way but they had good chemistry with each other prequels characters felt like cardboard i used think this was most boring star wars film i just dont understand why anymore ive noticed this film gets criticized bad pacing i could not disagree more star wars has best pacing original trilogy empires plot stopped moving middle movie first 35 40 minutes jedi were total pit stop star wars other hand smoothly builds up final climax at death star without any long story lags battle yavin has been criticized being too long by alec guinness roger ebert but i dont mind death stars destruction is exhilarating moment star wars is also funniest movie series bickering between three heroes death star is hilarious 2004 star wars movies were revised yet again dvd release i have say im disappointed with how original trilogy has been treated by lucas he seems support film preservation every case except when it comes his own movies me replacing actors revising special effects is just as bad as colorizing black white movie it eliminates all historical significance i hope one day original trilogy will receive better treatment future i would recommend buying original trilogy dvd now while you still can it might not be released again but with lucas you can never tell,0.5555256296733568,0.1359880460448642,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6.0,A great movie - for its time,"""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.",great movie its time,star wars is 2 hour science fiction movie almost 30 years ago written directed by george lucas there really needs nothing be said about how good this is 1970s movie especially terms technical aspects academy certainly got it right by giving them all these oscars it however it lacks certain other areas unfortunately first all acting isnt too great that is not really problem characters though but rather way they were written which simply offered no room outstanding performances peter cushings character was downright forgettable despite being main antagonist instead people remember darth vader obviously why because this film is all about way characters look not what they do or say bit style over substance apart that i am quite surprised alec guinness scored academy award nomination his turn here script is not greatest achievement general its usual black white characterization with good vs evil characters have no real shades no facets this was made up again by strong work other departments as its not too memorable what they say do but what they look like especially non human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today i am not saying characters are written badly not at all but its just other contributions that made them what they are today not script while i enjoyed most film i cannot see it as epic or cult classic as so many people do this date star wars is bound rise again with new film coming out soon featuring original cast again it should be interesting what they make out it until then feel free watch old films like this one but not too many very first star wars film here is not great achievement terms story only terms all visual audible aspects,0.5288051948051948,0.159512987012987,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",long time ago childhood not too far away,princess leia is captured held hostage by imperial army as it seeks rule galactic empire old jedi knight by name ben obi wan kenobi may just be hers rebels only hope teaming up with farm boy luke skywalker scoundrel captain han solo couple quirky droids kenobi sets off mission that could well shape destiny galaxy all who dwell within it back 1977 i was but wee 11 year old boy weened films all genres by my movie loving parents i had no idea that star wars was have same impact me as jaws had two summers previously where yet again i found myself queueing around block two whole hours see film one screen theatre my love cinema firmly cemented star wars was start love affair that lasts this very day as years have rolled by my love cinema has taken more depth serious tones i have come realise that star wars proves be far flawless picture certainly its detractors do point some frayed acting call plot structure jazzed up good versus evil axis while charge george lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands but really do those things matter no they do not because star wars opened up new world cinema something portal youngsters such as i it got people talking debating about merits model work films which is extraordinary high standard here it nudged film makers explore being bigger bolder their approach crucially above all else it got film goers hungry again hankering more please if you may now it has be said that all that followed 20th century foxs historic blockbuster didnt run with baton fact most pale into comparison impact value but better or worse depending discerning viewers peccadilloes star wars stands as bastion adventure laden entertainment it is by definition one most successful films history george lucas perhaps didnt know it at time but what was become almost operatic anthology he didnt just make movie he created whole new world seeping with style rich texture almost as amazing as success series is how it has become part modern day pop culture anything religion everyday speak has at some time or another referenced lucas baby ultimately though its one single thing that made still does make star wars so great its that it has ability lift audience into rousing united feel good cheer that is something that few films can ever lay claim too 1977 it was awe inspiring event watch theatre now here my middle age its event that is like hugging dear old friend friend that i know will never ever let me down no matter how many times i turn it 10 10,0.46844487963535586,0.18124384433908247,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"

,Classic bit of fun sci-fi  a space western!,"The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices. The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems. The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire. However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star. Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape. When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi. Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation. However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space. The story is simple but contains clear characters. The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front. The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle. The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars! The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer. Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!). He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role. However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas. Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances. Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role. Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'. But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood. Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.",classic bit fun sci fi space western,republic has fallen empire rules galaxy as dictatorship seeking destroy dissenting voices empires ultimate weapon death star is fully line capable destroying whole systems jedi have been destroyed save few living hiding unable compete with force empire however princess leia has plans showing weakness within death star before she is captured by darth vader she gives them droids c3po r2d2 they escape when they land nearby planet they find luke skywalker set out find owner droids obi wan kenobi or old ben kenobi obi wan begins train luke way force as they try get information rebellion before death star can be used at full power its not brilliant piece filmmaking lets be honest lucas isnt shakespeare our generation however what it is is good story good vs evil western goodies v baddies set space story is simple but contains clear characters thing that sets it apart is fun sense wonder kids but also enjoyment it brings adult story is good sci fi with lot history back story clearly set out up front action scenes are mostly great not dry effects but with real sense action excitement too this may be 4th part but its also our first chapter it is light enjoyable but hints that this is only part ongoing battle way it relates kids adults is obvious as it broke records everyone certain age knows about star wars effects still look good today many ways model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are real dont just exist within computer sound effects comedy music its all pitch perfect sets up rest series really well hamil is ok as skywalker blonde hair blue eyes chasing amy he is suitable kids film he does well with his role however like part 1 has anakin at his least interesting part 4 has luke yet develop into darker areas ford is perfect as han solo he adds character flair some dry performances alec guinness adds maturity whole film is so good is obi wan that even ewan mcgregor just does impression rather than recreate role darth vader is just right side silly camp villain jones voice is perfect fit he has real menace power bits players such as chewie c3po r2d2 etc all add comedy spades overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together star wars history but even without all hype this is really fun sci fi that is enjoyable simple really good fun watch if youre mood having deeper perspective it just makes it all better,0.4322255291005291,0.20601851851851855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7.0,A product of its time. A classic,"When Star Wars came out in 1977 there was nothing like it, it came out of nowhere and was so different. It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era. As a film it is very simple and easy to follow. There are no big twists, dilemmas and the good forces come on top. The special effects and film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements. Darth Vader, the army of storm troopers and the mighty light saber is unlikely to be forgotten. Star Wars as a franchise clearly benefited from coming out at the right time, this was the day before competitive television, streaming services or films like Inception. The immortality of Star Wars lies in its simplicity, linear story and vast imagination. This appealed to millions of kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series.",product its time classic,when star wars came out 1977 there was nothing like it it came out nowhere was so different it is indeed product its time would have fascinated many kids era as film it is very simple easy follow there are no big twists dilemmas good forces come top special effects film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements darth vader army storm troopers mighty light saber is unlikely be forgotten star wars as franchise clearly benefited coming out at right time this was day before competitive television streaming services or films like inception immortality star wars lies its simplicity linear story vast imagination this appealed millions kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series,0.5400793650793653,0.2283068783068783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,The classic...,"Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it.",classic,having grown up with star wars trilogy then star wars episode iv new hope is classic every sense word this is epic story good vs evil light vs dark but it is also story heroism bravery adventure i am fan boy yes but what is there not love about star wars george lucas really managed piece together timeless classic that stands its own even today even with effects 1977 it was light years ahead its time no pun intended effects stand their ground even by todays standards there is something uniquely amazing about atmosphere feel star wars universe it doesnt require much be swept away carried along galaxy far far away cast star wars episode iv new hope did good memorable job with their individual roles characters with this movie george lucas established some characters that instantly became well known well loved star wars episode iv new hope is movie high space adventure with vibrant characters creatures spaceships it is enjoyable movie entire family space nerds or not if you are not already familiar with legendary star wars episode iv new hope movie then it is more than due time get it,0.5744903581267219,0.22794306703397615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.51}"
