,Still Has Its Magic,"Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", and the rest of this fine production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.",still has its magic,judy garlands portrayal dorothy dorothys oddball oz friends somewhere over rainbow rest this fine production wizard oz have lost little their magic over years while it has become oddly fashionable recent years deride this kind classic innocent fantasy movie itself has aged very well it is likely retain appreciative audience some time come theres no doubt that part appeal story characters comes them being such old friends so many cinema fans but there are also good reasons why they have endured so long have been able hold up even after becoming so familiar although dorothy is not particularly complex character she represents innocent but deep yearning that is easy identify with likewise oz characters are bizarre enough remain interesting but there is core substance that again is easy believe who does not feel that he or she could use at least one things that dorothys friends want adaptation original story is done quite well making fine choices characters episodes that would work film settings visual effects may not impress devotees todays computer imagery but their time they certainly demonstrated great deal skill planning even now their own way they are more believable than are most computer tricks that have become so overused popular story has also been used number more recent adaptations some them have had some good points their own but this wizard remains by far most wonderful versions classic tale,0.5874255952380952,0.3290302579365079,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Timeless classic still entertaining the masses as each new generation comes in.,"Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.The Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.There are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie.

,A fantasy rooted in the landscape of your childhood.,"I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children. The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds. Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.",fantasy rooted landscape your childhood,i have theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any

10.0,My childhood favourite!,"I am 16, and I still love this movie. I grew up watching this, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Meet Me in Saint Louis, and I never tire of them. Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy, bringing a sense of vulnerability and sadness to the role, making Over The Rainbow more poignant than it already was. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are really entertaining as her three friends. Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins were great fun too. The wicked witch of the west scared the life out of me here and still does, and even Frank Morgan does 5 roles to great comical effect. The songs are just fabulous, and so is the cinematography and the stunning scenery. True, the film isn't completely faithful to the book, but why does it have to be? If I had one minor drawback, it would be the singing voice of the Lion, but apart from that, this movie is a must-see! 10/10.

10.0,Finding Her Way Back Home -- To Our Hearts.,"Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time, whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity, who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepia-tones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now, as it had did back then. In my world, this is an utterly, fantastic film.And what is Oz, by the way? Well, from a little girl (and the child in all of us), it's that place where our imagination runs wild, where everything is perfect, where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It's that place where we feel we will belong, and who as a child didn't feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word 'place' because this is so much about placement, places, our place and therefore, our own self-expression, our own sense of self. Who hasn't wanted to ""seek a place of one's own' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from, stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly, there is no place like home.Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years, when unemployment was at an all time high, it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm, but then throwing a parent-less girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character, the same way, the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl, and having Judy Garland -- not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one -- play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen, fresh-faced, innocent and vulnerable: she is Dorothy, and we can't imagine anyone else, not even nearly 70 years later.And speaking of casting, it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy's friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream, it's more than logical: many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams -- it's even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they, but Dorothy most of all, lacks -- courage, love, and wisdom -- makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story, so when they grow as characters, so do we, and of course, so does Dorothy.THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it's all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment.",finding her way back home our hearts,even with advance special effects there will never be movie as honest as true its heart as wizard oz with exception lord rings trilogy but since latter is too new it cant be compared former everyone at one point their lives especially as children has seen this film has experienced emotions that dorothy experienced terror entering wicked witchs lair her transition little girl wise young woman this incredible world that l frank baum created hollywood perfected what makes great movie experience that you are watching it very first time whether you were seven years old or adult living adult world this film is one those even when as adult i can see some cracks peeking through some lapses continuity who cares tornado ripping through cornfields is as real as real ones i have seen even though is was really muslin moment that sepia tones kansas segment peel away dorothy opens door her house i saw bright colors oz i knew i was there story had enveloped me now as it had did back then my world this is utterly fantastic film what is oz by way well little girl child all us its that place where our imagination runs wild where everything is perfect where there is no tomorrow yellow brick road will take us that perfect place filled with song its that place where we feel we will belong who as child didnt feel like we were out place notice i repeat word place because this is so much about placement places our place therefore our own self expression our own sense self who hasnt wanted seek place ones own where light love prevailed only return back where we came stronger wiser its message is so universal truly there is no place like home timing is crucial symbolic success this movie as well still middle depression years when unemployment was at all time high it focuses not just harshness keeping farm but then throwing parent less girl into strange land who finds foster mother sorts who would tell her that way back home would not be easy one glinda good represents this character same way wicked witch west represents darker forces that watch her every move aggressively try trip her up this is quite lot shoulders little girl having judy garland not yet major star but just brink becoming one play dorothy gale has become casting history 1939 she was about seventeen fresh faced innocent vulnerable she is dorothy we cant imagine anyone else not even nearly 70 years later speaking casting it was genius have actors playing dorothys friends enemies kansas also show up oz since movie is so much like dream its more than logical many people our lives sometimes show up dreams its even books about dreams that they also represent that which not only they but dorothy most all lacks courage love wisdom makes their appearances even more intrinsic story so when they grow as characters so do we course so does dorothy wizard oz is timeless so simple so honest but so deep its messages about love self discovery all actors including veteran billie burke would be remembered most their roles here more than any other movie set direction is made look as close storybook all that is missing are page frames there isnt false move here all those back stories well their okay read but cinema lover looking magic its all here about two hours pure entertainment,0.49508062770562766,0.2566807359307359,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,A true cinematic milestone,"Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number ""Over the Rainbow"" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes.

,a milestone,"People talk about The Wizard of Oz as a backdrop to their lives; and how true that is. I just saw it again, DVD, for the first time in--gosh!--20 years. There was a little art house in Lansing Michigan USA that ran it back then, on the popular premise that there's nothing like TWoO on ""the big screen."" That's the last time I'd seen it, 'til today.I guess the part that ""gets"" me about the movie is how the writers made it pretty plain that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion really already had what they thought they were missing; that their respective problems were in misapprehending their own complete natures. That's a powerful statement for many of us. I found myself most touched in scenes where the Scarecrow was showing wisdom, the Tin Man feeling deeply (""...when I think of Dorothy in that awful place...""), and the Lion...well, maybe accomplishing this effect was harder in his case...what *is* true courage?Anyway, if you're reading this here, you must be a movie weenie, and you've no doubt already seen the movie, so I'm not going to recite the usual ""go see this movie"" mantra.I was just very touching to see this movie again, at this phase in my life.I will mention a few more things about how I now see this movie as a ""growed up"" (I'm almost 50): It's interesting how you can see the production values of the time; the lot sets and special effects and so forth. This movie is a powerful example of how a good story overcomes limited means in other areas.People who look back with disdain on the low-tech chintz of old movies can see in TWoO the magic ingredient; narrative solidity. And I'm not a pollyanna about this: I'm sure the underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories of expert disagreement, rewrites, discarding, jerryrigging, and the rest of it. But in the end, something like narrative love won out; and that's the important thing.Oh: And having Harold Arlen write the music was good luck indeed. And orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas in composition (polymodalism, non-standard phrasings, etc.) didn't hurt, either!Geez, this movie is such a little universe....I'd better stop here.",milestone,people talk about wizard oz as backdrop their lives how true that is i just saw it again dvd first time gosh 20 years there was little art house lansing michigan usa that ran it back then popular premise that theres nothing like twoo big screen thats last time id seen it til today i guess part that gets me about movie is how writers made it pretty plain that scarecrow tin man cowardly lion really already had what they thought they were missing that their respective problems were misapprehending their own complete natures thats powerful statement many us i found myself most touched scenes where scarecrow was showing wisdom tin man feeling deeply when i think dorothy that awful place lion well maybe accomplishing this effect was harder his case what is true courage anyway if youre reading this here you must be movie weenie youve no doubt already seen movie so im not going recite usual go see this movie mantra i was just very touching see this movie again at this phase my life i will mention few more things about how i now see this movie as growed up im almost 50 its interesting how you can see production values time lot sets special effects so forth this movie is powerful example how good story overcomes limited means other areas people who look back with disdain low tech chintz old movies can see twoo magic ingredient narrative solidity im not pollyanna about this im sure underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories expert disagreement rewrites discarding jerryrigging rest it but end something like narrative love won out thats important thing oh having harold arlen write music was good luck indeed orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas composition polymodalism non standard phrasings etc didnt hurt either geez this movie is such little universe id better stop here,0.4845360903871542,0.16541401860550797,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"

It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time.

It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor.

10.0,An enchanting film with flaws that cannot seriously mar its durable delights,"Dorothy's trip, as we follow her from her Kansas farm down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City and back home again, is depicted with rare cinematic imagination and skill At the beginning, we may wonder at the obvious falseness of the black-and-white Kansas setting, although the monotonous, arid landscape ultimately makes an effective contrast to the later scenes in Oz But rationality disappears the moment Judy Garland strikes at the heart with her trembling singing of ""Over the Rainbow."" And when Frank Morgan appears as Professor Marvel, we are captivated by his familiar bumbling charmDorothy's entrance into the land of Oz remains one of the screen's most memorable moments, as the black-and-white scene give way to glowing color photography ""I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore!"" is her understated response as she enters Munchkinland The sequence in Munchkinland, though beautifully designed, is actually, a mixed blessing Billie Burke is exactly right as the Good Witch of the North, and Margaret Hamilton is wonderfully shrill and repulsive as the Wicked Witch of the West But the Munchkins themselves, midgets gathered from all over the world for the occasion, are all wonderful with their prematurely old faces and chipmunk voicesThe talents of Dorothy's friendsJack Haley as the Tin Man, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lionhave been frequently celebrated, but their good humor and their shining humanity behind the grotesque makeup remain fresh eternally""The Wizard of Oz"" is a joy forever Why does it still glow, while other films of the period grow dimmer every year? It is unquestionably due to more than the sum of its sterling cast, winning songs, and lovely special effects, although the absence of these virtues has turned more than one ""musical fantasy"" into failures It may be that Dorothy steps from black-and-white Kansas into the bright colors of Munchkinland, she is taking everyone's first voyage of discovery With the universality of the best fables, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has her learning about evil (the Wicked Witch), friendship (her companions on the road to Oz), and fallibility (the Wizard). And somehow childrenand the child in all of uslike to see this voyage made repeatedly Children as adults, today as in 1939, ""The Wizard of Oz"" will remain for us the beloved movie ever made!",enchanting film with flaws that cannot seriously mar its durable delights,dorothys trip as we follow her her kansas farm down yellow brick road emerald city back home again is depicted with rare cinematic imagination skill at beginning we may wonder at obvious falseness black white kansas setting although monotonous arid landscape ultimately makes effective contrast later scenes oz but rationality disappears moment judy garland strikes at heart with her trembling singing over rainbow when frank morgan appears as professor marvel we are captivated by his familiar bumbling charm dorothys entrance into land oz remains one screens most memorable moments as black white scene give way glowing color photography i have feeling were not kansas anymore is her understated response as she enters munchkinland sequence munchkinland though beautifully designed is actually mixed blessing billie burke is exactly right as good witch north margaret hamilton is wonderfully shrill repulsive as wicked witch west but munchkins themselves midgets gathered all over world occasion are all wonderful with their prematurely old faces chipmunk voices talents dorothys friends jack haley as tin man ray bolger as scarecrow bert lahr as cowardly lion have been frequently celebrated but their good humor their shining humanity behind grotesque makeup remain fresh eternally wizard oz is joy forever why does it still glow while other films period grow dimmer every year it is unquestionably due more than sum its sterling cast winning songs lovely special effects although absence these virtues has turned more than one musical fantasy into failures it may be that dorothy steps black white kansas into bright colors munchkinland she is taking everyones first voyage discovery with universality best fables wizard oz has her learning about evil wicked witch friendship her companions road oz fallibility wizard somehow children child all us like see this voyage made repeatedly children as adults today as 1939 wizard oz will remain us beloved movie ever made,0.49665286404416836,0.1905753968253968,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,I wish I could have followed the yellow brick road.,"I remember watching this movie when they would air it once a year on CBS a few years back. Now it is shown on a couple of different networks quite frequently. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever. The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well. Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die.

There are hundreds of unforgettable, instant-classic moments in the film, with the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy and Toto, the songs, Garland's dazzling ruby red slippers, sepia-toned Kansas and the closing line ""There's no place like a home!"" just a few of the wondrous delights that THE WIZARD OF OZ offers.It is hard to believe that the filing of ""Oz"" was so fraught with problems when you view the finished product. It seems a thing of absolute perfection, with Garland's casting a stroke of genius. Her wistful interpretation of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" is the stuff of legend.

10.0,Perhaps the most well known and watched film in history?,"This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.Today at age 55, when it shows up on Turner Classic Movies, even though I have in my possession the deluxe ""Wizard of Oz DVD Set and Museum in a Box"", I'll still stop and watch it from whatever point I catch it to the end. Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even ""Star Wars"" has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"" is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking ""Isn't she dead yet?"" There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - ""Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard"" is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.",perhaps most well known watched film history,this film predates my birth by 19 years so ive seen it as child when it was annual event network tv stretched out hours length believably due commercials maybe not so believably today due network hosting talking about film little during breaks today at age 55 when it shows up turner classic movies even though i have my possession deluxe wizard oz dvd set museum box ill still stop watch it whatever point i catch it end having advantage having seen it at all ages i can truly say that it has enough fantasy whimsy spectacle keep interest children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too i think all filmdom only walt disney walts time with his animated features pixar modern times have been able strike that balance even star wars has lost step or two 36 years since its release wizard oz has universal themes value friendship family how many us have strengths virtues inside us well never believe we have until tested how many powerful people are literally all hot air pay no attention that man behind curtain is practically slogan american politics as i am writing this year 2013 then there is beautiful judy garland when her exterior still matched her voice before studio system chewed her up literally spit her out she was never more lovely than she is right here youd never believe billie burke as good witch glenda is 55 years old youd never believe that margaret hamilton as bad witch is only 37 i remember seeing her daytime commercial 1960s as child thinking isnt she dead yet there is maybe one aspect this film that is uniquely pre wwii theme film never look anything if you cant find it your own backyard is motto isolationist years between wars that would be left behind only couple years when it became apparent that u s would have confront evil expansionist powers growing both sides globe it is perhaps unique snapshot time that regard only it also shows best studio system could produce that fabled year 1939 when it was at height its power forgive me yammering about film that has been reviewed hundreds times but this one will always have special place my heart my memory,0.5896541950113379,0.14219104308390018,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"

,Timeless,"In the fall of 2006, my husband and I saw a screening ""The Wizard of Oz"" that had a full orchestra providing the soundtrack. Never in my life had I seen a more eclectic audience: there were families with little children, adults who came alone (one woman was dressed as Glinda), teens and college students, even couples who had to have been in their '90s. Not to gush, but it's really a testimonial to ""Oz""'s legacy that it can appeal to every generation, to every age. Like hot chocolate or Mickey Mouse T-shirts, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is something you never have to worry about being too old for. There is something so comforting about the familiar story of farm girl Dorothy's journey through the strange but wonderful land of Oz, and yet it remains a wonder to behold. I still get excited when Dorothy steps out her sepia-toned world of Kansas into the Technicolor Munchkinland, even though I learned ages ago how the trick was done. I'm still overjoyed when Dorothy makes another odd yet loyal friend along her journey (hmmm, a nice message of tolerance, too!). I still cry when Dorothy bids her friends farewell (Jack Haley in particular breaks my heart). I just want to yell at the screen, ""no! Forget boring old Kansas, stay in Oz!""Not only is ""The Wizard of Oz"" a charming, addictive classic, but it's one of the best-cast films ever. Putty-limbed Ray Bolger (""Some people without brains do and AWFUL lot of talking, don't they?""), over-the-top Bert Lahr (I haven't any courage at all, I even scare myself!""), and boyishly charming Jack Haley (""Now I know I have a heart, 'cause it's breaking."") are pitch-perfect in their respective roles as the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man. All three were vaudeville vets, and they infuse their roles with both theatrical shtick and warmth. Billie Burke is memorably twittery yet poised as Glinda the Good Witch, and who can possibly forget Margaret Hamilton's cackling, gleefully evil performance as the Wicked Witch of the West? Hamiltion's iconic, villainous image is so emblazoned in our minds, that it's easy to forget she was a former kindergarten teacher and future animal rights activist! As superb as the cast is, however, ""The Wizard of Oz"" belongs to the young Judy Garland. Garland makes Dorothy a very real character that we can all relate too, whereas any other actress would have made her one-note and whiny. She believably plays an ordinary girl in an extraordinary place, her lovely brown eyes wide with awe and wonder. And that singing voice! Long before Garland's voice became tinged with tremulous desperation due to age and hard living, the true beauty and purity of her voice comes through in ""Oz"". Garland sings ""Over the Rainbow"" so simply, without a trace of theatrics, and you're swept away just the same. It's spellbinding, seeing someone so young have the presence and talent to hold a movie in the palm of her hand. ""The Wizard of Oz"" will remain the ultimate escapist classic for generations to come, and it will always be one of my favorites.

10.0,Garland's Oz.,"The Wizard of Oz (1939): Dir: Victor Fleming / Cast: Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton: Sensational treasure about mind and imagination. Judy Garland plays Dorothy, a farm girl who, in the midst of a tornado, is spirited away over the rainbow to the glorious land of Oz. She is greeted by numerous Munchkins after her house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. This angers the Wicked Witch of the West who demands the ruby slippers, which have appeared on Dorothy's feet. To return to Kansas she must follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek help from the wizard. On the way she encounters a scarecrow who needs a brain, a tin man who needs a heart, and a cowardly lion who needs courage. Skillfully directed by Victor Fleming whose luck had him direct this film and Gone With the Wind the same year. Garland graces the screen with her innocence and beautiful singing voice that belts out ""Over the Rainbow."" Margaret Hamilton plays the menacing wicked witch whose defeat is one of the great scenes due to its simplicity. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are wonderfully cast as Dorothy's companions.

9.0,The Wizard of Oz,"Fantastic tale about a Kansas farm girl who's spirited off to the wondrous land of Oz. The film still tingles with freshness and beauty.

10.0,Immortal,"It's hard to overstate the true significance of this film. The Library of Congress informs us that it is the most watched film ever made. Its signature song, ""Over The Rainbow"", written for the film, didn't merely win the Oscar for best original song of 1939. More significantly, decades later the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts both voted this song as the number 1 song of the twentieth century. The American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest movie song of all time.But the film's accolades go on and on. It is one of only a few films listed in UNESCO's ""Memory Of The World"" Registry. Even in a supporting role, actress Margaret Hamilton turned her Wicked Witch into American Film Institute's 4th-greatest villain of all time, behind Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates, and Darth Vader. All of the main actors and many people responsible for the film's technical achievements have received and continue to receive innumerable awards and honors seventy years after the film was released.From its inception as a children's book in 1900 by author L. Frank Baum, the simple story was retold countless times in novels, stage presentations, and other forms, in many subsequent years, including: 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1933, and 1938. But it was the film of 1939, directed by Victor Fleming, that propelled the story into immortality.With its perfect 3-Act structure, the script creates iconic characters and iconic dialogue. Some lines have morphed into cultural clichés, they are so often repeated. How many times has the line ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more"" been borrowed by hack writers to use in their hack scripts? I think it was Oscar Wilde who said: ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness"".At a deeper level than the well-known story, the film's many allegories have been and will continue to be debated by scholars. Many of these allegories are so subtle they may never be appreciated by viewers, especially in an age when subtlety has been rendered a forgotten art. Is the naïve Dorothy really the American people? Does the yellow brick road symbolize the gold standard? Is the Emerald City a symbol of materialism that we in the early 21st century might equate to Wall Street?A deep, intellectual script it may be, but the film would be merely great without its underlying emotional appeal to the heart. It's the visuals and music that render the film so beloved by the world.And when you join the simple, yet intellectual, story with the power of great visuals and great music, you create a timeless expression of the human experience. The summary message is thus conveyed that no matter where or how far you may roam, and no matter what joys and friendships you may experience along the way, after all and in the end, there's no place like home.It's almost impossible to view this film objectively, critically, so magical, mythical, and powerful has it become. It's a film that does not require a plot summary; it's too well known for that, too burned into our collective consciousness.Academy Award films, well-made classic films linger with us. But ""The Wizard Of Oz"" isn't just another Oscar winner or classic film. It is unique, its own category, a one-of-a-kind artistic expression. There will never be another film quite like it. If humans are still around a thousand years from now, someone, somewhere, using some form of futuristic technology, will be watching it, enthralled by its universality, its timelessness.",immortal,its hard overstate true significance this film library congress informs us that it is most watched film ever made its signature song over rainbow written film didnt merely win oscar best original song 1939 more significantly decades later recording industry association america national endowment arts both voted this song as number 1 song twentieth century american film institute ranked it as greatest movie song all time but films accolades go it is one only few films listed unescos memory world registry even supporting role actress margaret hamilton turned her wicked witch into american film institutes 4th greatest villain all time behind hannibal lecter norman bates darth vader all main actors many people responsible films technical achievements have received continue receive innumerable awards honors seventy years after film was released its inception as childrens book 1900 by author l frank baum simple story was retold countless times novels stage presentations other forms many subsequent years including 1908 1910 1914 1925 1933 1938 but it was film 1939 directed by victor fleming that propelled story into immortality with its perfect 3 act structure script creates iconic characters iconic dialogue some lines have morphed into cultural clich s they are so often repeated how many times has line toto ive feeling were not kansas any more been borrowed by hack writers use their hack scripts i think it was oscar wilde who said imitation is sincerest form flattery that mediocrity can pay greatness at deeper level than well known story films many allegories have been will continue be debated by scholars many these allegories are so subtle they may never be appreciated by viewers especially age when subtlety has been rendered forgotten art is na ve dorothy really american people does yellow brick road symbolize gold standard is emerald city symbol materialism that we early 21st century might equate wall street deep intellectual script it may be but film would be merely great without its underlying emotional appeal heart its visuals music that render film so beloved by world when you join simple yet intellectual story with power great visuals great music you create timeless expression human experience summary message is thus conveyed that no matter where or how far you may roam no matter what joys friendships you may experience along way after all end theres no place like home its almost impossible view this film objectively critically so magical mythical powerful has it become its film that does not require plot summary its too well known that too burned into our collective consciousness academy award films well made classic films linger with us but wizard oz isnt just another oscar winner or classic film it is unique its own category one kind artistic expression there will never be another film quite like it if humans are still around thousand years now someone somewhere using some form futuristic technology will be watching it enthralled by its universality its timelessness,0.49722842261904765,0.25638020833333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,"A Wiz of a film, if ever a Wiz there was","The NBC Peacock began unfolding its wings. ""The following program is brought to you in living color--with portions in black & white--on NBC."" That exclusive intro began my exposure to color television at Grandma's in 1968. When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network. In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television. It was ""Oz."" Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does. What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, ""Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!""Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps ""The Sound of Music."" Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, ""The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!"" Yikes! In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that ""Oz"" doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies. It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings. The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible. And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action. Certain numbers like ""Merry Old Land of Oz,"" I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves. I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, ""Step forward, Tin Man!"" What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result? ""Oz"" is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light. This was done due to the lack of a suitable ""color film"" in 1939. That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives. Because ""Oz"" was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded. So now we have home videos/DVDs of breathtaking color quality. Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr. But they all hold up amazingly well.""Oz"" has a valuable message. As the pop group America once said, ""No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have."" If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack. The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.Didn't bring your broomsticks with you?

10.0,"Click your heels, fly out of Kansas, and go where nobody mourns the wicked.","For my 2000th review, I felt it would be appropriate to visit the film that I saw 20 times by the time I was 20. Between countless network T.V. viewings (on my grandparent's old T.V. where everything was green, even the black and white Kansas sequences), several big screen visits, hundreds of playings of it at the video store I worked at for 10 years and numerous video covers and different DVD releases, this film has never escaped our culture, and thus my life. My favorite VHS cover was the one in red which focused on the witch and her crystal ball, but that was out of print almost immediately after its release, while the one copy I owned was the blue ""50th Anniversary"" special edition which came with a ton of extras.While throughout grade school, I was obsessed, not only with the film, but the book too, I made a point of seeing it every time network T.V. aired it. When I first discovered it on video, I was thrilled to be able to see it without commercials and certainly without edits. I was also surprised to find out how much was edited from the film, and like Angela Lansbury quoted about the film in her documentary on its filming, ""How long is too long?"". Certainly, I would have loved to see the filmed footage of ""The Jitterbug"" rather than the home movies, but it is obvious from what I have seen that it takes away from the flow of the completed film. What would have been more interesting was the lavish sequence (seen briefly in one of the re-release trailers) of Dorothy and her friend's return from the witches' castle.Of course, the star-making performance of Judy Garland is the heart and soul of this breathtaking fantasy, often imitated but never surpassed. She's a bit busty for the role of the pre-teen Dorothy, but her sincerity is magnetic. There was a genius behind all her madness and as sorry as you can feel for her because of all her woes, you can't feel sorry for the artist who to this day strikes a cord in non-fans, not to mention those of us who consider her the single greatest female performer of all times.There's no better supporting cast (although much of the roles were initially mentioned for other actors), with Ray Bolger an absolute rubbery delight as the Scarecrow, Jack Haley tender and gentle to the max as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr a blubbering gem as the Cowardly Lion. No good witch was more glamorous than Billie Burke's Glinda (even all the blonde starlets in Broadway's ""Wicked""), and for pure fright, no wicked witch was scarier than Margaret Hamilton's. I became a huge fan of this wonderful character actress as a child, and to this day, I delight in finding works of hers I hadn't seen yet. Hamilton's Miss Gulch reminds me of the delightfully nosy neighbors of my childhood, and to see her in the same outfit the year later sticking her nose up to W.C. Fields' in ""My Little Chickadee"" was a comic treat.While Fields was mentioned as a candidate for the role of the wizard, it was Frank Morgan, a stuttering gem of a comical character actor who ended up with the role. He appears in an assortment of other roles, beginning in the Kansas sequence, and later as the doorman of Oz and the doorman to the wizard, all disguised to make you think that he's actually another character, which is doubtful. Hamilton obviously is not only Miss Gulch and the Western Witch, but in the brief guise of the Eastern Witch as well. Of course, in ""Wicked"", Nessarose is a lot more beautiful than her sister, only made ugly in spirit by her change in character which didn't ring true.In smaller roles, Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em offer wise, if distant, support to Judy Garland's Dorothy, with Grapewin very funny as he reluctantly greets the Gulch Woman and Blandick downright hysterical as she tells her off. Toto is an adorable pooch, and I long for a spoof of him getting his revenge on Gulch by biting her in the tush before jumping out of the basket. So as I reflect in my journal of my journey down the yellow brick road, I must call it a lifetime of great and powerful entertainment where every character has become an important part of my child-like heart in my transition to find my own land of Oz.",click your heels fly out kansas go where nobody mourns wicked,my 2000th review i felt it would be appropriate visit film that i saw 20 times by time i was 20 between countless network t v viewings my grandparents old t v where everything was green even black white kansas sequences several big screen visits hundreds playings it at video store i worked at 10 years numerous video covers different dvd releases this film has never escaped our culture thus my life my favorite vhs cover was one red which focused witch her crystal ball but that was out print almost immediately after its release while one copy i owned was blue 50th anniversary special edition which came with ton extras while throughout grade school i was obsessed not only with film but book too i made point seeing it every time network t v aired it when i first discovered it video i was thrilled be able see it without commercials certainly without edits i was also surprised find out how much was edited film like angela lansbury quoted about film her documentary its filming how long is too long certainly i would have loved see filmed footage jitterbug rather than home movies but it is obvious what i have seen that it takes away flow completed film what would have been more interesting was lavish sequence seen briefly one re release trailers dorothy her friends return witches castle course star making performance judy garland is heart soul this breathtaking fantasy often imitated but never surpassed shes bit busty role pre teen dorothy but her sincerity is magnetic there was genius behind all her madness as sorry as you can feel her because all her woes you cant feel sorry artist who this day strikes cord non fans not mention those us who consider her single greatest female performer all times theres no better supporting cast although much roles were initially mentioned other actors with ray bolger absolute rubbery delight as scarecrow jack haley tender gentle max as tin man bert lahr blubbering gem as cowardly lion no good witch was more glamorous than billie burkes glinda even all blonde starlets broadways wicked pure fright no wicked witch was scarier than margaret hamiltons i became huge fan this wonderful character actress as child this day i delight finding works hers i hadnt seen yet hamiltons miss gulch reminds me delightfully nosy neighbors my childhood see her same outfit year later sticking her nose up w c fields my little chickadee was comic treat while fields was mentioned as candidate role wizard it was frank morgan stuttering gem comical character actor who ended up with role he appears assortment other roles beginning kansas sequence later as doorman oz doorman wizard all disguised make you think that hes actually another character which is doubtful hamilton obviously is not only miss gulch western witch but brief guise eastern witch as well course wicked nessarose is lot more beautiful than her sister only made ugly spirit by her change character which didnt ring true smaller roles charley grapewin clara blandick as uncle henry auntie em offer wise if distant support judy garlands dorothy with grapewin very funny as he reluctantly greets gulch woman blandick downright hysterical as she tells her off toto is adorable pooch i long spoof him getting his revenge gulch by biting her tush before jumping out basket so as i reflect my journal my journey down yellow brick road i must call it lifetime great powerful entertainment where every character has become important part my child like heart my transition find my own land oz,0.5432262827611666,0.13713778146917682,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"Is, and always will be, a classic for all time!","In order to coincide with the upcoming ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"", I'm going to make my own review of this 1939 classic that will be celebrating it's 75th anniversary next year (not to mention the fact that it will be in IMAX 3D this year in September). I watched it when I was a little kid and loved it as much as anyone else in the film industry. Sure, it's not actually faithful to the book, but it doesn't matter.It did what it had set out to do and defined the meaning of a true Hollywood classic that inspired other acclaimed directors and filmmakers to do the same. The story is very original in the overall light-hearted tone, although it does have some moments that would make you feel scared(especially the Wicked Witch of the West who scared me as a little child). The scenery is beautiful and realistic and the look of the Emerald City is a sight to behold. The characters are charming and likable too. Judy Garland is a beautiful Dorothy, Ray Bolger is a terrific Scarecrow, Jack Haley is a wonderful Tin Man, Bert Lahr is a hilarious and cowardly Lion, and Margaret Hamilton is a scary Wicked Witch of the West.The pacing moves along very nicely, but the best part would have to go to the musical numbers written by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Yip Harbug including ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", ""Ding! Dong! The Wicked Witch Is Dead"", ""If I Only Had A Brain"", ""If I Only Had A Heart"", ""If I Only Had The Nerve"", ""We're Off To See The Wizard"", and more.Overall, The Wizard of Oz is, and always will be, a classic to those who are young and old.

10.0,The best fantasy of all time,"I have seen The Wizard of Oz lots of times and never tire of it. It has to be the best fantasy movie ever made.A twister sends Dorothy, her dog Toto and their home to the magical land of Oz. When there, she first discovers her home has crushed the Wicked Witch of the East to death and the area of Oz she has landed in is Munchkin Land. After a visit from the Good Witch of the North, some songs with the munchkins and an unpleasant visit from the Wicked Witch of the West, she starts to make her way along the Yellow Brick Road to the Emarald City to visit the Wizard himself who can get her back home to Kansas. On the way, she meets up with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and they eventually end up at the Emarald City. Before eventually meeting the Wizard, she is kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West's strange monkey-bat creature slaves and locked up in her castle but is rescued and the Witch disintegrates when some water is thrown over her. Dorothy then gets to see the Wizard, who gives the Scarecrow his brain, the Tin Man his heart and the Cowardly Lion his courage. The Wizard turns out to be a Kansas person as well but his balloon is accidentally released and Dorothy misses out on returning home with him. She returns home by saying ""There's No Place Like Home"" but all this turns out to be a dream at the end.The best song in the movie has to be ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which Dorothy sings before she gets to Oz.Now to the excellent cast. Judy Garland plays her best role as Dorothy and is joined by Frank Morgan who has five roles, Burt Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and an excellent performance from Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.This movie is an excellent way to spend part of an afternoon, not just at Christmas when most TV channels screen it.

10.0,A Great and Powerful Film,"Released in 1939, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a classic American film that had a modest start. After its release, and for many years, it was viewed as an entertaining film but not as a great film. When I was a child, it aired on network TV once a year, around Thanksgiving. Whole families would gather around their sets for this special annual viewing.Later, when films became more widely available, its reputation seemed to grow and one would find it included in the lists of ""best"" films. Personally, I have always loved ""The Wizard of Oz"". I have seen it so many times, I practically know it frame by frame, as I am sure many others do.Here are some of the reasons this film should be considered great and powerful:1. The Beginning: The first part of the film, which is filmed in rich sepia tones, includes comedy, suspense, drama, music, and the establishment of all main characters.2. The tornado: The special effects used to create the menacing tornado are spectacular. It is still an emotionally charged element, despite our exposure to the spectacles of modern CGI.3. The song: ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is regarded as one of the best film songs of all time. The film almost starred Shirley Temple and MGM wanted to cut the song, so we should consider ourselves lucky.4. Judy Garland: The use of Judy Garland to play the role of Dorothy Gale added a sense of maturity to the role and to the movie in general. Her vocal talents elevated the film.5. Frank Morgan: First introduced in the film as Professor Marvel, Frank Morgan's talents are used in a clever way through his various characters.6. The use of color: When Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland, the screen erupts in color. It has various symbolic uses, but mostly it delineates between the world Dorothy is from and a new world where the rules are unknown.7. The Munchkins: The strangeness of the new world and a considerable amount of charm are enhanced by this troupe and their voices.8. The Yellow Brick Road: Not the literal road, but what it represents--an adventure of possibilities, where heroes are tested.9. Serendipity: The fortunate way the elements of this film came together (Judy Garland vs. Shirley Temple, Ray Bolger vs. Buddy Ebsen, the use of the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", etc.)10. The Wizard: The use of screen projection, smoke and sound produced a scary Wizard that contrasted sharply with the beneficent image suggested to Dorothy by Glinda and the Munchkins.11. The musical score in general. The production is generously endowed with some magical musical numbers.12. The supporting cast: Dorothy's fellow travelers seem perfectly cast to us now, so iconic are their characterizations.13. The Witch: One of the great villains in film history, surrounded by her henchmen and her minions (the flying monkeys, terrors in their own right).14. The script: The story is engaging. It is also responsible for a slew of iconic quotes. My favorite is ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!""15. The director: Victor Fleming's vision produced a delightful film that can be enjoyed over and over.

8.0,"Classic fairy tale with dazzling fantasy , colorful images , impressive songs and enjoyable roles","Marvelous tale in which Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland , she had to wear a painful corset-style device around her torso so that she would appear younger and flat-chested) is swept away to a magical location in a tornado and being transported on the land of Oz she embarks on a quest to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan , he plays various characters) who can help her return home . The film opens in sepia-tone academy ratio for the Kansas scenes, before widening out and blooming into full color in Oz . There appears Dorothy and her dog when she is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. She's helped by the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) , but she's also in trouble with the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton, many of her scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely, her performance was thought too frightening for audiences) . Reluctantly drawn into the problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Dorothy must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. On her way she meets the Munchkins (they are portrayed by the Singer Midgets, named not for their musical abilities ,the troupe came from Europe to immigrate and escape the Nazis) , a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger , face makeup wore consisted, in part, of a rubber prosthetic with a woven pattern to suggest cloth) who needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley who wrote additional dialogue) who wants a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bet Lahr , he wrote additional dialogue , too) who desperately needs courage . Putting their arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry they transform themselves not only into the great and powerful helpers of Oz but into the better friends as well . This is an agreeable film for children of all ages based on the all-time classic by Frank Baum . This engrossing picture contains powerful ,haunting images and immortal songs ,in fact the song ""Over the Rainbow"" was ranked #1 by the American Film Institute in 2004 on the 100 Greatest Songs in American Films list . Beautiful scenery , colorful cinematography by Harold Rosson , spirited adventure and a stirring climax lift this story . It is a genuine as well as imaginative tale written and directed with great sensibility , fairness and imagination. It's plenty of scenes that stay in the mind as when Dorothy/Judy Garland appears at the 'other side' that results to be the fantastic as well as glowing world of OZ . There's something for everyone here ; fans of fantasy , fans of magic and necromancy , fans of incredible adventures , should all find something to enjoy about this film . A perfect cast and enjoyable secondaries in the perfect fantasy . As a likable acting by Judy Garland as an adorable girl who is swept away to an enchanted land . Sympathetic support cast such as Ray Bolger , Billy Burke , Charles Grapewin , Jack Haley , Frank Morgan and Margaret Hamilton as witch ; among others . Spectacular and glamorous sets , production designer Cedric Gibbons studied the films of Walt Disney classic films to achieve the appropriate Art Deco design for the Emerald City of Oz . The film was completely shot in studio , the only location footage in the entire film are the clouds over the opening titles . The director opted to use practical sets in conjunction with matte painting . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Victor Fleming , though supported by other notorious as well as uncredited filmmakers such as George Cukor , Norman Taurog , King Vidor and Mervyn LeRoy , also producer . However , Richard Thorpe, the original director of the film, had shot around two weeks of footage before he was fired . A recent study claimed that this is the most watched movie in film history, largely due to the number of television screenings each year as well as video which has enabled children of every generation to see it. This story about OZ has been adapted several times such as : An old and mute version (1925) , this classic and the best rendition , the MGM release ¨The wizard of Oz¨ (1939) by Victor Fleming with Judy Garland , remade in 1978 as ¨The Wiz¨ by Sidney Lumet with Diana Ross , Richard Pryor and Michael Jackson and ¨Return to Oz¨ (1985) by Walter Murch with Fauriza Falk ,Nicol Williamson, Matt Clark and Piper Laurie . And recent prequel (2013) by Sam Raimi titled ¨Oz the Great and Powerful¨ with James Franco as Oz , Mila Kunis as Theodora , Rachel Weisz as Evanora and Michelle Williams as Annie .",classic fairy tale with dazzling fantasy colorful images impressive songs enjoyable roles,marvelous tale which dorothy gale judy garland she had wear painful corset style device around her torso so that she would appear younger flat chested is swept away magical location tornado being transported land oz she embarks quest see wizard frank morgan he plays various characters who can help her return home film opens sepia tone academy ratio kansas scenes before widening out blooming into full color oz there appears dorothy her dog when she is hurled away dusty kansas vibrant land oz shes helped by good witch north billie burke but shes also trouble with wicked witch west margaret hamilton many her scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely her performance was thought too frightening audiences reluctantly drawn into problems facing land oz its inhabitants dorothy must find out who is good who is evil before it is too late her way she meets munchkins they are portrayed by singer midgets named not their musical abilities troupe came europe immigrate escape nazis scarecrow ray bolger face makeup wore consisted part rubber prosthetic with woven pattern suggest cloth who needs brain tin man jack haley who wrote additional dialogue who wants heart cowardly lion bet lahr he wrote additional dialogue too who desperately needs courage putting their arts use through illusion ingenuity even bit wizardry they transform themselves not only into great powerful helpers oz but into better friends as well this is agreeable film children all ages based all time classic by frank baum this engrossing picture contains powerful haunting images immortal songs fact song over rainbow was ranked by american film institute 2004 100 greatest songs american films list beautiful scenery colorful cinematography by harold rosson spirited adventure stirring climax lift this story it is genuine as well as imaginative tale written directed with great sensibility fairness imagination its plenty scenes that stay mind as when dorothy judy garland appears at other side that results be fantastic as well as glowing world oz theres something everyone here fans fantasy fans magic necromancy fans incredible adventures should all find something enjoy about this film perfect cast enjoyable secondaries perfect fantasy as likable acting by judy garland as adorable girl who is swept away enchanted land sympathetic support cast such as ray bolger billy burke charles grapewin jack haley frank morgan margaret hamilton as witch among others spectacular glamorous sets production designer cedric gibbons studied films walt disney classic films achieve appropriate art deco design emerald city oz film was completely shot studio only location footage entire film are clouds over opening titles director opted use practical sets conjunction with matte painting motion picture was stunningly directed by victor fleming though supported by other notorious as well as uncredited filmmakers such as george cukor norman taurog king vidor mervyn leroy also producer however richard thorpe original director film had shot around two weeks footage before he was fired recent study claimed that this is most watched movie film history largely due number television screenings each year as well as video which has enabled children every generation see it this story about oz has been adapted several times such as old mute version 1925 this classic best rendition mgm release wizard oz 1939 by victor fleming with judy garland remade 1978 as wiz by sidney lumet with diana ross richard pryor michael jackson return oz 1985 by walter murch with fauriza falk nicol williamson matt clark piper laurie recent prequel 2013 by sam raimi titled oz great powerful with james franco as oz mila kunis as theodora rachel weisz as evanora michelle williams as annie,0.5953333333333333,0.28211111111111126,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
