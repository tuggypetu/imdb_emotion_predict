9.0,Art!,"I haven't seen the black and white original of Mughal E Azam since the '80's, but I recently saw the restored revived colourised 2004 re-release for the first time and was astounded by the results. I'm not a believer in messing around with the originals, but bearing in mind director Asif always wanted to make the whole film in colour but didn't have enough money the ""final"" product is amazing to see - such is technology! It was incredibly expensive to make as it was, the restoration process must have cost a fabulous amount too.Seminal Indian epic purporting to deal with events from about 400 years ago around Prince Saleem (Dilip Kumar) falling in love with a court dancer Anarkali (Madhubala) to his father Akbar's utter opposition and eventually causing a rift leading to all out war. The drama and war spectacle scenes are memorable enough, with thousands of humans and animals as extras, and the music is uniformly superb too. But it's Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya (If I have loved someone>why should I be afraid?) sung by Anarkali (Lata) to the 2 of them in the Hall Of Mirrors that is absolutely stunning - I will have to get the original and compare, because the remaster seems to have turned this song into something even more magical and mesmerising than I remembered. It took Naushad and Shakeel Badayuni one night to compose music and lyrics so timeless - a colourful piece of poetry in motion, with the insistent kaleidoscopic climax added by Asif. Awesome! According to the legend it was supposed to have an unhappy ending - needless to say I'm glad it was altered here to a happy one after such a roller-coaster ride!A tremendous work of Art, showing the very best of Indian cinema.",art,i havent seen black white original mughal e azam since 80s but i recently saw restored revived colourised 2004 re release first time was astounded by results im not believer messing around with originals but bearing mind director asif always wanted make whole film colour but didnt have enough money final product is amazing see such is technology it was incredibly expensive make as it was restoration process must have cost fabulous amount too seminal indian epic purporting deal with events about 400 years ago around prince saleem dilip kumar falling love with court dancer anarkali madhubala his father akbars utter opposition eventually causing rift leading all out war drama war spectacle scenes are memorable enough with thousands humans animals as extras music is uniformly superb too but its pyar kiya darna kya if i have loved someone why should i be afraid sung by anarkali lata 2 them hall mirrors that is absolutely stunning i will have get original compare because remaster seems have turned this song into something even more magical mesmerising than i remembered it took naushad shakeel badayuni one night compose music lyrics so timeless colourful piece poetry motion with insistent kaleidoscopic climax added by asif awesome according legend it was supposed have unhappy ending needless say im glad it was altered here happy one after such roller coaster ride tremendous work art showing very best indian cinema,0.7189583333333334,0.24270833333333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"

The love travails of the myth of Anarkali have been splendidly captured on the tinsel screen through the superb portrayal by both, Madhu Bala and legendary Dilip Kumar.

8.0,Timeless Classic.,"K. Asif was the Indian ""Cecille B. Demille"" (who was known as CB, in the industry)conceived and executed his vision on a grand Scale. There will only be one ""Ben-Hur"", one ""Lawrence of Arabia"", one ""Sound of Music"", one ""Sangam"", one ""Gadar-Ek Prem Katha"" and only one ""Mughal-E-Azam"". The grand scale is evident in the lyrical poetry set into music by music maestro Naushad, which laid the rich tapestry for this Magnum Opus. Prithviraj Kapoor, was the doyen, who started Prithvi theaters and was the patriarc of the Kapoor Clan, which included The older Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, and Sashi Kapoor. The most talented was Raj kapoor, who was the ""Barnum"" of the Indian Cinema. He made countless movies and everyone of them a masterpiece, but the best was ""Sangam"" (1963). Baritone voiced Prithviraj Kapoor, was in the same genre as Charlston Heston,Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, an actor's actor; a style that was unique and patented. After I watched the movie after three decades, few things stood out-the ornate settings for the Madhubala's (Born as Mumtaz Begum, was married to singer/actor Kishore Kumar, and died at age of 36, from a congenital heart problem), dance sequence, the rich music, the beauty of the yesteryear actresses and the devotion of the directors to make a statement-not just a movie. For current tastes and standards(""Dabaang"" ""Three Idiots"" ""Housefull 2"" produced by the Bollywood suvvar scum maggots,) the movie is a drag, but for the masses in the bygone years that starved for class and elegance, this was a treat. I was not too impressed with Dilip Kumar, as young Prince, most of the time he looked distant and lost. Suffice to say he matured to be good actor (""Ram aur Shyam"") in the later years. The two that carried the mantle were Kapoor and Madhubala.",timeless classic,k asif was indian cecille b demille who was known as cb industry conceived executed his vision grand scale there will only be one ben hur one lawrence arabia one sound music one sangam one gadar ek prem katha only one mughal e azam grand scale is evident lyrical poetry set into music by music maestro naushad which laid rich tapestry this magnum opus prithviraj kapoor was doyen who started prithvi theaters was patriarc kapoor clan which included older raj kapoor shammi kapoor sashi kapoor most talented was raj kapoor who was barnum indian cinema he made countless movies everyone them masterpiece but best was sangam 1963 baritone voiced prithviraj kapoor was same genre as charlston heston laurence olivier richard burton actors actor style that was unique patented after i watched movie after three decades few things stood out ornate settings madhubalas born as mumtaz begum was married singer actor kishore kumar died at age 36 congenital heart problem dance sequence rich music beauty yesteryear actresses devotion directors make statement not just movie current tastes standards dabaang three idiots housefull 2 produced by bollywood suvvar scum maggots movie is drag but masses bygone years that starved class elegance this was treat i was not too impressed with dilip kumar as young prince most time he looked distant lost suffice say he matured be good actor ram aur shyam later years two that carried mantle were kapoor madhubala,0.5302083333333333,0.22708333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Mughal-E-Azam,"A true masterpiece,featuring some of the greatest actors ever to grace the Indian screen.Prithviraj Kapoor,the doyen of Indian Cinema is Akbar himself and Dilip Kumar & Madhubala both put in sterling performances There is a question as to whether the storyline was actually true but the very nature of the story indicates the level of religious tolerance that existed at the time of Akbar.Akbar's wife Rani Jodhabhai was a hindu and that was the mughal method of building bridges with their hindu subjects.The role of Akbar would really serve as a model for religious amity today.The major issue Akbar had in consenting to the marriage of dancer Anarkali(represented by Madhubala) and Prince Salim(Dilip Kumar) was the class status.After all it was the 16th century All in all,a grand spectacle which showcases Indian culture at its very best and grandest and leaves one to wonder at the relative deterioration in subsequent centuries",mughal e azam,true masterpiece featuring some greatest actors ever grace indian screen prithviraj kapoor doyen indian cinema is akbar himself dilip kumar madhubala both put sterling performances there is question as whether storyline was actually true but very nature story indicates level religious tolerance that existed at time akbar akbars wife rani jodhabhai was hindu that was mughal method building bridges with their hindu subjects role akbar would really serve as model religious amity today major issue akbar had consenting marriage dancer anarkali represented by madhubala prince salim dilip kumar was class status after all it was 16th century all all grand spectacle which showcases indian culture at its very best grandest leaves one wonder at relative deterioration subsequent centuries,0.4366666666666666,0.30520833333333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.44}"

Asif","Haha -- when I see comments that put Kuch Kuch Hota Hain or any other formulaic hindi flick as ""the best film ever"" they obviously didn't see K. Asif's vision of Mughal-e-Azam.

10.0,Opulent Tale of Timeless Emotional Struggle,"Mughal-e-Azam may represent history both of India and of film but, as in any good tale, the tensions within and between the characters surprised me by being fresh and immediate. The sheer visual beauty was worth the full-price theatre ticket at a special showing in Richmond. I was a little skeptical beforehand about the colorization--but this is done lovingly as an art in itself and fully supportive of the cinematographic effects of the original filming. Completely enjoyed it! Also a source of pleasure: the traditional figures come to life, and the actors are committed to their characters with depth of sincerity that insures integrity of the story. Now--questions that came out of the theatre with me regarding justice: was it ""might makes right""? Was there another justice than this tyrannic ""scale"" of the Emperor's? Does the Emperor reward the Sculptor to acknowledge a higher Cause, the ""Emperor of Emperors""? Is his fatal role the reason the Sculptor (creator of true images) has no name? It was he who brought Amarkali into the court with a prophesy of what would come of it. While the Sculptor seems to be an arm of Fate, so the courtesan Bahar (deliciously played by Nigar Sultana) also administers Fate as she manipulates actions and outcomes. What will her reward be? Is there any other Justice than the Emperor's? Is her self-seeking malice considered so inevitable that Fate does not touch her, in turn? If my answers lie in further reading into these histories, so be it . . . In the meantime, the scenes of the movie play out in my mind as I wonder about fate, justice, and--of course--human love. After the movie, in the theatre lobby, a young woman spotted a mouse skittering from the auditorium across the lobby into a closet. I believe it was Sri Ganesha's vehicle.",opulent tale timeless emotional struggle,mughal e azam may represent history both india film but as any good tale tensions within between characters surprised me by being fresh immediate sheer visual beauty was worth full price theatre ticket at special showing richmond i was little skeptical beforehand about colorization but this is done lovingly as art itself fully supportive cinematographic effects original filming completely enjoyed it also source pleasure traditional figures come life actors are committed their characters with depth sincerity that insures integrity story now questions that came out theatre with me regarding justice was it might makes right was there another justice than this tyrannic scale emperors does emperor reward sculptor acknowledge higher cause emperor emperors is his fatal role reason sculptor creator true images has no name it was he who brought amarkali into court with prophesy what would come it while sculptor seems be arm fate so courtesan bahar deliciously played by nigar sultana also administers fate as she manipulates actions outcomes what will her reward be is there any other justice than emperors is her self seeking malice considered so inevitable that fate does not touch her turn if my answers lie further reading into these histories so be it meantime scenes movie play out my mind as i wonder about fate justice course human love after movie theatre lobby young woman spotted mouse skittering auditorium across lobby into closet i believe it was sri ganeshas vehicle,0.593543956043956,0.22135989010989007,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
8.0,An epic extravaganza with gloss and substance,"Mughul-E-Azam boasts of some of the highest production values employed in filmmaking in India up to that point, and the result is astounding, to say the least. The film is a true cinematic experience in terms of aesthetics, and be it the black-and-white or the colour version, it is an unforgettable visual treat. The sets, the costumes, are stunningly lavish, almost to the point of casting a gloom over the story itself. And then we have the story, an epic, poetic one, which involves a most subtle love story. The dialogue is stupendous, with many lines having a memorable, larger-than-life quality which enhances the narrative beyond imagination. The music is similarly fantastic, with spectacularly performed dance numbers. Needless to say, ""Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya"" is the high-point of the film and the story it tells. Prithviraj Kapoor is excellent in a wonderfully dramatic and appropriately theatrical performance as Emperor Akbar. Dilip Kumar seems to enjoy his own, mere presence, while underplaying his role to great effect. It is Madhubala, however, who walks away with the most fully-realised part of Anarkali, a slave girl whose dignity cannot be taken away at any cost. I found the film a greatly entertaining watch, and while I had a problem with its overlong running time, as well as some faulty sequences, such as the less convincing battle between the father and son, Mughul-E-Azam remains a meticulous piece of art, and a rightly-touted all-time classic of Indian cinema.",epic extravaganza with gloss substance,mughul e azam boasts some highest production values employed filmmaking india up that point result is astounding say least film is true cinematic experience terms aesthetics be it black white or colour version it is unforgettable visual treat sets costumes are stunningly lavish almost point casting gloom over story itself then we have story epic poetic one which involves most subtle love story dialogue is stupendous with many lines having memorable larger than life quality which enhances narrative beyond imagination music is similarly fantastic with spectacularly performed dance numbers needless say pyar kiya darna kya is high point film story it tells prithviraj kapoor is excellent wonderfully dramatic appropriately theatrical performance as emperor akbar dilip kumar seems enjoy his own mere presence while underplaying his role great effect it is madhubala however who walks away with most fully realised part anarkali slave girl whose dignity cannot be taken away at any cost i found film greatly entertaining watch while i had problem with its overlong running time as well as some faulty sequences such as less convincing battle between father son mughul e azam remains meticulous piece art rightly touted all time classic indian cinema,0.570965250965251,0.2217310167310167,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Today I am very lucky and felt an honored of writing the review for the greatest epic of Indian cinema and biggest Indian film ever which has been hailed as a masterpiece,"The ostentatious look, the unforgettable music, the awesome war scenes, superb performances, the well-known romance between Salim and Anarkalis MUGHAL-E-AZAM will always remain as a point of reference.After 44 years, this masterpiece has been released after reviving it in color (the original version was 85 percent black and white and 15 percent colour), with an upgraded, contemporary sound system (Dolby Digital).The Story is about the Ruler Akbar (Prithviraj Kapoor) and Queen Jodha (Durga Khote) give birth to a son, Salim, after years of prayer.Prince Salim (Dilip Kumar) grows into a commendable combatant. Salim falls in love with court dancer Anarkali (Madhubala). Initially wary of his affections because of the difference in their positions, she soon reciprocates his love.Akbar finds out about the affair and that creates a rift between the father and son. It is a must see movie for every moviegoer for its pure canvass, for its majestic framing and not just for being a colorful costume drama, for its romance, for the glorious Sheesh Mahal and also for our fake filmmakers (like karan johar, aditya chopra, nikhil advani, kunal kohli and many others like them) who cannot think beyond Manhattan and singing heroes and have light years to reach this level of film-making. MUGHAL-E-AZAM is a must for those who have seen it in B & W. Now watch it in color and experience the grandeur. MUGHAL-E-AZAM is a must for todays generation, who, perhaps, may not have watched this classic. Watch this epic and you will realize the difference between the cinema of yore and the cinema of today.

10.0,One of the BEST movies I have seen,"This film is by far one of the best, I have seen. One is sure to be mesmerized by the love affair, the Mughal Emperor and the India of that time. The film being in Urdu language also adds originality and aura. The dialogs and direction is superb. The voice of late Prithvi Raj Kapoor as Akbar is beyond compare. Salim, played by Dilip Kumar is one of his best known acting and film. Madhubala seems great, and I definitely feel, she rivals any modern day actress in her beauty, grace and boldness and courage. I watched the latest 2004 re-release of this film in a theater and the experience was superb. I had earlier watched the movie (earlier release) in television before, but the latest release in colour and Dolby digital sound adds to the experience. Talking about a Hindi film, one definitely has to applaud it's songs. Based on Classical music, the songs adds life to the film and are strongly linked with the story-line as well. The best part I felt as a modern gen. guy is the passion and the customs and respect towards his/her duties and elders and system. Akbar's court was also known his secular principles. He had cordial relations with Rajputs(Hindu) too with his wife Jodha Bai herself being from Rajput clan and Man Singh as the head of his infantry. The movie shows the love and emotions through powerful poetic words (dialoges). This is one of the best parts of this film. One can learn many things from this film and is sure to bring in oneself an increased understanding towards one's duties and sacrifice. A must watch for one and for all ... and do watch with keenness and each word spoken in the movie is worth it.",one best movies i have seen,this film is by far one best i have seen one is sure be mesmerized by love affair mughal emperor india that time film being urdu language also adds originality aura dialogs direction is superb voice late prithvi raj kapoor as akbar is beyond compare salim played by dilip kumar is one his best known acting film madhubala seems great i definitely feel she rivals any modern day actress her beauty grace boldness courage i watched latest 2004 re release this film theater experience was superb i had earlier watched movie earlier release television before but latest release colour dolby digital sound adds experience talking about hindi film one definitely has applaud its songs based classical music songs adds life film are strongly linked with story line as well best part i felt as modern gen guy is passion customs respect towards his her duties elders system akbars court was also known his secular principles he had cordial relations with rajputs hindu too with his wife jodha bai herself being rajput clan man singh as head his infantry movie shows love emotions through powerful poetic words dialoges this is one best parts this film one can learn many things this film is sure bring oneself increased understanding towards ones duties sacrifice must watch one all do watch with keenness each word spoken movie is worth it,0.539068100358423,0.4293010752688172,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,The Biggest and Best Magnus Opus Of Indian Cinema like Never Before and Never After!,"Mughal E Azam (1960) :The Biggest and Best Magnus Opus Of Indian Cinema like Never Before and Never After! I have been watching Mughal E Azam since childhood on TV but i never watched it in 'Single Take' so I decided to make it 'Single Viewing' during the lockdown and apparently the experience i just had forced me to write this review (so late but better than never). Almost 3 hours long and Mughal E Azam still left me spellbound for every minute, yes i repeat every freaking minute. A grandeur like never before puts modern films to shame. Well, for me it is never about just the grandeur but it is also about getting Storytelling on that level which suits and worths the Grandeur. Mughal E Azam does that.. otherwise we have witnessed many Grand scale attempts faltering in front of crap filmmaking and poor script. Mughal E Azam is Pride of Indian Cinema. If Hollywood has 'The Ten Commandments', 'Ben-Hur' and 'Titanic' as never seen before spectacles then Indian Cinema has 'Mughal E Azam'. We are bloody hell proud of Mughal E Azam. Mughal E Azam is an example suitable for when an adjective like 'Classic' looks like an understatement. K Asif's dedication, efforts and passion towards this film was unthinkable, it took him almost 14 years to complete Mughal E Azam and the result worths the wait like never before. The film may have suffered to the historical inaccuracies but it don't really matter because even if i have to watch it as a Fictional story, it still has a magical sphere. Dilip Kumar as Saleem is excellent, Madhubala as Anarkali looks beautiful and her performance is even more beautiful. Prithviraj Kapoor as Akbar outshines everyone, he's that good. I don't really see any valid reason why these 3 didn't win Filmfare or National Award for this film. It is one of those rare Bollywood flicks when 3 lead actors make you confused over thinking who was much better? Supporting cast is fine. Cinematography is Top Class and one of the finest of all time. I don't need to say anything more about Mughal E Azam's Music as it is well known and one of the most celebrated music album of all time in Bollywood. Truly Chartbuster and Timeless ! Legend Naushad does it again. Like I said, the story of Mughal E Azam lacks the authenticity from History but the narrative is Fantastic. It has Love Story, Family Drama, Sacrifice, Action and Legacy in short it has everything which is needed for a Perfect Film. Hence proved again that Bollywood don't need to borrow or copy Stories from another industry because we have something lot more interesting and deserving stories in our History books. The Production design of the film crosses all the limits of appreciation, i am literally running short of adjectives at the moment. In short, Biggest Ever and Forever ! Dialogues of the Mughal E Azam are Outstanding. I mean it fully. How many clapworthy dialogues do you find in any film of World cinema? Ten? Twenty? Or max Thirty, right? Well, Mughal E Azam is far far ahead, almost making it 5x to the Maximum case. I tried to count and found 1 clapworthy dialogue after 2 minutes, now calculate for 3 hours.. I have never seen such a brilliant dialogue writing in any bollywood or Indian film. Undoubtedly, The Best Dialogue Writing in the History of Indian Cinema. K Asif's direction is Marvellous, Phenomenon, Extraordinary and you please keep adding more praise untill you feel tired. He delivered or should i say gifted (that's much better) The Biggest and Best Magnum Opus of Indian Cinema. It's been 60 years now and i haven't seen anything spectacular like this or something which is even half of it. I don't care if we had no Robot and No Bahubali because we have Mughal E Azam that will live Forever. A Legendary Motion Picture that took Bollywood Cinema on an untouchable level.

,A work of Art - Ben Hur of Indian Cinema,"Mughal-e-Azam is the culmination of a dream, of a man possessed to make this movie - K Asif. (He made only one other completed movie) He spared no costs to produce this period drama. For instance, the grandeur of a set for the ""Sheesh Mahal"" (i.e. the palace of mirrors) appears for only a few seconds in the final print, meant a lots of peculiar challenges for the cameras and lighting, it cost a fortune, but K Asif still used it.R D Mathur's cinematography is brilliant. He used 8 cameras simultaneously, for filming the battle scenes, which are surprisingly realistic for a 1950s Bollywood movie. The close-ups of the romantic scenes are also done very well. Dilip Kumar and Madhubala's performances and their on-screen chemistry are great. Especially if you consider the fact that they had a break-up in real life, and Dilip Kumar appeared as a witness against Madhubala in a court case!Performances by Prithviraj Kapoor and Durga Khote might appear a bit too dramatic and overdone. The dialogues of this movie are very poetic and crisp. (I am not sure if translations and sub-titles could do proper justice to them)Western audiences would find this film a bit long, and then it has that compulsory ingredient of any bollywood movie - the songs. (Which are good if you understand the language and the poetry) This is not to say that film doesn't have its flaws - to show Akbar as a compassionate king and to have a ""happy ending"" Asif changed the popular legend by letting Anarkali escape through the false bottom of the wall that opens out into a tunnel unknown to Salim.

10.0,Relive the Mughal Era,"Now that's what we call a timeless classic. Mughal-e-Azam is arguably the BIGGEST production in Indian cinema ever.

The sheer magic of cinema grips you all through, and though the movie runs for longer time than an average Hindi movie, you really don't ever feel dragged.

10.0,The great Bollywood epic (12 songs by Lata),"Mughal-E-Azam (1960) was co-written and directed by K. Asif. It is considered the great Bollywood epic movie. It's the Magnum Opus of Indian Cinema.The film stars Prithviraj Kapoor as the Mughal Emperor Akbar, and Dilip Kumar as his son, Prince Saleem. The role of the dancing girl Anarkali is portrayed by Madhubala, ""The Queen of Indian Cinema."" ""Known for her beauty, personality, and sensitive portrayals of tragic women.""The movie is very long by our standards--over three hours. True--but the length fits the epic nature of the plot. And, as expected, there are many, many episodes of singing and dancing. (Also, battle scenes with--literally--a cast of thousands.)The film was originally show in black and white, but it has been meticulously colorized. (Usually, I'm not fond of colorization. However, in this case it works.)The basic plot is simple. Prince Saleem falls in love with the beautiful dancing girl, Anarkali. His father opposes the marriage of his son to a lowly servant girl. Everything else follows.Not only is the movie a treat for the eye, it's also a treat for the ear. Lata Mangeshkar is the playback singer for 12 songs. She is the most famous playback singer in the world--""The Voice of India.""This film cries out to be seen on the large screen. In fact, it was shown at Rochester's Dryden Theatre. However, we couldn't see it then, so we settled for the DVD. (There are two different DVD's of this film. The one we saw was from Shemaroo Entertainment.)Mughal-E-Azam carries a fantastically high IMDb rating of 8.3. Believe it or not, I thought it was even better than that.

8.0,"To my shock, I preferred the partially colorized version.","Sort of Indian cinema's 'Gone With the Wind' in its scale and impact, this huge 3 hour epic started slowly for me, feeling awkward, dated, and a little stagy.But then, I found myself unexpectedly swept up in this story of a prince defying his father for love of a woman, really enjoying it, and wanting to see how the story would turn out.Some amazing set design, and some beautiful songs, along with often really strong cinematography.2 versions of film exist. It was originally released in 1960, mostly in black and, but with two reels in color. Filmmaker Asif had wanted to make the whole film in color, but lacked the funds. In 2004 it was re-released in a version that colorized the black and white reels. While that would normally be a film sacrilege to me, in this case it was done with loving care, at great expense, and with the intention of finishing Asif's version the way he wanted. I actually own both versions.Following the advice of what seemed the majority of critics I watched the colorized version first, and was shocked to find it really worked for me. Maybe the early Indian color process had a slightly unreal look that let the reels that were originally in color blend just about seamlessly with the colorized reels, but in any case the whole worked wonderfully.On the other hand I recently watched the film again, this time in the original mostly black and white/2 reels in color version. I found that somewhat less satisfying. The magic of the piece seemed dimmed, the fairy tale sense of being in another world less constantly palpable. The sets felt less amazing, and details didn't catch my eye the same way.The Eros release is pretty high quality for the color and the Shameroo/Eros is OK for the older black and white/color combination. That print is very beat up, but at least the image seems sharp.

This movie is a made on a phenomenally grand scale (think BenHur or Gone with the Wind).

I was absolutely floored by the exquisitely beautiful and talented actress in the lead role- MADHUBALA ! She shines with such a natural and wholesome radiance and commands every scene in which she is present. In the first song where she is introduced, I dare say that she is a close match to the greatest Hollywood beauties of her time (think of a classic Ava Gardner combined with a teasing Marilyn Monroe).

9.0,Timeless - a masterpiece,"On 2nd My 2021, Zee Bollywood aired Mughal-E-Azam, and I didn't want to miss it. 61 years since it's release on 5th August 1960, the film can be easily crowned as India's first magnum opus. Made with a budget of Rs. 15 crores in those days, it was definitely a gamble for the man at the helmet, K. Asif, and did it hit bullseye! It garnered Rs. 11 crores at the box office and is still considered one of the finest productions of all times.When you critically examine the film with modern standards, you are bound to find issues with it. With a running time of 198 minutes, it's genuinely long and grievously slow, especially when the romance between the protagonists is blooming. Dilip Kumar (Salim, tgevheir apparent of the Mughal empire) is at his brooding best and Madhubala (Anarkali) is well, mutely expressive. But that's hindsight and the sequences were perhaps inevitable due to the social class barriers between the crown prince and the pretty courtesan, and the romance could not have been an effervescent or exciting one. But nonetheless, the pace slackened and it tested one's patience.Yet when the matters came to head and the affair becomes known to the emperor Akbar, played by Prithviraj Kapoor, in what I believe is one of the finest performances of all times on the silver screen, histrionics go to war before the duel between father and son. Prithviraj Kapoor's eyes erupt with volcanic fire and his face and body display outrage at Salim's insolence. He lashes out, expressing his dissatisfaction first and then issues the diktat of punishing Anarkali, who in his opinion had crossed her limits of permissible freedom of expression. In the same vein, he admonishes his son and issues a threat that summarily means death to the hapless girl.This is when the music of the film scored by Naushad and lyricist Shakeel Badayuni takes centre stage. Considered onevof the most classical compositions of all times, the songs of Mughal-E-Azam are rare gems even by contemporary standards, you marvel listening to them each time, as you discover newer facets of music and lyrics with every replay. ""Mohe Panghat Pe"" represents Hindu mythology and is downright pleasant, and then the numbers start getting more dramatic and intense. When you witness ""Jab Pyar Kiya to Darna Kya"", you wonder whether you should gawk at the beauty of the face that launched a thousand mirrors or see the fiery reactions of the emperor who is being challenged. Then comes my favourite ""Beqas Pe Karam Kijiye Sarkar E Madina"" - the lyrics are good enough to make the heart melt down in total pity for the woman in shackles, seeking freedom from her suffering. The last one with Mohammad Rafi belting out the war cry ""Mohabbat Zindabad"" perhaps underlines the resistance towards the forceful trampling of love sublime by the ruler.Mughal-E-Azam is epic by every standard. It's larger than life, plush, slick, boasts of superlative production values and you cannot find flaws in direction or editing. The film completely justifies its IMDB rating of 8.2 that doesn't wane. The cinematography by R. D. Mathur is par excellence, costumes, makeup, sound, action, art and special effects are simply eye-popping.

10.0,"No hype, not overrated- was unexpectedly DAZZLED by this truly glorious classic-for-a-reason","Note: I've marked the spoiler sign- but this is a well known myth so no surprises here (not even the ending- which is also a popular myth where Anarkali comes back as NurJahan).Prepare to be dazzled. A luscious feast for the senses, the new restored & colorized version allows us to appreciate the fine attention to detail. The colors are breathtaking- and that is when I realized that Sanjay Leela Bhansali- much as I like that director- isn't all that original. K. Asif got there first. Bhansali tried to do the lavish sets, gorgeous costumes, attention to detail, assault of color in Devdas. But K. Asif got there first- and without the digital technology of today.That is only the film's visual victory over your defenses. When there is silence in a scene- you can only just hear the fountains, and the crystal droplets of the ""shama daans"" or lamps tinkling in the soft breeze. And then there are the gorgeous, tight, beautifully written dialogs rendered in chaste Urdu (by all actors, regardless of religion- Prithviraj Kapoor's progeny might like to take a feather off his cap, and polish up their enunciation - really there is no reason why the poet Ghalib must be referred to as Gaalib by today's lazy actors). It was a relief to my ears which are usually accosted in even the best Karan Johar entertainer, by an unfortunately politicized and degraded Hindustani.Then there are the performances. Albeit some performances and dialogs are melodramatic, over-the-top- especially the ones with the mother, Queen Jodha Bai, yet one must understand the requirement of the time, as well as the archetypes that were (and are) close to the heart of the audiences. These often have religious and mythological overtones which most people would immediately have picked up on- the mother, the wife, the beloved.Technically, so much has been said about the cinematography, especially in the dance scene in the Hall Of Mirrors, and the battle scenes- that I wont repeat them- but I'll just say- pay attention to these and remember these scenes were shot despite the limitations of available technology. Amazing! Finally- the fabulous on screen chemistry of Dilip Kumar and Madhubala. With his nuanced acting and the slightest inflection in tone conveying volumes- Dilip Kumar is simply arresting and with her naughty, flirtatious first dance as Radha, Madhubala conveys the passionate Anarkali. Their scenes together are never vulgar or titillating- just terribly erotic- sensuous- again tactile: Prince Salim brushing a feather against Anarkali's skin...Really- there's so much more to write- but I'll just say that there is a reason this is a classic. Enough said.10/10",no hype not overrated was unexpectedly dazzled by this truly glorious classic reason,note ive marked spoiler sign but this is well known myth so no surprises here not even ending which is also popular myth where anarkali comes back as nurjahan prepare be dazzled luscious feast senses new restored colorized version allows us appreciate fine attention detail colors are breathtaking that is when i realized that sanjay leela bhansali much as i like that director isnt all that original k asif got there first bhansali tried do lavish sets gorgeous costumes attention detail assault color devdas but k asif got there first without digital technology today that is only films visual victory over your defenses when there is silence scene you can only just hear fountains crystal droplets shama daans or lamps tinkling soft breeze then there are gorgeous tight beautifully written dialogs rendered chaste urdu by all actors regardless religion prithviraj kapoors progeny might like take feather off his cap polish up their enunciation really there is no reason why poet ghalib must be referred as gaalib by todays lazy actors it was relief my ears which are usually accosted even best karan johar entertainer by unfortunately politicized degraded hindustani then there are performances albeit some performances dialogs are melodramatic over top especially ones with mother queen jodha bai yet one must understand requirement time as well as archetypes that were are close heart audiences these often have religious mythological overtones which most people would immediately have picked up mother wife beloved technically so much has been said about cinematography especially dance scene hall mirrors battle scenes that i wont repeat them but ill just say pay attention these remember these scenes were shot despite limitations available technology amazing finally fabulous screen chemistry dilip kumar madhubala with his nuanced acting slightest inflection tone conveying volumes dilip kumar is simply arresting with her naughty flirtatious first dance as radha madhubala conveys passionate anarkali their scenes together are never vulgar or titillating just terribly erotic sensuous again tactile prince salim brushing feather against anarkalis skin really theres so much more write but ill just say that there is reason this is classic enough said 10 10,0.5853211414435904,0.2088324940365756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Greatest of all !,"Mughal-E-Azam - 1960Great! Yes! Each and everything in Mughal-E-Azam is great that can make you watch it several times even for 3 hours. Reviewing this masterpiece will be insignificant, so here are the tons of appreciations.One of the best screenplay ever written with unbeatable dialogues with beautiful use of Urdu language by director-writer K.Asif. The best screenplay is performed by the brilliant actors, whether it's a lead role or just a few minute appearances, all of them are admirable. Prince Saleem(Dilip Kumar) falls in love with Anarkali(Madhubala), a dancer in their palaces and goes against all the royal chic and king Akbar(Prithviraj Kapoor). All the characters are very well played and dialogue delivery, oh my god, such powerful dialogues and excellent delivery by each and every character and a brilliant voice over as well. If it comes to music and dance, totally amazing, properly suits the situations and very well composed and choreographed. Another highlight is the grand sets of the movie that are used to make the great grand palace of king Akbar, all interiors and exteriors are very accurately and beautifully designed. It was originally made and released as Black and White film in 1960 and was digitally colored and re-released later on.Mughal-E-Azam is a great grand creation of a great grand story which will be remembered forever and will be at the top for many-many generations.",greatest all,mughal e azam 1960great yes each everything mughal e azam is great that can make you watch it several times even 3 hours reviewing this masterpiece will be insignificant so here are tons appreciations one best screenplay ever written with unbeatable dialogues with beautiful use urdu language by director writer k asif best screenplay is performed by brilliant actors whether its lead role or just few minute appearances all them are admirable prince saleem dilip kumar falls love with anarkali madhubala dancer their palaces goes against all royal chic king akbar prithviraj kapoor all characters are very well played dialogue delivery oh my god such powerful dialogues excellent delivery by each every character brilliant voice over as well if it comes music dance totally amazing properly suits situations very well composed choreographed another highlight is grand sets movie that are used make great grand palace king akbar all interiors exteriors are very accurately beautifully designed it was originally made released as black white film 1960 was digitally colored re released later mughal e azam is great grand creation great grand story which will be remembered forever will be at top many many generations,0.6085858585858586,0.4851010101010101,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
