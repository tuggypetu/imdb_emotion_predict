1,I'm so sorry I went,"Look, I have a strong stomach, but I have no use for Torture Porn in my entertainment. A few weeks ago, I saw a preview of this film that gave no indication of it's true nature. This, plus the intriguing poster led me to believe this was going to be a brooding drama in the Hitchcock tradition. Instead, I found myself watching the ugliest, most disgusting film I have ever attended of my own free will. I should have guessed when the cashier gave me a funny look while getting my ticket.The first thing I realized was the script was by an amateur. The scenes and dialog jumping around with no thought or subtlety. Like other reviewers, I knew who the torturing villain was within the first few minutes. But, I still had to sit through several scenes of dismemberment and pain, which made me sick. Sick that I had spent money to watch this disaster.I can't imagine why Lindsay Lohan would agree to be in this production. There are other venues to stretch her acting talents. Neal McDonough and Julia Ormond's rent must have been due.The story, such as it is has at it's core an interesting premise. A top director might have made a respectable film out of it with a total rewrite, without the gore and more atmosphere.This movie is an absolute, total disaster. No one involved has anything to be proud of.",im so sorry i went,look i have strong stomach but i have no use torture porn my entertainment few weeks ago i saw preview this film that gave no indication its true nature this plus intriguing poster led me believe this was going be brooding drama hitchcock tradition instead i found myself watching ugliest most disgusting film i have ever attended my own free will i should have guessed when cashier gave me funny look while getting my ticket first thing i realized was script was by amateur scenes dialog jumping around with no thought or subtlety like other reviewers i knew who torturing villain was within first few minutes but i still had sit through several scenes dismemberment pain which made me sick sick that i had spent money watch this disaster i cant imagine why lindsay lohan would agree be this production there are other venues stretch her acting talents neal mcdonough julia ormonds rent must have been due story such as it is has at its core interesting premise top director might have made respectable film out it with total rewrite without gore more atmosphere this movie is absolute total disaster no one involved has anything be proud,0.5496543778801843,0.07354070660522273,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10,Great moment,"I discovered this movie in 2021 on Prime after reading a review in a french horror magazine.It was entertaining, sexy, disturbing, sometimes too slow, but for me it was fun.I enjoyed the colors, the mood, the plans and ideas of the filmmaker.Despite i didn't care a lot about Lindsay before, i must admit she played with a lot of intensity and is really beautiful in this movie.I don't really get the hate this movie has received in 2007 !I would give it a good 7/10 but because of the others rating i push it to 10/10.The DVD could be placed on a shelf near Hannibal, Red Dragon or some italian Giallo !",great moment,i discovered this movie 2021 prime after reading review french horror magazine it was entertaining sexy disturbing sometimes too slow but me it was fun i enjoyed colors mood plans ideas filmmaker despite i didnt care lot about lindsay before i must admit she played with lot intensity is really beautiful this movie i dont really get hate this movie has received 2007 i would give it good 7 10 but because others rating i push it 10 10 dvd could be placed shelf near hannibal red dragon or some italian giallo,0.51,0.19,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
2,One of the Worst Thrillers of the 2000's,"Combine Twin Peaks, Brian De Palma's Sisters and the latest disney channel star to fall off the production line with an incoming DUI and you have one of the most poorly received suspense thrillers of the 2000's. Us this is not (or it could be, i haven't seen it) as Lindsay Lohan stars in I Know who Killed Me.The film's rather basic story revolves around a student's twin who was abducted and tortured by a sadistic serial killer. She manages to make it out alive but after she regains consciousness in the hospital she insists that her identity is that of another woman.The music score by Joel McNeely is as Hollywood as they come and it ranges from ill fitting orchestral melodies to just plain unlistenable clanging on a piano as if the player's hands were made of potatoes. Parts of this soundtrack are genuinely some of the worst that I have ever heard in an internationally released film.Director Chris Sivertson splooged his VHS collection all over the screen and blinded us all so that we can't make head nor tail of what's going on half the time. There are other reasons why this film is both equal parts predictable yet incomprehensible and we'll get to those, but for now it must be said that the director's visual platitudes make the eyes grow weary with their pointlessness and them serving as reminders that there are several films out there much better than this doing more or less the same in both story and presentation.Apart from Lohan's desperate attempts at credibility, torture porn being shoehorned into this chaste old school thriller is the most 2008 thing about this film. Whilst these scenes are effective, they serve no purpose and just date the film in the most hilarious and original way.Coming now to the unsung arsonist of the staggering dumpster fire that is this film is first (and last time apparently) screenwriter Jeff Hammond. The dialogue is wall smashing levels of on the nose and beyond belief is the film's overall concept, most likely due to the complete absence of likeable characters to distract us from it's high concept spastication.Lindsay Lohan is terrible in this, clearly relying on the bratty charm that worked for her in the Disney period of her career, but it is woefully out of place here in this edgy as balls 'erotic' thriller.Speaking of which, there was a no nudity clause in her contract, yet there is a lengthy sex scene as well as extended pole dancing scenes with her? The skilfulness of an actress should never be defined by her cup size, but why even have these scenes even when their purpose it to be erotic? Nudity also definitely would have gone a long way towards helping Lohan shake off the Disney dandruff. Sadly, it's all perfectly understandable. Lohan was going through a really bad time in her life when this film was being made with TMZ shadowing her every move and encouraging her ever increasing self-destructive behaviour. It was a disgraceful scene that showed a side of the film industry everyone would have liked to forget existed. Until Twitter happened that is and made paparazzi scum out of you all. Nude scenes probably would have just fanned the flames regarding Lohan's situation in the late 2000's.I'll conclude by saying that I Know Who Killed Me is total amateur hour despite having a lot of veteran Hollywood talent working on it. Lohan is hopelessly immature, the direction is insipid and the screenplay is a mess. Some scenes are effective, but only by pure luck alone. Overall the film is just aimless tedium.",one worst thrillers 2000s,combine twin peaks brian de palmas sisters latest disney channel star fall off production line with incoming dui you have one most poorly received suspense thrillers 2000s us this is not or it could be i havent seen it as lindsay lohan stars i know who killed me films rather basic story revolves around students twin who was abducted tortured by sadistic serial killer she manages make it out alive but after she regains consciousness hospital she insists that her identity is that another woman music score by joel mcneely is as hollywood as they come it ranges ill fitting orchestral melodies just plain unlistenable clanging piano as if players hands were made potatoes parts this soundtrack are genuinely some worst that i have ever heard internationally released film director chris sivertson splooged his vhs collection all over screen blinded us all so that we cant make head nor tail whats going half time there are other reasons why this film is both equal parts predictable yet incomprehensible well get those but now it must be said that directors visual platitudes make eyes grow weary with their pointlessness them serving as reminders that there are several films out there much better than this doing more or less same both story presentation apart lohans desperate attempts at credibility torture porn being shoehorned into this chaste old school thriller is most 2008 thing about this film whilst these scenes are effective they serve no purpose just date film most hilarious original way coming now unsung arsonist staggering dumpster fire that is this film is first last time apparently screenwriter jeff hammond dialogue is wall smashing levels nose beyond belief is films overall concept most likely due complete absence likeable characters distract us its high concept spastication lindsay lohan is terrible this clearly relying bratty charm that worked her disney period her career but it is woefully out place here this edgy as balls erotic thriller speaking which there was no nudity clause her contract yet there is lengthy sex scene as well as extended pole dancing scenes with her skilfulness actress should never be defined by her cup size but why even have these scenes even when their purpose it be erotic nudity also definitely would have gone long way towards helping lohan shake off disney dandruff sadly its all perfectly understandable lohan was going through really bad time her life when this film was being made with tmz shadowing her every move encouraging her ever increasing self destructive behaviour it was disgraceful scene that showed side film industry everyone would have liked forget existed until twitter happened that is made paparazzi scum out you all nude scenes probably would have just fanned flames regarding lohans situation late 2000s ill conclude by saying that i know who killed me is total amateur hour despite having lot veteran hollywood talent working it lohan is hopelessly immature direction is insipid screenplay is mess some scenes are effective but only by pure luck alone overall film is just aimless tedium,0.4962380952380952,0.011756410256410266,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9,i can't understand why people hate this movie,"To me it is great, and a lot more original than some other movies. The actors deliver a very good performance, especially Aubrey's parents and the FBI. The use of the color blue as an artistic theme was impressive and added a special feel to the movie that is somewhere between.horror and fantastic. The only down to it is that there were some plot holes and I think the ending was a bit abrupt, to me it would have been possible to stretch a little after the final scene.",i cant understand why people hate this movie,me it is great lot more original than some other movies actors deliver very good performance especially aubreys parents fbi use color blue as artistic theme was impressive added special feel movie that is somewhere between horror fantastic only down it is that there were some plot holes i think ending was bit abrupt me it would have been possible stretch little after final scene,0.7452954144620811,0.18235670194003528,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.24}"
5,"Very strange, but not terrible","My friend and I were looking for a movie to see in the theater yesterday, everything I saw she didn't ad everything she saw I didn't, but one movie we didn't see was I Know Who Killed Me. We never heard of it, we actually for a minute didn't wanna see it because Lindsay Lohan was in it, but eventually we were just like ""What the heck?"". We needed a couple hours to kill and had free movie tickets that we got as a gift. So after seeing I Know Who Killed Me, I just was thinking of how much of a strange movie this was, but at the same time I didn't think it was all that bad, there were some things left unexplained and the ending was pretty lame, but I think over all, this was a thriller with good potential and just needed a little pick-me-up.Aubrey is a good girl who has strong potential to be a good writer and piano player, she has a good life, good home, loving parents, good friends, and a loving boyfriend. One night though, she is kidnapped and brutally tortured. Someone finds her on the road, but when Aubrey is picked up and taken to the hospital, she says she's not Aubrey, she's Dakota Moss, a stripper with a dirty life who has no idea what's going on, but she's not Aubrey. Is this a story that she's believing too much? Is this a possible side effect from being traumatized? Is this something from the drugs the killer was making her take? Or is she even right? Is it a possibility that she really isn't Aubrey? Everyone calls her crazy and just tries to make her believe that she is Aubrey, but Dakota searches for the truth and wants answers.Like I said, I Know Who Killed Me turned out to be a little surprise of a film, I liked it personally, there were things that were confusing, but over all I think the plot kept me guessing and going. Lindsay I would say did a good job, but the strip scenes at times were a little too much, just because we all know her personal life, so I think it would make us a little uncomfortable. There are some flaws to the film, but I wouldn't say to stay away, just keep your mind open and you might find yourself liking it.5/10",very strange but not terrible,my friend i were looking movie see theater yesterday everything i saw she didnt ad everything she saw i didnt but one movie we didnt see was i know who killed me we never heard it we actually minute didnt wanna see it because lindsay lohan was it but eventually we were just like what heck we needed couple hours kill had free movie tickets that we got as gift so after seeing i know who killed me i just was thinking how much strange movie this was but at same time i didnt think it was all that bad there were some things left unexplained ending was pretty lame but i think over all this was thriller with good potential just needed little pick me up aubrey is good girl who has strong potential be good writer piano player she has good life good home loving parents good friends loving boyfriend one night though she is kidnapped brutally tortured someone finds her road but when aubrey is picked up taken hospital she says shes not aubrey shes dakota moss stripper with dirty life who has no idea whats going but shes not aubrey is this story that shes believing too much is this possible side effect being traumatized is this something drugs killer was making her take or is she even right is it possibility that she really isnt aubrey everyone calls her crazy just tries make her believe that she is aubrey but dakota searches truth wants answers like i said i know who killed me turned out be little surprise film i liked it personally there were things that were confusing but over all i think plot kept me guessing going lindsay i would say did good job but strip scenes at times were little too much just because we all know her personal life so i think it would make us little uncomfortable there are some flaws film but i wouldnt say stay away just keep your mind open you might find yourself liking it 5 10,0.5272981366459626,0.07997929606625259,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.24}"
7,Has improved with age,"This movie came at the height of Lindsay's legal troubles so it was disregarded as an awful film at the time of release I remember, but I honestly consider this to be one of Lindsay Lohan's best films when it comes to darker and more serious work as an actress minus her comedy and family-friendly roles. For me this film has improved with age. It was not released at a time that it would have been found relevant.What was partly misunderstood about this film was it was marketed as a serious horror film that was intended to be frightening but instead it is more of a David Lynch and Twin Peaks kind of thing with an ambiguous ending and a mystery / crime storyline more than a horror one.This film captivates me each time I give it a watch. I would have liked Lindsay to explore more edgy roles in her past career during this time. The ending is quite eerie because it could almost go either way.I think this film is not as bad as Lindsay's Legal troubles would tell you it is. For someone like myself not looking to hate it, or hate on the actress/actors, I find it an enjoyable crime mystery. One of Lindsay's better roles for a more mature minded audience.I know some would find it ridiculous anyone could genuinely enjoy this movie. But it is just such a wacky premise and the themes are deliberate. It's competently acted, and the ending that didn't sit well at first, has improved with age.I think it's unfortunate that audiences didn't appreciate this film, but seeing as it has improved with age, and has kind of a timeless dreamlike quality to it. I would go as far to say this could be considered a cult classic some day. Maybe in 30 years someone else might appreciate this film only at face value.",has improved with age,this movie came at height lindsays legal troubles so it was disregarded as awful film at time release i remember but i honestly consider this be one lindsay lohans best films when it comes darker more serious work as actress minus her comedy family friendly roles me this film has improved with age it was not released at time that it would have been found relevant what was partly misunderstood about this film was it was marketed as serious horror film that was intended be frightening but instead it is more david lynch twin peaks kind thing with ambiguous ending mystery crime storyline more than horror one this film captivates me each time i give it watch i would have liked lindsay explore more edgy roles her past career during this time ending is quite eerie because it could almost go either way i think this film is not as bad as lindsays legal troubles would tell you it is someone like myself not looking hate it or hate actress actors i find it enjoyable crime mystery one lindsays better roles more mature minded audience i know some would find it ridiculous anyone could genuinely enjoy this movie but it is just such wacky premise themes are deliberate its competently acted ending that didnt sit well at first has improved with age i think its unfortunate that audiences didnt appreciate this film but seeing as it has improved with age has kind timeless dreamlike quality it i would go as far say this could be considered cult classic some day maybe 30 years someone else might appreciate this film only at face value,0.6412280701754386,0.09583333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.26}"
1,"""BarbWire was better than this""","That's right, my girlfriend turned to me in the movie and said, ""I think BarbWire was better than this."" Her opinion and mine seemed to carry through to the whole audience in the advance screening we went to last night. The audience was laughing at the horrible acting, terrible script and crap camera work.Specifics: Lohan works in a strip club where women are topless, yet she never takes the top off and even in sheer bra has pasties on (or were the pasties on top of the bra?). I could care less about seeing her naked, but if you are playing a stripper you might have to at least imply nudity with well placed hands.Someone decided to inject humor into the movie into the most awkward places. The biggest problem was trying to figure out why people were laughing more during the ""serious parts"" than the ""funny parts"".Characters come in, spout some wisdom and disappear behind a rock like the Dungeon Master. I have a feeling that they are supposed to be angels, maybe God himself? The twists in the movie are tough to swallow. I will not even come close to ruining them, they are not even worth ruining. Someone thought they could write a M. Knight script, but failed.Overall, this movie would be worth a rental from the dollar kiosk at the grocery store, as long as everything else is sold out. I am glad I got in for free. If you do decide to spend money to see this movie, send me the cash instead, I will then hit you in the groin, you will enjoy it more.",barbwire was better than this,thats right my girlfriend turned me movie said i think barbwire was better than this her opinion mine seemed carry through whole audience advance screening we went last night audience was laughing at horrible acting terrible script crap camera work specifics lohan works strip club where women are topless yet she never takes top off even sheer bra has pasties or were pasties top bra i could care less about seeing her naked but if you are playing stripper you might have at least imply nudity with well placed hands someone decided inject humor into movie into most awkward places biggest problem was trying figure out why people were laughing more during serious parts than funny parts characters come spout some wisdom disappear behind rock like dungeon master i have feeling that they are supposed be angels maybe god himself twists movie are tough swallow i will not even come close ruining them they are not even worth ruining someone thought they could write m knight script but failed overall this movie would be worth rental dollar kiosk at grocery store as long as everything else is sold out i am glad i got free if you do decide spend money see this movie send me cash instead i will then hit you groin you will enjoy it more,0.5264208909370199,0.01925243215565796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.51}"
8,A giallo at heart!,"I'm going to start this off with an unpopular take. This is not a bad movie. When I first met my wife, she used to tell me how much she loved it and I thought she was crazy. Surely, everyone online that went out of their way to destroy it had to be right, right?Wrong. Go with me on this alternative universe logic - if Lindsey Lohan were a disgraced movie star in 1967 instead of 2007, she would have gone to Italy to make movies for directors like Bava, Argento, Martino and Antonio Margheriti. She would have been in the same company as Anita Ekberg, Florinda Bolkan, Elke Somer and even Edwige Fenech.The film has all the hallmarks of giallo: a serial killer is abducting, torturing and killing young women in the suburb of New Salem. An evening of fun for Aubrey Fleming (Lohan) turns into weeks of torture as she wakes up bound and gagged on an operating table, her hands deep in dry ice.The FBI Task Force has already given up hope of finding the killer, but a driver discovers Aubrey on a deserted road in the middle of the night. To the shock of her parents, she declares that she's really a stripper named Dakota Moss and has no idea who Aubrey Fleming is. And then she realizes that she's missing her hand and half of her leg.At this point, you're either going to give up on this movie or dive in. I advise diving right in.While the police, the doctors and her parents believe that this is all PTSD, Aubrey/Dakota insists that she is not who anyone thinks she is. Things get weirder when FBI agents discover a story on Aubrey's laptop about a girl with an alter ego named Aubrey. And DNA confirms that Dakota really is Aubrey. This inversion of identity is key to the main tenets of classic giallo.Dakota has a theory of her own: She's Aubrey's twin sister and her injuries are Corsican Brothers-like (or Tomax and Xamot, if you prefer) sympathetic wounds as she experiences the plight of her symbiotic sibling.Sure, her mother has a pregnancy ultrasound that shows only one fetus. But Dakota confronts her father (or Aubrey's, stay with me) as she believes that her mother lost that child soon after its birth and that she and Aubrey were the twin children of a crack addict named Virginia Sue Moss. Aubrey was taken to live in comfort city mouse style while she stayed with Moss, trailer park mouse style. The complication? Virginia Sue Moss was yet another character from Aubrey's short story.Richard Roeper claims that this is the worst movie of the 2000s, calling the film ""a ridiculous thriller (minus the thrills)"" and saying that it's filled with a"" nonsensical plot that grows sillier by the second, tawdry special effects, heavy-handed symbolism that's big on electric-blue hues and mechanical performances are all culprits as far as the title's concerned."" Has Roeper even seen a giallo? Because reading that sentence makes me want to watch this movie all over again!Back to the movie: Dakota starts to see visions of the killer slicing up his captive which draws her to the cemetery. As she investigates the grave of another victim, Aubrey's friend Jennifer, she finds a blue ribbon from a piano competition. Aubrey was a noted pianist and there's a note attached from her (and Jennifer's) piano teacher, Douglas Norquist. As her father (or Aubrey's, look, it's not a giallo if you don't get confused) looks on, she declares, ""I know who killed me.""That's because the ribbon says, ""Blue Ribbons Are For Winners, Never Settle For The Red, Rest In Peace, Douglas."" It's a metaphor for the lives of the twins: Aubrey is the blue chipper with a boyfriend that loves her, good grades, plenty of friends and a bright future. Dakota works in the red light district and faces a life of poverty.Without any police backup - again, this happens all the time in giallo - they confront Norquist. Daniel is killed before Aubrey leaves the safety of the car and enters the house. She fights Norquist, cutting off his hand, before she's tied up. He asks her why she returned after he buried her alive before she frees herself and kills him. She heads into the woods where she digs up Aubrey, verifying that she was not insane and had been right all along. Then, she lies on the ground with her twin sister.Some of the few critics who liked this movie compared it to Brian DePalma or David Lynch films. Sure. Or you could go right to the source - Italy.If you replaced the score of the film (that said, I love that The Sword and The Melvins are heard in this film) with some insane synth or orchestral music (someone get Claudio Simonetti, Piero Umiliani or Morricone on the line), if you made the homes space age lounges filled with improbable furniture and if you had more than one scene of Lohan stripping (any of the sex in this movie is honestly the unsexiest sex ever, they should have really studied Sergio Martino movies), this movie would fit perfectly into my DVD collection between Hatcher for the Honeymoon and Inferno. Who am I kidding? It's on my shelf already!This is not the first time Lohan played twins on film, thanks to starring in the remakes of Freaky Friday and The Parent Trap. Again, this is perfect giallo casting - not to mention pure exploitation - showing her gone to seed as two twins who couldn't be more different.However, this was not an easy movie to film for director Chris Sivertson, as Lohan had an appendix operation during shooting. Plus, there were times when she would not show up at all - necessitating a body double be used to film the end of the movie. Even worse, she was followed by paparazzi throughout the shoot and some of them are still in the background of a few shots! There are giallo techniques used throughout the film, such as a neon sign outside the strip club that foreshadows Dakota's injuries and the fact that Bava-esque blue and red lighting determines which character is on screen between Aubrey and Dakota.While so many decry this film for not making any sense, if you've made it through any number of classics (sure, the director claims Hitchcock as a primary influence, but you can say that he's the well from which all giallo flows) like The Bird With the Crystal Plumage or Deep Red or Lizard in a Woman's Skin, you're going to be just fine. The world was just ready to devour Lindsey Lohan and this film would be its sacrificial lamb. Oh if only there were an Italian film industry for her to turn to and appear alongside Ivan Rassimov!",giallo at heart,im going start this off with unpopular take this is not bad movie when i first

5,"Intriguing Premise, Absurd Resolution","In New Salem, the upper-class high-school student and aspiring writer Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) has just quit the piano classes to dedicate to write. When the mutilated body of her missing schoolmate Jennifer Toland is found, the locals grieve the student while the police chase the serial-killer. After a football game, Aubrey is kidnapped and then she is mutilated by the psychopath. A couple of weeks later, Aubrey is found unconscious in a lonely road and brought to the hospital with severed hand and foot in the same modus-operandi Jennifer was mutilated. When she awakes, she tells that she is the stripper Dakota Moss and her junky mother had an overdose and died. When the FBI finds that Dakota is one character of Aubrey's stories, they conclude the girl needs psychiatric treatment and protection. But Dakota insists she is not Aubrey ""I Know Who Killed Me"" has a promising premise of a girl that denies being herself after a traumatic and extremely violent experience. The cinematography is stylish, with blue color for Aubrey and red for Dakota. However, the identity of the killer is easily predictable when Dakota visits Jennifer's parents. Unfortunately, the resolution is absurd and even ridiculous, imaging that what physically happens to Aubrey happens also to Dakota. The secret of Aubrey and Dakota is excellent, but unfortunately wasted in a bad screenplay. Further, most of the characters (FBI agents, Aubrey's boyfriend, the gardener) vanish near the weak conclusion. With improvements in the screenplay, this movie could be great. Nevertheless, the top nomination (9) to the 28th RAZZIE® Awards is unfair.

The torture/mutilation scenes were over the top and needlessly macabre, leaving nothing to the imagination. Remember Silence of the Lambs (1991)? That movie had macabre aspects but it was tastefully done (no pun intended). This movie was tactless and tasteless. What in the world did they think they were doing when they made this movie?! They wasted Lindsey Lohan's talents; I think she tried her best to due justice to the role. Even Julia Ormond's presence could not save this horrid movie. The director did not know what to do with the fine actors that he had in the movie. Of the five movies he has down so far, this is the absolute worst movie that Silvertson has ever directed.

7,"Intriguing, Original Thriller, But With Faults.","""I Know Who Killed Me"" is about a young college student named Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan), who disappears one night while going out with some friends. She is found on the side of road weeks later, still alive, with her hand and leg viciously amputated by her captor. But when she awakens in the hospital, Aubrey claims to be somebody else... a woman named Dakota Moss, a rough-living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as Aubrey, and that the real Aubrey Fleming is still in mortal danger. Aubrey's worried parents try and uncover the truth, while Dakota tries to convince others that she isn't Aubrey... but is Aubrey really just pretending to be someone else? Is she suffering from a psychological problem triggered by her kidnapping and torture? Or could Dakota really perhaps be a real person? Watch and find out.After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I'm not a fan of Lohan particularly, but this film looked good. Unfortunately, it has its ups and downs, but overall I thought it was a pretty good horror/thriller. The plot is original in its essential form, but does contain some clichés here and there - all things considered though, this is an original premise that deals with certain scenarios not often seen in cinema (if at all). It's a mystery film, and it did do a very solid job at keeping the viewer guessing. The expected twists and turns take place as well, and I thought for the most part the plot twists were fairly well thought-out. You don't really know what to think or expect for the first hour or so, as the story is pieced together linking Aubrey and Dakota, and whether or not they are in fact one person. I did become a little confused at moments, and there were a few plot holes (which I expected considering the complex storyline), but overall I didn't see anything that affected the course of the movie. Things pieced together fairly nicely before anything became too much of a problem, but there were some holes that needed filling.Another thing that succeeds in this movie is the cinematography, it was really beautifully shot. Color (mainly the color blue) plays a vast amount of significance in the story, and while it is there for a purpose, it almost seems too obvious because the color pops up continuously in practically every scene. Still, beautiful cinematography and some stylish editing get good points in my book, and this movie had both. Even in the sexual stripteases done by the Dakota character (where Lindsay's body is the main focus), the color use and cinematography shine. Good soundtrack as well that plays along with the flow of the film quite well, and really adds to the movie's energy. I was surprised at the amount of violence in this movie, but don't dismiss it if you are thinking it's something along the lines of a blatant torture flick, because this movie has a lot more to it than just that, unlike the recent trend of horror flicks that are nothing but one big gory torture show. ""I Know Who Killed Me"" manages to pack some suspense and tension that are vital to a good horror and/or thriller, and there were quite a few really scary scenes. Strangely enough, there is some unexpected humor to be found in the movie as well. One scene in particular was really quite funny, and while I'm not sure if it made the film less believable or was in it's favor, I know it made me laugh a few times.As for the acting, I think a lot of people are slamming this movie unfairly because of it's lead actress, Lindsay Lohan. Whatever the reason that some may despise her, I'll put it like this - if it were another actress playing the lead, people wouldn't be as harsh as they are. Honestly, I think Lindsay gave one of the best performances of her career (so far) in this movie. Her previous films mainly consist of pointless teeny-bopper trash, so I respect her for doing something with a little more depth, and while her acting and delivery is a bit flat on occasion, she carries this movie well. Julia Ormand and Neil McDonaugh play her concerned and confused parents, and both do a good job in their roles too. As for the big secret ending (which I won't reveal here), I thought it was fitting. The showdown between Lindsay and the killer, while a bit contrived, was pretty scary, as was the villain. The explanation behind the Aubrey/Dakota mystery was really strange, and I wasn't expecting it to turn out the way it did, but I think that's a good thing. It may be a bit of a stretch for some because of the obscure subject (and the revelation seemed to kind of come out of nowhere), but I liked it for being different and not what I'd normally expect in a twist ending.Overall, ""I Know Who Killed Me"" is a different but original horror/thriller. Cinematography was excellent, the storyline (while a little problematic at times) was original and very intriguing, there are some pretty creepy scenes, and the big plot twist was different from the norm. The acting wasn't that bad either, don't judge the movie by it's lead actress - I'm not a big fan of her either, but I found her to be fairly solid here. Recommended to horror and thriller fans if you're interested in a bit of a strange but nonetheless interesting movie. It's got a few plot holes and problems, but as I see it, the good outweighed the bad, and I was happy with the two hours I spent at the theater. 7/10.",intriguing original thriller but with faults,i know who killed me is about young college student named aubrey fleming lindsay lohan who disappears one night while going out with some friends she is found side road weeks later still alive with her hand leg viciously amputated by her captor but when she awakens hospital aubrey claims be somebody else woman named dakota moss rough living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as aubrey that real aubrey fleming is still mortal danger aubreys worried parents try uncover truth while dakota tries convince others that she isnt aubrey but is aubrey really just pretending be someone else is she suffering psychological problem triggered by her kidnapping torture or could dakota really perhaps be real person watch find out after seeing trailer this movie i knew i had see it im not fan lohan particularly but this film looked good unfortunately it has its ups downs but overall i thought it was pretty good horror thriller plot is original its essential form but does contain some clich s here there all things considered though this is original premise that deals with certain scenarios not often seen cinema if at all its mystery film it did do very solid job at keeping viewer guessing expected twists turns take place as well i thought most part plot twists were fairly well thought out you dont really know what think or expect first hour or so as story is pieced together linking aubrey dakota whether or not they are fact one person i did become little confused at moments there were few plot holes which i expected considering complex storyline but overall i didnt see anything that affected course movie things pieced together fairly nicely before anything became too much problem but there were some holes that needed filling another thing that succeeds this movie is cinematography it was really beautifully shot color mainly color blue plays vast amount significance story while it is there purpose it almost seems too obvious because color pops up continuously practically every scene still beautiful cinematography some stylish editing get good points my book this movie had both even sexual stripteases done by dakota character where lindsays body is main focus color use cinematography shine good soundtrack as well that plays along with flow film quite well really adds movies energy i was surprised at amount violence this movie but dont dismiss it if you are thinking its something along lines blatant torture flick because this movie has lot more it than just that unlike recent trend horror flicks that are nothing but one big gory torture show i know who killed me manages pack some suspense tension that are vital good horror or thriller there were quite few really scary scenes strangely enough there is some unexpected humor be found movie as well one scene particular was really quite funny while im not sure if it made film less believable or was its favor i know it made me laugh few times as acting i think lot people are slamming this movie unfairly because its lead actress lindsay lohan whatever reason that some may despise her ill put it like this if it were another actress playing lead people wouldnt be as harsh as they are honestly i think lindsay gave one best performances her career so far this movie her previous films mainly consist pointless teeny bopper trash so i respect her doing something with little more depth while her acting delivery is bit flat occasion she carries this movie well julia ormand neil mcdonaugh play her concerned confused parents both do good job their roles too as big secret ending which i wont reveal here i thought it was fitting showdown between lindsay killer while bit contrived was pretty scary as was villain explanation behind aubrey dakota mystery was really strange i wasnt expecting it turn out way it did but i think thats good thing it may be bit stretch some because obscure subject revelation seemed kind come out nowhere but i liked it being different not what id normally expect twist ending overall i know who killed me is different but original horror thriller cinematography was excellent storyline while little problematic at times was original very intriguing there are some pretty creepy scenes big plot twist was different norm acting wasnt that bad either dont judge movie by its lead actress im not big fan her either but i found her be fairly solid here recommended horror thriller fans if youre interested bit strange but nonetheless interesting movie its got few plot holes problems but as i see it good outweighed bad i was happy with two hours i spent at theater 7 10,0.4965765936004033,0.10377078609221464,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"

7,It's much better than people are saying,"This movie has unfairly gotten a lot of hate, and I honestly can't see why. Well, ok, that's not exactly true. A big part of it is that it came out during a time where Lohan's career was at an all time low and the public pretty much hated her. That hatred was projected onto this movie, and so people began to hate it by default. I even know people who claimed they ""hated"" it when they hadn't even seen it. You can't make that claim without watching it first.The movie has a pretty interesting premise. It's a murder mystery involving twin stigmata. From what I've heard, however, most people were expecting some kind of twist at the end where it's revealed that the twins are actually the same person. When the movie didn't go that route, people were upset. That seems to be another reason why people primarily hated the movie. Personally, I think it was smart not to do that. Twin stigmata in movies is not something we've seen that often, but movies with a plot twist like that have been something we've seen a thousand times. The fact that so many people thought that's what would happen proves that. So people were upset that they didn't have some grand twist. Instead, the movie gave you exactly what it promised and was exactly what it was made out to be. Simple, but still good.Overall, I say to give the movie a chance. Ignore the hate you've heard about it and go in expecting it to be what it is, a simple murder mystery involving twin stigmata. Is it a masterpiece? No, of course not, but it's still a pretty good movie that will keep you entertained for an hour 45, and that's perfectly ok.",its much better than people are saying,this movie has unfairly gotten lot hate i honestly cant see why well ok thats not exactly true big part it is that it came out during time where lohans career was at all time low public pretty much hated her that hatred was projected onto this movie so people began hate it by default i even know people who claimed they hated it when they hadnt even seen it you cant make that claim without watching it first movie has pretty interesting premise its murder mystery involving twin stigmata what ive heard however most people were expecting some kind twist at end where its revealed that twins are actually same person when movie didnt go that route people were upset that seems be another reason why people primarily hated movie personally i think it was smart not do that twin stigmata movies is not something weve seen that often but movies with plot twist like that have been something weve seen thousand times fact that so many people thought thats what would happen proves that so people were upset that they didnt have some grand twist instead movie gave you exactly what it promised was exactly what it was made out be simple but still good overall i say give movie chance ignore hate youve heard about it go expecting it be what it is simple murder mystery involving twin stigmata is it masterpiece no course not but its still pretty good movie that will keep you entertained hour 45 thats perfectly ok,0.558061224489796,0.06683673469387755,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.24}"

7,This film is crazy and Lohan is hot (even with bits missing!).,"It's easy to see how I Know Who Killed Me has garnered so many unfavourable reviews, since it doesn't follow the standard rules of your typical Hollywood horror, and stars Lindsay Lohan, whose popularity has been steadily waning since her much reported 'drunken episodes'. But to label the film as crap is doing it an injustice: had it been made in Italy, it probably would've gone down a storm with fans of Euro-horror.With its preposterous plot laden with totally bonkers moments, a crazy killer who is revealed only in the film's closing moments, and over-stylised direction with a strong use of colour, I Know Who Killed Me shares a lot in common with Italian horror, and, in particular, the 'giallo' genre of movies: horror/thrillers that are often weak on story, but loaded with great visuals.Considering I was expecting this Lindsay Lohan vehicle to be a tame, teen-friendly Hollywood horror, I was actually rather pleasantly surprised by its absurdity (but then I love Argento films, which rarely make sense).In addition to the constantly surprising narrative, viewers are also treated to some surprisingly nasty bits of gore, but, unfortunately, no nekkidness from the star (although there are still a couple of moments in which she does turn up the heat: as a stripper performing a pole dance, and during a sex scene).Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, a pretty teen who becomes the latest victim of a serial killer who has been abducting girls and cutting off their limbs before leaving them to die. Eventually, the girl is discovered, mutilated, but still alive, and is taken to hospital. But when she is interviewed by the FBI, she claims that her name is Dakota, and she has no recollection of her attacker...Things go a little crazy from this moment onwards, and those who prefer their horror to be completely believable need not bother to watch any furtherany film that features a stigmatic twin who falls apart for no apparent reason isn't going to impress your 'average' cinema-goer. I, however, was in the mood for some silliness and found the film pretty entertaining, despite being a tad overlong.By no means a modern horror classic, but not the complete waste of time that some claim it to be, I Know Who Killed Me is something a little different in a genre currently packed with predictable gore-fests, awful sequels and dodgy remakes. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",this film is crazy lohan is hot even with bits missing,its easy see how i know who killed me has garnered so many unfavourable reviews since it doesnt follow standard rules your typical hollywood horror stars lindsay lohan whose popularity has been steadily waning since her much reported drunken episodes but label film as crap is doing it injustice had it been made italy it probably wouldve gone down storm with fans euro horror with its preposterous plot laden with totally bonkers moments crazy killer who is revealed only films closing moments over stylised direction with strong use colour i know who killed me shares lot common with italian horror particular giallo genre movies horror thrillers that are often weak story but loaded with great visuals considering i was expecting this lindsay lohan vehicle be tame teen friendly hollywood horror i was actually rather pleasantly surprised by its absurdity but then i love argento films which rarely make sense addition constantly surprising narrative viewers are also treated some surprisingly nasty bits gore but unfortunately no nekkidness star although there are still couple moments which she does turn up heat as stripper performing pole dance during sex scene lohan plays aubrey fleming pretty teen who becomes latest victim serial killer who has been abducting girls cutting off their limbs before leaving them die eventually girl is discovered mutilated but still alive is taken hospital but when she is interviewed by fbi she claims that her name is dakota she has no recollection her attacker things go little crazy this moment onwards those who prefer their horror be completely believable need not bother watch any further any film that features stigmatic twin who falls apart no apparent reason isnt going impress your average cinema goer i however was mood some silliness found film pretty entertaining despite being tad overlong by no means modern horror classic but not complete waste time that some claim it be i know who killed me is something little different genre currently packed with predictable gore fests awful sequels dodgy remakes 6 5 out 10 rounded up 7 imdb,0.5124503968253967,-0.011557539682539678,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"

1,Oh God,"I went into this movie with a friend thinking it would be a cheesy, fun horror movie - just a good way to pass the time on a rainy day.Oh god, was I wrong.It's as if the director spent the film's entire budget acquiring Lindsay Lohan and disregarded everything else. EVERYTHING within this film is bad - the scary parts aren't scary (or even remotely suspenseful), the dialogue is awful, the acting is questionable at best, and, I am very sorry to say that Lindsay Lohan's stripping/ sex scenes were not sexy at all. On top of everything else, the killer was obvious and the plot didn't even make a whole lot of sense. Even the quality of film used is inferior to the type normally used (yes, you can tell).Some films are so bad they're good. This film was just SO BAD.Don't wait for the DVD.

1,The Top Seventeen Ways I Knew Who Blue Me,"1. Unbelievably, it isn't a Writer's Guild violation to complete a screenplay on used toilet paper. 2. Bloody stripper poles simply cannot be a turn on, but, the show must go on.3. In this case, yes, you would have to be a rocket scientist to understand this movie.4. Even the Smurf movies didn't have this much blue in it.5. Fun medical fact #1: hand sawed off? Finger mysteriously detached? Wrap a towel around the stub and sometimes hold up above heart until the pain disappears and you're okay again. NOTE: sometimes two towels are needed.6. Fun medical fact #2: Being buried alive isn't all that bad. The average stigmata twin can survive hours with little to no air. Unfortunately, this really only applies to stigmata twins, so yeah, don't try this in your own backyard.7. When your daughter thinks she's a twin, prove her wrong with a ready-to-play video of just her in your womb before birth.8. One of the Lohans states ""Hospitals are for rich people"" when she refuses assistance for her severed finger. Yeah, rich people and idiots that don't know they help anyone regardless of wealth.9. Wish my phone battery lasted hours after its low-battery alarm alerts me like the more crucial battery did in this movie.10. It's doubtful the best way to announce a classmate has been recovered dead over the PA and repeatedly is: ""Jennifer Toland's body was found.""11. Also, don't ever, EVER, ask a teacher for details on your classmate's ""found body."" She honestly may not have too much more to say than ""Jennifer Toland's body was found"" after the 1½ seconds of information she was given.12. Maybe, in 2007, the world wasn't ready for the real Lindsay Lohan meltdown. No, not even with two Lohans.13. And speaking of which, this is the third time Lohan played two characters in the same film after The Parent Trap and Freaky Friday. This probably explains a lot of her real life problems.14. Flashback to The Room and Birdemic with the split-second finding of Jerrod in a busy crowd when one of the Lohans' been wished luck in tracking him down.15. If only this took place during summer vacation because you'd one helluva story/movie to tell the following year.16. They accomplished Movie Cliché #158, or ""set up a murder-mystery with tons of oh-sooo suspicious characters,"" so well, you can't take your eyes off that devilish little hairless creature of a pet they have and yet, never see again.17. Mercifully, through the quicksand of a script, there were enough unintentionally hilarious scenes and facial expressions to at least keep the viewer awake.",top seventeen ways i knew who blue me,1 unbelievably it isnt writers guild violation complete screenplay used toilet paper 2 bloody stripper poles simply cannot be turn but show must go 3 this case yes you would have be rocket scientist understand this movie 4 even smurf movies didnt have this much blue it 5 fun medical fact hand sawed off finger mysteriously detached wrap towel around stub sometimes hold up above heart until pain disappears youre okay again note sometimes two towels are needed 6 fun medical fact being buried alive isnt all that bad average stigmata twin can survive hours with little no air unfortunately this really only applies stigmata twins so yeah dont try this your own backyard 7 when your daughter thinks shes twin prove her wrong with ready play video just her your womb before birth 8 one lohans states hospitals are rich people when she refuses assistance her severed finger yeah rich people idiots that dont know they help anyone regardless wealth 9 wish my phone battery lasted hours after its low battery alarm alerts me like more crucial battery did this movie 10 its doubtful best way announce classmate has been recovered dead over pa repeatedly is jennifer tolands body was found 11 also dont ever ever ask teacher details your classmates found body she honestly may not have too much more say than jennifer tolands body was found after 1 seconds information she was given 12 maybe 2007 world wasnt ready real lindsay lohan meltdown no not even with two lohans 13 speaking which this is third time lohan played two characters same film after parent trap freaky friday this probably explains lot her real life problems 14 flashback room birdemic with split second finding jerrod busy crowd when one lohans been wished luck tracking him down 15 if only this took place during summer vacation because youd one helluva story movie tell following year 16 they accomplished movie clich or set up murder mystery with tons oh sooo suspicious characters so well you cant take your eyes off that devilish little hairless creature pet they have yet never see again 17 mercifully through quicksand script there were enough unintentionally hilarious scenes facial expressions at least keep viewer awake,0.4830921257391846,0.035021786492374724,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1,Was this film a joke?,"This film was treacherous. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be taken seriously or not. I'm not sure if there was supposed to be some sort of imagery or artfulness in the film with a lot of blue, because it turned out really obvious and lame. Her car is blue, the rose is blue, the torture tools are blue, BLUE BLUE BLUE. Lohan's acting is not wonderful in this film, not to mention the plot is horrendous. Most people probably take an interest either because of seeing Lohan dance on a pole or to see Lohan with missing limbs. If that's what you're looking for this is the movie. Other than that, the plot is laughable and the film is just a total bust in general. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it's awful and a waste of time. 0/10.",was this film joke,this film was treacherous im not sure if it was supposed be taken seriously or not im not sure if there was supposed be some sort imagery or artfulness film with lot blue because it turned out really obvious lame her car is blue rose is blue torture tools are blue blue blue blue lohans acting is not wonderful this film not mention plot is horrendous most people probably take interest either because seeing lohan dance pole or see lohan with missing limbs if thats what youre looking this is movie other than that plot is laughable film is just total bust general i wouldnt recommend this movie anyone its awful waste time 0 10,0.4478535353535353,-0.10795454545454546,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.33}"
