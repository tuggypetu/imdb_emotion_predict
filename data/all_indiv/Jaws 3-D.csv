5.0,"Mediocre, but Oscar worthy compared to part IV.","Saw this one in all its 3D glory in the theater back in 1983, and it really scared the heck out of me. (I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall, and Mike is (heh, heh, heh,) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening, some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say, some people get eaten.This film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists, but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people, it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting, and full of bloody carnage.The cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera, though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park, and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Englishmen who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.The individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them, one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition, sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar, but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater, but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater, but now look ludicrous and forced.This film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",mediocre but oscar worthy compared part iv,saw this one all its 3d glory theater back 1983 it really scared heck out me i was ten this film furthers saga brody family as sons sean mike are now fully grown moved away amity island sean does something colorado if i recall mike is heh heh heh underwater welder who just finished construction undersea kingdom at sea world florida just when park is about have grand opening some uninvited guests show up they being 35 foot great white shark her offspring needless say some people get eaten this film was originally going be made as spoof previous two films im not sure if any type finished script that effect exists but it would be worth look jaws 3d ends up being another serious monster movie with disaster movie subplot not only does shark eat bunch people it also traps several others underwater part park race is save people kill mother shark her baby dies midway through after it is captured hastily put display park conclusion is fairly exciting full bloody carnage cast is one stronger points film dennis quaid is fearless mike brody bess armstrong plays parks head biologist quaids love interest real sparks were apparently flying between quaid lea thompson off camera though thompson plays water skier at park john putch plays sean brody who falls her simon maccorkindale p h moriarity play couple englishmen who show up help battle sharks by far best performance is turned by louis gossett jr fresh off his oscar officer gentleman he plays owner manager president im really not sure which park he has terrific moment as he addresses park guests underwater tunnels over p system he turns fake executive public relations charm asks them all calmly exit park just as giant shark is bearing down them individuals who play dan liz left lot be desired since no other film credits are listed them one would have conclude that they actually worked at sea world were given these roles since this is what they do daily basis maybe they still work there anyone know sharks look pretty good most scenes except at very end when shark is lodged into control room its tail is sticking out that looked incredibly fake addition sharks must always stay moving water or theyll die they cant just lay low huge underwater structures waiting pounce their victims they usually strike directly underneath their victims most attack scenarios big shark this film also has ability growl roar but not as loudly as one part iv 3d effect looked very good theater but films like this lose quite bit their luster tv screen youre only left with bunch gag shots that were supposed scare viewers theater but now look ludicrous forced this film made some pretty decent its theatrical run is still shown regularly television if nothing else is you find yourself front tv extended period give this film try but be forewarned part iv is perhaps worst film ever made dont waste your time that one 5 10 stars hound,0.5231399391568884,0.0668126177024482,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.44}"
6.0,Campy fun.,"I actually like this Jaws ok. I don't think it is a masterpiece or anything, but it is good if not taken to seriously. This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt. One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously). I actually saw this one at the theater too, so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it. The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny, then you find out there is a bigger one out there. There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater. This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it.",campy fun,i actually like this jaws ok i dont think it is masterpiece or anything but it is good if not taken seriously this one focuses brodie boys who really went through growth spurt one dennis quaid works at sea amusement park this is where shark attacks take place this should alone tell you not take film seriously i actually saw this one at theater too so that helps enjoy film more as it was rather cool 3 d it is only 3 d movie i have ever seen at theater so maybe that is why i will always somewhat enjoy it plot is at sea park like i said first team goes after this one shark that was rather puny then you find out there is bigger one out there there are couple pretty good shark attack scenes i loved subplot people stuck that pod underwater this film isnt everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one worst so read other peoples reviews before deciding see it,0.5328947368421053,0.19956140350877194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,"Stupid plot, rubbish effects and almost no tension to speak of","Mike Brody appears to be totally over the events that struck his family in his youth and now works in Florida's newest underwater attraction  Seaworld. His brother, Sean is less sure and never goes in the water  although a visit to see Mike and a new girlfriend help him confront his fear if not get over it. Meanwhile, something is picking off staff and swimmers getting Mike and the staff out on a shark hunt. They capture a small great white and take it into captivity, only for it to die when it is put in too small a tank. They think their problems are over until an examination of the bite marks on some bodies and they realize that the shark that did the killing is much, much bigger than the one they caught.I saw this film as a child but couldn't remember if it was any good or not  my childish fears may have made it scary even if the film was poor, so I decided to give it a go again recently. The first thing that struck me was the sheer rubbishness of the effects. In the original Jaws, Spielberg had hidden the shark as much as he could because the effects didn't work (and also therefore upping the tension); however here the makers just decide to show anything  a poorly superimposed image, a rubber shark, fake severed arms and so on  none of them are concealed, they are all shown up in all their rubbish glory. I could forgive it this due to its age but two other films had already managed to handle this issue before this film so I don't see why they went this route when it so clearly didn't work. Some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken for being a spoof (witness the shark swimming towards the control room).Of course, after the poor effects the second thing that hits you is the laughable plot. True it is not as bad as part 4 in terms of plausibility but it is still pretty thin. No attempt is made to really give the characters any sort of, well, character and the very basic sea world plot just about manages to give the shark enough high profile feeding scenes to keep the film moving  just don't hold your breath for any logic or sense. In fact, the opposite is true and this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what the writers were thinking when they conceived some of this stuff! The manner of Jaws' death here would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn pathetic. Even with the plot being poor the film should still have had at least a few moment of fear and tension  many of us fear being eaten alive so it isn't hard to draw on that, but this fails to have any tension or excitement to speak of. The effects suck a lot of this out  but a director who's name is listed in the dictionary alongside the work 'workmanlike' didn't do anything to stop the rot either.Without characters the cast are set adrift with nothing to do  how Quaid must have envied Roy Schnieder in the first films, at least he was a good character. Quaid runs around the place, Armstrong screams, Putch broods, Thompson screams and Gossett tries to act tough in the middle of a script that gives him nothing to do. I don't blame the cast but I am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was to make a happy ending out of the dolphins surviving while so many other people had not!Overall this is just a bad film. I'm not a big one for lists so I'll not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone.",stupid plot rubbish effects almost no tension speak,mike brody appears be totally over events that struck his family his youth now works floridas newest underwater attraction seaworld his brother sean is less sure never goes water although visit see mike new girlfriend help him confront his fear if not get over it meanwhile something is picking off staff swimmers getting mike staff out shark hunt they capture small great white take it into captivity only it die when it is put too small tank they think their problems are over until examination bite marks some bodies they realize that shark that did killing is much much bigger than one they caught i saw this film as child but couldnt remember if it was any good or not my childish fears may have made it scary even if film was poor so i decided give it go again recently first thing that struck me was sheer rubbishness effects original jaws spielberg had hidden shark as much as he could because effects didnt work also therefore upping tension however here makers just decide show anything poorly superimposed image rubber shark fake severed arms so none them are concealed they are all shown up all their rubbish glory i could forgive it this due its age but two other films had already managed handle this issue before this film so i dont see why they went this route when it so clearly didnt work some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken being spoof witness shark swimming towards control room course after poor effects second thing that hits you is laughable plot true it is not as bad as part 4 terms plausibility but it is still pretty thin no attempt is made really give characters any sort well character very basic sea world plot just about manages give shark enough high profile feeding scenes keep film moving just dont hold your breath any logic or sense fact opposite is true this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what writers were thinking when they conceived some this stuff manner jaws death here would be hilarious if it wasnt so darn pathetic even with plot being poor film should still have had at least few moment fear tension many us fear being eaten alive so it isnt hard draw that but this fails have any tension or excitement speak effects suck lot this out but director whos name is listed dictionary alongside work workmanlike didnt do anything stop rot either without characters cast are set adrift with nothing do how quaid must have envied roy schnieder first films at least he was good character quaid runs around place armstrong screams putch broods thompson screams gossett tries act tough middle script that gives him nothing do i dont blame cast but i am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was make happy ending out dolphins surviving while so many other people had not overall this is just bad film im not big one lists so ill not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all plot is poor effects are rubbish direction is weak script just load nonsense there is total lack tension thrills or excitement original is classic this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone,0.5380569023569023,-0.06814478114478113,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,Terrible special effects but I liked it anyway,"*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Jaws invades an underwater park. The idea was great. The problem is the special effects were terrible. I missed it when it came out in theaters so I never got to experience the 3-D phenomenon. Maybe that would have made a difference but I doubt it.A giant shark attacking a Sea World like park was a great starting point. But it's hard to get scared of Jaws when he looks like the shark at Universal Studios. I mean he was one plastic shark. I need to believe Jaws is a real shark inflicting terror. This time, I didn't. He was definitely a big toy floating in the water. The climax scene was the worst of all.SPOILER ON ENDINGJaws goes headfirst through the window of the control room. In 3-D, this might have been cool. In the tape I saw, it looked awful. Although the effects were rotten, I still find myself enjoying this flick. Face it, all the Jaws sequels have a very high bar set for them. They are not going to even get close to the original ""Jaws"". For a B giant shark flick, it was pretty good. Comparing it to ""Jaws"" is unfair but also unavoidable. Even though I know the effects were bad, I still liked it. It was the best ""Jaws"" sequel.",terrible special effects but i liked it anyway,spoiler alert spoiler alert jaws invades underwater park idea was great problem is special effects were terrible i missed it when it came out theaters so i never got experience 3 d phenomenon maybe that would have made difference but i doubt it giant shark attacking sea world like park was great starting point but its hard get scared jaws when he looks like shark at universal studios i mean he was one plastic shark i need believe jaws is real shark inflicting terror this time i didnt he was definitely big toy floating water climax scene was worst all spoiler endingjaws goes headfirst through window control room 3 d this might have been cool tape i saw it looked awful although effects were rotten i still find myself enjoying this flick face it all jaws sequels have very high bar set them they are not going even get close original jaws b giant shark flick it was pretty good comparing it jaws is unfair but also unavoidable even though i know effects were bad i still liked it it was best jaws sequel,0.6755811287477954,0.04789329805996472,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,The better of the Jaws sequels.,"This is Jaws' second sequel, which I think is the best of the three following the original movie. The sons of Roy Scheider's Chief Brody character, Mike and Sean, take center stage. Mike and girlfriend Kathryn Morgan are marine biologists at a Seaworld theme park. They discover a baby shark, which happened to be trapped inside the park, and later perishes. To their surprise, the scientists also discover that its 35-foot mother, a huge Great-White shark, is also trapped inside and is hungry; therefore, they try to evacuate Seaworld before any casualties strike.The special effects were bit of a downgrade from the first two movies, with the shark's execution being less realistic and horrific; in some scenes, you could hear the animatronics and machinery that the crew used to operate the animal. Alan Parker did a fine job on the music score, I think, and also incorporated John Williams' famous shark theme.While this film was pretty much slammed by many critics and viewers, even garnering several Razzie Award nominations, I actually thought the movie was exciting and more fun to watch than Jaws II. Having the setting inside a water theme park rather than the usual beaches in a small town is a neat idea, and seeing the Seaworld workers reacting to the idea that a huge Great White is inside the park, where thousands of visitors are, and trying desperately to find a plan to evacuate the park and capture the shark is suspenseful. The acting is descent and plot is fast-paced. Director Joe Alves did a pretty good job making the movie.There are more surprises and thrilling moments, I think, than in the previous movie. My favorite scene is the part where the Great White swims toward the viewing glass from the park's control room, puncturing the glass, letting water rush in and sending every person inside swimming for their lives.Overall, Jaws III doesn't match the original film in fright and shock value, but is what I think the better of the three sequels.Grade B",better jaws sequels,this is jaws second sequel which i think is best three following original movie sons roy scheiders chief brody character mike sean take center stage mike girlfriend kathryn morgan are marine biologists at seaworld theme park they discover baby shark which happened be trapped inside park later perishes their surprise scientists also discover that its 35 foot mother huge great white shark is also trapped inside is hungry therefore they try evacuate seaworld before any casualties strike special effects were bit downgrade first two movies with sharks execution being less realistic horrific some scenes you could hear animatronics machinery that crew used operate animal alan parker did fine job music score i think also incorporated john williams famous shark theme while this film was pretty much slammed by many critics viewers even garnering several razzie award nominations i actually thought movie was exciting more fun watch than jaws ii having setting inside water theme park rather than usual beaches small town is neat idea seeing seaworld workers reacting idea that huge great white is inside park where thousands visitors are trying desperately find plan evacuate park capture shark is suspenseful acting is descent plot is fast paced director joe alves did pretty good job making movie there are more surprises thrilling moments i think than previous movie my favorite scene is part where great white swims toward viewing glass parks control room puncturing glass letting water rush sending every person inside swimming their lives overall jaws iii doesnt match original film fright shock value but is what i think better three sequels grade b,0.4610942249240122,0.1948328267477204,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.31}"
3.0,Another inferior and embarrassing sequel from Spielberg classic,"The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley's novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy) , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary Jaws I,II) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then, an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.It's an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws, except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to ¨Revenge of the creature¨(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to ¨Back to the future¨) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves, producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by Jeannot Swarc,Joe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel, a real turkey. Only for theaters, its real asset are the 3D digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities.",another inferior embarrassing sequel spielberg classic,great white goes back into cinema this flawed sequel this bone chilling movie based peter benchleys novel written by richard matheson carl gottlieb screenwriter trilogy it packs some exciting scenes thrills chills lousy direction film is developed at florida seaside park while previous entries are set at new england shore community named amity there people is terrorized by giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at undersea kingdom during preview week underwater world that contains restaurant cafeteria aquarium several other things sons dennis quaid john putch police chief brody roy scheider lorraine gary jaws i ii attempt convince park owner louis gossett jr who reluctantly listen them close attraction meanwhile giant shark attacks victims run afoul making real carnage those serving lunch then adventurer named phillip simon maccorkindale his helper determine track down kill it protagonists are forced fight their lives mortal confrontation its inferior following with average creation tension thrills terror emotions brief gore story gets little relation first two jaws except by father sheriff brody sons relationship argument this gratuitous following is partially similar revenge creature jack arnold which also monster terrorizes sea park shark attack images deliver exciting united creepy score composed conducted by alan parker inspired classic soundtrack by master john williams prized with oscar who heightens suspense this below average movie features lousy interpretations quintet main star dennis quaid bess armstrong louis gossett jr john putch lea thompson formerly back future regular cinematography by james contner subsequently filmmaker is badly directed by joe alves producer designer original film while classic picture by spielberg obtained three oscars well deserved today considered authentic classic its tree sequels are much worst were respectively directed by jeannot swarc joe alves joseph sargent annoying direction rating bottom barrel real turkey only theaters its real asset are 3d digital effects that reason television lost their spectacular tri dimensional qualities,0.4317079745651175,-0.03959235209235207,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.46}"
7.0,A great BAD Movie of the last 30 years,"I am a sick, sick man. I love hokey, cheesy movies. And horror/thrillers never fail to turn out as such in basket loads. The Original Jaws is a classic in every sense of the word, a genuine edge of your seat thriller, that despite my having seen it 413 times never ceases to make me jump at just the right moments. The first sequel Jaws 2, was just your average, late-1970's rehash, Chief Brody is scared of Sharks, we get it, but not bad either, it had going for it a reasonable number of the original cast and enough of the shark to keep even the most slacked of jaws happy. Jaws: The Revenge (the fourth one) is just trash, stupid and without redeeming value (except Michael Caine, but that is another review). But this little, almost lost gem, is just so great it blinds me as a shining example of how to make a great second sequel without any of the original cast, and being a sequel in name only, Halloween wishes it could the Jaws series, and Highlander, I laugh at you (and not in a good way). A quick rundown of the plot finds MIKE BRODY (son of Roy Scheider, is afflicted with the most interesting aging disease ever, as first he ages too fast, then starts to go backwards), played by Dennis Quaid, who was at the time, near the peak of his cocaine habit. Although to be fair, he keeps it hidden MOST of the time. He was something of a heart-throb in the 80's, and the years since have been kind to him, as he still turns out pretty decent fair and hasn't gotten too ugly with age. He, John Schneider, and Sean Connery should all do a film that compliments their superior genetics. Oh sorry...got off topic for a second. Brody is an UNDERWATER ENGINEER (real likely field of work, given his history, anybody with anything remotely approaching logical reasoning abilities would go and be a farmer in Kansas) who is the leading member of the construction crew finishing up a new addition to Sea World. Lou Gossett Jr. is Calvin Bouchard, an interesting millionaire who owns Sea World and is implied to have dragged himself up by his bootstraps, thus explaining his thick quasi-Cajun accent, and lack of refinement. A lot was made of his being in the film just after his win of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman, but he probably had most of this flick in the can before the awards ceremony (Shark Chow). Bess Armstrong is Brody's girlfriend (fiance) who is also a marine biologist, fortunately for both her and Brody, she has a strange power over dolphins, and that saves them. Simon (Manimal) MacCorkindale makes an appearance as the only person I have ever actually wanted to be eaten by a shark in a movie (and real life too), fortunately the movie doesn't disappoint. We get to see the most annoying member of the Brody men, Mike's brother Sean, who despite having a stated fear of water, spends quite a bit of the film in the water. Keep an eye open for a young Lea Thompson, she dated Quaid for a while after they met making this movie. Needless to say, a shark makes its way into the park, eats a few people (for the relatively few of us who have actually seen the movie in 3-D, it is a pretty neat special effect) and then has to be taken out by Brody. He uses a grenade, borrowed from MacCorkindale's corpse, as it has been decided that the only way for the shark's to go is to be blown to smithereens. Don't worry the dolphins rush Quaid and Armstrong to the surface after the coolest 3-d explosion ever, without worry or mention of the Bends. There is a very special place in my heart for this movie. For some reason I must be the only one, as the next film, just pretends this never happened. Which is sad because this one actually made money at the theaters, and has characters that are relatively easy to care about. Watch Jaws: the Revenge, and you are hoping the entire Brody clan is taken out, not quite the heroes we were hoping for. But this little film is a great time waster. If you don't have a date for Friday night, or if like I once did, you do and she just wants to spend the night with the TV, some popcorn, the couch, a blanket, and you. You really can't go too wrong with this one. It's also a great flick to show the kiddies (I told you I am sick), I showed it to my then 5 year old nephew just before a trip to the beach, and a good time was had by all (although therapy bills are expensive). Get a copy, it's out on DVD (though not in 3-d), make a batch of popcorn, and enjoy your lovely Friday night.",great bad movie last 30 years,i am sick sick man i love hokey cheesy movies horror thrillers never fail turn out as such basket loads original jaws is classic every sense word genuine edge your seat thriller that despite my having seen it 413 times never ceases make me jump at just right moments first sequel jaws 2 was just your average late 1970s rehash chief brody is scared sharks we get it but not bad either it had going it reasonable number original cast enough shark keep even most slacked jaws happy jaws revenge fourth one is just trash stupid without redeeming value except michael caine but that is another review but this little almost lost gem is just so great it blinds me as shining example how make great second sequel without any original cast being sequel name only halloween wishes it could jaws series highlander i laugh at you not good way quick rundown plot finds mike brody son roy scheider is afflicted with most interesting aging disease ever as first he ages too fast then starts go backwards played by dennis quaid who was at time near peak his cocaine habit although be fair he keeps it hidden most time he was something heart throb 80s years since have been kind him as he still turns out pretty decent fair hasnt gotten too ugly with age he john schneider sean connery should all do film that compliments their superior genetics oh sorry got off topic second brody is underwater engineer real likely field work given his history anybody with anything remotely approaching logical reasoning abilities would go be farmer kansas who is leading member construction crew finishing up new addition sea world lou gossett jr is calvin bouchard interesting millionaire who owns sea world is implied have dragged himself up by his bootstraps thus explaining his thick quasi cajun accent lack refinement lot was made his being film just after his win best supporting actor oscar officer gentleman but he probably had most this flick can before awards ceremony shark chow bess armstrong is brodys girlfriend fiance who is also marine biologist fortunately both her brody she has strange power over dolphins that saves them simon manimal maccorkindale makes appearance as only person i have ever actually wanted be eaten by shark movie real life too fortunately movie doesnt disappoint we get see most annoying member brody men mikes brother sean who despite having stated fear water spends quite bit film water keep eye open young lea thompson she dated quaid while after they met making this movie needless say shark makes its way into park eats few people relatively few us who have actually seen movie 3 d it is pretty neat special effect then has be taken out by brody he uses grenade borrowed maccorkindales corpse as it has been decided that only way sharks go is be blown smithereens dont worry dolphins rush quaid armstrong surface after coolest 3 d explosion ever without worry or mention bends there is very special place my heart this movie some reason i must be only one as next film just pretends this never happened which is sad because this one actually made money at theaters has characters that are relatively easy care about watch jaws revenge you are hoping entire brody clan is taken out not quite heroes we were hoping but this little film is great time waster if you dont have date friday night or if like i once did you do she just wants spend night with tv some popcorn couch blanket you you really cant go too wrong with this one its also great flick show kiddies i told you i am sick i showed it my then 5 year old nephew just before trip beach good time was had by all although therapy bills are expensive get copy its out dvd though not 3 d make batch popcorn enjoy your lovely friday night,0.5581715535323782,0.13901013076270807,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,"Not The Worst Of The Sequels, But Close","I had avoided seeing this film for fifteen years because of it's bad reputation and because I love the first Jaws as one of the greatest movies ever made. Having survived the horror of ""Jaws: The Revenge"" once, I decided to see if I could brave this one, though.About the only thing that surprised me was that the premise wasn't quite as dumb as ""Jaws: The Revenge"" is. And while there is a reference to the events of ""Jaws 2"" at least they don't insult our intelligence with a shark pursuing one family etc. of any ""Brody curse.""

4.0,You can't tame a Great white.,"Sea world is under siege from the Great White monster, that's basically the entire plot, throw on the kids from Jaws 1 (all grown up rather quickly,) some cute dolphins, some horrific 3D effects, and a hugely camp performance from Simon MacCorkindale and you have a film.You need to be watching it in 3D or it looks horrific, the effects are bad enough as it is, without 3D they look shocking, floating limbs and fish heads etc.I liked the opening scenes with the music and the dead fish etc. quite atmospheric I guess, I think by now though the Jaws franchise is looking very very tired, Jaws 2 was a fairly decent sequel, but they should have stopped there. The film definitely misses Roy Schneider who was the focal character (apart from the Shark of course.)It's definitely better then Jaws The Revenge which is an absolute waste of time. In shark terms this film would be a Basking Shark, it certainly lacks any bite of any kind. It's a film you watch for a bit of fun, it's hard to take this one seriously. 4/10",you cant tame great white,sea world is under siege great white monster thats basically entire plot throw kids jaws 1 all grown up rather quickly some cute dolphins some horrific 3d effects hugely camp performance simon maccorkindale you have film you need be watching it 3d or it looks horrific effects are bad enough as it is without 3d they look shocking floating limbs fish heads etc i liked opening scenes with music dead fish etc quite atmospheric i guess i think by now though jaws franchise is looking very very tired jaws 2 was fairly decent sequel but they should have stopped there film definitely misses roy schneider who was focal character apart shark course its definitely better then jaws revenge which is absolute waste time shark terms this film would be basking shark it certainly lacks any bite any kind its film you watch bit fun its hard take this one seriously 4 10,0.5880272108843538,-0.0016921768707482885,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.38}"
3.0,Revenge of the 80's: The sequel meets the 3-D fad.,"Jaws 3-D (1983) was not only a sequel to the first two JAWS films, but it was also one of the few movies that took advantage of the rebirth of the 3-D fad that was sweeping Hollywood during the early 80's (see Amityville 3-D and Friday the 13th 3-D). When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.Not recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless.",revenge 80s sequel meets 3 d fad,jaws 3 d 1983 was not only sequel first two jaws films but it was also one few movies that took advantage rebirth 3 d fad that was sweeping hollywood during early 80s see amityville 3 d friday 13th 3 d when film hit video shelves they scrapped whole thing why make 3 d movie first place if youre not going take advantage it when its available home video market video looked bad when it was released as rental many scenes that were shot didnt make any sense or were badly projected movie did poorly at box office after couple years no more mainstream films were presented 3 d movie itself is pretty bad only die hard fans jaws series not recommended unless they re release it 3 d other than that its pretty much worthless,0.5641666666666667,-0.09833333333333331,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.24}"

2.0,"Help, help...we're 90 minutes from the ocean and somehow a killer shark STILL is attacking us!!!","When I began watching ""Jaws 3-D"" I had to laugh. According to IMDB and the film itself, it was filmed at Sea World in Orlando. Well, Orlando is about 90 minutes from the ocean....and there is no way ANY shark could attack there as there are only lakes around the property. I am sure that a lot of other Floridians had to laugh at this as well.The first portion of ""Jaws 3-D"" wasn't that bad. Sure, there were some cheap 3-D tricks reminscent of ""SCTV"" and their 'Dr. Tongue' skits....but the story wasn't too stupid. However as the film progressed, the 3-D stunts got worse as did the horrid underwater sequences and, especially, the plot. We are to believe that a 35 foot Great White shark is angry because its baby was killed (sharks have zero maternal instinct by the way) and it attacks and destroys much of an underwater sea park...and, it growls!! The premise is ridiculous and the whole thing is carried off in the crappiest possible way. For examples, as people are supposedly walking around in tunnels under the sea, it's obvious that the external shots were sloppily added later....and when you see subs and other things under the water, it's obvious they were done using a green screen and VERY poorly added later. On the big screeen this must have been paritcularly jarring to watch! As for the shark itself, despite nearly a decade between this film and the original ""Jaws"", the shark manages to look even LESS lifelike! This is especially true in the ultra-slow motion scene towards the end when it smashes the control room...and ultimately meets its doom. You just have to see it to believe it!!Overall, a dopey movie with abominable special effects. One positive thing, however, about the film...it proves that acting in such a movie will NOT necessarily kill your career or your reputation. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, for example, managed to make this pile of crap and still have some self-respect. Strangely, despite all its many deficiencies...the movie still managed to make money!!If you didn't know, this movie is currently #60 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. I can how it made it, as the list consists of the worst major releases and even after 36 years, folks STILL remember it and hate it.

5.0,Cheesy exercise in 3D effects,"By now the series had descended into laughability, something at a high with this cheesy 3D take on the killer shark theme made to cash in on the short-lived 3D craze of the early '80s. Immediately we're bombarded with those blocky yellow titles that fly out of the screen and get to watch lots of things fly out at us throughout the film's course. Objects include jets of water, a harpoon, the inevitable shark and my favourite, a cheesy severed arm which lingers on the screen for minutes. None of these are as much fun as they were in, say, Friday the 13th Part III. All of these effects are made hilarious by the bad special effects, which are so unrealistic that it looks like little, if any of the film was actually filmed underwater at all!The link with the previous films is so tenuous that you have to wonder just why they bothered at all to associate it with them - surely a clean break would have been a better bet? This time Dennis Quaid plays the far too-young hero, and it's hard to believe that he went on to quite a successful career after his bad performance here. At least he isn't alone, as just about all of the cast are stupid and unconvincing in this film - with the possible exception of an under-used Louis Gossett Jr, who is pretty cool as the chief of the theme park who has to face up to the consequences of his playing with nature.The people are a clichéd bunch as per usual - there's the clean-cut girl, the ""risky"" younger brother who gets himself in trouble, two imported British actors as a pair of hunters who plan to trap the shark, plus loads of forgettable youngsters who fade from the memory the instant the film finishes (although one of them, Lea Thompson, would go on to forge out her own Hollywood career). The plot is merely a string of clichés, and you can pretty much guarantee that what you see here has been done before - there's even a group of people being trapped in one location with time running out, a disaster movie staple if ever there was one. The rubber shark is overused here too, making it unrealistic and in places ludicrous.The whole idea of a complex being attacked by sharks is done a lot better in the recent hit thriller DEEP BLUE SEA, which at least doesn't take itself too seriously and remains frequently exciting. Exciting is about as far as you can get from JAWS 3, which also totally fails to build up any suspense that its predecessors sustained - here, at the climax, you just think ""that's it?"" instead of sitting back in satisfaction with the previous two films. You may think that the idea of a mother shark coming back to avenge the death of her young is a clever one, but go back twenty-three years previously and you'll notice it was already done in GORGO anyway.Seen in 3D, the effects are entirely primitive and not a patch on those of, say, HOUSE OF WAX, made a good three decades earlier. There's a fairly effective sense of depth throughout, and the underwater photography looks good. The ""jump out"" scenes are less effective and just look fake for the most part, the worst being the superimposed bookending dolphins of the final shot; it's like they saved the worst for last.But perhaps I'm being too harsh. Whilst bad, JAWS 3 isn't quite the worst film ever made. Some scenes are cool - I loved the close-up of the slimy, worm-infested mutilated head we see in one instance, which undoubtedly helped to earn this film a 15 certificate. It's also watchable on a schlocky level, and sometimes reaches the level of bad '70s disaster flicks like METEOR and others. The best I can say about this film is that it's rarely boring (only at the beginning, which takes half an hour to get going). You may think that things couldn't get worse after this, but JAWS: THE REVENGE followed four years later...",cheesy exercise 3d effects,by now series had descended into laughability something at high with this cheesy 3d take killer shark theme made cash short lived 3d craze early 80s immediately were bombarded with those blocky yellow titles that fly out screen get watch lots things fly out at us throughout films course objects include jets water harpoon inevitable shark my favourite cheesy severed arm which lingers screen minutes none these are as much fun as they were say friday 13th part iii all these effects are made hilarious by bad special effects which are so unrealistic that it looks like little if any film was actually filmed underwater at all link with previous films is so tenuous that you have wonder just why they bothered at all associate it with them surely clean break would have been better bet this time dennis quaid plays far too young hero its hard believe that he went quite successful career after his bad performance here at least he isnt alone as just about all cast are stupid unconvincing this film with possible exception under used louis gossett jr who is pretty cool as chief theme park who has face up consequences his playing with nature people are clich d bunch as per usual theres clean cut girl risky younger brother who gets himself trouble two imported british actors as pair hunters who plan trap shark plus loads forgettable youngsters who fade memory instant film finishes although one them lea thompson would go forge out her own hollywood career plot is merely string clich s you can pretty much guarantee that what you see here has been done before theres even group people being trapped one location with time running out disaster movie staple if ever there was one rubber shark is overused here too making it unrealistic places ludicrous whole idea complex being attacked by sharks is done lot better recent hit thriller deep blue sea which at least doesnt take itself too seriously remains frequently exciting exciting is about as far as you can get jaws 3 which also totally fails build up any suspense that its predecessors sustained here at climax you just think thats it instead sitting back satisfaction with previous two films you may think that idea mother shark coming back avenge death her young is clever one but go back twenty three years previously youll notice it was already done gorgo anyway seen 3d effects are entirely primitive not patch those say house wax made good three decades earlier theres fairly effective sense depth throughout underwater photography looks good jump out scenes are less effective just look fake most part worst being superimposed bookending dolphins final shot its like they saved worst last but perhaps im being too harsh whilst bad jaws 3 isnt quite worst film ever made some scenes are cool i loved close up slimy worm infested mutilated head we see one instance which undoubtedly helped earn this film 15 certificate its also watchable schlocky level sometimes reaches level bad 70s disaster flicks like meteor others best i can say about this film is that its rarely boring only at beginning which takes half hour get going you may think that things couldnt get worse after this but jaws revenge followed four years later,0.5643344155844154,-0.025326028138528134,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"

4.0,"It could have worked, but DOES NOT","I'm certain if you read the screenplay for this third entry in the Jaws franchise you'd think it could amount to a solid sequel. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it at least adds many new elements to the Jaws formula. Where it all goes wrong is in the execution. The acting, direction, and production values are way, way below what they should have been. The 3-D effects are ridiculous. They bring to mind a SCTV parody of 3-D films, with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. Compare this to something like The Creature From The Black Lagoon, or It Came From Outer Space- those films were 3-D but play perfectly well as flat films. But those were made by people with talent, this film is not.There's also the weird idea of using the Sea World park, but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions- it's a strange bit of promotional advertising. The real Sea World is quite different, and yet it's shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. A better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. The scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. The use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. The old Flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes.The effects are wretched. In fact, had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste, but they are totally amateurish, below that of a Roger Corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. One expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a mega-hit.The actors offer nothing here. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset have shown remarkable talent, but none of it is on display here. Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson are both very attractive, but again they don't really add anything, and Thompson seems especially vapid here.

10.0,3rd demension IS terror!,"By far, this is the most innovative of the whole series! I mean, come on! SEA WORLD! Terror at Sea World! You don't get any better than this, and I must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10",3rd demension is terror,by far this is most innovative whole series i mean come sea world terror at sea world you dont get any better than this i must say acting score development all written with intellect i do not care what any one says this film is true piece work with same type opening p o v shot deep blue ocean which was missed jaws 2 this one has creepy feeling beginning admittingly first two films preceeding this have it beat many areas but not all very idea not one but two sharks sea world as its grand opening takes place is just freaky special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3 d glasses however film is still enjoyable watch alan parker povides film with new kind shrieking score that makes feel little eerie as original shark theme is put test brought new level scary what most call boring is intellectual discussions that main characters speak as they being adults must deal with water crises most mature way they can different ideas murder explosions captivity are all order evening as exposition is revealed later film takes plunge when hungry mamma is let out all hell breaks loose literally not so much scares as shocks are what draws me this film every minute is worth while never trust ocean it is always full suprises all wrong ways yes 3rd demension is pure terror jaws 3 d will not fail serve audiences with real bang boom 9 10,0.4948585329399283,0.12113719613719615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Jaws 3 a unique movie and not just a remake!!!,"JAWS 3 is one of my favorite childhood movies, I was so glad they did not make JAWS 3 take place on Amity Island where it would be just another remake of the first JAWS like JAWS 2 was, they went in an interesting direction, took a gamble and to some it worked and to some it did not the same can be said for HALLOWEEN III which is also a good movie. Joe Alves is a great director and his vision for the film works for me. If I were to complain about anything it would be the lack of people being eaten by the Great white Shark, especially during the water skiing scene where no one die I think at least one person should have gotten the big bite. The underwater scenes were done very well and in 3-D looked fantastic, I think a lot of the bad rap JAWS 3 gets are from those who have only seen the 2-D version, it is a shame that theaters can't do 3-D anymore it would be fun to have these classic 3-D movies pop up at your local Multiplex from time to time. On a final note The soundtrack to JAWS 3 by Alan Parker is outstanding.",jaws 3 unique movie not just remake,jaws 3 is one my favorite childhood movies i was so glad they did not make jaws 3 take place amity island where it would be just another remake first jaws like jaws 2 was they went interesting direction took gamble some it worked some it did not same can be said halloween iii which is also good movie joe alves is great director his vision film works me if i were complain about anything it would be lack people being eaten by great white shark especially during water skiing scene where no one die i think at least one person should have gotten big bite underwater scenes were done very well 3 d looked fantastic i think lot bad rap jaws 3 gets are those who have only seen 2 d version it is shame that theaters cant do 3 d anymore it would be fun have these classic 3 d movies pop up at your local multiplex time time final note soundtrack jaws 3 by alan parker is outstanding,0.5757575757575757,0.22689393939393943,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,"Not What We've Come To Expect, But Not As Bad As You've Heard.","While this work is inferior to the first two installments, this is still enjoyable. The story line is a bit recycled, and the ""son of"" factor does detract a bit, but the entertainment quality is still present, and the atmosphere generated herein is above par.The effects were great, but the performances were of a ""B"" Movie-quality. That was the main detractor from this work, and was most contributory in the low numbers this work receives.

8.0,A really good movie.,"Yes, i give this a 8 out of 10 points because i like it. I liked it back in 83/84 and still like it today, thats a good thing. To me, the jaw is more scary in this third part then in the first part for example. You can nicely see his body and its just scary to see how big he is. The plot is also very interesting, about a water park that opens his doors for the first time with some nice people working their that gives the movie a lot of fun times to watch. No stupid characters and some moments are really good like when the shark attacks some of the underwater parts of the park or when the dolphins helps the people fight the jaw.

5.0,Not as bad as they say!!!,"First of all, the movie fails mainly due to the 3D effects (sorry for my English, I'm a Spaniard!) 'cause they wanna be more than they're. Sometimes, they look laughable, but the physical effects are awesome (the great great white). I appreciate this movie 'cause this is a movie of my childhood. I saw and recorded it on TV, and I grew with Mike and Kathryn, my right heroes!!!.Now, I'm conscious about the film's mistakes, but, for a third installment, the result ins't so bad. The plot couldn't innovate the genre, but the idea of a baby shark and his angry mother is... so childish and imaginative. Otherwise the idea of a shark attack in a aquatic park is fabulous. I think that if they made this movie without the 3D effect it looked better. Sometimes, the scales don't agree, and the ""lake"" looks deeper than it is, for example. The ending, with the mother breaking the control room's glass is... funny (and ridiculous) ...The characters are well performed, but I saw this film on the Spanish version, so the ""dubbing actors"" could act better than the original actors. Because of that, I don't understand why Louis Gosset Jr. was nominated for a Razzie award ¿?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.This movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones, but...worthy and entertaining. If the effects weren't 3D, the movie was totally fabulous. But, furthermore there was the 80s. It doesn't look so bad for being 80s. Isn't it?",not as bad as they say,first all movie fails mainly due 3d effects sorry my english im spaniard cause they wanna be more than theyre sometimes they look laughable but physical effects are awesome great great white i appreciate this movie cause this is movie my childhood i saw recorded it tv i grew with mike kathryn my right heroes now im conscious about films mistakes but third installment result inst so bad plot couldnt innovate genre but idea baby shark his angry mother is so childish imaginative otherwise idea shark attack aquatic park is fabulous i think that if they made this movie without 3d effect it looked better sometimes scales dont agree lake looks deeper than it is example ending with mother breaking control rooms glass is funny ridiculous characters are well performed but i saw this film spanish version so dubbing actors could act better than original actors because that i dont understand why louis gosset jr was nominated razzie award relationship mike kathryn sean kelly are convincing this movie is far being worst series its clearly weaker than first ones but worthy entertaining if effects werent 3d movie was totally fabulous but furthermore there was 80s it doesnt look so bad being 80s isnt it,0.6348214285714285,0.07738095238095241,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"
1.0,"Jaws 3, Audience 0","It took three screenwriters (Carl Gottlieb, Michael Kane, and the estimable Richard Matheson) to concoct what is surely the lamest suspense movie in history. Chief Brody's oldest son has grown up and become Dennis Quaid, working as a manager at Sea World Florida; after receiving a visit from his sea-shy brother, Quaid, girlfriend Bess Armstrong (who resembles Lorraine Gary, the original Mrs. Brody), and other park employees capture a Great White shark--a feat they will live to regret! Originally shown in 3-D, the movie-monster is mainly seen via underwater stock footage. When an actual Jaws is required, director Joe Alves unveils nothing more than a rubberized dummy. Alves has fun foisting severed limbs (not to mention the head of a fish!) at the camera in an attempt to raise chills, but any audience worth their salt won't be rooting for the swimmers.
