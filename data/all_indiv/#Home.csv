10,A relatable... Feel good movie,"Rojin Thomas, who had a promising directorial debut with Philips and the Monkey Pen, seems to have recaptured some of the magic of his debut in #Home. More than a part of that magic is owing to the presence of Indrans, who has delivered a heartfelt performance. From the scenes depicting his struggles with the smartphone - portraying effectively an entire generation's struggles with technology which came late into their lives - to the ones of him hiding his feelings from the eyes of his family, Indrans makes Oliver relatable and endearing. Even without the 'extraordinary' back story. Oliver is made extraordinary by Indrans' portrayal of the ordinary man.",relatable feel good movie,rojin thomas who had promising directorial debut with philips monkey pen seems have recaptured some magic his debut more than part that magic is owing presence indrans who has delivered heartfelt performance scenes depicting his struggles with smartphone portraying effectively entire generations struggles with technology which came late into their lives ones him hiding his feelings eyes his family indrans makes oliver relatable endearing even without extraordinary back story oliver is made extraordinary by indrans portrayal ordinary man,0.6303571428571428,0.2119047619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.18}"

10,"A feel good, funny, family movie with an amazing message","Never thought I would write a review for a family drama. But #Home is not just a funny, feel good movie but it takes the viewers through an amazingly thought-provoking journey into the life of Mr Oliver Twist, a gentle and kind-hearted dad who tries to keep pace with the tech savvy generation addicted to their mobile phones. His cute attempts to learn how to use a smart phone and social media is endearing. Equally sad is the way his sons take him for granted, ignores his futile efforts to make a conversation with them. While eventually they realise their mistakes, the way the movie portrays the family dynamics is remarkable. Kudos to the writer, director and all the actors especially Indrans who have done an amazing job of fitting into the role of Oliver Twist so well.

9,FILM OF THE YEAR!! And likely to remain so. Home is an Emotional Masterpiece journey into your life which you live daily but don't actually Live it.,"#Home (2021) : Movie Review -Malayalam Cinema is unstoppable in 2021. From Classics like 'The Great Indian Kitchen', 'Operation Java', 'Drishyam 2', 'Nayattu' to other great films like 'Aarkkariyam', 'Malik' and 'Kututhi' to couple of more notable films like 'Joji' and 'Cold Case', Malayalam Cinema is giving away quality content with open hands. I have seen all these films so now i am eligible to state my opinion clearly. ""#Home"" is FILM OF THE YEAR so far and is likely to remain so because it is almost impossible to bring such an outstanding content in so great manners. For me, #Home has also surpassed Bollywood, Telugu and Tamil Classics of this year. It is a film that takes you on a journey into your own daily life, into your family, into your emotions to teach you everything about the same Life which you are living but actually not Living but just passing your days in today's Digital era.Home is tremendously rich in writing departement. No other family comes close to this and neither will come i guess. I am considering all the great family dramas while saying this right from Oscar Winning 'How Green Was My Valley', George Steven's 'I Remember Mama' to Bollywood Films to modem foreign language films like 'My Father and My Son' (2005). Yes, #Home beats them all because it is not just about family, it is about lots of other things too which can't be explained here. You have to see it, experience it and understand it on your own and then you'll never ever forget it that's my promise. Each and every small small nuances here are notable and life-changing, it's just about your understanding level and if you have it solid then make it more solid because this film might just demolish your thinking power.From performance to technical aspects to everything you name under cinematic aspects, #Home is an expert's tutorial book. Not only for viewers but also for filmmakers on how to plant cinematic nuances within dramatic limits. It may not be excessive and agressive about telling the facts, i mean you won't see any lectures from the characters, that's old school filmmaking almost 50 years old. Here, #Home tries the leap method, it just hints about the subtle meaning of the scenes and runs away for the next scene only to leave you all alone with your acknowledgement power.I actually wanted to talk about many scenes and to elaborate the subtle meaning and artistic values of it but i am leaving it open for you all. Who knows, you might understand something better than me and anyways who gives spoilers before recommending a Must Watch Film? Rojin Thomas hasn't done anything extraordinary till date and that's a correct statement too if we consider his previous projects but now with this film i can say that the things have changed. With #Home , he has delivered that EXTRAORDINARY MASTERPIECE which is more than enough for me to remember his name forever. What a marvelous designing of sensible subject it is. I am truly speechless Thomas sir. Hats off man. Overall, #Home is film which mustn't be missed by anybody, whoever he or she is, whatever the age is, just watch it with your whole family and try to understand the mistakes you have done unknowingly and if possible then confess it. Eventually, #Home will make your imperfect life PERFECT! ! It is a bridge between three generations and we all have or had them in our families, no?RATING - 9/10*",film year likely remain so home is emotional masterpiece journey into your life which you live daily but dont actually live it,2021 movie review malayalam cinema is unstoppable 2021 classics like great indian kitchen operation java drishyam 2 nayattu other great films like aarkkariyam malik kututhi couple more notable films like joji cold case malayalam cinema is giving away quality content with open hands i have seen all these films so now i am eligible state my opinion clearly is film year so far is likely remain so because it is almost impossible bring such outstanding content so great manners me has also surpassed bollywood telugu tamil classics this year it is film that takes you journey into your own daily life into your family into your emotions teach you everything about same life which you are living but actually not living but just passing your days todays digital era home is tremendously rich writing departement no other family comes close this neither will come i guess i am considering all great family dramas while saying this right oscar winning how green was my valley george stevens i remember mama bollywood films modem foreign language films like my father my son 2005 yes beats them all because it is not just about family it is about lots other things too which cant be explained here you have see it experience it understand it your own then youll never ever forget it thats my promise each every small small nuances here are notable life changing its just about your understanding level if you have it solid then make it more solid because this film might just demolish your thinking power performance technical aspects everything you name under cinematic aspects is experts tutorial book not only viewers but also filmmakers how plant cinematic nuances within dramatic limits it may not be excessive agressive about telling facts i mean you wont see any lectures characters thats old school filmmaking almost 50 years old here tries leap method it just hints about subtle meaning scenes runs away next scene only leave you all alone with your acknowledgement power i actually wanted talk about many scenes elaborate subtle meaning artistic values it but i am leaving it open you all who knows you might understand something better than me anyways who gives spoilers before recommending must watch film rojin thomas hasnt done anything extraordinary till date thats correct statement too if we consider his previous projects but now with this film i can say that things have changed with he has delivered that extraordinary masterpiece which is more than enough me remember his name forever what marvelous designing sensible subject it is i am truly speechless thomas sir hats off man overall is film which mustnt be missed by anybody whoever he or she is whatever age is just watch it with your whole family try understand mistakes you have done unknowingly if possible then confess it eventually will make your imperfect life perfect it is bridge between three generations we all have or had them our families no rating 9 10,0.540093537414966,0.13654916512059367,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"

8,Indrans and Manju Pillai shine in this heartwarming family drama!,"Despite immense performance in indie films like Veyilmarangal and Aalorukkam, finally comedian turned ace character actor Indrans gets a mainstream lead role that he could sink his teeth into.He stars as the aptly named Oliver Twist, a technologically challenged dad desperately trying to reconnect with his young sons. Manju Pillai plays his hot-tempered, bickering wife and the two veterans play off each other to really hook the audience from the word go.Sreenath Bhasi essays the role of a typical disconnected, spoiled elder son who has taken his parents for granted while finding his feet as a young film director.Although Director Rojin Thomas leverages his brilliant leads to generate excellent feel good moments, the attempts at comedy often fall flat. At 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film is too long especially since the narration meanders to unnecessary sub-plots at many points.Johny Antony is a delight as Indrans' best friend and generates the few genuine laughter-inducing comic sequences while Vijay Babu and Deepa Thomas come off as stiff and artificial in their supporting roles. Nelsen K Gafoor delivers his second superb performance on the trot after his standout role in Kuruthi, again, interestingly as a temperamental younger sibling.At its very core, #Home is an endearing father-son story and one that hits very close to (pun intended) home. Despite its many flaws, the film is elevated by the monumental performance of Indrans who makes you buy into the out-of-touch father's helplessness and his unending plight to win his son's approval.#Home will definitely bring a smile to your face by the climax and make you question, reassess and maybe even correct your dynamic with your own parents.Recommended.",indrans manju pillai shine this heartwarming family drama,despite immense performance indie films like veyilmarangal aalorukkam finally comedian turned ace character actor indrans gets mainstream lead role that he could sink his teeth into he stars as aptly named oliver twist technologically challenged dad desperately trying reconnect with his young sons manju pillai plays his hot tempered bickering wife two veterans play off each other really hook audience word go sreenath bhasi essays role typical disconnected spoiled elder son who has taken his parents granted while finding his feet as young film director although director rojin thomas leverages his brilliant leads generate excellent feel good moments attempts at comedy often fall flat at 2 hours 40 minutes film is too long especially since narration meanders unnecessary sub plots at many points johny antony is delight as indrans best friend generates few genuine laughter inducing comic sequences while vijay babu deepa thomas come off as stiff artificial their supporting roles nelsen k gafoor delivers his second superb performance trot after his standout role kuruthi again interestingly as temperamental younger sibling at its very core is endearing father son story one that hits very close pun intended home despite its many flaws film is elevated by monumental performance indrans who makes you buy into out touch fathers helplessness his unending plight win his sons approval will definitely bring smile your face by climax make you question reassess maybe even correct your dynamic with your own parents recommended,0.52991452991453,0.21715506715506713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"

7,"A heart-warming, feel-good flick that's best enjoyed with the fam! [+72%]","The best thing about #Home is that it gives a veteran performer like Indrans an opportunity (in 2021) to act his heart out. #Home is everything you can expect given its title. Thematically, it heavily borrows from Sreenivasan's Kadha Parayumbol in its climactic moments but writer-director Rojin Thomas successfully infuses a huge dose of relatability to the proceedings before we get there. The (slightly excessive) melodrama in the end makes me reduce half a star in a film that gets its humor going pretty early on. Everyone on the film's poster (or otherwise) does well - conveying the right emotions with ease.Rojin has written the lead character of Oliver Twist (Indrans, playing the man of the house) in a layered manner. Right when you think the focus goes away from the sexagenarian, Rojin carefully drifts it back on him. It also tries to convey a subtle message on mobile phone addiction without being outright preachy about it. As it's a 2h 40m movie, #Home spends enough and more time breathing life into each of its leads. The comedy is laugh-out-loud when it works and super-bland when it doesn't; that said, it's the former that we get more of. #Home looks like it was prepared to delight (and occasionally moisten the eyes of) family audiences during the Cor-Onam season when Keralites are mostly stuck at home.The gripes I had with the film include a few problematic quips around mental health, how Antony's somewhat toxic behavior gets written off as ""stress"" and is conveniently forgiven, and that Kuttiyamma (Manju Pillai) gets reduced to the empathetic caretaker of all the men in the household. Also, why does Antony want his dad to be extra-ordinary for them to reconnect? Most dads are ordinary and they're still awesome for just being themselves. That aside, #Home certainly warrants a watch with the fam.P.

10,#Home is where the heart is!,"Yes, this movie is full of heart. Having a rough day, go home and watch this movie. Have free time, watch this movie. It's totally worth it.#Home perfectly fits the description of a 'feel-good movie'. It has a wonderful wonderful screenplay that'll make you completely fall in love with this movie. It's long enough (in a good way) to make you completely immersed in the characters and the story. You may not necessarily like it in the beginning, but it slowly grows on you. If I'm being completely honest, I didn't like some of the main characters in the beginning. I had problems with them all. For eg, I did not like the dad (Oliver Twist Sr., which you'll understand when you watch the film), Antony OT (Srinath Bassi), and the younger brother even as I found his antics annoying and he was too loud. But as the film progressed I started understanding the reasons behind why they were how they were. Many things that feel a little hard to believe, you'll get closure on those things as it moves ahead. The script is honestly extremely good and the movie has this sense of realism that'a conveyed to you beautifully. That's the beauty about Malayalam cinema. They feel so realistic and relatable, you will absolutely love their stories.This is that kind of film that's going to be remembered for a long long time. For eg, Dhrishyam, Kumbalangi which are absolute classics. Yes, there are a lot of Malayalam movies that are insanely good, but these two classics come to mind instantly when you think about supremely wonderful Indian films.
