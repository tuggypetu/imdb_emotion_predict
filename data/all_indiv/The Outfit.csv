9.0,Fitting plan,"Suspend your disbelief - it is possible to do so. Especially because the actors and the setting is so well chosen, that you will just fit right into it. No pun intended - and even though there are certain things that seem quite coincidental and based on luck rather on skill or whatever else you would want to call it, the movie and the characters in it, really draw you in - I guess that could also be considered a pun.While the not tailor (don't call him that, he is a cutter) is at the center of the story and many things seem simple ... there are quite a few revelations that might be able to surprise you. Again do not worry about what makes sense or not too much - just enjoy how well woven it all is - ah another pun. Well I can't help it, it feels good when I put them on and they work like a charm ... charm(e) also something that can be said about the actors involved in this.

,No thriller out there now can compete with this spare thriller teeming with superior acting.,"""Anyone can be tailor."" Leonard (Mark Rylance)Although sometimes I can't tell if I love film more than theater, with The Outfit I found a film that satisfies both affections. Writer-director Grahame Moore brings a Hitchcock frame of mind with one dominant location, an atelier holding no more than four or five characters, just like a theater stage, and a sense of foreboding coming from history and the characters themselves, just like the modern psychological thrillers do.Just watch out for those scissors-Hitch would love the touch.Underneath the simple set is a rumbling of sin as the meek tailor, Leonard, contends with three mobs threatening him and his secretary, Mable (Zoey Deutch). He is required to stitch around those who want to kill each other and destroy his business, with different crooks coming in the front door intent on finding a tape that allegedly would send them to jail.The joy of this neo-noir thriller is the suspense that Hitchcock virtually patented because his non-mob characters are seemingly innocent types, and his sinners not quite in control of their ambitions. What Hitch and other thriller directors like Moore want is to show the vulnerability of the common citizen and the weaknesses of the seasoned mobsters.Although it's up to Leonard, small haberdashery owner in Chicago, to protect his shop, he also, in a narcotic-like voice over, explains the allegorical implications of his cutting and sewing. For instance, he is not a tailor but rather a cutter. The former artless, the latter a professional trained for years on London's iconic Saville Row.No recent film has surpassed The Outfit's ability to reveal the wickedness of humanity and its adaptability while supplying a dose of old-time noir. Delight in the spare set, the super acting, and the innumerable closeups that do as much to reveal character as the uncomplicated, Pinter-like dialogue.Although this tidy feature, similar to Leonard in its meticulous revelation of character and motive, seems suited to streaming, it is a euphoric experience on the big screen as the spare audiences can be enveloped by the powerful characters and story, in a setting that puts all in a dynamic room with mystery aplenty.",no thriller out there now can compete with this spare thriller teeming with superior acting,anyone can be tailor leonard mark rylance although sometimes i cant tell if i love film more than theater with outfit i found film that satisfies both affections writer director grahame moore brings hitchcock frame mind with one dominant location atelier holding no more than four or five characters just like theater stage sense foreboding coming history characters themselves just like modern psychological thrillers do just watch out those scissors hitch would love touch underneath simple set is rumbling sin as meek tailor leonard contends with three mobs threatening him his secretary mable zoey deutch he is required stitch around those who want kill each other destroy his business with different crooks coming front door intent finding tape that allegedly would send them jail joy this neo noir thriller is suspense that hitchcock virtually patented because his non mob characters are seemingly innocent types his sinners not quite control their ambitions what hitch other thriller directors like moore want is show vulnerability common citizen weaknesses seasoned mobsters although its up leonard small haberdashery owner chicago protect his shop he also narcotic like voice over explains allegorical implications his cutting sewing instance he is not tailor but rather cutter former artless latter professional trained years londons iconic saville row no recent film has surpassed outfits ability reveal wickedness humanity its adaptability while supplying dose old time noir delight spare set super acting innumerable closeups that do as much reveal character as uncomplicated pinter like dialogue although this tidy feature similar leonard its meticulous revelation character motive seems suited streaming it is euphoric experience big screen as spare audiences can be enveloped by powerful characters story setting that puts all dynamic room with mystery aplenty,0.361156462585034,0.11523809523809526,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7.0,"a cutter, not a tailor","Greetings again from the darkness. Graham Moore won an Oscar for his screenplay on Alan Turing's life in THE IMITATION GAME (2014). Now he has directed his first feature film, one he co-wrote with Johnathan McClain. The final product is a bit unusual in that it takes place almost entirely in one spot ... a tailor's shop ... and features only a handful of characters. It's a film that would transition easily to the stage for live performances.Mark Rylance (Oscar winner for BRIDGE OF SPIES, 2015) excels here as Leonard, a Savile Row-trained tailor now working his craft in his own shop in 1956 Chicago. His path from London to the windy city is a bit murky, but we immediately take note of Leonard's calm and elegant presence accompanied by his soothing voice. Rylance uses that voice as narrator to explain the intricacies involved with creating a man's suit, and the importance of reading the man prior to utilizing the 4 fabrics and 38 pieces that make-up the outfit. Leonard is also protective of Mable (Zoey Deutch, ZOMBIELAND: DOUBLE TAP, 2019), his assistant who dreams of traveling the globe.An early montage shows us how the mob utilizes Leonard's shop for drops, and trusts him due to his 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' demeanor. Leonard is one cool dude, and it's obvious we (and the mob) are underestimating him ... but we can't quite figure out why or by how much. One crazy night changes everything. Richie (Dylan O'Brien, THE MAZE RUNNER franchise) is brought into the tailor shop after being shot by a rival gang ambush. He's accompanied by Francis (Johnny Flynn, EMMA., 2020), and the dynamics between these two is quite interesting. Richie is the son of the Boyle family patriarch and has been seeing Mable on the side, while Francis is the favored employee after saving Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale) by taking gun fire. Richie is a whiny, spoiled wannabe tough guy, while Francis is volatile and constantly sneering.What follows is a bit Hitchcockian. We have plot twists, murder, backstabbing, danger, and surprises. When it's discovered the Boyle family has a rat that is feeding details to the rival cross-town gang and the FBI, things get tense thanks partially to a MacGuffin audio tape. It all leads to confrontations in the shop, and some nice scene-chewing from Simon Russell Beale and Nikki Amuka-Bird as the leader of the rival gang. An elaborate plan by one of the characters is a pleasant surprise (to us, not the others). As Leonard points out on a couple of occasions, he's a ""cutter"", not a tailor - a distinction he takes as seriously as his skill with shears. The film's title has double meaning: the suits Leonard crafts, and the national syndicate that involves the Boyle family. Most of this we've seen before, but it's Rylance's portrayal of Leonard that offers a different look and feel. Fans of deceptive thrillers will find some joy here.Opens in theaters on March 18, 2022.",cutter not tailor,greetings again darkness graham moore won oscar his screenplay alan turings life imitation game 2014 now he has directed his first feature film one he co wrote with johnathan mcclain final product is bit unusual that it takes place almost entirely one spot tailors shop features only handful characters its film that would transition easily stage live performances mark rylance oscar winner bridge spies 2015 excels here as leonard savile row trained tailor now working his craft his own shop 1956 chicago his path london windy city is bit murky but we immediately take note leonards calm elegant presence accompanied by his soothing voice rylance uses that voice as narrator explain intricacies involved with creating mans suit importance reading man prior utilizing 4 fabrics 38 pieces that make up outfit leonard is also protective mable zoey deutch zombieland double tap 2019 his assistant who dreams traveling globe early montage shows us how mob utilizes leonards shop drops trusts him due his see no evil hear no evil speak no evil demeanor leonard is one cool dude its obvious we mob are underestimating him but we cant quite figure out why or by how much one crazy night changes everything richie dylan obrien maze runner franchise is brought into tailor shop after being shot by rival gang ambush hes accompanied by francis johnny flynn emma 2020 dynamics between these two is quite interesting richie is son boyle family patriarch has been seeing mable side while francis is favored employee after saving roy boyle simon russell beale by taking gun fire richie is whiny spoiled wannabe tough guy while francis is volatile constantly sneering what follows is bit hitchcockian we have plot twists murder backstabbing danger surprises when its discovered boyle family has rat that is feeding details rival cross town gang fbi things get tense thanks partially macguffin audio tape it all leads confrontations shop some nice scene chewing simon russell beale nikki amuka bird as leader rival gang elaborate plan by one characters is pleasant surprise us not others as leonard points out couple occasions hes cutter not tailor distinction he takes as seriously as his skill with shears films title has double meaning suits leonard crafts national syndicate that involves boyle family most this weve seen before but its rylances portrayal leonard that offers different look feel fans deceptive thrillers will find some joy here opens theaters march 18 2022,0.5716666666666667,0.17222853535353533,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,What a surprise this was!,"You don't see many movies like this in theatres these days! And this is exactly why I loved it, it's the kind of film that I really miss seeing a lot of; they type that typically gets dumped on streaming these days. It's an old-fashioned crime thriller that takes place in one location and is a dialogue driven story... and believe it or not it's not part of a franchise! It's a very well done film and is certainly going to be one of the most underrated films of 2022. If you're reading this, don't sleep on it, go see it right away! I didn't even watch a trailer for it, I went in pretty much blind, and absolutely loved it! I ate it right up; it was a huge, pleasant surprise! It's a perfect classic day-in-the-life of a mobster tale!Writer-director Graham Moore really brings a Hitchcock frame of mind to this film. It takes place all in one location, has a small cast and yet could not be more intense and impressive! The script is immaculate, one of the best crime thriller scripts I've seen in ages and feels like it actually has a high quality feel to it. There are so many awesome twists and turns throughout, and some truly electric dialogue. I also loved how it uses the concept of Chekhov's gun to cleverly setup and subvert expectations, it made the twists even more satisfying! Every time I thought I had the film figured out, it turned the tables on me, keeping me in suspense. Moore handles the suspense so well, in very Hitchcockian ways and the movie is constantly gripping, interesting and intense! However while the films abundance and reliance on its twists is its greatest strength, it's also its greatest flaw as it slightly pushed my suspension of disbelief a little far and messed with the pacing at times. But the pros far outweigh the cons. I also loved how cleverly Moore made use of the space (the tailor shop), which was immaculately and thoroughly utilized throughout. I was constantly surprised how they kept finding new ways to use the space and evolve the story! The only downside was that this didn't allow for the cinematography to be as impressive or eye popping as it could have been; it was good but not overly creative, just purely functional.Another huge strength of the film is it's impressive cast and stellar performances! Mark Rylance kills it in this movie, he delivers such a daring and phenomenal performance as Leonard. It's incredibly nuanced and I just love how he slowly revealed more about his character through ways he behaved and slight tendencies in dialogue delivery. The story also really helped here, I loved how it slowly pulled back the curtain on the character as the film went on, and you couldn't help but root for him. Zoey Deutch was also such a surprise, she was so good in this, and Dylan O'Brien and Johnny Flynn were also great and need to be in more stuff! All the acting in the film was incredible, it blew me away. The actors alongside the great script truly carry the film and are the reason I loved it as much as I did!The Outfit isn't flashy, but it's a very solid story with a tightly tailored performance from Mark Rylance. It's perfect for fans of old-school thrillers; it's very well made and very enjoyable. Don't miss this one, it's rare we get films as special as this one these days!",what surprise this was,you dont see many movies like this theatres these days this is exactly why i loved it its kind film that i really miss seeing lot they type that typically gets dumped streaming these days its old fashioned crime thriller that takes place one location is dialogue driven story believe it or not its not part franchise its very well done film is certainly going be one most underrated films 2022 if youre reading this dont sleep it go see it right away i didnt even watch trailer it i went pretty much blind absolutely loved it i ate it right up it was huge pleasant surprise its perfect classic day life mobster tale writer director graham moore really brings hitchcock frame mind this film it takes place all one location has small cast yet could not be more intense impressive script is immaculate one best crime thriller scripts ive seen ages feels like it actually has high quality feel it there are so many awesome twists turns throughout some truly electric dialogue i also loved how it uses concept chekhovs gun cleverly setup subvert expectations it made twists even more satisfying every time i thought i had film figured out it turned tables me keeping me suspense moore handles suspense so well very hitchcockian ways movie is constantly gripping interesting intense however while films abundance reliance its twists is its greatest strength its also its greatest flaw as it slightly pushed my suspension disbelief little far messed with pacing at times but pros far outweigh cons i also loved how cleverly moore made use space tailor shop which was immaculately thoroughly utilized throughout i was constantly surprised how they kept finding new ways use space evolve story only downside was that this didnt allow cinematography be as impressive or eye popping as it could have been it was good but not overly creative just purely functional another huge strength film is its impressive cast stellar performances mark rylance kills it this movie he delivers such daring phenomenal performance as leonard its incredibly nuanced i just love how he slowly revealed more about his character through ways he behaved slight tendencies dialogue delivery story also really helped here i loved how it slowly pulled back curtain character as film went you couldnt help but root him zoey deutch was also such surprise she was so good this dylan obrien johnny flynn were also great need be more stuff all acting film was incredible it blew me away actors alongside great script truly carry film are reason i loved it as much as i did outfit isnt flashy but its very solid story with tightly tailored performance mark rylance its perfect fans old school thrillers its very well made very enjoyable dont miss this one its rare we get films as special as this one these days,0.6107683982683982,0.35798533807462374,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,"He's not a tailor, he's a cutter.","Set in 1956 Chicago, the central character is a Bespoke suit maker played expertly by Mark Rylance. As he has established his business, central to that are the crime ring members who use his services and also his business as a drop off point for some mysterious packages. Presumably some packages of cash, to be picked up by the boss' men.On this night there is a tape, supposedly made by a ""rat"" to expose the crime operations. The identity of this rat is central to the story. We see a number of characters enter the story, some smarter than the others, but the only really smart one is the suit maker who is quick to clarify, ""I'm not a tailor, they just sew on buttons and stitch hems. I am a cutter.""As the story moves along it exposes itself somewhat as a dark comedy and we witness how the cutter is able to manipulate everything to get the results he needs for him and his young female receptionist.Very interesting movie that takes place essentially in one place, the suit maker's shop.

8.0,"Mark Rylance is, as always, quietly brilliant","This 'little' film very much has the feeling of a stage play. There is really only one set (the tailor Leonard's shop) in which everything happens. To go along with that, it has an almost claustrophobic atmosphere as the different Chicago gangster characters come and go, threaten Leonard and his receptionist Mable (nicely done by Zoey Deutch), argue, leave again. Leonard basically has to outwit them at every twist and turn (and there are lots of twists and turns), and that is about it for the plot. Add to that the fact that no one is entirely who they seem and we get a fascinating hour and a half of intense 'locked room' drama.I wouldn't quite call this minimalist (""Wating for Godot"" would classify as minimalist in my books). It's continually absorbing and yet built out of nothing but carefully rendered dialog. Mark Rylance is as always superb, he somehow builds a character out of measured dialog and changes in expression that might not be anything more than a raised eyebrow or a tightening of the mouth. Amazing to watch.I first noticed Zoey Deutch in Before I Fall (2017) in which she was about the only standout. Nice to see that bigger and better roles are coming her way.Saying anything more at all would give away too much since The Outfit is, in part, a mystery as well as suspense drama.

Second time in roughly three weeks that I've had the pleasure of seeing a Mark Rylance flick on the big screen and again he delivers - such a reliable actor. The other release was 'The Phantom of the Open', which is very good but both the film and Rylance's performance is bettered here. A thoroughly enjoyable showing from him as Leonard Burling.Things start off extremely strongly with a terrific opening scene with Rylance's Burling, so I was praying that it would keep that high level and I'm pleased to say that - in my opinion, of course - it absolutely did. There's a bit at the end that I was initially unsure about, though upon further thought I enjoyed it just as much as the rest.One element of this 2022 production actually stays the same from start-to-finish, I won't say what but early on I thought it may limit proceedings but if anything it just adds to the overall vibe of it all.

6.0,The Cutter Is In,"I am a massive fan of single location movies. ""Identity"" or ""Death And The Maiden"" come to mind. The conceit typically makes the moviemakers get really clever with the use of space. But if you've seen enough movies about mild manner characters with simmering dark pasts, you'll see a lot of this coming from a mile out. Which will leave you wondering ""why was the movie even made?""The writer/director is Graham Moore, who was most likely given this simple feature to make to show he can bridge his career into directing. This is a nice little flick that like the Wachowskis who made ""Bound"" means he can do something bigger. Perhaps not ""The Matrix"" but he will segue this into something much larger.The story is of a tailor...er cutter named Leonard Burling (Mark Rylance), a quiet Englishman who constructs the most exquisite suits in Chicago. We know this because of the way he speaks reverentially about his craft. His precision is that of a car engineer carving out clean lines, attention to detail, and near obsessive nature in which he narrates the work he is doing. It also illustrates the connection he makes between that and the people who wear the suits he makes.He is assisted by a very street tough girl, Mabel (Zoey Deutch) from the neighborhood who has long history with the block, enough to see that it has fallen to the scum of society. That doesn't stop her from dating the son of a very awful mob boss who has his eyes set on being included in a national network of other criminal scum. Leonard's store is being used as a drop off spot for communications between that interconnect villainy (the days before the Dark Web).Unfortunately, the local mob discover that there is a rat in their midst, and a tape that was discovered in the box contains the whereabouts and, therefore, identity of the snitch. There is some mob infighting and slowly, they begin to turn on one another.The movie itself, while expertly designed fails at the worst part possible...the reveal. It's no secret that still waters are going to run deep. And we are handed brief glimpses of the darkness within. Though, the frustrating part is having to wait for the pot to boil, it is also a grind to watch Mark Rylance savor his deadpan English darkness. Even when he is expressing any emotion. The audience will wonder if the man isn't brain dead at some points. Leonard is treated very poorly by the mob guys, but yet he remains still and silent...big clue he is about to get ugly. But that time never happens. Well, it kind of does, but by then, it comes off as very unsatisfying and exhausting.Now, going in, I knew there was going to be that titular scene of his love of making suits. This clearly had that in mind. Also, an Academy Award writer isn't going to slack on the details. However fascinating it is to see the making of a suit and the care and patience it takes to craft it, it is VERY tedious to sit through. At a certain point we want to scream ""we get it, you did your research!"" But that was a tough line to skate. Because it is filler to a rather empty plot throughout.I found myself disinterested in the why or how or whats and found myself just wanting it to have some tension.

8.0,Outfitted With More Articulate Wording Than Stunts,"LIKES:The Atmosphere: This movie is all about establishing an imposing and suspenseful atmosphere in probably the lowest intensity ever. And you know what... it worked for me. The Outfit is a very vague premise from the title, but in it you find a very classy, and intense atmosphere that does not involve creatures, bombs, or intense fighting scenes. This film takes a much laid back, and organized manner, where the intensity is trying to find out what will happen, how things will wind up, and what lies beneath the surface. As you are waiting for these answers, the movie continues to take elements to increase the suspense, and make you invest in the much simpler piece this film is made.The Costumes: It's nothing like a Disney live action movie or a Harry Potter world, but the Outfit's clothes tell a story on their own at what goes on in this story. Much of the film takes place in a small shop fitted to making clothes, and the stories that they hold are very powerful. It's a mobster movie as you can see from the poster, but though they come from a similar cloth, each suit holds a power and character with it, helping to differentiate characters, and make a statement to the story. It works well to be honest and I was very happy with how things came out with it.The Culture: This movie is all about the cultural mindsets and stereotypes of two worlds coming together. One of course in the dark corners of the Mafia family, while the other is of a cutter who finds business with these people. The two worlds dance in an uneven tone, with each new member adding to the odd exchange in an attempt to keep the situation at hand. Seeing the class of the Cutter trying to navigate the unruly attitude of the Mob boys was super intriguing to watch. I loved seeing the values, morals, and mannerisms come out, again making a big world in such a small space, once again maximizing so much in a small amount of work.Decent Pacing of The Tale: For a tale with no action, the Outfit moves very well to my surprise. It's very easy to follow, twisting the plot and kinking the linear pace to feel engaging and interesting in the process. Each new act of the movie somehow painted a bit more of the mystery to solve, while also laying a new clue to help you connect the pieces. Story elements gradually drop as well, and this one night of intensity becomes a crock pot ready to blow with the pressure being seen. Very nice tactics to use for something with less action and moving.The Dialogue/Writing: By far the biggest character moments is in the writing of this film, particular the dialogue our cast has to recite. The Outfit's words are not poetic sonnets meant to be quote, one liner capable of being the next TikTok scene, or even those inspirational lines that we love seeing. No, it's again a very witty and classy exchange of words as the stories that are being cast are put to the test of agonizing scrutiny by very powerful people. Each line uttered is like a sword on itself, a fencing match of intelligence and presentation in hopes of convincing the other to reveal the secrets and truth at hand. It's that writing that is very fitting of the time, the age, and the characters, not being forced as the characteristics come out in big in full light to potentially reward or punish those at hand. It's again very smart writing, and I loved how so much was through the words rather than the actions.The Acting: By far the strongest aspect, is the acting that has to deliver the lines. Secondary characters do well for the limited time and involvement to make a believable member of the troop. However, the main characters are the ones that get a gold star in this role that really take the movie to the top. Dylan O'Brien is fine, his character a keystone piece to the drama, though his full-on screen time needed work. He manages to bring the arrogance and fire of a youthful mob son holds. He has the mouth, the cockiness, and the edge to deliver threats and he does well with the part, hitting new levels of quality that I had not expected. Zoey Deutch is lovely as always, a role that brings out the usual innocence she has in her characters, but soon she brings her own edge to the mix. She's confident, she can face the group, but there is a vulnerability there too as she was forced into the game. I loved her chemistry with the characters a lot, and she really made a great bridge character to the group. As for Mark Rylance, wow... he was incredible as he always is in his roles. The class I've been talking about is held in his character on so many levels. From the way he presents his world to the posture he holds, there is just an heir of top-level character melding that Rylance obtained in his field. It was like he and Leonard were one and the same, making a believable performance that this movie heavily depended on, given the screen time he held. A strong character and a performance to match, he may be the strongest aspect of this film.DISLIKES:The Short Screen Time of Several Characters: As I said, Rylance holds much of the screen time, while a lot of other characters spend a shocking amount of time off screen. The Outfit is able to bring the absence into a more story-oriented use, but I can't help but feel robbed of the other cast members' performances by them being gone for so long. More integration was needed for these groups, and I had liked more time with the other cast members to get the full involvement in the story.Why Other Parts of The City Could Not Be Seen: As I said, the dialogue is super important to the story, as not only does it have to craft the characteristics, but also tells you what is happening in the world around them. Much of the film is cleverly taking place in this shop, but there is a lot happening in the streets of Chicago as well, and the world we could have inhabited. I'm not saying we needed to be running through the streets and ducking the gang fights, but I can say a little time outside of the shop would have done wonders for the film. Some of those characters that disappear from the screen, are out on those streets and getting to see these moments come out would have been nice at times.The Background Info Is Bland: For most characters, there are potentially some juicy origin stories to dive into, particularly in the darkness they hold. However, The Outfit's stories are rather mediocre for my tastes, and even the ones with more meat did not quite get the full body presentation I think they wanted. Maybe it was in the interest of time, or maybe it was trying to take the artistic direction, but there was more for me that could have been delivered to really give the full twist to the mix.The ""Climactic"" Finish: The one thing in this movie that felt off, was the final moment that felt like it was just in the wrong moment for this film. I liked seeing the last few parts of the character come to light and prove my theory, but this part seemed to just not fit into the pace of the rest of the movie. Even worse, this wrench in the gears really did not have impressive choreography or even really any tension, because most of the intensity had fled at this time. It felt like a last-minute attempt to interject some suspense and get the movie to over the 90-minute mark, but again it just did not feel needed.The VERDICT:The Outfit turned out to be a nice surprise in terms of the crime and drama element themes that the IMDB page promised. It's definitely not the usual gang busting, speed chasing, and bank robbing moment that we often get. No, instead, it's something with a lot more character development to it, using the subtle art of acting and good writing to tell the tale, rather than drown us in expensive scenes. The Outfit feels like a movie with a modern Shakespearean approach, and though the language is not as artsy, the presentation and intelligence are high for this film's writing making it the mightier pen of the crime and drama genres. However, the movie still could have used some doctoring up, trying to tie in more of the world and extend the world of the historical Chicago where so much happened. In addition, more characters needed to stay on screen helping further develop the information of their group, and maybe put more suspense into the film with the heated moods they took. Of course, the movie's end scene could have been different, and without the other scenes of action to support it, is a rather obscure finale to what was a calmer movie.My scores are:Crime/Drama: 8.0Movie Overall: 7.0.",outfitted with more articulate wording than stunts,likes atmosphere this movie is all about establishing imposing suspenseful atmosphere probably lowest intensity ever you know what it worked me outfit is very vague premise title but it you find very classy intense atmosphere that does not involve creatures bombs or intense fighting scenes this film takes much laid back

6.0,Contrived story designed to manipulate the viewer,"First off, I didn't hate this movie but anything above a 6 is questionable.It felt like an ending searching for a story line to get it there. Mark Rylance acting was great to watch, the rest of the cast acted to support his character and were weak in doing so. The mobsters were unrealistic and didn't convince me that they would believe everything a tailor, regardless of of how good he is, told them. And when he stuttered around telling the boss that his son was killed by one of his own people while the killer held a gun to the girls (Zoey Deutch) head in full view without question was odd and never challenged.To get something else out of the way, he was a tailor not just a cutter. A cutter fits, measures the customer and cuts the cloth. The tailor sews and styles the suit. He did both, this is a tailor's job. So that fell flat and sounded disingenuous every time he corrected them.For the receptionist to pick up the story the tailor was telling and continue it also felt like manipulated writing and came across as shallow and lazy story telling. Many of the twists were unsurprising and not needed. The last 10 minutes should have been cut. Getting stabbed by a tailors shears that deep in the neck would and should have been the end. Not even sure why he burned his shop down.I gave it a 6 for the same reason others gave it a 8 or 9, I'm starving for half decent movies that aren't centred around super powers, magic or a cartoon.

This is what keeps you intrigued throughout the film as you are constantly trying to guess what will happen next. Although most of the time the twists are done very well and they make sense there are a few that I feel were unneeded.Mark Rylance is great as the lead character but I do feel there needed to be some more development for his character at the beginning. His characters development is there but it doesn't come until later. That being said it doesn't take too much away from his character as you will still find yourself rooting for him throughout the film. Dylan O'Obrien, Zoey Deutch, Johnny Flynn we're all great in their respective roles.The entire film takes place in one setting and the director Graham Moore does an amazing job of using this setting to his advantage. Every time your attention is drawn to something it is used later and he does this wonderfully.Overall this is a great film with terrific direction and storytelling you will be kept on the edge of your seat throughout the film. With great performances and intriguing characters ""The Outfit"" will make audiences happy they went to the movies.8/10.",intriguing story with surprises galore,when expert tailor gets mixed up some mob business he must use his wits survive night i went into this film blind only thing i knew was synopsis i throughly enjoyed it film does amazing job constantly surprising you every time you think you have it figured out it throws another curve ball this is what keeps you intrigued throughout film as you are constantly trying guess what will happen next although most time twists are done very well they make sense there are few that i feel were unneeded mark rylance is great as lead character but i do feel there needed be some more development his character at beginning his characters development is there but it doesnt come until later that being said it doesnt take too much away his character as you will still find yourself rooting him throughout film dylan oobrien zoey deutch johnny flynn were all great their respective roles entire film takes place one setting director graham moore does amazing job using this setting his advantage every time your attention is drawn something it is used later he does this wonderfully overall this is great film with terrific direction storytelling you will be kept edge your seat throughout film with great performances intriguing characters outfit will make audiences happy they went movies 8 10,0.49537037037037035,0.28518518518518515,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,Tailor made for sleuth lovers,"My Review- The Outfit My Rating. 8/10 Watch out for this not sure of Australian Cinema release dateThe IMBD biography noted on Mark Rylance's biography state that he is widely regarded as the greatest stage actor of his generation, Sir Mark Rylance has won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Rudolf Abel in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies (2015).After watching The Outfit I can see why his stage acting reputation is so highly regarded as I found my experience watching this movie was like watching one of his finest stage performances and the set decoration is very stage like.His performance is spellbinding it's a role that only a master actor like Laurence Olivier , Michael Cain or Kenneth Branagh would attempt.The title has a dual meaning. The Chicago mafia is also referred to as The Outfit.The movie is set in 1956 Chicago Leonard Burling (Mark Rylance) is a master English tailor who's ended up in Chicago operating a corner tailor shop with his assistant Mabel played by (Zoey Deutch) who gives a great performance also. Leonard makes beautiful clothes for the only people around who can afford them unfortunately his clients include a Irish mob boss Roy Boyle played by Simon Russell Beale plus Boyle's chief enforcer, Francis, and his son and second-in-command Ritchie who use Burling's shop as a stash house for dirty money.The plot takes off in a very dramatic way when Leonard Burling is thrust into a deadly game of deception and murder.Francis shows up at the shop with Roy Boyles son Ritchie, who's been shot in the torso after a confrontation with the rival LaFontaine family, a black criminal organization. Leonard Burling is forced at gunpoint to treat Ritchie's wounds and hide a briefcase containing a copy of an FBI recording with detailed information on the crew's operations, which was provided by the ""Outfit"", a nationwide syndicate founded by Al Capone that protects criminal groups from the law.The movie opens with Leonard Burling Mark Rylance proudly explaining in great detail the skills needed to create a beautifully tailored suit so I wasn't surprised to read that Mark Rylance was actually trained in tailoring techniques by the famous Huntsman tailors on Savile Row.If your looking for action and thrills or a Godfather type epic you won't find it in The Outfit but if you enjoy a clever test of wits with surprising twists and turns this movie is for you. You can almost see and hear the clockwork like brain of Leonard Burling's brain tick over . Only a consummate actor at the height of his powers could portray this complex character.Cleverly written by Johnathan McClain and Graham Moore who also wrote the script for The Imitation Game . He deservedly won an Academy Award for that great script in 2015 . Jonathan McClain also directs this movie he is also a talented actor who featured in the final series of Madmen cast as Megan Draper's Agent Alan Silver.He certainly has done a ""Sterling ""job excuse my pun from Madmen and he understands actors .This film reminded me a little of the style of Michael Cain's crime thrillers Death Trap (1982) and Sleuth 1972) in its clever composition and battle of wits.",tailor made sleuth lovers,my review outfit my rating 8 10 watch out this not sure australian cinema release datethe imbd biography noted mark rylances biography state that he is widely regarded as greatest stage actor his generation sir mark rylance has won academy award best supporting actor bafta award best supporting actor his portrayal rudolf abel steven spielbergs bridge spies 2015 after watching outfit i can see why his stage acting reputation is so highly regarded as i found my experience watching this movie was like watching one his finest stage performances set decoration is very stage like his performance is spellbinding its role that only master actor like laurence olivier michael cain or kenneth branagh would attempt title has dual meaning chicago mafia is also referred as outfit movie is set 1956 chicago leonard burling mark rylance is master english tailor whos ended up chicago operating corner tailor shop with his assistant mabel played by zoey deutch who gives great performance also leonard makes beautiful clothes only people around who can afford them unfortunately his clients include irish mob boss roy boyle played by simon russell beale plus boyles chief enforcer francis his son second command ritchie who use burlings shop as stash house dirty money plot takes off very dramatic way when leonard burling is thrust into deadly game deception murder francis shows up at shop with roy boyles son ritchie whos been shot torso after confrontation with rival lafontaine family black criminal organization leonard burling is forced at gunpoint treat ritchies wounds hide briefcase containing copy fbi recording with detailed information crews operations which was provided by outfit nationwide syndicate founded by al capone that protects criminal groups law movie opens with leonard burling mark rylance proudly explaining great detail skills needed create beautifully tailored suit so i wasnt surprised read that mark rylance was actually trained tailoring techniques by famous huntsman tailors savile row if your looking action thrills or godfather type epic you wont find it outfit but if you enjoy clever test wits with surprising twists turns this movie is you you can almost see hear clockwork like brain leonard burlings brain tick over only consummate actor at height his powers could portray this complex character cleverly written by johnathan mcclain graham moore who also wrote script imitation game he deservedly won academy award that great script 2015 jonathan mcclain also directs this movie he is also talented actor who featured final series madmen cast as megan drapers agent alan silver he certainly has done sterling job excuse my pun madmen he understands actors this film reminded me little style michael cains crime thrillers death trap 1982 sleuth 1972 its clever composition battle wits,0.5639931528166822,0.17006769374416428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.43}"
