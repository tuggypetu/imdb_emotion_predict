10,The soul of Indian cinema shines through C/o Kancharapalem!,"C/O Kancharapalem is a beautifully told tale about the highs and lows of love in a small remote Indian village. From the very first frame, you cannot help but be drawn into this charming world and fall in love with the characters with all their endearing quirks and frailties. It is even more surprising to learn that none of the lead characters in the film were trained actors. This is truly a testament to up and coming director Maha Venkatesh who has masterfully directed this ode to love with a poetic elegance. The music of the film stays with you long after the final credits roll. This is Indian cinema at its simplest and finest.",soul indian cinema shines through c o kancharapalem,c o kancharapalem is beautifully told tale about highs lows love small remote indian village very first frame you cannot help but be drawn into this charming world fall love with characters with all their endearing quirks frailties it is even more surprising learn that none lead characters film were trained actors this is truly testament up coming director maha venkatesh who has masterfully directed this ode love with poetic elegance music film stays with you long after final credits roll this is indian cinema at its simplest finest,0.6322222222222221,0.4033333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"

Finally heard some fresh lines and saw some cute faces! Acting was a spot on with a majority of them.

A great effort must have been put in to keep the costumes and accessories in coherence with the time. Although I wished a little more effort in sinking the dialect with the time should have been a great plus. Also the outragious demolition and the deaths for the two major belief-systems whereas a smooth weep-over for the third, might lose points in the fair lens of some.

9,The ghost of Satyajit Ray hovers over this marvellous Telugu film.,"I'm sure the ghost of Sayajit Ray is looking down from whatever heaven he is in and smiling since his legacy is alive and well here on Earth. ""C/o Kancharapalem"" is a film Ray could have made in the blink of an eye. By that I mean it oozes Ray's humanity as well as a great deal of the skill he brought to everyone of his projects. Using non-professional actors Venkatesh Maha's marvellous film spins four separate love stories through four different generations in the Indian village of Kancharapalem and it's a charming and heart-breaking film, funny and touching in equal measure. It's also remarkably frank in its portrayal of the way in which women are treated in Indian society.If the performances don't always hit the mark remember that few of these people are professional actors and yet they handle the intricacies of Maha's multi-layered script with considerable aplomb. It also eschews Bollywood gloss for a much rawer, more naturalistic, feel and is a very hard film to dislike. This is an intimate epic that unfolds like a great novel and confirms its writer and director as a major player. It's also got one of the best codas I've seen in a movie in years.",ghost satyajit ray hovers over this marvellous telugu film,im sure ghost sayajit ray is looking down whatever heaven he is smiling since his legacy is alive well here earth c o kancharapalem is film ray could have made blink eye by that i mean it oozes rays humanity as well as great deal skill he brought everyone his projects using non professional actors venkatesh mahas marvellous film spins four separate love stories through four different generations indian village kancharapalem its charming heart breaking film funny touching equal measure its also remarkably frank its portrayal way which women are treated indian society if performances dont always hit mark remember that few these people are professional actors yet they handle intricacies mahas multi layered script with considerable aplomb it also eschews bollywood gloss much rawer more naturalistic feel is very hard film dislike this is intimate epic that unfolds like great novel confirms its writer director as major player its also got one best codas ive seen movie years,0.5084401709401709,0.246741452991453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.25}"

7,Breaking the stereotypes,"C/O Kancharapalem is about four love stories of people with different age groups set in a single town. Kacharapalem is name of that town.Is is the sweetest film ever made. Never at any point in the film, any of the lovebirds exchange smiles, they talk to each other normally, they never suggest from their expressions that they are in love. All they do is doing little things to show that they care for each other. One of the love stories is that of a prostitute and and man in 30's, but unlike other films, they never talk about her leaving the job or improving her life. It's the only film in which we never see proper fancy proposal(except one), yet we know it's a about love. Among all four stories, the story of Radha and Raju stands out, which is also the most 'silent' love story. Also, in the whole film, no one was going to die/kill for his/her lover, everyone knew their limitations.There is a scene in which the school boy did something that can't be justified after his break-up. That is the only only dramatic segment, and I kind of don't like it. All the memorable scenes are in the first half, second half has only tragedies.The realistic stories have some realistic problems, with religion playing a common part .There are talks of one's philosophy of god, women empowerment, sex and religion among other subjects, but it's not preachy.I feel the ending was a bit unnecessary, though it was there to explain the theme. But the director could have left the audience to understand without explaining it himself.I must mention that it was made on a shoestring budget . Even the biggest budget films in India have poor vfx. But this film is good in technical departments, cinematography, sound editing. Sountrack was good. You never feel like it's made by a first time director, you never feel like the actors are not professionals.C/O Kancharapalem is one of best the experiments in the history of Indian cinema(In all languages).",breaking stereotypes,c o kancharapalem is about four love stories people with different age groups set single town kacharapalem is name that town is is sweetest film ever made never at any point film any lovebirds exchange smiles they talk each other normally they never suggest their expressions that they are love all they do is doing little things show that they care each other one love stories is that prostitute man 30s but unlike other films they never talk about her leaving job or improving her life its only film which we never see proper fancy proposal except one yet we know its about love among all four stories story radha raju stands out which is also most silent love story also whole film no one was going die kill his her lover everyone knew their limitations there is scene which school boy did something that cant be justified after his break up that is only only dramatic segment i kind dont like it all memorable scenes are first half second half has only tragedies realistic stories have some realistic problems with religion playing common part there are talks ones philosophy god women empowerment sex religion among other subjects but its not preachy i feel ending was bit unnecessary though it was there explain theme but director could have left audience understand without explaining it himself i must mention that it was made shoestring budget even biggest budget films india have poor vfx but this film is good technical departments cinematography sound editing sountrack was good you never feel like its made by first time director you never feel like actors are not professionals c o kancharapalem is one best experiments history indian cinema all languages,0.49835600907029487,0.1418509070294785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9,Epic drama.,"Description: ""C/o Kancherapalem"" is a film of various love tales set in four different generation people, in which the characteristic point is, all these stories are happening in a typical village called Kancherapalem (Although it is a part of the city Vizag, director portrayed it like a village). However, the main focus is on the drama between Raju, a 49 years old attender in a government office and Radha, a 42 years old middle-aged woman got transferred from Orissa to the same office. The protagonist Raju is unmarried due to some personal problems, because of which the whole village irritates him by continually asking about his wedding, and even mock him for being the bachelor. Radha is a widow with an adolescent daughter.Analysis: Not even a single artist is known to us, but the director got triumphed enough in obtaining the required performances out of them. Every actor has done their job well. However, it is Mr. Subba Rao, who played the character ""Raju"" got a meaty role, and he is quite natural in it. With the few initial shots, the director set the right mood in audiences' minds and prepares us to witness a beautiful village drama. Although it is a compilation of many love stories, the director did not talk only about love but also discussed the crooked, narrow mindset of a typical human being in our current society. The themes of the stories are not entirely new, and we saw many of them in several other films. But the presentation is quite interesting in setting up the tale. Every single shot is made in natural light, and the freshness has lasted throughout the movie. Camara work is authentic, and editing is the colossal strength of the film. Music is another department which needs a proper appreciation for an adequate background score, and village folk songs. One may feel that the initial portions of the film are dragged a bit, but I think it is necessary to establish the four stories. Once the stage is set, the director takes us into the village Kancherapalem and makes us involved in this lovely drama. As the film progresses towards the end, the stories turn quite engaging with many scary situations. Finally, the twist which glues everything together is an epic conclusion that one can give. Considering the budget constraints, and the challenges in making this flick, I'd say this is a fantastic output that a new director can get. Mr. Venkatesh Maha, I could not appreciate you enough for making this beautiful flick, and I thank all the members of the crew for this remarkable drama.",epic drama,description c o kancherapalem is film various love tales set four different generation people which characteristic point is all these stories are happening typical village called kancherapalem although it is part city vizag director portrayed it like village however main focus is drama between raju 49 years old attender government office radha 42 years old middle aged woman got transferred orissa same office protagonist raju is unmarried due some personal problems because which whole village irritates him by continually asking about his wedding even mock him being bachelor radha is widow with adolescent daughter analysis not even single artist is known us but director got triumphed enough obtaining required performances out them every actor has done their job well however it is mr subba rao who played character raju got meaty role he is quite natural it with few initial shots director set right mood audiences minds prepares us witness beautiful village drama although it is compilation many love stories director did not talk only about love but also discussed crooked narrow mindset typical human being our current society themes stories are not entirely new we saw many them several other films but presentation is quite interesting setting up tale every single shot is made natural light freshness has lasted throughout movie camara work is authentic editing is colossal strength film music is another department which needs proper appreciation adequate background score village folk songs one may feel that initial portions film are dragged bit but i think it is necessary establish four stories once stage is set director takes us into village kancherapalem makes us involved this lovely drama as film progresses towards end stories turn quite engaging with many scary situations finally twist which glues everything together is epic conclusion that one can give considering budget constraints challenges making this flick id say this is fantastic output that new director can get mr venkatesh maha i could not appreciate you enough making this beautiful flick i thank all members crew this remarkable drama,0.47199482065553494,0.14841141001855288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9,An Ode to True Love!,"""Sporting victory or defeat,In season or out of season,Love does not come aglitter on the forehead,Love defies time,Love defies age even more...""These words have been immortalized through the baritone voice of the 'Bard of the Brahmaputra' in a beautiful composition. This movie portrays how true these words can get.C/o Kancharapalem is an ode to true love, which can crisscross age, religion and above all, time. This movie has been crafted like a brilliant jigsaw puzzle, where all the pieces fit in methodically to reveal the final masterpiece, LOVE.The actors, mostly amateurs, play out the parts with their heart and soul and draw you into the rustic world of Kancharapalem.

8,Hands down to Telugu Cinema for the Greatest Storytelling ever in Love-story Genre in Indian Cinema.,"C/o Kancharapalem (2018) : Brief Review -Hands down to Telugu Cinema for the Greatest Storytelling ever in Love-story Genre in Indian Cinema. I have been to all the major classics in Romance genre starting right from D W Griffith's films in 1910s decade, Murnau's Masterpiece 'Sunrise' in 20s decade to 'The Crowd' (1928) to Rom-coms in 30s to Hollywood classics of 40s like 'Casablanca' and so on 500 more from world cinema. The last high end classic in the genre was 'Veer Zaara' (2004) and then Marathi Movie 'Shala' (2012) which was quite not a pure Live-story but more like a childhood nostalgia. After seeing like 500+ films in this genre, i don't think any film had such a great storytelling trick like C/o Kancharapalem. The film may look cliched at few occasions but it's just the matter of time. As you finish watching it, you forgive those cliches because of Strong Climax. Talking about the story will spoil all the fun and credibility of it so let's keep it a secret because i want you guys to feel the Original impact of. It includes 4 unconventional love stories set in the town and including the people of Kancherapalem, that's all i can tell and that's all you should know. Leave rest of the story for the viewing experience. The film features a cast of over 80 non-actors, most of them native to Kancharapalem, a neighbourhood where the film is set and everyone has given natural and honest performance. Venkatesh Maha has worked on nuances very smartly. His direction is just outstanding, i just can't tell how because then i have to talk about the scenes which will spoil all the fun. I have never rated any Love story above 8/10* except for just 4 or 5 out of 500+ films, and now i am going to give 8.5/10* to this one. Now, you know what High Level of Classic it is. Overall, A MUST MUST MUST WATCH !RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",hands down telugu cinema greatest storytelling ever love story genre indian cinema,c o kancharapalem 2018 brief review hands down telugu cinema greatest storytelling ever love story genre indian cinema i have been all major classics romance genre starting right d w griffiths films 1910s decade murnaus masterpiece sunrise 20s decade crowd 1928 rom coms 30s hollywood classics 40s like casablanca so 500 more world cinema last high end classic genre was veer zaara 2004 then marathi movie shala 2012 which was quite not pure live story but more like childhood nostalgia after seeing like 500 films this genre i dont think any film had such great storytelling trick like c o kancharapalem film may look cliched at few occasions but its just matter time as you finish watching it you forgive those cliches because strong climax talking about story will spoil all fun credibility it so lets keep it secret because i want you guys feel original impact it includes 4 unconventional love stories set town including people kancherapalem thats all i can tell thats all you should know leave rest story viewing experience film features cast over 80 non actors most them native kancharapalem neighbourhood where film is set everyone has given natural honest performance venkatesh maha has worked nuances very smartly his direction is just outstanding i just cant tell how because then i have talk about scenes which will spoil all fun i have never rated any love story above 8 10 except just 4 or 5 out 500 films now i am going give 8 5 10 this one now you know what high level classic it is overall must must must watch rating 8 5 10 by,0.48530202821869495,0.2585156124739457,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"
