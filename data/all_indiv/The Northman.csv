4,Surprisingly mediocre,Where do I start? No real drama. No character development. The most cornball dialogue. Sloppy plot. Poor use of a potentially spectacular landscape. Bland soundtrack. I think any episode of VIKINGS would surpass this film. I was blown away by how ordinary it was and almost walked out. It was cinema by numbers that added up to far less than its parts. This film should have been absolutely epic. Terribly disappointing. It was well over two hours of boredom. Anyone claiming it a masterpiece should be banned from entering Valhalla!,surprisingly mediocre,where do i start no real drama no character development most cornball dialogue sloppy plot poor use potentially spectacular landscape bland soundtrack i think any episode vikings would surpass this film i was blown away by how ordinary it was almost walked out it was cinema by numbers that added up far less than its parts this film should have been absolutely epic terribly disappointing it was well over two hours boredom anyone claiming it masterpiece should be banned entering valhalla,0.6291666666666667,-0.10833333333333332,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.35}"
5,Who knew Vikings and Vengeance could be such a boring combination?,"I won't waste too much time with this one. If you've had the misfortune to watch the recent movie ""The Green Knight"" then be prepared for more of the same pseudo art-house nonsense here.Coming from ""visionary"" director Robert Eggers (if you ask me, he's had one too many ""visions"") this is a dull, tedious slog. Now, as my title suggests, it seems inconceivable (yes I do know what that word means!) that putting vikings and a tale of vengeance together could be such a dud, but here it is.The Northman manages to take a story that should easily fit in the old 90 minute movie bracket and pad it out to nearly two and a quarter hours. The padding comes in the form of trippy daydreams/hallucinations by the main character as he suffers to satisfy his vengeance. Yeah, you'll want to skip those if you can.I've only given this as many points as I have because at least there was a small twist in the story, albeit a blindingly obvious one to do with the ""hero's"" mother. That, and the ending which...lets just say it isn't surprising given the story. That lack of surprise ending will still leave you with that sinking feeling. A feeling that you've just wasted two hours of your life on what amounts to an episode of Vikings that was discarded in the writer's room.SUMMARY: Going to Iceland (the store) is less tedious and frustrating than going to Iceland (the place) in this movie. Too much ""visionary"" and not enough ""entertaining"" in this one. Skip it, watch Vikings again, or Conan, or 13th Warrior or Outlander (2008). All are much, much more fun.",who knew vikings vengeance could be such boring combination,i wont waste too much time with this one if youve had misfortune watch recent movie green knight then be prepared more same pseudo art house nonsense here coming visionary director robert eggers if you ask me hes had one too many visions this is dull tedious slog now as my title suggests it seems inconceivable yes i do know what that word means that putting vikings tale vengeance together could be such dud but here it is northman manages take story that should easily fit old 90 minute movie bracket pad it out nearly two quarter hours padding comes form trippy daydreams hallucinations by main character as he suffers satisfy his vengeance yeah youll want skip those if you can ive only given this as many points as i have because at least there was small twist story albeit blindingly obvious one do with heros mother that ending which lets just say it isnt surprising given story that lack surprise ending will still leave you with that sinking feeling feeling that youve just wasted two hours your life what amounts episode vikings that was discarded writers room summary going iceland store is less tedious frustrating than going iceland place this movie too much visionary not enough entertaining this one skip it watch vikings again or conan or 13th warrior or outlander 2008 all are much much more fun,0.44772727272727275,0.0017676767676767598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"

6,It delivered less than I had expected...,"Well, the movie's cover/poster definitely was interesting enough to catch my attention. And I figured that with the movie's 7.8 rating on IMDb, in this writing moment, then I would be in for something grand here.And I will admit that I was excited to see what writers Sjón and Robert Eggers had in store for me here with the 2 hours and 17 minutes that the movie ran for.However, I must say that while ""The Northman"" was watchable, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill Viking-inspired movie, for better or worse. Sure, it was a watchable movie and entertaining enough for what it was. But don't get your hopes up for this one. If you've seen other Viking movies, or TV series for that matter, then you already know what you are in for here. Yeah, director Robert Eggers didn't deviate much from the how-to-make-a-Viking-saga-movie blueprint.Visually then ""The Northman"" was interesting, as it definitely felt like an era-appropriate movie. I did like the props, costumes, sets, scenery, etc., because it definitely looked and felt like what is usually associated with the Vikings era.""The Northman"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and even Willem Dafoe. All great talents, sure, but some of them do raise a wondering sensation as to why they were cast for a Viking movie. But on the other hand, I will say that casting Icelandic singer Björk for the movie, despite being a minor role and appearance, was just phenomenal.Something that didn't sit well with me in ""The Northman"", was the fact that it was English language based. Sure, I understand that from a wider appeal to the audience approach. But it just feels wrong having Vikings speak English, it just takes away from the atmosphere and the believability. And also the supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling to me. Sure, I understand that the Valkyries are a part of Norse lore, but having a pale woman with retainers on her teeth screaming and sitting on a flying horse just doesn't really work.I was expecting more than just your average generic Viking movie from director Robert Eggers, and I was somewhat disappointed when the movie just turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Viking movie. It could and should have been so much more, especially for a production of this magnitude.While ""The Northman"" is watchable and entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, then this is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.My rating of ""The Northman"" lands on a six out of ten stars. It is the atmosphere, the brutality in the movie, and some of the performances that managed to snag the rating up from five to a six star rating for me.",it delivered less than i had expected,well movies cover poster definitely was interesting enough catch my attention i figured that with movies 7 8 rating imdb this writing moment then i would be something grand here i will admit that i was excited see what writers sj n robert eggers had store me here with 2 hours 17 minutes that movie ran however i must say that while northman was watchable it was ultimately just another run mill viking inspired movie better or worse sure it was watchable movie entertaining enough what it was but dont get your hopes up this one if youve seen other viking movies or tv series that matter then you already know what you are here yeah director robert eggers didnt deviate much how make viking saga movie blueprint visually then northman was interesting as it definitely felt like era appropriate movie i did like props costumes sets scenery etc because it definitely looked felt like what is usually associated with vikings era northman has good cast ensemble with likes alexander skarsg rd nicole kidman claes bang ethan hawke even willem dafoe all great talents sure but some them do raise wondering sensation as why they were cast viking movie but other hand i will say that casting icelandic singer bj rk movie despite being minor role appearance was just phenomenal something that didnt sit well with me northman was fact that it was english language based sure i understand that wider appeal audience approach but it just feels wrong having vikings speak english it just takes away atmosphere believability also supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling me sure i understand that valkyries are part norse lore but having pale woman with retainers her teeth screaming sitting flying horse just doesnt really work i was expecting more than just your average generic viking movie director robert eggers i was somewhat disappointed when movie just turned out be run mill viking movie it could should have been so much more especially production this magnitude while northman is watchable entertaining enough what it turned out be then this is hardly movie that i will be returning watch second time my rating northman lands six out ten stars it is atmosphere brutality movie some performances that managed snag rating up five six star rating me,0.4904468599033816,0.13746376811594202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6,"Well Produced, but Dark, Slow and Not Engaging","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Anything novel and not Marvel. But, unfortunately, this movie was dark, slow and not engaging. It started off with the harsh power of humanity to endure hardship and to impose it, but then went flat with the story. Nothing to learn, no one to love or hate, nothing to make you a character. Not intending the ultimate insult, but perhaps it is: you never forget you're watching a movie. You don't become one with it. However, it could win an Academy award for the production or costumes, but none of that makes up for a dark, slow and non-engaging story.",well produced but dark slow not engaging,i wanted like this movie i really did anything novel not marvel but unfortunately this movie was dark slow not engaging it started off with harsh power humanity endure hardship impose it but then went flat with story nothing learn no one love or hate nothing make you character not intending ultimate insult but perhaps it is you never forget youre watching movie you dont become one with it however it could win academy award production or costumes but none that makes up dark slow non engaging story,0.5544117647058824,-0.08088235294117647,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.26}"

5,Hawke The Slayer,"This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping ""The Northman"" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic volcano that looms over Iceland throughout the film and features in the ending. The fight scenes are generally well done, though I don't necessarily think that they were as gory as I hoped, or as others seem to have found them. Skarsgard's performance was good, though if I'm honest I'm not sure that any of the rest of the cast (perhaps with the exception of Claes Bang) really fit the roles they were playing. . . These are all actors I like in other things, but personally felt like they were miscast here.Again, I really do feel like on another day, or perhaps at home rather than at the cinema I might have enjoyed the film more, but it felt long, and I didn't care for the times when the film took its more artistic flights of fancy. The film I'd compare it too is ""The Green Knight"", which is similar in terms of tone and use of fantasy elements, though obviously with a different cultural mythology.It's not often that I feel like the problem with a film I haven't enjoyed might be me, rather than the film - but ""The Northman"" feels like a film that's going to divide it's audience and, this time, I'm not sold.",hawke slayer,this might be unpopular one but i guess i have speak truth as i found it which was that i was hoping northman would be crazy wild brutal viking adventure which some elements it is but its also lyrical arthouse style loose adaptation amleth that perhaps caught me wrong mood truly appreciate king aruvandil ethan hawke is viking king who is murdered by his brother fjolnir claes bang who takes his estate his queen gudrun nicole kidman fjolnir fails kill his son amleth oscar novak alexander skarsgard though who swears revenge as child after years killing pillaging with adopted clan learns that fjolnir has moved iceland infiltrating household as slave amelth joins forces with olga anya taylor joy another slave house his long awaited vengeance begins i can see why people liked it its beautiful look at shot practical locations using cgi enhance scenes when required such as epic volcano that looms over iceland throughout film features ending fight scenes are generally well done though i dont necessarily think that they were as gory as i hoped or as others seem have found them skarsgards performance was good though if im honest im not sure that any rest cast perhaps with exception claes bang really fit roles they were playing these are all actors i like other things but personally felt like they were miscast here again i really do feel like another day or perhaps at home rather than at cinema i might have enjoyed film more but it felt long i didnt care times when film took its more artistic flights fancy film id compare it too is green knight which is similar terms tone use fantasy elements though obviously with different cultural mythology its not often that i feel like problem with film i havent enjoyed might be me rather than film but northman feels like film thats going divide its audience this time im not sold,0.5737308987308988,0.09413364413364415,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8,Beastliness incarnate,"Everything about this movie screams ""beastly."" Literal screams along with metaphorical ones. It's a beastly movie with a beastly cast giving beastly performances behind a backdrop of beastly cinematography scored with beastly music. Beastly men in beastly fights.I had a smile on my face for most of the movie. I was fully invested in the story and characters. The directing is top-notch with a style that gives the movie a character of its own. There are so many beautiful shots. And I give it major props for going all out and holding nothing back (we need more R-rated movies!!).In my review for Dune, I mentioned that so many scenes feel so epic even without action. Regular scenes of them walking are somehow epic. It's the same way with The Northman. It's filled with epic non-action moments, which are heavily aided by the music and cinematography. When this is the case, even the slow parts feel escalated.The entire cast gives great performances, but I need to single out Anya Taylor-Joy. I want her cast in every movie. She has the acting talent as well as a screen presence and charisma that has you glued to every scene she's in. I've liked her in everything I've seen of hers, which already includes so many great movies like Split/Glass, Last Night in Soho, and Morgan. We're witnessing the birth of a star. It's possible I'm a bit biased due to her being one of the most beautiful women on the planet.I highly recommend The Northman.

8,stylish Conan,"Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) wants to avenge his father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) who was killed by his uncle Fjölnir The Brotherless (Claes Bang). Fjölnir stole his father's kingdom and his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). It's early tenth century. He has been raised as a berserker pillaging for a slaving warlord. A defeated witch proclaim his prophesized vengeance. He pretends to be a slave to be sold to Fjölnir. Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a fellow slave who sees through his ruse.This is a stylish brutal tale of violence and revenge worthy of the Vikings. This is a Scandinavian legend which supposedly inspired Hamlet. It's Game of Thrones and Conan the Barbarian except more brutal. The acting is great with a shocking turn from Nicole Kidman. She's always great but in this one, she accesses something manically dark. I would make a small addition. An exterior Christian threat needs to be stated more prominently so that they're automatically assumed to be the killers. The naked bodies should be positioned into a cross or maybe they could be crucified. That would be enough of a misdirection. Otherwise, Amleth would be a good suspect. The family should not be that clueless.

10,A brutal epic that makes clear Robert Eggers is one of the greats,"My first impression is that this is a contender for the Most Metal Movid. It's like when you first see The Wild Bunch with a good screen and sound, you leave with more chest hair than when you came into it (whether you're a man or a woman). It's brawny, bloody, brutal, graphic revenge fiction made by a filmmaker who is so sincere that any further to the right or left and it could could self parody. It never is and if I found myself chuckling over how unique a giant vision of how violence dooms.... everything and everyone.Eggers and his absolute Top of the Heap artisans and designers, from the designers of those trippy sequences to whichever team made *that* severed head to the volcano set piece and location scouts etc etc, manage to transport you to a time and place that is not familiar to I'd suspect 90% of us, and even for like a Game of Thrones comparison that has more of a modern sensibility and humor than this. Eggers and Sion manages to pack two semesters worth of study on Mythology into a little over two hours in a completely organic sensibility.But there's a mystery to parts of the symbolism here that I'm sure will keep me coming back to analyze things like the Supernatural and otherworldly (are they totems to the afterlife? What about the Valhalla woman on the horse riding into the sky? Well... all of a piece, right). Amid the transporting into this other realm is this sense that violence is so overencompansing it can swallow you whole.And the performances add to this feeling of fervor and intensity and with 11000% pathos going on in that similar sincerity with the design elements. And occasionally much needingly with Anya Taylor Joy, who is so strong as the pulsating beating heart beneath this thing. Someone like her character helps to not so much soften but balance out how almost everyone else here, certainly Skarsgard in a towering and angry but vulnerable turn but also Hawke in his time and Kidman when she gets her moments (next Oscar already throw her one she is staggeringly good), is firing on these cylinders of seriousness and primal rage and sadness and just.... fire is the word for it.

10,One goal/destination/plan,"Considering the trailer had the quote being said over and over again (""I will avenge you ... I will save you .. I will kill you ..."" leaving the spaces on purpose in case someone has not seen the trailer, you can find out about that in the movie then), it is a bit surprising that the grown man we see seems to have forgotten about the words he uttered over and over again as a kid.That being said, it does give another nice turning point and introduces us to an interesting and intriguing character. I am not too familiar with Vikings folklore and saga (I didn't even know much about the History behind the very good tv show Vikings), but I imagine Eggers did quite a bit of research. And I think you can tell by watching it. Even if I hadn't seen a video of him explaining one scene (the first time we see the adult version of out main character that is, on a boat), I could feel that there is a lot of authenticity in the movie.That begins with the set and production design and goes beyond that to the lighting and costumes. The movie is quite dark and while they surely must have used artificial lighting (or at least some digital enhancement), it does feel like you only get the natural lighting that the scene provides. That is quite astounding, all things considered. Especially how producers and audiences want or are used their movies to look like.Talking about looking like: if you are into handsome and well trained bodies, the movie will please with Skarsgard and his transformation - his physical appearance that is. But the movie does not only look good, it also sounds good. While the Green Knight still is something I will remember fondly when it comes to its sound design, this also makes the best use of music and general sounds to create an atmosphere that is truly amazing.There is so much one can write about this and you do not even have to go into the revenge theme of the movie. Or the Valhalla saga - or anything related to the story. Or any of the specific characters - because while the movie seems straightforward, there are a couple of twists along the way. Although I kind of felt one of them more or less coming. Not all of the twist and I did not suspect the reasons behind it, but it did make sense the way it was presented.If you have seen an Eggers movie (The Witch and The Lighthouse come to mind right now), you will be familiar that his movies are not easy. They are also not exactly something that anyone would call blockbuster material ... but they are very well done. And while this takes its time too, to get us to the good parts, there quite a few we will encounter. You can not be faint hearted or easily offended though. I suspect that what I read about producers interfering might have had some impact towards the end. Especially with one scene where the death of a character is not as graphic as it could be, because ... well political correctness and all that. But you'll understand once you see it.Certain things seem inevitable ... and the movies end is one of them. Greatly achieved though - and so well shot. There could have been even more blood, but that doesn't mean that the movie holds back. Also the long tracking shots combined with the action they portray surely where quite hard to achieve anyway or as it is. I can highly recommend this - and I am happy I watched it in cinemas too.",one goal destination plan,considering trailer had quote being said over over again i will avenge you i will save you i will kill you leaving spaces purpose case someone has not seen trailer you can find out about that movie then it is bit surprising that grown man we see seems have forgotten about words he uttered over over again as kid that being said it does give another nice turning point introduces us interesting intriguing character i am not too familiar with vikings folklore saga i didnt even know much about history behind very good tv show vikings but i imagine eggers did quite bit research i think you can tell by watching it even if i hadnt seen video him explaining one scene first time we see adult version out main character that is boat i could feel that there is lot authenticity movie that begins with set production design goes beyond that lighting costumes movie is quite dark while they surely must have used artificial lighting or at least some digital enhancement it does feel like you only get natural lighting that scene provides that is quite astounding all things considered especially how producers audiences want or are used their movies look like talking about looking like if you are into handsome well trained bodies movie will please with skarsgard his transformation his physical appearance that is but movie does not only look good it also sounds good while green knight still is something i will remember fondly when it comes its sound design this also makes best use music general sounds create atmosphere that is truly amazing there is so much one can write about this you do not even have go into revenge theme movie or valhalla saga or anything related story or any specific characters because while movie seems straightforward there are couple twists along way although i kind felt one them more or less coming not all twist i did not suspect reasons behind it but it did make sense way it was presented if you have seen eggers movie witch lighthouse come mind right now you will be familiar that his movies are not easy they are also not exactly something that anyone would call blockbuster material but they are very well done while this takes its time too get us good parts there quite few we will encounter you can not be faint hearted or easily offended though i suspect that what i read about producers interfering might have had some impact towards end especially with one scene where death character is not as graphic as it could be because well political correctness all that but youll understand once you see it certain things seem inevitable movies end is one them greatly achieved though so well shot there could have been even more blood but that doesnt mean that movie holds back also long tracking shots combined with action they portray surely where quite hard achieve anyway or as it is i can highly recommend this i am happy i watched it cinemas too,0.5496281362007167,0.19487903225806452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"
5,Robert Eggers' weakest film,"While they definitely aren't for all tastes, I was blown away by the originality and singular visions of ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" even if they still are so specific that I still had my criticisms of them. As a result, I was hoping for this to be a truly unique and memorable cinematic experience. Unfortunately, it looks and sounds incredible but otherwise ended up being a letdown in my book. It's certainly Eggers' weakest film yet, which is disappointing.The film centers on a Viking whose father is killed by his uncle when he is very young. Decades later, he is a berserker raiding villages who ends up plotting a bloody plot for vengeance. Shot on location in Iceland, the film's cinematography is often beautiful, with expansive and wide shots. The film's score is also stirring and authentic. Everything looks and sounds incredible in a Dolby Cinema screen, accentuated by Eggers' precise attention to historical accuracy that we see throughout his films. Tragically, though, these technical qualities are about where the strengths of the film end. Unlike ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" this film feels oddly derivative. The story feels like a recycled revenge plot, and the brutal Viking action doesn't feel like something we haven't seen before. While those two other films generally lacked plots in a conventional sense, people who enjoyed them could successfully argue that they made up for such a lack of plot in clear vision. They were uniquely atmospheric and created pitch-perfect senses of suspense and dread, accentuated by the period detail and aesthetics. Unfortunately, ""The Northman"" just doesn't feel as atmospheric or tonally unique. This might in part be caused by the fact that it has a much bigger budget than those other two films, but it also means that I feel the film dragged on a bit longer than it should have. You can have a unique plot and/or an engaging atmosphere. Some films have one of these elements, and some have both. But unfortunately, I feel like the derivativeness of the plot and the sometimes-choppy editing and pacing ended up getting the better of it. In ""The Lighthouse"" and ""The Witch,"" you felt genuine psychological peril that could make you appreciate the comparatively low-but-serious stakes of the characters. The same cannot be said here. All of the violent Viking action is plentiful, but it gets very predictable and repetitive, and simply just doesn't feel as impactful or soulful as genuine psychological suspense and taut narrative creativity. Sadly, I don't recommend this one. 5/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema.

5,"The technical quality of ""The Northman"" doesn't carry over in its storytelling","I was looking forward to ""The Northman"" due to a variety of different reasons.... or, if I'm being honest, just one: Anya Taylor-Joy. The talented, gorgeous seductress she is, once I learned that she would play a starring role in this film, I knew I had to see it on the largest screen possible. Unfortunately, the theatre I went to had an unfortunately small screen that certainly detracted from my viewing experience; maybe this was a strategic move, however, on the part of the studio, as now I will be going to see this movie again at a different cinema, preferably one with a bigger silver screen. And as I am so willing to go pay to see this movie again, surely I must have loved it.... right? Wrong - and don't call me Shirley.""The Northman"" is no doubt overhyped. Directed by Robert Eggers, who has made ""The Witch"" (which I adore) and ""The Lighthouse"" (which I haven't yet seen), ""The Northman"" is his third feature, one that was making a name for itself before it was even released due to how well-received his previous two movies were. In all honesty, it seems like people were ready to love this without even having seen it yet, and I believe that, because of this excitement, people (critics included) are having a difficult time looking at this movie objectively - because with all there is to appreciate, there is also an equal amount to criticize.Anya Taylor-Joy is perfection, as always - she's not just beautiful, but she is proving her range as an actress in each and every role she chooses. Yes, she may have been my reason for buying a ticket to this, but I was equally as impressed with virtually everyone in here. Alexander Skarsgård is one of my favorite actors, and he was very effective as a monstrous brooding brute. Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman also do well with what they have; in short, the acting is good - that is, when the script allows it to be. Because, even though the actors and actresses are clearly committed to their parts, the script is full of borderline embarrassing dialogue. Conversations have no substance to them, with people speaking as if they've never spoken before. Many lines are simplistic to the extreme, almost as if they were written by a mediocre fan fiction writer. You can almost look past it due to the clear competence of the performers, but my near constant eye rolls had me wishing for a better screenplay.If you've seen the trailer for this, you already know the movie looks incredible - and it does. My eyes were constantly glued to the screen, soaking up the scenery. Similarly, my ears found themselves honed in on the soundtrack; basically a star in and of itself, the score here booms through the theatre sound systems. Ominous and engrossing, the soundtrack is nearly constant, seeping everything in a sense of horror and unease - and it's effective (and so loud that, even if you find yourself bored, you won't be able to fall asleep). Visually and audibly, ""The Northman"" is 100% worth the price of admission. From a plot and story perspective, however, you'll find it lacking.""The Northman"" has a simplistic story - perhaps too simplistic for its own good. Following a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father's murder, you'd think that Eggers would have something unique up his sleeve. I assumed that he'd either fill this movie with great action and have this be his entry into blockbuster filmmaking, or if not that, at the least attempt to throw a wrench in what is otherwise a traditional revenge movie. Alas, he does neither! ""The Northman"" does not have enough action to qualify as a satisfying action movie (granted, the action is filmed well, but is surprisingly tame and not as bloody as I expected or wanted) nor does it have enough plot twists to switch things up from average revenge fare. The movie meanders, barely picking up any steam except for the occasional burst of violence. You'll spend a lot of time watching characters engage in uninteresting conversations that could've been interesting with better dialogue. You'll see psychedelic dream sequences that are unique the first time, and then quickly overplayed by the second, third, fourth, and fifth time. The story lacks focus; so sure, while you'll see a visual feast of Norse culture that never really leads anywhere, you'll also find yourself asking whether you're watching a revenge movie or a historically accurate portrayal of 900 A. D. life.In many ways ""The Northman"" delivers. It's great to look at (and not just because of Anya Taylor-Joy), with truly immersive world building that draws viewers in with overwhelming sights and sounds. This is a brutal film, one that's not afraid to show Norse culture as it was. This is also a film that has a shocking lack of direction. While I would never say I was bored or disengaged, I can say I found myself slightly confused at the way the movie plodded along; for a movie that's over two hours, not much happens, and when things do happen, it isn't very interesting. I was disappointed in ""The Northman,"" but even so, cannot deny the quality of its technical aspects - I only wish that quality carried over in the storytelling.",technical quality northman doesnt carry over its storytelling,i was looking forward northman due variety different reasons or if im being honest just one anya taylor joy talented gorgeous seductress she is once i learned that she would play starring role this film i knew i had see it largest screen possible unfortunately theatre i went had unfortunately small screen that certainly detracted my viewing experience maybe this was strategic move however part studio as now i will be going see this movie again at different cinema preferably one with bigger silver screen as i am so willing go pay see this movie again surely i must have loved it right wrong dont call me shirley northman is no doubt overhyped directed by robert eggers who has made witch which i adore lighthouse which i havent yet seen northman is his third feature one that was making name itself before it was even released due how well received his previous two movies were all honesty it seems like people were ready love this without even having seen it yet i believe that because this excitement people critics included are having difficult time looking at this movie objectively because with all there is appreciate there is also equal amount criticize anya taylor joy is perfection as always shes not just beautiful but she is proving her range as actress each every role she chooses yes she may have been my reason buying ticket this but i was equally as impressed with virtually everyone here alexander skarsg rd is one my favorite actors he was very effective as monstrous brooding brute ethan hawke nicole kidman also do well with what they have short acting is good that is when script allows it be because even though actors actresses are clearly committed their parts script is full borderline embarrassing dialogue conversations have no substance them with people speaking as if theyve never spoken before many lines are simplistic extreme almost as if they were written by mediocre fan fiction writer you can almost look past it due clear competence performers but my near constant eye rolls had me wishing better screenplay if youve seen trailer this you already know movie looks incredible it does my eyes were constantly glued screen soaking up scenery similarly my ears found themselves honed soundtrack basically star itself score here booms through theatre sound systems ominous engrossing soundtrack is nearly constant seeping everything sense horror unease its effective so loud that even if you find yourself bored you wont be able fall asleep visually audibly northman is 100 worth price admission plot story perspective however youll find it lacking northman has simplistic story perhaps too simplistic its own good following young viking prince his quest avenge his fathers murder youd think that eggers would have something unique up his sleeve i assumed that hed either fill this movie with great action have this be his entry into blockbuster filmmaking or if not that at least attempt throw wrench what is otherwise traditional revenge movie alas he does neither northman does not have enough action qualify as satisfying action movie granted action is filmed well but is surprisingly tame not as bloody as i expected or wanted nor does it have enough plot twists switch things up average revenge fare movie meanders barely picking up any steam except occasional burst violence youll spend lot time watching characters engage uninteresting conversations that couldve been interesting with better dialogue youll see psychedelic dream sequences that are unique first time then quickly overplayed by second third fourth fifth time story lacks focus so sure while youll see visual feast norse culture that never really leads anywhere youll also find yourself asking whether youre watching revenge movie or historically accurate portrayal 900 d life many ways northman delivers its great look at not just because anya taylor joy with truly immersive world building that draws viewers with overwhelming sights sounds this is brutal film one thats not afraid show norse culture as it was this is also film that has shocking lack direction while i would never say i was bored or disengaged i can say i found myself slightly confused at way movie plodded along movie thats over two hours not much happens when things do happen it isnt very interesting i was disappointed northman but even so cannot deny quality its technical aspects i only wish that quality carried over storytelling,0.5409869194591418,0.13152777777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
