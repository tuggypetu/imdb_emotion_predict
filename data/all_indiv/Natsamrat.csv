10,Nana Patekar brilliance reminds us what Bollywood is missing out on,"The words uttered by Ganpatrao in Natsamrat feels like a religious discourse, falling on ears like a soothing balm. It is after many a long years that dialogues with such finesse have been put up on the screen. They seem nothing less than those featured in plays Ganpatrao cherishes and brings to life on stage. Screenplay writers nowadays dumb down their content in a disquietude that the audience will not comprehend the gems of emotions they hide beneath the curtains called words. Here, the writing is intelligent treating the audience with the reverence it is often penurious of.A forlorn Ganpatrao asks in an address to the characters he religiously brought into life 'When will my grief be considered worthy as yours?' Nana Patekar rises to this very question and breathes fire into this character. There are rare times when an actor just draws you into a movie, when he rises above the movie itself and well, puts you in a state of limbo where you are divested from your physical abilities to move. You just stare and get amazed. I hate to say it because I believe staunchly that every actor has untapped potential beyond realization, but this is a career-defining performance by Nana. He can't rise above this unfortunately and it is an amalgamation of sadness and joy when I come to this realization.As to the movie itself, it is left miles behind in the inter space between it and Patekar's performance. It is ridden with the very clichés I had expected it to be free from the shackles of. The premise, although bases on a play by V.V.Shirwadkar, brings back memories of a much-superior Tokyo Story(or a much inferior Baghban as well), which forever immortalized the theme of the neglectful children-old parents through the mastery of the profound Ozu himself .While being a compelling character-study, Natsamrat is lagging behind on adapting itself to the familiarity of its concept to the audience. But, with Nana Patekar's visceral performance the movie is aeons ahead of what it could have been without him. It is Manjrekar's ode to the purity and greatness of theater and its dialogues which remain forever etched in the minds of the audience, and peering through that field of vision, it is a beautiful and heartfelt ode, a one which should be watched at least once. Patekar's performance embodies every emotion that actors strive to put up on screen through courses of their lifetimes, which in most cases unfortunately, bears not even a dint of success.",nana patekar brilliance reminds us what bollywood is missing out,words uttered by ganpatrao natsamrat feels like religious discourse falling ears like soothing balm it is after many long years that dialogues with such finesse have been put up screen they seem nothing less than those featured plays ganpatrao cherishes brings life stage screenplay writers nowadays dumb down their content disquietude that audience will not comprehend gems emotions they hide beneath curtains called words here writing is intelligent treating audience with reverence it is often penurious forlorn ganpatrao asks address characters he religiously brought into life when will my grief be considered worthy as yours nana patekar rises this very question breathes fire into this character there are rare times when actor just draws you into movie when he rises above movie itself well puts you state limbo where you are divested your physical abilities move you just stare get amazed i hate say it because i believe staunchly that every actor has untapped potential beyond realization but this is career defining performance by nana he cant rise above this unfortunately it is amalgamation sadness joy when i come this realization as movie itself it is left miles behind inter space between it patekars performance it is ridden with very clich s i had expected it be free shackles premise although bases play by v v shirwadkar brings back memories much superior tokyo story or much inferior baghban as well which forever immortalized theme neglectful children old parents through mastery profound ozu himself while being compelling character study natsamrat is lagging behind adapting itself familiarity its concept audience but with nana patekars visceral performance movie is aeons ahead what it could have been without him it is manjrekars ode purity greatness theater its dialogues which remain forever etched minds audience peering through that field vision it is beautiful heartfelt ode one which should be watched at least once patekars performance embodies every emotion that actors strive put up screen through courses their lifetimes which most cases unfortunately bears not even dint success,0.4935490435490434,0.04665242165242165,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,Brilliant; deserves a National Award,"Natsamraat had a pretty good run in theatres, especially for a Marathi movie in Bollywood's heartland Mumbai! With every review being good, and of course with Nana Patekar, I too wanted to see this film and eventually I did last night on DVD.This movie is brilliant and 10 is not high enough a rating. Nana Patekar is at his very best. The story is riveting, so real and so poignant, a story of our times, unfolding through the powerful dialogues of a Natsamraat who certainly deserves the title.This is so different from the stereotyped roles Nana Patekar plays in Bollywood films.Natsamraat has English sub titles. My Marathi is of the spoken variety and I read the sub titles for some of the dialogues but as the movie progressed, they were not necessary because the manner in which Nana delivered his dialogues was sufficient to convey the meaning of every single word.This film ought to have sub titles in all major regional languages for a wider audience, and it surely deserves the National Award.",brilliant deserves national award,natsamraat had pretty good run theatres especially marathi movie bollywoods heartland mumbai with every review being good course with nana patekar i too wanted see this film eventually i did last night dvd this movie is brilliant 10 is not high enough rating nana patekar is at his very best story is riveting so real so poignant story our times unfolding through powerful dialogues natsamraat who certainly deserves title this is so different stereotyped roles nana patekar plays bollywood films natsamraat has english sub titles my marathi is spoken variety i read sub titles some dialogues but as movie progressed they were not necessary because manner which nana delivered his dialogues was sufficient convey meaning every single word this film ought have sub titles all major regional languages wider audience it surely deserves national award,0.6724414210128495,0.27501700680272106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,This is what I call a perfect movie.!!,"This is what I call a perfect movie. Natsamrat is a must watch movie. Nana Patekar proves yet again that not only is he an actor par excellence, but also he has a power to totally grip you till the end of his films. His performance is so brutally honest, that it will tear your heart into pieces as you sit transfixed, watching him with rapt attention.  Just as Nana's Ganpatrao says in the movie, a true skill of any actor is not to let his viewer get distracted by a packet of snacks while watching him on stage. Nana does the exact same thing to you. It is not like this actor has not impressed us with his stage or screen presence before. But this film is different. Simply, because it is just so him. Nana does it with panache and adds value complete with some wonderful layers to the character in his own trademark style. Here is why you must start your New Year with his wonderful, wonderful movie. For those who don't know, Natsamrat is a cinematic adaptation from V V Shirwadkar (Kusumagraj's) iconic play by the same name. Natsamrat essayed by Nana is a celebrated veteran Shakespearean theatre artiste who is struggling to negotiate with the harsh realities of life once his fame begins to fade away. This character is based on Shakespeare's King Lear. Vikram Gokhale is Nana's companion, confidante and also a competitor. Together, they rule the theatre world before they age and decide to retire gracefully. The film deals with an actor's confusion of the whole 'To Be or Not To Be' question which life poses before him after his glory fades. It is essentially about the performer lurking in every retired actor who just can't enough of the stage and his audience. It is also about the better half and family of such an actor who in Medha Manjrekar's (who plays Nana's on screen wife in the movie) words, ""Don't leave theatre, but get it to their homes and lives."" The film is also mainly about the ruthless society we reside in. Natsamrat on its own is a powerfully written play. Nana's rendition of Kusumagraj's heart wrenching soliloquies will make you cry but will your heart will feel light and deliriously content, I guarantee. This film is intense and extremely honest but it has its light moments. Moments which will make you laugh hysterically but will sometimes leave a sombre aftertaste. Interactions between Nana and Vikram Gokhale are beyond fabulous. They are wry, sarcastic and funny as hell. Though the focus is on Nana, all the supporting actors play their part very well. An actor can put act into his performance superbly well only he completely forgets himself in front of the camera and becomes one with the character he plays. Nana does exactly that. We forget Nana Patekar while watching him playing the Natsamrat. And, that's the success of any actor. Story, screenplay, background score, cinematography, acting and direction everything is superb. One should not miss this unforgettable movie experience.",this is what i call perfect movie,this is what i call perfect movie natsamrat is must watch movie nana patekar proves yet again that not only is he actor par excellence but also he has power totally grip you till end his films his performance is so brutally honest that it will tear your heart into pieces as you sit transfixed watching him with rapt attention just as nanas ganpatrao says movie true skill any actor is not let his viewer get distracted by packet snacks while watching him stage nana does exact same thing you it is not like this actor has not impressed us with his stage or screen presence before but this film is different simply because it is just so him nana does it with panache adds value complete with some wonderful layers character his own trademark style here is why you must start your new year with his wonderful wonderful movie those who dont know natsamrat is cinematic adaptation v v shirwadkar kusumagrajs iconic play by same name natsamrat essayed by nana is celebrated veteran shakespearean theatre artiste who is struggling negotiate with harsh realities life once his fame begins fade away this character is based shakespeares king lear vikram gokhale is nanas companion confidante also competitor together they rule theatre world before they age decide retire gracefully film deals with actors confusion whole be or not be question which life poses before him after his glory fades it is essentially about performer lurking every retired actor who just cant enough stage his audience it is also about better half family such actor who medha manjrekars who plays nanas screen wife movie words dont leave theatre but get it their homes lives film is also mainly about ruthless society we reside natsamrat its own is powerfully written play nanas rendition kusumagrajs heart wrenching soliloquies will make you cry but will your heart will feel light deliriously content i guarantee this film is intense extremely honest but it has its light moments moments which will make you laugh hysterically but will sometimes leave sombre aftertaste interactions between nana vikram gokhale are beyond fabulous they are wry sarcastic funny as hell though focus is nana all supporting actors play their part very well actor can put act into his performance superbly well only he completely forgets himself front camera becomes one with character he plays nana does exactly that we forget nana patekar while watching him playing natsamrat thats success any actor story screenplay background score cinematography acting direction everything is superb one should not miss this unforgettable movie experience,0.6200318549375153,0.25728987993138935,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,Phenomenal acting and poetry,"I cant figure out any flaw with any part of this movie. This movie actually urged me to open an IMDb account and rate it as 10 stars as I really want the world to see what a masterpiece has been created by a small community of enthusiasts. Though the story has been adapted from an old Marathi play the movie does justice to every aspect of film making. The poems are mesmerizing. The acting is outstanding. The movie makes you question the harsh reality of relationships and standing up for what you believe in. A post retirement story of a down to earth actor parallels with the different acts he has played in his lifetime.

10,"Movie Review: My reverence to ""Natsamrat"" Nana Patekar","Some movies go beyond the visuals, the dialogues, the script & even the actors to make an ineffaceable mark on your memory lane. Natsamrat is one such astonishing piece of cinema!A screen adaptation of Kusumagraj's iconic Marathi play ""Natsamrat"", this movie takes us through the life of a veteran theater actor named Ganpat ""Appa"" Belwalkar (Nana Patekar), the fame & stardom during his heydays & the tragic upturn of his life after his retirement. The agony of the lead character is heartbreaking and the story telling is path-breaking. This movie leaves you with moist eyes & a scratched soul.Nana Patekar is outstanding as Ganpat Belwalkar. He owns this movie with unmatched conviction. ""Natsamrat"" in literal sense means the ""The King of Actors"" & this man makes you realize that he indeed is amongst the best in Indian cinema. You laugh when he cracks the jokes & you cry when he suffers. He has portrayed this character with such a proficiency that you leave the cinema hall with a reverence to the phenomenon called Nana Patekar!As Amitabh Bachchan is the ""Shenshah""& so is Shahrukh the ""King Khan"". Nana Patekar, should, with due authority, be rechristened as ""Natasamrat Nana Patekar"" after this performance.Vikaram Gokhale as Rambhau is superlative. The veteran actor plays the role with such a conviction that in few scenes he given even Nana Patekar a run for his money. The sequence on his deathbed when Gokhale recites lines from the Mahabharat gave me goosebumps. This movie will be a milestone for this ""Best Man in the Marathi theater"". The scenes of Nana & Vikram Gokhale are the life of this movie. What a camaraderie! It's like watching Sachin & Ganguly bat together. Sheer brilliance!Medha Manjrekar as Kaveri Ganpat Belwalkar is serene. The romance between Anna & Kaveri is ethereal. Mrunmayee Deshpande, Neha Pendse, Sunil Barve play their parts well.The director, Mahesh Manjrekar needs a serious applause for steering the ship such beautifully. The film is an ode to the theater greats from V V Shirwadkar to Shakespeare. The story telling is refined, to-the-point & touches you to the core. Even though the plot is melodramatic & you would have seen similar plots of aging Parents suffering in the hands of their children in movies like Baghbaan, Avatar and many more, Mahesh Manjarekar's Natsamrat hits you the hardest. The director makes you feel the weight of Nana's pain & suffering.Such a kind of cinema needs to be celebrated & it's high time that Marathi Cinema gets its due acclaim & admiration. This movie will make Bollywood realize what they have missed by not using an actor of Nana Patekar's class to his truest potential.My take: A must watch! Go & experience the acting prowess of Nana Patekar.",movie review my reverence natsamrat nana patekar,some movies go beyond visuals dialogues script even actors make ineffaceable mark your memory lane natsamrat is one such astonishing piece cinema screen adaptation kusumagrajs iconic marathi play natsamrat this movie takes us through life veteran theater actor named ganpat appa belwalkar nana patekar fame stardom during his heydays tragic upturn his life after his retirement agony lead character is heartbreaking story telling is path breaking this movie leaves you with moist eyes scratched soul nana patekar is outstanding as ganpat belwalkar he owns this movie with unmatched conviction natsamrat literal sense means king actors this man makes you realize that he indeed is amongst best indian cinema you laugh when he cracks jokes you cry when he suffers he has portrayed this character with such proficiency that you leave cinema hall with reverence phenomenon called nana patekar as amitabh bachchan is shenshah so is shahrukh king khan nana patekar should with due authority be rechristened as natasamrat nana patekar after this performance vikaram gokhale as rambhau is superlative veteran actor plays role with such conviction that few scenes he given even nana patekar run his money sequence his deathbed when gokhale recites lines mahabharat gave me goosebumps this movie will be milestone this best man marathi theater scenes nana vikram gokhale are life this movie what camaraderie its like watching sachin ganguly bat together sheer brilliance medha manjrekar as kaveri ganpat belwalkar is serene romance between anna kaveri is ethereal mrunmayee deshpande neha pendse sunil barve play their parts well director mahesh manjrekar needs serious applause steering ship such beautifully film is ode theater greats v v shirwadkar shakespeare story telling is refined point touches you core even though plot is melodramatic you would have seen similar plots aging parents suffering hands their children movies like baghbaan avatar many more mahesh manjarekars natsamrat hits you hardest director makes you feel weight nanas pain suffering such kind cinema needs be celebrated its high time that marathi cinema gets its due acclaim admiration this movie will make bollywood realize what they have missed by not using actor nana patekars class his truest potential my take must watch go experience acting prowess nana patekar,0.5131609195402299,0.15954022988505745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10,Natsamrat is the best movie of the 2016 with award winning performance from Nana Patekar and brilliant taking of Mahesh Manjrekar.A Masterpiece work....Loved it...,"Natsamrat (2016): Till now I haven't watched any Marathi film but I had heard lot of praise all the times for Nana Patekar and Mahesh Manjrekar.When I have heard about Natsamrat,I have decided that let this movie introduce me to Marthi cinema so I gave it a try..So how is Natsamrat??Did it gave me a good start??Plot: The film is a tragedy about a veteran theater actor named Ganpat ""Appa"" Belwalkar (Nana Patekar) who has been the best of his lot during his heyday, garnering fame and fortune acting in plays based on various works, especially William Shakespeare's. It is a tragedy of a veteran actor who enjoyed a very vital importance in his life but who becomes the victim of old age alienation and estrangement. The film reveals an intensely tragic fate of an actor who becomes victim of fate and fortune in old age, which is similar to the fate of Lear. Natsamrat suffers the pangs of old age and dishonor inflicted on him by his own children. It is a tragedy of great humanist and actor who succumbs to the ill fate and destiny. In fact, Natsamrat is a story of Ganpatrao Belvalkar, who withstands great suffering after his retirement from stage acting.Plus Points:1)Performances: Nana Patekar is truly a Natsamrat.He deserves an award for sure for his mind blowing performance.Patekar, at 65 proves that great actors don't fade away. They simply burn brighter with the growing awareness of mortality. This performance of a man raging against human injustices and God's quirky decree will rank among the most towering performances of Indian cinema.Vikram Gokhale as Rambhau is equally compelling. The sequence on his deathbed when Gokhale recites lines from the Mahabharat makes our hairs stand on-end. This is an actor at the crest of his performing ability.Medha Manjrekar as Sarkaar is brilliant in her role.2)Dialogues Screenplay and Direction: Natsamrat is a very old-fashioned melodramatic morality tale, and that's the highest compliment I can pay this extraordinarily rich emotional drama. One of the residual joys of watching this expansive tear-jerkier is its affectionate and enthusiastic evocation of theater greats from V V Shirwadkar to Shakespeare and, yes, even Tenesee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. The director, rather dexterously brings in the idea of 'Old Theatre' versus 'New Theatre', of changing mores in theater and life.Writers Kiran Yadnopavit, Abhijeet Deshpande for bringing alive a 45-year old play to remind us that great writing is ever renewable.Thank you, Mahesh Manjrekar, for restoring our faith in a cinema that speaks a straight emotional language and doesn't borrow its sensitivities from European cinema.3)Music: Background score is brilliant and carries the feel of the movie perfectly.So,Natsamrat is the best movie of the 2016 with award winning performance from Nana Patekar and brilliant taking of Mahesh Manjrekar.A Masterpiece work....Loved it...My rating 10/10",natsamrat is best movie 2016 with award winning performance nana patekar brilliant taking mahesh manjrekar masterpiece work loved it,natsamrat 2016 till now i havent watched any marathi film but i had heard lot praise all times nana patekar mahesh manjrekar when i have heard about natsamrat i have decided that let this movie introduce me marthi cinema so i gave it try so how is natsamrat did it gave me good start plot film is tragedy about veteran theater actor named ganpat appa belwalkar nana patekar who has been best his lot during his heyday garnering fame fortune acting plays based various works especially william shakespeares it is tragedy veteran actor who enjoyed very vital importance his life but who becomes victim old age alienation estrangement film reveals intensely tragic fate actor who becomes victim fate fortune old age which is similar fate lear natsamrat suffers pangs old age dishonor inflicted him by his own children it is tragedy great humanist actor who succumbs ill fate destiny fact natsamrat is story ganpatrao belvalkar who withstands great suffering after his retirement stage acting plus points 1 performances nana patekar is truly natsamrat he deserves award sure his mind blowing performance patekar at 65 proves that great actors dont fade away they simply burn brighter with growing awareness mortality this performance man raging against human injustices gods quirky decree will rank among most towering performances indian cinema vikram gokhale as rambhau is equally compelling sequence his deathbed when gokhale recites lines mahabharat makes our hairs stand end this is actor at crest his performing ability medha manjrekar as sarkaar is brilliant her role 2 dialogues screenplay direction natsamrat is very old fashioned melodramatic morality tale thats highest compliment i can pay this extraordinarily rich emotional drama one residual joys watching this expansive tear jerkier is its affectionate enthusiastic evocation theater greats v v shirwadkar shakespeare yes even tenesee williams streetcar named desire director rather dexterously brings idea old theatre versus new theatre changing mores theater life writers kiran yadnopavit abhijeet deshpande bringing alive 45 year old play remind us that great writing is ever renewable thank you mahesh manjrekar restoring our faith cinema that speaks straight emotional language doesnt borrow its sensitivities european cinema 3 music background score is brilliant carries feel movie perfectly so natsamrat is best movie 2016 with award winning performance nana patekar brilliant taking mahesh manjrekar masterpiece work loved it my rating 10 10,0.5385292074180962,0.29576599326599323,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10,A Shakespearean tragedy of epic proportions,"Natsamrat is a tribute to a bygone era of Marathi theater which was probably the last great art movement that shaped the texture of the society it inhabited and which it took inspiration from. Life has since moved on and theater has become relegated to the margins of society but a glimpse of what it was capable of has been presented in this great work of art which should become a classic in time.It tells the story of a once - celebrated giant of the stage whose retirement from theater also starts the beginning of his fall from glory into a miserable state of existence, bought about by ungrateful children and a society that has retreated further into its hypocrisy and shallowness. It has no need of a larger than life actor who lives his life with much of the flair and celebration and truthfulness with which he decorated the roles of the great tragedians of the past. Impotent political correctness and circumspect sheepishness is now the order of the day where truth of any kind is banished and manipulative strategies are encouraged, indeed celebrated. Whereas this larger critique of society and a lone man's fight is nothing new to cinema or art, Natsamrat's unique claim to greatness comes from its brilliant synthesis of searching dialogues and superb acting. There are outstanding exchanges between Vikram Gokhale and Nana Patekar musing on the nature of life and its trials. For our generation raised on easy clichés of feel good relationships, these two actors show what the essence of a truly honorable friendship over years really is. The culmination of this brilliant friendship invokes the famous dialogue from the Mahabharata in which Karna questions Krishna on the unjust nature of Fate and Krishna begs forgiveness. A more memorable display of acting will be difficult to find.Its a testament to the acting prowess of Nana Patekar that he is able to take on a role which has been considered a milestone in Marathi theater for decades now. The tragic story of an actor is shown through his identification and questioning of the great roles he has performed. He reminiscences of Lear whose folly and tragic pain mirrors his own. Theatre we are shown is not just a means of entertainment but a profound mirror in which we can seek answers to life's most difficult questions, including the greatest of them all: What's the purpose of life itself ? Its another question whether we have the desire to seek these answers. A society is defined by the questions it asks and not necessarily by the solutions it invents. Out great misfortune today is that we don't question the mysteries of existence anymore. The film deals with many more issues of life, death, suffering and the paradoxical depth and shallowness of the actor. Mention must be made of Medha Manjrekar who plays the dignified stoical wife whose self effacing dedication to her husband is only matched by her lifelong resolve to protect him. She keeps having high temperatures, perhaps because she always takes the storms on herself. A film that should be seen many many times.",shakespearean tragedy epic proportions,natsamrat is tribute bygone era marathi theater which was probably last great art movement that shaped texture society it inhabited which it took inspiration life has since moved theater has become relegated margins society but glimpse what it was capable has been presented this great work art which should become classic time it tells story once celebrated giant stage whose retirement theater also starts beginning his fall glory into miserable state existence bought about by ungrateful children society that has retreated further into its hypocrisy shallowness it has no need larger than life actor who lives his life with much flair celebration truthfulness with which he decorated roles great tragedians past impotent political correctness circumspect sheepishness is now order day where truth any kind is banished manipulative strategies are encouraged indeed celebrated whereas this larger critique society lone mans fight is nothing new cinema or art natsamrats unique claim greatness comes its brilliant synthesis searching dialogues superb acting there are outstanding exchanges between vikram gokhale nana patekar musing nature life its trials our generation raised easy clich s feel good relationships these two actors show what essence truly honorable friendship over years really is culmination this brilliant friendship invokes famous dialogue mahabharata which karna questions krishna unjust nature fate krishna begs forgiveness more memorable display acting will be difficult find its testament acting prowess nana patekar that he is able take role which has been considered milestone marathi theater decades now tragic story actor is shown through his identification questioning great roles he has performed he reminiscences lear whose folly tragic pain mirrors his own theatre we are shown is not just means entertainment but profound mirror which we can seek answers lifes most difficult questions including greatest them all whats purpose life itself its another question whether we have desire seek these answers society is defined by questions it asks not necessarily by solutions it invents out great misfortune today is that we dont question mysteries existence anymore film deals with many more issues life death suffering paradoxical depth shallowness actor mention must be made medha manjrekar who plays dignified stoical wife whose self effacing dedication her husband is only matched by her lifelong resolve protect him she keeps having high temperatures perhaps because she always takes storms herself film that should be seen many many times,0.6434848484848484,0.2616287878787879,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8,An ode to the Forgotten STAGE,"Natsamrat is the answer to what Marathi cinema can do. Spell Magic. Nana Patekar delivers a stellar performance though falters in the parts he is gripped with alcohol. You have an answer there. Vikram Gokhale excels and takes over the baton with a dash of whiskey. Cheers!! I easily cry watching movies but something was amiss here that even emotional scenes to the hilt couldn't roll down a tear down my face. The direction is pretty good but somewhere the writing lacked depth that it couldn't move a weakling like me. All things said, I doubt an actor or a film can better this in Bollywood. Regional cinema in India is gold. Needs to be excavated more. Yes! Excavated!! I am a Keralite born and brought up in Pune and had to rely on subtitles owing to the tough Marathi used in the movie.

10,This Natsamrat Lived For The Stage And Ultimately Died On And For The Stage.,"Masterpiece. No word else can describe what I had just witnessed. Nana Patekar is a great favorite of mine and he has captivated me in films like Parinda(1989), Prahaar(1991), Angaar(1992), Krantiveer (1994), Agni Sakshi(1996), Ghulam-E-Mustafa(1997) Yeshwant(1997), Ab Tak Chhappan (2005) and sequel Ab Tak Chhappan 2(2015), Tarkieb(2000) and Aanch(2003). He has starred in a lot of other films, but these above are a good guide.Back to the film. This film concerns the later years of a great and accomplished actor Ganpat Ramchandra Belwalkar (Nana Patekar), who has retired from the stage with the honorific Natsamrat (King of the Theater). He finds life out of stage awkward. He often makes rude and crude jokes in front of his family and friends. This often leads to a great deal of embarrassment afterwards. Also Ganpat is fond of liquor and gets drunk on many occasions. One day he teaches his grand-daughter a rude nursery rhyme which causes a great stir at school when it is overheard by her teacher. This immediately causes friction between him and his daughter-in-law. Ganpat wills his house to his son and all his money to his daughter. He says he does not need any wealth as he is very old and wants his son and daughter to take care of him and his wife. But however a great tragedy is out to befall him which will test him till the very end. William Shakespeare was a great English playwright specializing in tragedies like Hamlet/Romeo And Juliet/Julius Caesar and many others. This film can be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy and those of you who are of an emotional nature will be driven to tears by what befalls this Natsamrat.The film deals with a major topic not only in India but I feel all over the world. Our parents, who have given birth to us and have taken care of us till early adulthood, suffering all the hardships to make ends meet - should we abandon them in their old age? In American, children rarely live with their parents. The elderly are only seen living in their own homes or at an old age home/institution. The core of the Hindu family revolves around the whole family staying together. Lately, due to the great increase in cost of living and healthcare, due largely to the fact of world overpopulation, a single man of low income can't earn enough money to feel his parents and his children. Thus more and more cases in India and the rest of the world, of the youth abandoning their parents. I think its high time that society need to think about the care of the elderly. Other tragedy films Do Bigha Zamin(1953-this is the film I love the most), Anand (1971 film), Mili(1975), Prem Geet(1981).

The original play which is in Marathi language is considered the hardest role for an actor to play. Almost all actors who have been playing or had played this role for prolonged time on theater have died or had problems relating to heart. That is how intense and involved the role of the main character in this movie is. This is one of the best movie ever created.
