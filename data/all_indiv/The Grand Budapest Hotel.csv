9.0,A hotel well worth revisiting more than once,"That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.While it isn't quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don't like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast's roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson's style), 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.It really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.Alexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it's never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.In conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one's taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox",hotel well worth revisiting more than once,that it was directed by wes anderson who has unique style that really fascinates but admittedly not everybody will like or warm his style that cast is so stellar were reasons enough see grand budapest hotel first place as well as its many accolades critical acclaim while it isnt quite flawless it is easy see why number people dont like or will not like it due lot casts roles being pretty short only gustave zero being fully fleshed out characters those who have problem with andersons style grand budapest hotel is visually stunning hugely entertaining wonderfully weird impeccably cast acted film it really stuns visually with cinematography that is not only clever technique but also gorgeous aesthetic tight fluid editing costumes production design hair make up richly deserved their oscar academy award wins costume production design have lusciously colourful fairy tale feel while also given substance by bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects crime drama aspect story brilliantly alexandre desplat also received oscar with its hauntingly hypnotic entrancing tones it richly deserved it as me it was by far best score those nominated anderson directs superbly story balances darkness quirkiness great effect prison scene is unforgettable its never too simplistic or convoluted though course visuals dialogue performances make much more impact screenplay is sublime mixture dark quirky witty subtle delivered with rapid fire grand budapest hotel boasts impeccable cast pretty much everybody does splendid job though many roles are short my only criticism film is that harvey keitel saoirse ronan are underused just get lost amongst everything else unrecognisable tilda swinton also has little do but still gives bat out hell performance bill murray f murray abraham jeff goldblum jason schwartzman owen wilson give very entertaining performances while edward norton is delightfully droll adrien brody especially willem dafoe bring sinister foreboding film some may say that tony revolori is overshadowed by more experienced cast members being only newcomer large cast big names but me he more than holds his own effectively plays it straight film belongs ralph fiennes what is essentially heart film while he has always been fine actor he has not given performance this brilliant years never knew he could be so riotously funny conclusion wonderful film hotel well worth revisiting more than once if ones taste 9 10 bethany cox,0.660801158301158,0.3258767696267697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Strange and pretty much impossible to describe.,"Wes Anderson's films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" worth seeing. It's an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it's filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson's other films, it's full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it's NOTHING like other films by other directors.The bottom line is that all these weird factors work together to make a film that you'll probably enjoy--but, like me, you won't be exactly sure why!",strange pretty much impossible describe,wes andersons films are really hard describe or define suffice say that he is unique his style very unique this uniqueness is what makes grand budapest hotel worth seeing its odd story where story is told within story its filled with famous actors making lots odd cameos like andersons other films its full odd characters unusual dialog brisk paced editing not surprisingly its nothing like other films by other directors bottom line is that all these weird factors work together make film that youll probably enjoy but like me you wont be exactly sure why,0.6366161616161616,0.06950757575757574,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"Absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful","Can a film be absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful at the same time? Yes. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' combines all those elements. And I didn't even mention the most important characteristic: it is visually wonderful.In this film, director Wes Anderson creates his own universe, full of colourful characters, old-world charm and witty one-liners. The nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect. Every shot, every little detail and every set is flawless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war (The Trans-Alpine Yodel) - Anderson has given thought and attention to everything.The story is not very important, because it is merely a vehicle for the stunning visuals, the dark humour and the rapid-fire dialogue. It's all about a hotel concierge, Gustave H., who is being chased by various villains for stealing a painting. All this is set against the backdrop of the Nazis invading Central Europe (although in Anderson's fantasy world they are not called Nazis of course). Some of the scenes are very funny, but there is always a darker tone because of the looming war. Anderson doesn't shy away from extreme violence, but he shows it in an offbeat and almost comical manner.My favourite scene, in which it all comes together, shows concierges in hotels all over Europe, calling each other to help Gustave H. Each of them is shown in his hotel (with a wonderful fantasy name of course), busy doing some important job like tasting the soup or giving first aid to an unconscious hotel guest, when he is being called away to the telephone. Each hands the job over to his assistant, and answers the phone. This fast succession of little scenes is done so perfectly, it's a great joy to watch.Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the sophisticated Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Because of the amount of support actors, some of them are a bit underused. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel.The film moves forward at a breakneck speed. You have to be very alert in order not to miss something. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time.",absurd funny exciting violent colourful,can film be absurd funny exciting violent colourful at same time yes grand budapest hotel combines all those elements i didnt even mention most important characteristic it is visually wonderful this film director wes anderson creates his own universe full colourful characters old world charm witty one liners nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect every shot every little detail every set is flawless lead character gustave h s purple jacket title newspaper announcing war trans alpine yodel anderson has given thought attention everything story is not very important because it is merely vehicle stunning visuals dark humour rapid fire dialogue its all about hotel concierge gustave h who is being chased by various villains stealing painting all this is set against backdrop nazis invading central europe although andersons fantasy world they are not called nazis course some scenes are very funny but there is always darker tone because looming war anderson doesnt shy away extreme violence but he shows it offbeat almost comical manner my favourite scene which it all comes together shows concierges hotels all over europe calling each other help gustave h each them is shown his hotel with wonderful fantasy name course busy doing some important job like tasting soup or giving first aid unconscious hotel guest when he is being called away telephone each hands job over his assistant answers phone this fast succession little scenes is done so perfectly its great joy watch ralph fiennes steals show as sophisticated gustave h who never despairs even most unfavourable circumstances he is supported by large number star actors who are sometimes almost unrecognizable because amount support actors some them are bit underused tilda swinton gets rather little screen time as does harvey keitel film moves forward at breakneck speed you have be very alert order not miss something plot is not always very easy follow dialogue is fast there are great camera angles wonderful detailed sets pay attention i think by seeing film second time you can discover lots things you didnt notice first time,0.7068059916274203,0.2405286826268969,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,Keep your hands off my lobby boy!,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a zany, colorful and fascinating journey through old postcard Europe, such as only Hollywood can think of. With his old, almost square picture format Wes Anderson pays tribute to recent days, but with the whole movie. In addition to his brilliant humor and endearing characters, this film captures gems with seemingly small details and meticulous compositions. For me, now one of the funniest and most original movies of 2014.The style is unique. You will either like it or you won't.

8.0,A brilliantly entertaining fantasy outing by Wes Anderson,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the latest from Wes Anderson, and what great fun it is. My review of Monuments Men pointed out that putting the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray and Hugh Bonneville in the same film was no guarantee of a good film. Following that logic, what should we make of the following turning up together: Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Owen Wilson and (a wonderfully made up) Tilda Swinton? The answer is a near masterpiece of cameos that add up to a highly entertaining and memorable film.In a complex serious of flashbacks, Tom Wilkinson plays an author remembering his younger self (Jude Law) being recounted, a number of years before, the life story of The Grand Budapest's mysterious elderly guest Zero Moustafa, played by Abraham. (Are you still with me?) Featuring strongly in this life story, Ralph Fiennes plays hotel concierge and lothario Gustave H., seducer of his elderly and wealthy guests. He is supported in this role – for everything outside the bedroom that is – by trainee Bellboy, and Gustave's protégé, Zero (in the younger form of Tony Revolori).Following the murder of one such guest (Tilda Swinton), Gustave is not surprised to feature strongly in her will, awarded a priceless Renaissance painting – Boy with Apple. This is much to the displeasure of her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and his evil henchman Jopling (Willem Defoe). What follows is a madcap pursuit across snowy landscapes, various grisly murders, a couple of civil wars, some disconnected fingers, a prison break and a downhill ski chase.All the cast seem to enjoy themselves immensely, but it is the production design and cinematography that really shines through: every single shot of the film is just a joy to look at, from the bright pastel colours of some scenes to the oak-panelled finery of the elderly lady's mansion. Beautifully crafted, beautifully lit,beautifully costumed, beautifully filmed. Bringing a film out so early in the new Oscar-year must be risky: but one can only hope that the voting members have a long enough memory to recognise this movie in these sorts of categories.There are some interesting crossovers to recent films: both 'The Book Thief' and 'The Monuments Men' were filmed – as this was – in Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam. No coincidence then that the steam train chugging through the East European countryside looked startlingly similar to that in the opening scenes of 'The Book Thief'; and if you have Bill Murray and Bob Balaban in town for Monuments Men, then why not stick them together for this film too? Simples! Alexandre Desplat turns up AGAIN with another quirky and fitting score.All in all, if you like the quirky style of films of the likes of Moulin Rouge then you'll love this.

,A Grand Adventure,"Wes Anderson is one of the most original film makers working today. None of his films can be categorized into any particular genre. His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author & F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson & countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience).",grand adventure,wes anderson is one most original film makers working today none his films can be categorized into any particular genre his latest grand budapest hotel which opened berlin film festival continues that trend it is tale within tale within another tale whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though work art hanging museum story wise anderson has let his imagination run wild though tale with tom wilkinson as author story tale within tale with jude law as young author f murray abraham as mysterious owner grand budapest hotel have straightforward narratives tale within tale within tale which comprises bulk film is set years preceding second world war is wild uproarious train ride story telling it also boasts cast life time ralph fiennes tilda swinton edward norton adrien brody willem dafoe harvey keitel jeff goldblum bill murray owen wilson countless cameos it will delight anderson fans but is more likely destined art house cinemas as it is too off center mainstream audiences production design music are outstanding even end credits are imaginatively done received another ovation audience,0.6316666666666666,0.29583333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"""There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity... He was one of them. ""","Wes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete control on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film he desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave's company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he's blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.I frankly don't understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren't familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities. You won't want to return to the real world when the credits start to roll.",there are still faint glimmers civilization left this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity he was one them,wes anderson is one last directors auteurs whos got complete control film set has power make whatever kind film he desires his distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut bottle rcoket but that was just start with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more more this marvelous attention detail way he composes his shots tracking shots symmetry characters running slow motion chase scenes love story nostalgia explanatory montages colourful set design prevalent theme every one his films family this all adds up reason why audience enjoys andersons film so much this all is brought perfection grandhotel budapest through complex narrative framework which itself is mockery all these films that are being narrated by someone is also being excuse not being too realistic we get story young lobby boy named zero moustafa gustave h ralph fiennes concierge grandhotel budapest many female guests hotel mainly come enjoy gustaves company when one these ladies passes away gustave grabs zero boards train her mansion soon hes blamed her murder hunted by police led by edward norton grim faced assassin played by willem dafoe there also is love story between two young teens zero agatha saoirse ronan who has birthmark shape mexico i frankly dont understand how can this film be successful usa this film is just so typically european that i guess some aspects film americans just arent familiar with some humor reminded old french italian czech comedies wes anderson remains be stand out filmmaker who never disappoints with any his creations is safe bet rely his qualities you wont want return real world when credits start roll,0.40454545454545454,0.1654040404040404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,A new high for Wes Anderson,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an old relic in the eastern European former republic of Zubrowka. In 1985, the author of the book Grand Budapest Hotel (Tom Wilkinson) recounts how in 1968 he (Jude Law) got the story from Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). He talks about his early life as Lobby Boy (Tony Revolori) with the original concierge M. Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932 who was willed a priceless painting by Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) setting off a battle with the woman's family led by her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and the violent Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Gustave is arrested for Madame D's murder. Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is the girl of purity who's in love with Zero. Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) is the executor of the will.This is a new high for Wes Anderson. He's filled this with his usual unique visual style and his quirky characters. In addition, he has used it in an exciting thriller with a bit of mystery. There are some really dangerous bad guys. There is real tension that isn't always there for a Wes Anderson film.

9.0,Wes Anderson's Best?,"I would consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, however in saying that, I have only seen a handful of his movies. I was very excited for The Grand Budapest Hotel, because of its excellent cast, the fact it's directed by Wes Anderson and just by how unique it looked. After watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I can confidently say that it's my new favourite Wes Anderson film, and probably his best.As I was hoping, the story to The Grand Budapest Hotel is very original and unique, some may even say strange. And as the movie goes on, the story only gets wilder and wilder. The film is often very hilarious, with some seriously funny dark humour thrown in there as well. Characters are extremely well written, with the bond between Gustave and Zero being the backbone of the whole movie as it's so well written. The Grand Budapest Hotel features an odd narrative structure that works very well for the film, again adding to the uniqueness and freshness of it. I wasn't exactly sure how the story would play out, as I purposely avoided all promotional materiel so I would know as little as possible before watching. This was a great benefit to my viewing experience as I loved everything I saw, and felt as though nothing was spoiled from watching too many trailers.I haven't been a huge fan of most of Ralph Fiennes' work since his phenomenal performance in 1993′s ""Schindler's List"", but this is easily his best performance since then. He proves he can do comedy just as well as he can do drama, providing a perfect balance of both. Newcomer Tony Revolori is excellent as well. I won't get into the whole supporting cast because there's so many who were all so great, but I was particularly impressed by Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan.The Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely a Wes Anderson film, down to its very core. If you know his style, then you known what to expect, as this movie is full of it. Thankfully though, it's not a case of style over substance, with a great story to accompany the gorgeous visuals. The colour palette is beautiful; it's nice to see lot's of bright colours when so many other films are so dark and dreary. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. The cinematography is phenomenal, and I really like how the film was presented in different aspect ratios.You really can't go wrong with this film. It's probably Wes Anderson's best film, it has gorgeous visuals, excellent acting and a wonderful story.

10.0,A perfect holiday without leaving home.,"My heart is still rolling from the escape to 30's Europe this afternoon, and without jet lag. This movie is an inspiration, a dream, a walk through a painting and a study of humanity. Ralph Fiennes﻿ is a phenomenon as M. Gustave. his interactions with every cast member and especially newcomer Tony Revolori are fantastic.

10.0,Simply wonderful,"An extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's greatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the Alpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay at the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable painting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames Fiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to free Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money, hopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken by fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a nice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure, it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it his most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos and little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill Murray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless heavy.",simply wonderful,extraordinary cinematic confection probably wes andersons greatest film ralph fiennes plays concierge at grand budapest hotel 1930s which exists fictional european country alpine range he has habit keeping some old women who stay at hotel company when one tilda swinton leaves him valuable painting boy with apple swintons evil son adrien brody frames fiennes murder fiennes closest companion hotel lobby boy zero tony revolori his girlfriend saorsie ronan conspire free fiennes prison sell painting loads money hopefully enabling them leave country which is being overtaken by fascists story isnt much more than fluff though there is nice tinge poignancy but its enormously amusing fluff highly amusing trailer did give away many films best gags but this is laugh minute movie visuals are absolutely delightful sure its all nothing you havent seen before anderson but i found it his most perfect accomplishment film is loaded with great cameos little roles woman behind me almost had orgasm when bill murray appeared but my favorite was willem dafoe as toothless heavy,0.6531746031746032,0.3480654761904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,"Entertaining, slightly farcical, tale of dark deeds and friendship","21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand Budapest Hotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene.

7.0,A funny thing happened to me on the way to the Grand Budapest Hotel,"After seeing the previews several times, I thought I would enjoy a delightful almost-fantasy-like film. But, at age 64, after going to the movies literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, I did something today that I've only ever done 3 times previously -- I walked out of a movie halfway through the picture. I didn't blame Wes Anderson, because clearly his films have a following...but I thought it must be an acquired taste...that I had not acquired. I admitted that it was a uniquely visually pleasing film, but I wondered why so many fine actors agreed to what were rather small parts. At the time I said that this film bored me even more than ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The the other night it was on cable. I thought I would give it another try, but I fully expected to turn it off at home, also. Perhaps it helped that rather than watch it all in one setting, I broke it into roughly 30 minute segments with breaks in between. Guess what. This time I liked it. I'm not saying I loved it. But I did like it. What did I see this time that I didn't see before. Well, perhaps the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the film. The chance to see Ralph Finnes be downright silly instead of his typical dramatic role. The wonderful photography and special effects. The skill of young actor Tony Revolori. The pleasure of seeing F. Murray Abraham again. And, this time enjoying the many ""cameo"" shots.I still think it dragged on a bit too long (at 100 minutes there are still a few small bits that could have been edited more tightly or even eliminated). And, I'm still not a raving fan of it. But, this time around I did ""like"" it. But it won't end up on my DVD shelf, and I doubt I'll watch it again.

9.0,"""He retained the illusion with remarkable grace.""","A former lobby boy, Zero Moustafaw tells a story to a writer, who tells this tale of a hotel, it's guests and the outstanding concierge Monsieur Gustav H to us. It's about (blind) loyalty, duty beyond the required, greed, stupidity, love for women in any age ... and the power of influence when treating persons with the grace of that person's beauty. It's (black) comedy at its best. The ridiculous becomes brilliant through cleverly constructed dialog, impeccable executed timing and timbre change. Many camera shots are little art pieces like in Moonrise Kingdom, beautifully constructed with cuts that ad to the timing, visually. The production design takes you from the shabby to over-the-top kitsch to breath taking wooden interiors and mountains. The CGI reminds me of Monty Python, deliberately unrealistic which is part of the humor yet makes it at the same time oddly believable.Never thought of Ralph Fiennes as a comedic actor. He convinced me here. Tony Revolori as young Zero Saoirse Ronan as Agatha are remarkable. And then there were: F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Léa Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, (I think I saw George Cloony for 2 sec)...

9.0,Best effort by Wes Anderson since The Royal Tennenbaums,"I avoided this movie when it came out, since the last two films I've seen of director Wes Anderson, The Light Aquatic and the Darjeeling Limited, were utterly terrible. Only with the recent multiple Oscar nominations of this movie, I decide to give this a chance. And guess what: it is a great movie, his best since the Royal Tennenbaums. Set mostly in the 1930s in a fictional Central European state (the film was mostly shot in Southern Germany) - though with a nifty introduction from the 1960s that frames the narrative with Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham - the Grand Hotel Budapest tells the story of the said hotel - one in the classical European style - that is run by the concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) helped by the bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori)Fiennes is great as Gustave, a cultured, suave womanizer specialized in wooing elderly ladies who sees himself as a beacon of civilization in an age of increasing barbarism. When one of his ""customers"" (Tilda Swinton) dies and decides to give part of her inheritance to Mustafa, her two psycho sons (Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe) will left no stone unturned in trying not to give others what they think is rightfully theirs.This movie has an impressive all star cast. Along with those already named, we also have Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan, Mathieu Amalric and (in smaller roles), Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzmann.

10.0,Keeping Things Classy,"Wes Anderson is pretty much the kind of director who never betrays his cinematic trademark no matter how small and unconventional it looks. Just like most of his films, the style and personality are written all over it, from aesthetics to pizazz, but compare this to the others, The Grand Budapest Hotel crafts something that is nearly otherworldly which (obviously) makes it very charming. It is a part thriller and part comedy film that is perfectly coated by its artistic panache, but looking deep within the structure, you may also find a bunch of witty humor and rich character development from the two leads which makes it a really special experience.The film is actually a set of layered events telling how many generations have reached the story of the past hotel owner, Gustave H. That strange piece of intro immediately presents the endless creativity of the picture. Some might think it's unnecessary, but it gives a lot of sense when the final title card appears, pretty much sums up the purpose of that period jump. But it doesn't stop there, of course. The whole film is an amusing multi-genre adventure that takes you to whimsically designed places. Even when it hits to the suspenseful moments, it still sticks to the lightheartedness until every color fades into black and white. It's a quite sophisticated direction, anything else is a pure delight.The aesthetics are an undeniable visual feast. You couldn't ask for anything more than that, the film adds plenty of quirky action within this fabulous looking world. The perfect blend of buddy comedy, mystery, and suspense is all what you need for this platform video game looking environment. But then, it's not complete without the joys of the characters. The real shining moments here is the relationship between Gustave H. and Zero. Ralph Fiennes is wondrous to the role. He made Gustave H. a very likable fellow in spite of his obvious insecurities and selfishness. But then it's an overall compelling performance. Tony Revolori also shines as his apprentice. The misfit pair sparks chemistry that adds more color to this already colorful world. The rest of the cast are just equally terrific at they are doing, whether it's to deliver great humor or give a lot of life in each scene.The Grand Budapest Hotel is often manic yet (obviously) often creative and witty. It's all classic stuff: it suddenly creates a captivating universe where its imaginations are free to express endlessly. I mean it even ends with an animated dance at the credits. Everything is not a surprise from the director, however it is still kind of a refreshing cinema. Because definitely it has larger than life painted exteriors, delightful characters, brilliant humor, and smart filmmaking that do not always exist in your everyday entertainment. It's just a fun caper that is easy to love, no matter if your interests to movies is mainstream or art-house.",keeping things classy,wes anderson is pretty much kind director who never betrays his cinematic trademark no matter how small unconventional it looks just like most his films style personality are written all over it aesthetics pizazz but compare this others grand budapest hotel crafts something that is nearly otherworldly which obviously makes it very charming it is part thriller part comedy film that is perfectly coated by its artistic panache but looking deep within structure you may also find bunch witty humor rich character development two leads which makes it really special experience film is actually set layered events telling how many generations have reached story past hotel owner gustave h that strange piece intro immediately presents endless creativity picture some might think its unnecessary but it gives lot sense when final title card appears pretty much sums up purpose that period jump but it doesnt stop there course whole film is amusing multi genre adventure that takes you whimsically designed places even when it hits suspenseful moments it still sticks lightheartedness until every color fades into black white its quite sophisticated direction anything else is pure delight aesthetics are undeniable visual feast you couldnt ask anything more than that film adds plenty quirky action within this fabulous looking world perfect blend buddy comedy mystery suspense is all what you need this platform video game looking environment but then its not complete without joys characters real shining moments here is relationship between gustave h zero ralph fiennes is wondrous role he made gustave h very likable fellow spite his obvious insecurities selfishness but then its overall compelling performance tony revolori also shines as his apprentice misfit pair sparks chemistry that adds more color this already colorful world rest cast are just equally terrific at they are doing whether its deliver great humor or give lot life each scene grand budapest hotel is often manic yet obviously often creative witty its all classic stuff it suddenly creates captivating universe where its imaginations are free express endlessly i mean it even ends with animated dance at credits everything is not surprise director however it is still kind refreshing cinema because definitely it has larger than life painted exteriors delightful characters brilliant humor smart filmmaking that do not always exist your everyday entertainment its just fun caper that is easy love no matter if your interests movies is mainstream or art house,0.6390731292517007,0.24356972789115652,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,"Delightfully whimsical comedy adventure, with great design and fun performances","I watch a lot of short films and you can tell that Wes Anderson has very much made an impact on up and coming filmmakers due to how often you see people trying to make what they call 'a Wes Anderson style film'. Watching these film is mostly interesting because of how often these efforts fall short. It is a reminder to me of how hard it actually is to do 'whimsy'. To make it work, you not only need to make it happen, but you also need to do it in a way that gets the audience into the space they need to be in so as to be able to enjoy it; without this it is often just annoying.I was thinking of this because GBH is a great example of this working. This is not to say it is brilliant cinema, because in the end it is a whimsical piece but it does do it really well. The structure itself tells you where you are, because this is a film that opens with a girl paying respects at the bust of a dead author, who we then jump to as he starts to tell the story that was told to him by another man – a story which is also that of a story being told – and it is this story which we see for the most part. It is a structure that allows for the exaggeration and elaboration of all told stories, and it allows us to go with the sheer silliness of the tale. I say silliness, but actually the film keeps a lot which actually engages in the adventure plot, but yet at the same time delivers enough decadence and invention to allow us to enjoy it as a piece of fun.The cast match this. In many films it would be a real distraction to have so many famous faces in one film, however here it works – again because the audience are mostly positioned just to go with whatever. Fiennes is the beating heart of the film, and if he does not make his character work then the whole thing would struggle; as it is, he makes it work really well, with such color and flourish. Revolori is equally good, and needs to be since the friendship and his link to the presence (or plural) is also critical to making it work. The rest of the cast contain so many famous names doing small but enjoyable turns that it is pointless to name them all – but they all add to the whimsy rather than overwhelm it. Technically the film is a beauty, with great shots, great design through, and a sense of second-hand wonder which fits the story-telling structure.All told, it is a quite wonderful piece of silly adventure. It works because it knows itself, and it delivers itself really well in a way that draws the viewer into the space we need to be in to really go with it. This is not easy to do, and Anderson does it really well here.",delightfully whimsical comedy adventure with great design fun performances,i watch lot short films you can tell that wes anderson has very much made impact up coming filmmakers due how often you see people trying make what they call wes anderson style film watching these film is mostly interesting because how often these efforts fall short it is reminder me how hard it actually is do whimsy make it work you not only need make it happen but you also need do it way that gets audience into space they need be so as be able enjoy it without this it is often just annoying i was thinking this because gbh is great example this working this is not say it is brilliant cinema because end it is whimsical piece but it does do it really well structure itself tells you where you are because this is film that opens with girl paying respects at bust dead author who we then jump as he starts tell story that was told him by another man story which is also that story being told it is this story which we see most part it is structure that allows exaggeration elaboration all told stories it allows us go with sheer silliness tale i say silliness but actually film keeps lot which actually engages adventure plot but yet at same time delivers enough decadence invention allow us enjoy it as piece fun cast match this many films it would be real distraction have so many famous faces one film however here it works again because audience are mostly positioned just go with whatever fiennes is beating heart film if he does not make his character work then whole thing would struggle as it is he makes it work really well with such color flourish revolori is equally good needs be since friendship his link presence or plural is also critical making it work rest cast contain so many famous names doing small but enjoyable turns that it is pointless name them all but they all add whimsy rather than overwhelm it technically film is beauty with great shots great design through sense second hand wonder which fits story telling structure all told it is quite wonderful piece silly adventure it works because it knows itself it delivers itself really well way that draws viewer into space we need be really go with it this is not easy do anderson does it really well here,0.4939423076923077,0.19666666666666663,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,BOY WITH APPLE,"Not since ""The Book Thief"" have I been so entertained by a movie that knows how to create art. Rather than mention the plot, I will say that the language flowed with grace and humor. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) our main character had the ability to be classy while being crude. The harpsichord soundtrack fit well into the production. One could see where classical action/comedy/romance films of the 50's and 60's have influenced the film until it spoofs them in a generic fashion. Even minor characters like Saoirse Ronan are carefully crafted with odd flaws, such as her facial birthmark shaped like Mexico.Gustave describes sex as ""eating steak."" His affairs with older women he claims, ""The cheaper cuts are more flavorful."" He is also a lover of poetry and writes poems and speaks poetically with a way that amuses the audience.While the film has a classic look and sound to it, the humor is suited for a younger audience.",boy with apple,not since book thief have i been so entertained by movie that knows how create art rather than mention plot i will say that language flowed with grace humor gustave ralph fiennes our main character had ability be classy while being crude harpsichord soundtrack fit well into production one could see where classical action comedy romance films 50s 60s have influenced film until it spoofs them generic fashion even minor characters like saoirse ronan are carefully crafted with odd flaws such as her facial birthmark shaped like mexico gustave describes sex as eating steak his affairs with older women he claims cheaper cuts are more flavorful he is also lover poetry writes poems speaks poetically with way that amuses audience while film has classic look sound it humor is suited younger audience,0.357843137254902,0.05784313725490196,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.57}"
