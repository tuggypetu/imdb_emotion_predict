,Read my comment.,"Shaquille O'Neal delivers an Oscar worthy performance in what might be the most powerful performance of the 90's. All around, it is brilliant. This is a gripping and amazing tale about a genie and his friendship with a lonely child. Acting is purely amazing and the story is beautifully played out like poetry in motion. Honestly, this film goes down as one of the all time greats. Top to bottom, this film is perfectly mastered. Every actor in this film comes through and nails the role perfectly. 11/10Now, imagine the exact opposite of that. Got it? Okay, the truth is...the movie isn't even *that* good.

10.0,This movie changed my life.,"This movie really helped me find myself. Before I saw this movie, I wandered this streets crying often knowing my life had no purpose. Until one faithful day, I found myself in Chuckey Cheese on my usual drinking binge. When to my surprise, the robotic Chucky Cheese and gang started singing ""Happy Birthday"" which sounds exactly like ""You're the Best"" (a song from Karate Kid) after an eleven day drink binge. I saw a bright light, which many witnesses argue was a fire cause from the bad wiring in the Chucky Cheese band, pointing at the prize shelf. I took the remaining money I found on a passed out man outside the Chucky Cheese and went to play the Wack-A-Mole game that changed my life. I furiously pounded the moles while I was in the middle of the Chucky Cheese. The children screamed and cried as I fulfilled my destiny; if I could see those children again, I would hug them, for I would not have been able to win those two magical tickets. I went over to thank Chucky which soon after I blacked out, passing out on stage I woke up a few days later in my one room apartment with the tape super-glued to my face. In my excitement I quickly tore it from my skin and shoved it into my VCR. The next hour and thirty-six minutes (I got the special edition) of my life would be the happiest any man could ask for. I was so blown away by the amazing special effects that I was overcame and called an ambulance to pick me up after the movie ended. Shaq play a stunning and realistic role as a rapping Genie. I often found myself dancing in room to his tunes while my neighbor was yelling hurtful words and threats through the wall. After awhile though, I passed out on my floor. Awaking from another blackout, I caught glimpses of Shaq giving candy to all the children. I laughed, I cried. Could this movie be as brilliant as I realized. The ambulance pulled up and I told the paramedics to grab my belly; I was immediately tared. After a few weeks in intensive care, I returned to my house how I left it. Kazaam has given me a new out look on life and hopefully it will help shape your views.",this movie changed my life,this movie really helped me find myself before i saw this movie i wandered this streets crying often knowing my life had no purpose until one faithful day i found myself chuckey cheese my usual drinking binge when my surprise robotic chucky cheese gang started singing happy birthday which sounds exactly like youre best song karate kid after eleven day drink binge i saw bright light which many witnesses argue was fire cause bad wiring chucky cheese band pointing at prize shelf i took remaining money i found passed out man outside chucky cheese went play wack mole game that changed my life i furiously pounded moles while i was middle chucky cheese children screamed cried as i fulfilled my destiny if i could see those children again i would hug them i would not have been able win those two magical tickets i went over thank chucky which soon after i blacked out passing out stage i woke up few days later my one room apartment with tape super glued my face my excitement i quickly tore it my skin shoved it into my vcr next hour thirty six minutes i got special edition my life would be happiest any man could ask i was so blown away by amazing special effects that i was overcame called ambulance pick me up after movie ended shaq play stunning realistic role as rapping genie i often found myself dancing room his tunes while my neighbor was yelling hurtful words threats through wall after awhile though i passed out my floor awaking another blackout i caught glimpses shaq giving candy all children i laughed i cried could this movie be as brilliant as i realized ambulance pulled up i told paramedics grab my belly i was immediately tared after few weeks intensive care i returned my house how i left it kazaam has given me new out look life hopefully it will help shape your views,0.4480959145021645,0.24949945887445887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,"I feel enlightened after watching this movie (in the good way, not the naked after a party way).","I remember watching this film as a semi-retarded adolescent and not enjoying it due to the vague underlying themes that flew over my head at such a young age. However, last week, passing this movie in the Blockbuster Mega-Discount bin, I decided to re-watch it and see if my opinion has changed.(I tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, without losing some of the movie's flair. I feel I have succeeded) I must say, spending that 2.50$ plus tax was the greatest decision of my pitiful and shameful life. In the 5 days I have had the VHS, I have watched this film at least 15 times, I unfortunately lost track after blacking out naked on my carpet on the 2nd day. This movie goes down in history as one of the 5 greatest drama sequels of all time, and If I had to put a rating on it's comedy factor, I would give it 4 thumbs way up. I found myself laughing throughout the entire film, calling my friends and family to repeat jokes I had heard. The casting in this film is absolutely excellent, with Shaq leading the performance like a Frenchman in a yogurt factory. The story revolves around a genie named Shaq, and a small Italian boy named Max. Upon finding a magic stereo player, Max discovers a small black genie living inside, and offers to give him a place to sleep and eat for a week. Ironically, this is where the theme of pedophilia comes into play, with multiple scenes of Max and Shaq showering together and close up shots of them smiling. I hate to repeat myself, but as a child, I understood nothing about this subject. However, as a fleshy man, I see it in a new and blinding light.There are several moments throughout the play where the development of the characters and storyline drag, but the rest of the film certainly make up for it. The end is griping, and keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it. At the same time, I cry when the credits roll and long to see Shaq's black face one more time (of course, I will rewind the movie at this point and watch it over again).On a final note, this movie is almost perfect in every aspect. This is the epitome of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. The casting is amazing, the special effects are mind-blowingly realistic and stunning, the fully orchestrated soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and amplifies the experience. If I were to put a grade on this, I would have to give it a 9/10, losing a point because of the slight nudity (i'm not the biggest fan, but I won't say no!). But, this is not a movie to be rated, it is a movie to be bought, watched, and enjoyed.

2.0,"A perfect example of a movie that I loved as a child, hate as an adult...","Well, adolescent really(19). Like Howard the Duck, Kazaam was a movie I loved as a child but looking back on it I was shocked at how low my taste buds were as a kid. Granted, there are some funny moments specifically the ones with the flying toasts and the bicycle race. And it is not the worst movie of 1996, Ed and especially Bio Dome are worse. However, the special effects are really quite substandard, and the rest of the production values are of direct to video quality and shoddy ones at that. The story is predictable with only a few worthwhile scenes to favour, the sight gags suffer from poor comic timing and the script is childish and simplistic. The characters I really dislike here, the kid is annoying, the villain is one of the lamest I have seen in a long time while Shaquille O'Neal's Genie with his awful rapping(then again I dislike rap intensely, and that is the least problematic of his performance) grated on me fast. The acting doesn't fare much better either, while the direction is literally non-existent and the soundtrack is only tolerable if on mute.

,Shaq stars as a rapping genie.,"This is, by far, without a doubt, the best movie that has ever been produced on film.

So the fact that I say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise. It's like someone talking about WWII--practically no one says that was a GOOD thing, right?! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is ""why did they make this in the first place?!"". After all, it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. But, movies like ED (a baseball playing chimp), COOL AS ICE (starring the ever-popular Vanilla Ice), TROLL 2 (which doesn't even have any trolls in it), BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE (huh!?!) prove that any idea, no matter how dumb, can make it to the big screen! So, the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal'! The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. Like the punk from FREE WILLY, this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words, a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is, by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown. Just once, I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! Eventually, while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him, the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. But, the kid doesn't believe him AND the genie's magic seems a tad rusty.Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However, unlike most kids, he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime, Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And, according to the cliché, you know that by the end of the film, Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh, and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé (I'm gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.As for Kazaam, Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! He's an amazing basketball player and I've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes, he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie, I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However, later in the film, the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. And, out of nowhere, the plot gets really, really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And, oddly, this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! In addition, the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying, but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! What part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? Then, in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history, Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy, did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!Overall, it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. Yes, folks, with a messed up message, bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters, this is one wretched film. Sadly, given the idea and actors, it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!By the way, if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD, try the British made for TV film ""Bernard and the Genie""--a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish.",well at least its not as bad as contracting ebola,reviewing kazaam saying its bad movie isnt hard at all after all critics at time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film saying it was among worst films decade so fact that i say its bad or anyone else says its bad is certainly no surprise its like someone talking about wwii practically no one says that was good thing right question i have no place imdb can answer it is why did they make this first place after all its obvious anyone who isnt severely brain injured that film would be horrible but movies like ed baseball playing chimp cool as ice starring ever popular vanilla ice troll 2 which doesnt even have any trolls it baby geniuses einstain like superhero babies pinocchio outer space huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it big screen so idea best basketball player time starring as genie obnoxious little brat seems downright normal film starts with kid who is pretty jerky keying lockers hallway school like punk free willy this kid is somehow misunderstood other words total brat you know that no matter how selfish horrible he is by end film hell have learned something grown just once i want see punk kid like this end up prison or or dead by end film eventually while neighborhood bullies are middle pummeling him genie kazaam shaquille oneal is accidentally released insists giving brat three wishes but kid doesnt believe him genies magic seems tad rusty eventually brat does realize that kazaam is real however unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so meantime kazaam is forced follow him around everywhere like his own personal servant according clich you know that by end film max kazaam will have become lifelong buddies bunch tears will be shed oh max will have come terms with his absent father moms fianc im gonna gag apparently this genie is bit social worker addition being granter wishes as kazaam shaquille speaks rhyme through much movie even takes break rap very poorly im middle aged white guy i think i could probably rap at least as well hes amazing basketball player ive heard hes nice guy but rapper no way as far as his acting goes he wasnt great but had such nice personality film that its hard hate him even if they made him do lot very stupid things so is movie as excruciatingly awful as youve probably heard through first two thirds movie i would have said no shaquille seemed try his best with unlikable kid bad script however later film bad becomes horrid as kazaam seems too concerned with himself help kid when hes really needed out nowhere plot gets really really weird as guy who wants make kazaam rap star turns out be evil mobster oddly this guy seems accept that kazaam is genie with no hesitation addition last portion film consists people trying kill max his dad i know that kid was annoying but this is supposed be kids film what part trying kill kid didnt writers not understand then ending that makes this perhaps worst kids film ending history kazaam becomes god or something it all was like drug induced hallucination this ending was even dumber weirder than one black hole boy did it make my brain hurt uggghh horrible dialog was just too much bear overall its terrible film that is due mostly writers who were certifiably insane yes folks with messed up message bizarre non kid friendly material horrible characters this is one wretched film sadly given idea actors its hard imagine final product turning out much worse by way if you want see genie modern world film that is good try british made tv film bernard genie charming exceptionally well written film start finish,0.5827380952380952,-0.09264258028792911,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
1.0,At least Shaq has rapping to fall back on...,"i was given the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday, and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's over soon.The acting in this is terrible, which i expected from a film with Shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster (which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there). The kid in the film that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor. He's bullied by neighborhood kids, which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag.The story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché. About a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father.Even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea. It's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made. i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know just by reading the plot.",at least shaq has rapping fall back,i was given book version kazaam my 8th birthday people always say book versions are always better than movie but this time they were wrong at least with movie its over soon acting this is terrible which i expected film with shaq who plays magical rapping genie that comes out old ghetto blaster which there was probably good reason he was trapped there kid film that plays max is whiny terrible actor hes bullied by neighborhood kids which i dont blame them because hes little douche bag story is just plain stupid extremely clich about boy whos father is always working never around who finds new friend who makes his life better eventually helps him reconnect with his father even at 8 years old i thought this was stupid idea its surprise any people whom worked this film had careers after wards because its embarrassment should have never been made i could ramble even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading plot,0.5309429700734049,-0.12132269904009033,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.3}"

1.0,A 7 foot tall man is following a kid around the city offering him treats and wishes... see? We're already at problem #1 with this movie,"The other day my girlfriends and I were having our pizza night and looking for movies to watch. Kazaam was on demand and I asked if any the girls had seen it, only one of my friends did and I asked if it really was as bad as everyone says it is. She said she didn't remember since she saw it as a kid so we all decided to go for the bait and see if Kazaam really does deserve one of the worst movies in cinema titles. Oh, yeah, it really does. I could not believe how bad this movie was. Shaq has the acting quality of a wooden shelf, the kid who is supposed to be a hero is actually a brat, the villain of the story looks like a chewed up version of Mario from Super Mario Brothers and the story does not make sense for the child audience it was aimed for. How in the heck is a child supposed to relate to this story of trying to get his pirate music stealing father back with his mother while being stalked by a 7 foot tall grown man offering him free treats and all the presents in the world and OH MY GOD does that not sound so bad?! There are so many things wrong with this movie it drives me insane.A schoolboy named Max is confronted and chased down by a group of bullies through the city of New Bronslin. Max is chased into the abandoned building, where he discovers a magical boom-box and accidentally unleashes the genie inside. The genie, who introduces himself as Kazaam, tells Max that he is now Max's genie. Max returns home to find that his mother is marrying a fireman. It is revealed that his mother lied to him about his real father's whereabouts, and that he is actually located in the city. Max set out to search for his father in the hopes of rekindling some sort of bond between them. He suddenly encounters Kazaam during his travels, who pesters Max into making a wish. Max eventually finds his father, only to learn that he is a musical talent agent who specializes in pirated music. A employee of the nightclub shows interest in Kazaam upon the realization that he is a genie, and hopes to control Kazaam through Max's father.Between the awful acting, the terrible script and the lousy effects, this movie is just plain bad. This is how bad this is, Shaq literally slam dunks the villain to defeat him! If that's not a plug in for his career, I don't know what is. The kid Max has no likable qualities, he has a very loving mother and a possible step father who cares for him, yet he acts like a total jerk because he's not getting his way with not having his dad around who is a criminal no less! Even when his criminal father kicks him out of his life, Max still does everything to save him, sick isn't it? Shaq, I don't know the writers were thinking. Maybe that it's so funny that a giant basketball super star should be a genie and it's a great way to make a quick buck for those sucker parents who's kids are begging to see the film. I don't know how to say this other than just say it, it really is as bad as everyone says it is if not worse. Trust me, don't waste your sanity on this horrible movie, Shaq's acting is enough to make you wish this movie never existed in the first place.1/10",7 foot tall man is following kid around city offering him treats wishes see were already at problem with this movie,other day my girlfriends i were having our pizza night looking movies watch kazaam was demand i asked if any girls had seen it only one my friends did i asked if it really was as bad as everyone says it is she said she didnt remember since she saw it as kid so we all decided go bait see if kazaam really does deserve one worst movies cinema titles oh yeah it really does i could not believe how bad this movie was shaq has acting quality wooden shelf kid who is supposed be hero is actually brat villain story looks like chewed up version mario super mario brothers story does not make sense child audience it was aimed how heck is child supposed relate this story trying get his pirate music stealing father back with his mother while being stalked by 7 foot tall grown man offering him free treats all presents world oh my god does that not sound so bad there are so many things wrong with this movie it drives me insane schoolboy named max is confronted chased down by group bullies through city new bronslin max is chased into abandoned building where he discovers magical boom box accidentally unleashes genie inside genie who introduces himself as kazaam tells max that he is now maxs genie max returns home find that his mother is marrying fireman it is revealed that his mother lied him about his real fathers whereabouts that he is actually located city max set out search his father hopes rekindling some sort bond between them he suddenly encounters kazaam during his travels who pesters max into making wish max eventually finds his father only learn that he is musical talent agent who specializes pirated music employee nightclub shows interest kazaam upon realization that he is genie hopes control kazaam through maxs father between awful acting terrible script lousy effects this movie is just plain bad this is how bad this is shaq literally slam dunks villain defeat him if thats not plug his career i dont know what is kid max has no likable qualities he has very loving mother possible step father who cares him yet he acts like total jerk because hes not getting his way with not having his dad around who is criminal no less even when his criminal father kicks him out his life max still does everything save him sick isnt it shaq i dont know writers were thinking maybe that its so funny that giant basketball super star should be genie its great way make quick buck those sucker parents whos kids are begging see film i dont know how say this other than just say it it really is as bad as everyone says it is if not worse trust me dont waste your sanity this horrible movie shaqs acting is enough make you wish this movie never existed first place 1 10,0.5393167261588316,-0.13306017569175468,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.24}"
