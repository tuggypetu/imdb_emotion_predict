10.0,Fantastic...but possibly overwhelming.,"""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!The story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers, this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.Overall, amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly, however, the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen.",fantastic but possibly overwhelming,spider man into spider verse is fantastic film but might be bit overwhelming some viewers its filled with blaring hip hop music animation is beyond splashy its competely intense now these are not criticisms more warning if you hate these sorts things or if you or someone you loves has challenges such as autism as film might really be overwhelming still im nearly 55 loved picture i think most will if they have open mind want something different that does strongly apply me as ive gotten sick superhero movies because there have been so many recently theres certain sameness about them but not this spider man film story is told with breathtaking cgi with look that is nothing like any other film ive ever seen this world is young man who sees spider man killed is also bitten by spider becomes next incarnation spider man but instead taking time enjoy learn about his new powers this young man finds himself middle weird apocalyptic occurance all various incarnations various universes come together save day overall amazingly creative theres nothing else like it this is more than reason enough see it sadly however film loses bit home tvs even big ones as scale size film needs big screen,0.5728576978576979,0.13704351204351206,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,How on God's green Earth did this work so well???,"The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes. Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have? Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.",how gods green earth did this work so well,worlds superhero movies superhero comics are not as similar as they seem surface currently film studios are all about extended universe seeing how many different titles characters they can shove into one franchise avengers x men justice league making easy way squeeze few extra bucks out their lesser known properties comics have this as well course however they also have something modern movies havent really tapped into yet story one offs chance storyteller create unique tale not be constrained by implications or larger universe spider verse gets do just that while playfully taking fun if convoluted absurdity extended superhero universes listen i hear you how could we possibly need another spider man movie spider verse understands that question has take it yes peter parker is here fact there are two peter parkers theres also spider woman noir spider man anime spider girl robot spider pig at center though is miles morales afro hispanic brooklyn teen who must help these other spider people get back their own planes existence he fights with his cop dad he adores his shady uncle hates being simply smartest kid room just wants do something that matters being spider man wasnt his idea but hey when radioactive spider gives you powers what choice do you have look i dont have any sort hot take this movie it looks great humor pops with surprises voice casting is beyond perfect its simply stylishly exciting refreshingly unique take superhero genre sometimes thats more than enough,0.49634920634920643,0.17194444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Stan Lee Is Smiling Right Now,"A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations.

10.0,Game Changer,"Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.",game changer,have you ever sat through film you knew that films would never be same going forward example terminator 2 star wars first toy story iron manwell this is one those this is almost rather perfect film let me just say stylished animation is just top notch it as if comic book leaped off pages ive seen practically all super hero films include dc animated ones this feels as if they took comic books playstation animation just came up with this perfect look story is great pacing is so wonderful it is able tell story origin without boring us tears like zack snyder has done dc universe story is quiet touching it allows us have pretty interesting spider man miles without thrashing or having peter parker like experience plus our villains are so well done but i think we will see lot more this type animation future sony i think they announced their presence with authority like how dreamworks did with shrek how pixar did its been awhile i seen something so unexpected so cool,0.6194444444444445,0.31825396825396823,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,So Much More Than I Expected!,"So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage.

10.0,the most visually stunning film I've ever seen,"There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.",most visually stunning film ive ever seen,theres hardly anything i would improve about this film visuals concepts soundtrack characters pace humor animation are all some best ive ever seen any film i was worried hype would ruin it me as it always does but not even group kids theater who wouldnt stop loudly talking could ruin it me it is visually engaging beautiful every scene not mention with incredibly unique art style is honestly something other animated movies should have look up long time only real issue i can think is flashing lights which really alienates any epileptic audience but even then its done so beautiful artful way,0.6677777777777778,0.34055555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10.0,The best comic book movie I've ever seen,"The thing I hate about superhero movies is the origin story. After a multitude of Spider-Man stories, do we really need another retelling of his origin? That's the first - of many - things that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does right. Much like how Grant Morrison retold Superman's beginnings in one page in All-Star Superman, this movie tells you everything you need to know within one minute and goes right into the action. It expects you to know the expected, but then once it makes you feel comfortable, it tears the rug out from under you.Here's the low down for those of you that don't read comics: there's more than one reality and more than one version of Spider-Man, who may not always be a man. Written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who left Solo due to creative differences, this movie is pure joy from start to finish. If you know and love the characters, it's so amazing to see them treated properly on the big screen. And if you don't, it's so much fun to meet all new versions of a character you already love.Beyond the Spidey you know and love, there's Miles Morales, a gifted teen who struggles to fit into a new school. He loves Spider-Man, is often at odds with his parents and looks up to his uncle Aaron. While working on graffiti, he's bit by a radioactive spider and suddenly has the same abilities as his hero.After a tragic incident when the real Spidey battles the Kingpin as that baddy tries to uses a particle accelerator to bring back his lost wife and son, Miles must take on the mantle of a hero while working alongside the Spiders of other dimensions: Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker and SP//dr.The voice talent in this movie is absolutely amazing: Lily Tomlin is the best Aunt May ever, Nicholas Cage steals the show as Spider-Man Noir, who is from a world where it's always black and white and smells like rain and it was great to hear comedian John Mulaney as Spider-Ham.There's so much of this movie that perfectly translates the language of comics in a way that few films have succeeded in accomplishing. Ang Lee's The Hulk came close, but the animated styles of this film are constantly moving and even more alive than real action.It's also the first time I've seen a teenage world in a superhero movie that feels vibrant and now. Nothing feels fake, phony or forced about the school scenes. And the music is just as powerful as the film.Of all the Stan Lee cameos in the Marvel films, the one here feels the most organic and perfect. It brought a tear to my eye when he sold Miles the costume and told him that all the costumes eventually fit. Kudos to the producers for remembering both Lee and Steve Ditko at the film's end.In case you didn't pick it up, I give this movie my highest recommendation. While Infinity War may be the best Marvel movie ever, you need to have seen every single Marvel movie ever to get that. This is the kind of film that Becca could watch and enjoy without needing to open a single comic, which is just how she likes it. It's not only the best animated movie I've seen this year, it may be the best movie overall.",best comic book movie ive ever seen,thing i hate about superhero movies is origin story after multitude spider man stories do we really need another retelling his origin thats first many things that spider man into spider verse does right much like how grant morrison retold supermans beginnings one page all star superman this movie tells you everything you need know within one minute goes right into action it expects you know expected but then once it makes you feel comfortable it tears rug out under you heres low down those you that dont read comics theres more than one reality more than one version spider man who may not always be man written by phil lord christopher miller who left solo due creative differences this movie is pure joy start finish if you know love characters its so amazing see them treated properly big screen if you dont its so much fun meet all new versions character you already love beyond spidey you know love theres miles morales gifted teen who struggles fit into new school he loves spider man is often at odds with his parents looks up his uncle aaron while working graffiti hes bit by radioactive spider suddenly has same abilities as his hero after tragic incident when real spidey battles kingpin as that baddy tries uses particle accelerator bring back his lost wife son miles must take mantle hero while working alongside spiders other dimensions spider gwen spider man noir peter porker spectacular spider ham peni parker sp dr voice talent this movie is absolutely amazing lily tomlin is best aunt may ever nicholas cage steals show as spider man noir who is world where its always black white smells like rain it was great hear comedian john mulaney as spider ham theres so much this movie that perfectly translates language comics way that few films have succeeded accomplishing ang lees hulk came close but animated styles this film are constantly moving even more alive than real action its also first time ive seen teenage world superhero movie that feels vibrant now nothing feels fake phony or forced about school scenes music is just as powerful as film all stan lee cameos marvel films one here feels most organic perfect it brought tear my eye when he sold miles costume told him that all costumes eventually fit kudos producers remembering both lee steve ditko at films end case you didnt pick it up i give this movie my highest recommendation while infinity war may be best marvel movie ever you need have seen every single marvel movie ever get that this is kind film that becca could watch enjoy without needing open single comic which is just how she likes it its not only best animated movie ive seen this year it may be best movie overall,0.4470784231200896,0.251528178611512,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,"The better the art, the harder it is to find the right words to describe it.","Updated review 4-9-19I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.",better art harder it is find right words describe it,updated review 4 9 19ive now watched this movie 10 times since getting it digital then blu ray can safely say this is rare near

7.0,"Visually innovative, but has a lack of focus and is overstuffed.","As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...However, I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie, but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the ""Kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues, Peter B Parker was funny, tragic and fleshed out, and Gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.Then, a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went, ""Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.I'll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film, the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow, but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys, and there is no better example of this than...Gwen Stacey.Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker's/Miles Morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead, the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.To make matters worse, Gwen doesn't even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters, but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about ""Mary Sues"" in film but don't complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene), or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene, some loose character threads such as Miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it, and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.But, I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn't your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest, strong, but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out, but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation, but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually).",visually innovative but has lack focus is overstuffed,as much as i enjoy this movie as animator storyartist i love visuals i have honest say it is bit unfocused mess reason why you should see this movie is because it is first what will hopefully be trend innovative creative animated movies that arent just looking over shoulders what disney pixar are doing this movie is its own creature i think it deserves be seen just visuals opportunity hopefully support this trend however i would only say that if movie has some substance it which it does i recommend people see this movie but it should be noted that i think this movie may be getting kubo treatment where animated film is visually impressive such degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool first half this movie is brilliant i think just about everything first half works really well is super effective miles morales felt like real kid with some real kid issues peter b parker was funny tragic fleshed out gwen existed well get her later my eyes were glued screen i was excited where story would go as i was genuinely surprised at couple twists turns story then certain moment happened movie where i was taken out film went wait oh shoot this is going downhill real fast it was introduction all other spider verse characters at that moment film shifted gears into entirely different film first half does miles morales fit with professionals can miles morales impress them everyone seems hate him due his lack experience can miles morales take leap faith which he already did beginning movie is miles morales even relevant story all these sudden new themes plot developments completely derail what first half film was setting up such degree that it felt like giant schism cut through film second half film was waving goodbye first half ill be clear that i have no issue with other spider verse characters sharing screen time film issue is that they dont add much terms character development or interaction with miles characters should serve help miles grow but this movie they just seem like another pair fists punch bad guys there is no better example this than gwen stacey gwen stacey has unfortunate issue being completely irrelevant story when she should be important vital character peter b parkers miles morales character growth should have arc her own this is character who witnessed peter parker her best friend die peter b parker is someone who witnessed gwen stacey die her universe why dont they discuss this peter b parker should be surprised excited see someone he knew as dead alive again she should be happy see her best friend once more instead two characters just punch bad guys like everyone else no growth or development between two make matters worse gwen doesnt even really work help miles morales develop as character beginning film she is built up be one main characters but second half she doesnt develop any further than she did beginning she experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters she just exists film i could go while about all different weird pacing issues second half film such as miles morales suddenly getting super powerful skilled out nowhere its odd that people complain about mary sues film but dont complain about miles morales going zero hero one scene or single cut comedy scene tragic friends splitting up scene some loose character threads such as miles dad telling cops chase spider man but we never see them do it many other instances odd pacing choices poor juxtapositions emotional story beats but i will end this positive note all characters are enjoyable when they get their moment i think writing father was really good he wasnt your typical larger than life father but very honest strong but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable reasonable i wish him uncle aaron had some scenes together their dynamic was bit more fleshed out but as is i still like them regardless additional scenes they deserved go see it if you want support innovative risky animation but be warned that it is not perfect film other than visually,0.5474399856096283,0.1023919978830693,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Captures Your Attention From The Get Go!,"What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

,"Creative, funny, engaging, and exciting","There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.Overall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.",creative funny engaging exciting,there was lot hype about this film which surprised me because when i first glanced at trailer i just dismissed what i saw as direct tv film hype gave me pause but at same time made me wait so that it had time settle into reality coming it outside hype awards i was open what expect was pleasantly surprised what pleased me was how creative it was several areas production terms narrative it took risk be silly with its alternative spider men but was able balance that with engaging reasonably serious core narrative it managed be funny fun engaging enjoyable all way through animation wise it mixed many styles approaches very well even when it felt ott with visuals it still somehow worked i didnt feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload overall design film added this with good use music shot framing animation make it feel very cool fluid throughout production wise it felt like it got sense humour script made that work more than it otherwise would have done voice performances also seem get this everyone plays their characters well overall it is creative funny engaging exciting those that get into it accept it its own terms,0.5965582655826558,0.2381978319783198,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6.0,Visually Beautiful but the Good Part of the Story is in Another Dimension,"It started of well and I knew by the trailer what I was going to expect. I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash, this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues, it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills, voila!, he knows it all, like the back of his hand.People who say this is the most visually stunning film they have ever seen are those who haven't seen films. All those who have given this a rating standing at 8 point something have been blown over the visuals of this film which is great but every film's basic foot lies in it's screenplay. This is sloppy writing. Aunt May being kind of Iron Man and all. There is a moment in every new super hero film where the hero falls short of confidence and then a few scenes or a lot of scenes later the confidence is regained. Here it happens in the very next scene. What a load of BS. Spider-man sticky web sticks to his hand easily and is a disturbance for him but it is conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky webAnd Nicoles Cage..Are you kidding me...His way of talking makes it irritatingly meme funny. Depressing. His character was a complete waste.But definitely much better than Captain Marvel. This film is visually stunning and the animation is excellent. Kudos to the animation artists.

6.0,"For such an inventive premise and excellent animation, questionable plot choices are made and the themes and arc are surprisingly formulaic","I think this one is mostly ""on me"", as someone who never read comic books growing up and enjoys the ideas that movies leave me with, not the visual experience as much. Spider-Verse is undeniably creative and unique, particularly in its animation, which I think is the best I've ever seen, and the premise is a self-aware and original breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The voice acting is good, and the comedy is pretty good (though I found the jokes revolving around Miles being young and being goofy in learning his powers to be trite and overplayed). While I was ready to love it, many plot points left me scratching my head and there was no sense of any real stakes. Among the frustrating plot points to me were the absurdity of the 3 new spider people, especially Porky (why? How does that make any sense?); the uncle coincidentally being the person working for Kingpin and tasked with chasing down Spider-Man; Kingpin's backstory scene, where we are following Miles escaping and out of nowhere cut to a memory of Kingpin's family dying after having no background on him at all, just felt very out of place and poorly edited; and other minor points. The story was quite predictable and followed a rote story arc, which contributed significantly to the sense that the outcome was never in doubt, keeping my emotional investment and engagement low throughout. In classic deus ex machina form, Miles struggled and gradually is improving in using his powers, and then right after his dad talks to him he magically has complete control and can win all the fights, is a beast out of nowhere? It had done such a good job of showing his struggles in being valued and succeeding in his tasks, so the flipped switch of him effortlessly and suddenly being powerful was a disservice to the rest of the movie. Thematically, it didn't feel like anything unique, as a standard coming of age story and with a message that anyone can be a superhero. It pays obvious and honest homage to the comic book form, more genuinely adapting the style than any movie I've seen before. It did many things really well, but the various plot point frustrations and the lack of emotional investment due to the lack of stakes made it a forgettable, if pleasant, movie experience for me. I certainly recommend it to others, as at minimum you'll get a fun, amusing and visually gorgeous movie and if you like the comic book style, it could be an all time great.",such inventive premise excellent animation questionable plot choices are made themes arc are surprisingly formulaic,i think this one is mostly me as someone who never read comic books growing up enjoys ideas that movies leave me with not visual experience as much spider verse is undeniably creative unique particularly its animation which i think is best ive ever seen premise is self aware original breath fresh air superhero genre voice acting is good comedy is pretty good though i found jokes revolving around miles being young being goofy learning his powers be trite overplayed while i was ready love it many plot points left me scratching my head there was no sense any real stakes among frustrating plot points me were absurdity 3 new spider people especially porky why how does that make any sense uncle coincidentally being person working kingpin tasked with chasing down spider man kingpins backstory scene where we are following miles escaping out nowhere cut memory kingpins family dying after having no background him at all just felt very out place poorly edited other minor points story was quite predictable followed rote story arc which contributed significantly sense that outcome was never doubt keeping my emotional investment engagement low throughout classic deus ex machina form miles struggled gradually is improving using his powers then right after his dad talks him he magically has complete control can win all fights is beast out nowhere it had done such good job showing his struggles being valued succeeding his tasks so flipped switch him effortlessly suddenly being powerful was disservice rest movie thematically it didnt feel like anything unique as standard coming age story with message that anyone can be superhero it pays obvious honest homage comic book form more genuinely adapting style than any movie ive seen before it did many things really well but various plot point frustrations lack emotional investment due lack stakes made it forgettable if pleasant movie experience me i certainly recommend it others as at minimum youll get fun amusing visually gorgeous movie if you like comic book style it could be all time great,0.5433658531484618,0.24054311228224268,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"

He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.Had some potential, initially, to be an original take on Spider-Man and comic book movies in general.

Now, all the Spideys must team up to put an end to a danger, that could alter reality in terrible ways.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord, have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively.

7.0,"Too kid friendly, but good!","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done. For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans. A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem.

5.0,It's just okay.,"The visuals, while extremely ADHD are beautiful and help mask the usual uncanny valley physics that plague CGI heavy movies. That said, what is actually happening in some scenes is pretty vague, generally it's too busy.The story telling is competent, when the writing isn't tripping over itself with overly concious lines, or progressive character tropes. At least unlike most such movies, the messaging doesn't entirely overtake the plot, and there is actual character development.And even with those progressive tropes, there is some messaging around courage, and tenacity, typical of heroic movies that are often absent in the more wish forfillment progressive typical story telling.Although for a hero origin movie, there is very little trace of self sacrifice, which is it's essential nature. Still, whilst it is somewhat hamfisted message fiction, they manage to wrap it into a plot that makes the film servicable and tucks the messaging into places where a less observant eye might miss it.In general, it's safe to say this is pitched at kids.

7.0,"""What would I do if I were me?""","Uh-oh, I feel a 'here I go again' coming. As I write this, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 movies of all time, right there in between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Léon: The Professional"". Among the eighty plus comic-book based super-hero movies I've seen and reviewed, it comes in at #2, right behind ""The Dark Knight"", which means viewers give it a higher rating than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", if any of you Marvel fans care about that. I don't know, I just think there's just something askew about that, instinctively telling me that in this case, it's not the quality of the movie that places it so high in the rankings, but the overall popularity and buzz that attaches itself to the film. But enough of that.I actually thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters, some of whom I was familiar with and others not. I actually do remember Spider-Ham from the dark recesses of my memory long ago. As far as the story line goes, it wasn't particularly new or innovative, how many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? If it sounds like I'm trashing the flick, I'm not really, I think it's great for kids and fans of animated movies. Speaking of which, and relative to my argument above, the picture is outranked by the Japanese anime ""Spirited Away"" on the current Top 250 at Number #27, so I'm not bashing the picture for not being live action.My biggest kick out of watching the movie, and I make this statement a lot about Marvel based comic book movies, was seeing writer and artist Stan Lee drawn into the film as a store clerk named appropriately enough, 'Stan'. With his recent passing at the age of ninety five, it saddens me to know that I won't be seeing him in those ubiquitous cameo spots that I always look for in a Marvel super-hero film. As one of the original creators of Spider-Man along with Steve Ditko (who also passed away in 2018), I'd like to think that Stan Lee got his own special preview showing of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" before he entered Valhalla. He is one that will be missed.",what would i do if i were me,uh oh i feel here i go again coming as i write this spider man into spider verse is ranked imdbs list top 250 movies all time right there between saving private ryan l professional among eighty plus comic book based super hero movies ive seen reviewed it comes at right behind dark knight which means viewers give it higher rating than avengers infinity war guardians galaxy if any you marvel fans care about that i dont know i just think theres just something askew about that instinctively telling me that this case its not quality movie that places it so high rankings but overall popularity buzz that attaches itself film but enough that i actually thought film was ok not great but ok as far as animated movies go i thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright vivid colors interesting cast characters some whom i was familiar with others not i actually do remember spider ham dark recesses my memory long ago as far as story line goes it wasnt particularly new or innovative how many threats reality have you encountered over course your movie viewing lives if it sounds like im trashing flick im not really i think its great kids fans animated movies speaking which relative my argument above picture is outranked by japanese anime spirited away current top 250 at number so im not bashing picture not being live action my biggest kick out watching movie i make this statement lot about marvel based comic book movies was seeing writer artist stan lee drawn into film as store clerk named appropriately enough stan with his recent passing at age ninety five it saddens me know that i wont be seeing him those ubiquitous cameo spots that i always look marvel super hero film as one original creators spider man along with steve ditko who also passed away 2018 id like think that stan lee got his own special preview showing into spider verse before he entered valhalla he is one that will be missed,0.5061611652236654,0.19728400072150074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.3}"
