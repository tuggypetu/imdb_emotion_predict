9.0,Took nearly twenty years to make - not a single minute was wasted,"Here indeed is one of the great films of the 20th Century about one of the greatest men of the 20th Century. Ben Kingsley's interpretation of the Mahatma must go down in history as one of the most perfect cinema rôles ever carried out. Throughout the long film you forget you are watching an actor playing the part of a great man in history: you are watching the real Gandhi. A gigantic performance indeed. Richard Attenborough's patient and perfect directing added all the superlatives possible to make a crowning achievement, transporting biographic films into another dimension.It is all there: from the most intimate and poignant portrait to the incredible crowd scenes, beautifully captured in the most painstaking photography. You do not just watch the scenes unfold  you live them, you feel them, so captivating they are; and Ravi Shankar's music tugs at you, spellbinds you, forces you into sympathy, admiration and so many other feelings. Enthralling: how such a cinematographic work of art can reach such proportions is truly amazing; this film is nothing less than a miracle. During 1971 I travelled a good bit around India; I constantly had to apologise to energetic Indians who approached me on the subject of the British Raj. I had not even been born. But as a young and unappointed ambassador, I felt it my duty to bow my head in that country which is a microcosm of the whole planet. Thanks to this film, `Gandhi', Attenborough and Kingsley have said just about all there was to say.< For men may come and men may go, but Gandhi goes on forever >",took nearly twenty years make not single minute was wasted,here indeed is one great films 20th century about one greatest men 20th century ben kingsleys interpretation mahatma must go down history as one most perfect cinema r les ever carried out throughout long film you forget you are watching actor playing part great man history you are watching real gandhi gigantic performance indeed richard attenboroughs patient perfect directing added all superlatives possible make crowning achievement transporting biographic films into another dimension it is all there most intimate poignant portrait incredible crowd scenes beautifully captured most painstaking photography you do not just watch scenes unfold you live them you feel them so captivating they are ravi shankars music tugs at you spellbinds you forces you into sympathy admiration so many other feelings enthralling how such cinematographic work art can reach such proportions is truly amazing this film is nothing less than miracle during 1971 i travelled good bit around india i constantly had apologise energetic indians who approached me subject british raj i had not even been born but as young unappointed ambassador i felt it my duty bow my head that country which is microcosm whole planet thanks this film gandhi attenborough kingsley have said just about all there was say men may come men may go but gandhi goes forever,0.492408103592314,0.28837339561023767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Old-Time Hollywood Epic Redux.,"The life of the legendary man from India (dominant Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley, who was a total unknown theatrical newcomer at the time) who gave up work as an attorney to defy British rule throughout the first half of the 20th Century before falling to an assassin's bullet in 1948. Long, opulent, breath-taking and completely memorable take on one of the most important historical figures the world has ever known. Oscar-winning director Richard Attenborough obviously studied David Lean's epic film-making masterpieces from the 1950s and 1960s as we have similarities galore with ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and much more importantly ""Lawrence of Arabia"". An all-star cast of very old-time Hollywood legends (John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, John Mills) and relative newcomers who were on the rise (Candice Bergen, Martin Sheen, Edward Fox, Nigel Hawthorne and a super quick glance of a very young Daniel Day-Lewis) blend in a desert landscape of cinematic brilliance. Make no mistake of it though, ""Gandhi"" works because of Kingsley as he weaves a colorful tapestry of cinematic performing ungodliness with a totally convincing take on his role and the complex subject matter. Running nearly 190 minutes, ""Gandhi"" still just uses flash-points to under-score the importance and significance of the major topics within. Those familiar with advanced world history will likely get more out of the film, but still a movie whose glitter continues to shine as bright as ever. 5 stars out of 5.",old time hollywood epic redux,life legendary man india dominant oscar winner ben kingsley who was total unknown theatrical newcomer at time who gave up work as attorney defy british rule throughout first half 20th century before falling assassins bullet 1948 long opulent breath taking completely memorable take one most important historical figures world has ever known oscar winning director richard attenborough obviously studied david leans epic film making masterpieces 1950s 1960s as we have similarities galore with bridge river kwai much more importantly lawrence arabia all star cast very old time hollywood legends john gielgud trevor howard john mills relative newcomers who were rise candice bergen martin sheen edward fox nigel hawthorne super quick glance very young daniel day lewis blend desert landscape cinematic brilliance make no mistake it though gandhi works because kingsley as he weaves colorful tapestry cinematic performing ungodliness with totally convincing take his role complex subject matter running nearly 190 minutes gandhi still just uses flash points under score importance significance major topics within those familiar with advanced world history will likely get more out film but still movie whose glitter continues shine as bright as ever 5 stars out 5,0.4810526315789473,0.19554824561403505,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Attenborough offers a tour de force performances,"There is a sanctimonious air to the films of Sir Richard Samuel Attenborough: the earnest desire that fair play is seen to be done Attenborough attempts to humanize his personage by exposing the widening gaps between India's two main religious communities, but he seemed to be quite forced to ignore some of the Indian characters in favor of Western ones, as some of the very important episodes of the film were seen through the eyes of two American reporters...Attenborough, a filmmaker who can rival David Lean for the big set piece without losing a sense of human scale, presents the political events with real dramatic impact...His big challenge was to give the film an epic quality Still, while Attenborough's endless seas of extras testify to his ability to order crowds, his fine motion picture was seen very believable and realistic, with enough insight either into its sublimely serene hero's mind or into the complex realities of Indian history and politicsBritish actor Ben Kingsley portrays the spiritual leader with deep simplicity... Kingsley's Mahatma is amazing, so beautiful in its honesty... Kingsley burns with a strong and purer flame, particularly in the way he ages across the five decades which the film depicts... His wetly blazing eyes as a young lawyer in South Africa, his black hair and immense energy, gives way to the bald small modest man, in shawl, loin cloth, steel-rimmed glasses, frequently thrown in jail by the British authorities...Kingsley takes the qualities and details instructed by Attenborough: Gandhi's fiercely intelligent aura; Gandhi's rational and calm reaction to inflamed emotion; Gandhi's unshaken beliefs and principles; Gandhi's warm smile...A distinguished cast of characters surround Academy Award-Winning Ben Kingsley as Gandhi: Candice Bergen, the Life magazine American photographer whom Gandhi conveys with a sense of humor; John Gielgud, the Viceroy who decides to ignore the man in loin cloth; Edward Fox, the brutal English general who orders his troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowds; Trevor Howard, the Judge who behaves with great consideration, standing and nodding respectfully to Gandhi in the dock before taking his seat; Geraldine James, the adopted daughter, blinded by love for Ghandi; and Martin Sheen, the American reporter of the New York Times who makes Gandhi laugh: 'It would be uncivil for us to let you make the long trip for nothing.'""Gandhi"" has a rare combination of deep character penetration and enormous epic sweep with ""Lawrence of Arabia."" But while 'Lawrence of Arabia' is about a solitary adventurer, 'Gandhi' is a moving portrait of a character with a disarming humility, who spins cotton, walks the country roads, meditates in front of the ocean, or scoops salt from the beach... Throughout the picture, which takes place over a half century, one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions...

8.0,Beautiful Film,"""The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office. Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands. He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift. Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.""This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film ""Gandhi"". Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination. The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral. It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed. Mahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art. This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won. ""Gandhi"" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history. Ben Kingsley played Gandhi. He was the perfect for the role. He resembled the real Gandhi. He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.  He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the ""big-time actor"" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film. He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved. He became Gandhi.The cinematography was outstanding. Attenborough filmed ""Gandhi"" on location in India. The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film. This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi. Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta. It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming. They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman. Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film. Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.This movie is a must see for everyone. It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class. The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant. It is also a beautiful work of art. This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see ""Pearl Harbor"" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",beautiful film,object this massive tribute died as he had always lived without wealth without property without official title or office mahatma gandhi was not commander armies nor ruler vast lands he could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift yet men governments dignitaries all over world have joined hands today pay homage little brown man loin cloth who led his country freedom this quote is funeral scene 1982 film gandhi richard attenborough directed this massive epic about man that freed india film opens with gandhis assassination next scene his funeral is one greatest scenes cinematic history attenborough managed recreate gandhis funeral january 31st 1981 33rd anniversary actual funeral it is estimated that nearly 400 000 people were hand be part filming recreation this film was made before cgi computer generated images so funeral scene is probably last live action crowd that magnitude that will ever be filmed mahatma gandhis message non violent resistance is delivered interesting enthralling body art this film has made will make millions people aware little brown man that took british empire won gandhi serves both as entertainment important historical record one most important figures history ben kingsley played gandhi he was perfect role he resembled real gandhi he was young enough portray gandhi as young man he is british actor that nailed british influenced indian accent he is wonderful actor that was patient humble with such important part he was relatively unknown actor at time so big time actor persona did not get way viewing film he did win both academy award golden globe best actor this role which i agree he deserved he became gandhi cinematography was outstanding attenborough filmed gandhi location india scenes india are spectacular india is very much another character film this film is as much about india itself as it is about gandhi attenborough shows audience people india its countryside vast city calcutta it is suggested by kingsley dvd that attenborough had difficult time with elite class india at time filming they were against making such film by englishman undeterred by their negative thinking he persevered enlist thousands indians help make this film every crowd scene he used real indians area attenborough also won both academy award golden globe best direction this movie is must see everyone it should be required viewing high schools as part history class fight against prejudice will forever be relevant it is also beautiful work art this movie is not tainted by embellishment hollywood see pearl harbor that course it would have been hard screw up movie about such great man 10 10,0.541812865497076,0.21531632110579477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,"A true epic, in every sense of the word","Very, VERY few films have had the distinct ability to move and inspire me to the point where the effect is almost life-altering. ""Gandhi"" - the unbelievable, first-rate biopic on the historical figure - is truly one of those films, no question whatsoever. An unsurprising sweep for the 1983 Academy Awards, this is without a doubt one of the last real ""epic"" motion pictures ever.Chronicling the rich, unforgettable life of a one Mohandas K. ""Mahatma"" Gandhi - played to shocking perfection by the wonderful Sir Ben Kingsley - this is a film that I can say really, deeply affected me with its power, its scale, and of course, its timeless message of love and non-violence. As a matter of fact, ever since I first saw the film, and became much more aware of the back story, I can also say that Gandhi is now one of my biggest role models in life. I cannot fully express how much this great man's way of thinking - his words, his struggles, his accomplishments - has affected my own, for I am now a practicing pacifist. I am a firm believer in the value of non-violent protest, and have tried my best to apply that philosophy to most situations in my life. It has worked wonders for me, and has really changed how I view the world in terms of human nature and so forth.

,Gandhi's Umpteenth Fast,"In her diary entry of Saturday, February 27, 1943, Anne Frank wrote in passing (translated from the Dutch): ""The freedom-loving Gandhi of India is holding his umpteenth fast.""It's a comment at once mildly comical and respectfully admiring, one I think the Mahatma would have appreciated with a twinkle and a laugh. He and Miss Frank are linked with the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., as the civil rights spokesperson-giants of the 20th century. And civil rights, and the reversal of the institutionalized violation of the same, are a large part of what the last century's politics were all about. Movie viewers are apt to find in the diary remark a distillation of their experience of the Richard Attenborough film. A recommendation is that it be followed by rentals of Saving Private Ryan and The Long Walk Home, which together convey the investment put into the respective causes the trio represented.At the beginning of Gandhi we confront these words: ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man....""John Briley's screenplay accomplishes that faithfulness, and one probably has to be a scholar of the subject to sort out what is his and what is Gandhi's. Not that it really is of relevance, given what we learn from the movie about the value of eclecticism. Looking out over the bay at Porbandar, Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) tells Walker (Martin Sheen): ""The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course, but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped."" In a preceding scene, similarly, confronted by young toughs on a South African street, Gandhi defends for his Christian friend Charlie (Ian Charleson) the New Testament intelligence of turning the other cheek. A worried Charlie states, ""I think perhaps the phrase was used metaphorically. I don't think our Lord meant...,"" and is interrupted by a movie shot of the approaching menace. Gandhi replies calmly, ""I'm not so certain. I have thought about it a great deal. I suspect he meant you must show courage--be willing to take a blow--several blows--to show you will not strike back--nor will you be turned aside.... And when you do that it calls upon something...that makes...hate for you diminish and...respect increase. I think Christ grasped that and I...have seen it work.""The script is replete with these kinds of memorable words, and with others that reflect its subject's political acumen and strategical cleverness.Kingsley is sublime in the lead role. Saeed Jaffrey, Roshan Seth, and Alyque Padamsee do well as Gandhi's pro-independence collaborators. Ditto, Athol Fugard (""Assuming we are in agreement?"") and John Gielgud (""Salt?"") as two of his adversaries. Charleson, in his clerical collar, looks like he has walked in off the set of the preceding year's Academy Award winner, Chariots of Fire (where he played the Scottish sprinter-missionary, Eric Liddell).This movie won eight Oscars, with Attenborough, Briley, and Kingsley all earning honors. No other film biography I ever have seen works so well. It will stand the test of time and inform multiple generations.

Remains an incredible piece of storytelling and film making about one of few individuals the world has delivered, that can truly be referred to as a great leader - and not just of his people but of the peace loving populations of the world.

,A great epic; Kingsley's best performance,"As soon as I finished watching Gandhi, I thought to myself ""This movie had to have won Best Picture."" I think it's one of the best epics of all time.

I would be hard pressed to name anything lacking about it. Direction, cinematography, costumes, they're all great. And Ben Kingsley! Without a doubt his portrayal of Gandhi is one of the best performances of his career, if not THE best.

10.0,One of the greatest men of the 20th century.,"The film, Gandhi, is Richard Attenborough's tribute to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948). Although it won eight Academy Awards, Including Best Director and Picture, the film has been criticized for a variety of reasons by people who did not realize that Gandhi himself was the greatness of the film. Ben Kingsley portrayed Gandhi to perfection. The Indian music was by the great Ravi Shankar.Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, educated in England, who entered the political arena in South Africa to fight against the treatment of Indian immigrants, uniting both Hindus and Muslims in the cause. Everyone, even his enemies, were impressed by his willingness to suffer, even die, at the hands of those in power, rather than back down from a just cause. He won the victory by insisting that his followers use civil disobedience and eschew all violence, thereby depriving the authorities of a justification for violent suppression. Gandhi explained it: ""When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always won. There have been murderers and tyrants, and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it, always.""He returned to India after the victory to become that country's spiritual leader. He led the struggle for independence from Britain, still insisting on non-violent means. The goal of independence was achieved but the Hindus and Muslims did not unite as they had in South Africa. Instead, they caused India to be split into India, Pakistan and East Pakistan, which later separated from Pakistan as Bangladesh. Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic.Two decades later, his methods were used by Martin Luther King in the fight against segregation in the United States of America. Gandhi and King were both willing to die for a cause and they both did but even now, in the next century, there is still some hatred between Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir state and between blacks and whites in America. Where is the next Gandhi? Where is the next Martin Luther King?

10.0,Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.........1869-1948,"Films do not come any better than this. The impact of this singular life is still being felt in the world. This man of peace who toppled a mighty empire and caused it to leave his country. Many study his teachings, most importantly the Reverend Martin Luther King for the civil rights movement in America, not enough follow them, especially in Gandhi's own corner of the world. His monument is now a growing and prosperous India that is slowly eradicating poverty form its borders. Gandhi would approve of that, he was not just for independence for the sake of independence, he was deeply interested in the kind of society that would result after the British left India. India's growing prosperity would please him, the religious and ethnic struggles still prevalent in that part of the world would not.The problem in discussing a film like Gandhi is that discussions will overlap into the life of the subject as opposed to the quality of the film. Richard Attenborough having lived a lot of his life during the time when these events took place remembered them well. He's got an eye for the sweep and grandeur of the story, but the life of Gandhi here is never overwhelmed by the spectacle of the film. And Ben Kingsley's Gandhi dominates the film, no wonder he received his Oscar for Best Actor. Ironically enough one of his competitors was Paul Newman who got a nomination for The Verdict which I consider his best performance and my personal favorite of his films. For me to say Kingsley deserved it over him is quite an admission.Gandhi was a devout Hindhu, but he was a man of vision who saw some of the injustices of fundamentalist and exclusionary religious beliefs. Born in the Brahmin caste, he fought against the caste system where social status was stratified by religion in ancient times and people could not rise from it. He was a believer in a land of opportunity, careers that were open to talent. He also was against male domination and treated women as equals. Note that scene where after he's arrested the British soldier offers to take Mrs. Gandhi to shelter, but says she will make the same seditious speech her husband intended to make and they might as well arrest her too.Of the many varied roles in the film by British and Indian players and a couple of Americans as well, the one that really stands out was Edward Fox as General Dyer. Some of the violence during our civil rights struggles in the American south was nothing compared to the Amritsar massacre when as the British commander he opened fire on a peaceful rally and slaughtered hundreds of men, women, and children. We put Nazis to death for atrocities committed in World War II, yet little happened to Dyer except he was put on the shelf and buried like an embarrassment which he certainly was. Fox in that small role captured the haughty military mind and cold blooded ruthlessness that one has to be born with.The ironic thing is that after India did send troops to fight in various theaters in World War I the Indians, Moslems, Hindus, et al, expected independence. They thought it would be peaceful, but Amritsar made revolutionaries of a lot of people. And the sentiment in the British population was for independence. But some politicians like Winston Churchill and press barons like Lord Beaverbrooke whipped up a lot of fear in the Tory ranks for granting independence. It was a stupid and incredibly shortsighted opinion that we still feel the effects of today.Gandhi won several Oscars besides Kingsley's including Best Picture for 1982 and Best Director for Richard Attenborough. The best review I can give Gandhi is that the film is great and worthy of the great man in portrays.",mohandas karamchand gandhi 1869 1948,films do not come any better than this impact this singular life is still being felt world this man peace who toppled mighty empire caused it leave his country many study his teachings most importantly reverend martin luther king civil rights movement america not enough follow them especially gandhis own corner world his monument is now growing prosperous india that is slowly eradicating poverty form its borders gandhi would approve that he was not just independence sake independence he was deeply interested kind society that would result after british left india indias growing prosperity would please him religious ethnic struggles still prevalent that part world would not problem discussing film like gandhi is that discussions will overlap into life subject as opposed quality film richard attenborough having lived lot his life during time when these events took place remembered them well hes got eye sweep grandeur story but life gandhi here is never overwhelmed by spectacle film ben kingsleys gandhi dominates film no wonder he received his oscar best actor ironically enough one his competitors was paul newman who got nomination verdict which i consider his best performance my personal favorite his films me say kingsley deserved it over him is quite admission gandhi was devout hindhu but he was man vision who saw some injustices fundamentalist exclusionary religious beliefs born brahmin caste he fought against caste system where social status was stratified by religion ancient times people could not rise it he was believer land opportunity careers that were open talent he also was against male domination treated women as equals note that scene where after hes arrested british soldier offers take mrs gandhi shelter but says she will make same seditious speech her husband intended make they might as well arrest her too many varied roles film by british indian players couple americans as well one that really stands out was edward fox as general dyer some violence during our civil rights struggles american south was nothing compared amritsar massacre when as british commander he opened fire peaceful rally slaughtered hundreds men women children we put nazis death atrocities committed world war ii yet little happened dyer except he was put shelf buried like embarrassment which he certainly was fox that small role captured haughty military mind cold blooded ruthlessness that one has be born with ironic thing is that after india did send troops fight various theaters world war i indians moslems hindus et al expected independence they thought it would be peaceful but amritsar made revolutionaries lot people sentiment british population was independence but some politicians like winston churchill press barons like lord beaverbrooke whipped up lot fear tory ranks granting independence it was stupid incredibly shortsighted opinion that we still feel effects today gandhi won several oscars besides kingsleys including best picture 1982 best director richard attenborough best review i can give gandhi is that film is great worthy great man portrays,0.43697089947089945,0.20975529100529108,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Making of Mahatma's movie,"Picture this. Gandhiji walks in a court, accused of influencing the people and starting a movement, the Non Cooperation movement, immediately after Gandhiji broke the fast he started to curb the movement which had assumed violence after Chauri Chora. We walks in alone, unescorted and as soon as he walks in there is an unexplainable silence in the court, and to everyone's surprise the Judge, stands up in respect of the accused ! Seeing him do this the barristers and rest also stand up. This scene though may seem insignificant on paper is one without which this entire movie would have been incomplete. To know whyread on ! On day of 2nd October they play this movie every year on DD National, Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. I never watched it whenever it was shown since 20 years of 2nd Octobers I had seen. The first few years because I couldn't understand and the next few because I felt that though it's a multiple Oscar winner, how could at the end of the day, a British person understand and do justice to an Indian icon ? After so many years I finally broke the ice and saw the movie in totality right from the first scene of Nathuram Godse, to Hey Ram, and I understood that Gandhi was as British, as much a part of Britain's history as he was of India's, in fact an outsider judged the person better than we ourselves could, hence without doubt this is a masterpiece, because it was always meant to be. Richard Attenborough like all directors worth their salt uses visual aid as a medium to replace conventional dialogue delivery at times. A picture is worth a thousand words and a scene without words is worth a million. Like the first scene I described and others. In one scene towards the end of the movie, Gandhiji starts a fast until death to stop the communal riots post independence and Nehru goes to meet him. A crowd had gathered near his residence and one of the person in the crowd shouted a suggestion, 'Why don't they kill Gandhi ?', Nehru furiously jumps into the crowd to search for this person and the camera moves in the crowd and for a briefest time and quite unmistakably you spot Nathuram Godse in the crowd. This made me think, 'hey this is what I call good cinema!'.So what about the outsider theory ? Well you see if Rajkumar Santoshi, Yash Chopra, Raj Kapoor or Mani Ratnam had made this movie they would have fallen under the pressure and the unbearably weight of historical facts, Richard had that advantage. Someone quite ignorant about Indian culture was telling a story of an Indian to an audience even more ignorant. What I mean is that there are things which are skewed up, characters gone wrong and famous words mouthed by someone else. For example the writer has messed the character of the Patel Siblings. Vallabhbhai Patel was never an extrovert and never as polished as shown in the movie, but someone else was and it was his more Birtish, yet less famous elder brother Vithalbhai who in fact introduced Vallabh to Indian movement. Again it is a known fact that Vallabhai continued the Dandi march after Gandhi's arrest, the fact which is ignored. Once again the characters of Kriplani, Maulana Azad etc are all skewed. But at the end of it works, why, because Richard's view is focused. I would notice these mistakes because I am an Indian aware of this, a person in England may never find out and even if he does he would consider it as trivial because this is a story of Gandhi and not the Indian freedom struggle. People say that unnecessary importance is given to foreign characters in Gandhi's life like Margret, Rev. Charlie, Walker, Miraben, but I would say it is necessary because these people did influence Gandhi and made him an international personality which he is. But before I end my take on this movie I must comment on the characterization. Starting with Ben Kinsley as Gandhi. To tell you the truth when I first saw him as Mohandas KG in the train I was shocked, he didn't look like Gandhi which I imagined, but as the movie goes ahead I changed my opinion. Ben worked because of multiple reasons. The first he is a British Gujarati, Gandhi was gujarati who did his law in England so both speak the same language, Partly British English with unmistakable Gujarati overtones. Second all other characterization of Gandhis in the history are shown as fragile creatures without clothes. Ben did carry some more body than others and which made Gandhi look more real , more alive. Also he had an infectious little smile which works because Gandhi in many was a jovial happy person who smiled a lot , a kind smile of calm which no one but Ben Kinsley brought out ! Of the other characters, Martin Sheen as Walker was impressive, so were Lord Erwin, Gen Dyer, Margrets, Nehru and Miraben's characters. Rohini Hattangidi as Kasturba does a remarkable job too, though she was shown a little more extroverted than Kasturba was , maybe. As a whole to sum it up, this is one hell of a beautiful movie experience.

8.0,Splendid biopic about the lawyer who became the prestigious leader of the Indian revolts against the British through his philosophy of non-violence,"Biography of Mohandas K. 'Mahatma Gandhi' , the lawyer who became the famed leader of the Indian revolts against the British rule through his philosophy of nonviolent protest . Gandhi (excellent Ben Kingsley) realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa . Gandhi returns to India in 1915, when he has now abandoned his western clothing for more basic self-made garb of shawls and loincloths . Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence . Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. He is asked by prominent Indian figures of the day, such as Jawaharlal Nehru (Roshan Seth) , Sardar Vallabhai Patel (Saeed Jaffrey) and Mohammad Ali Jinnah (Padamsee) , to join the fight for Indian independence from the British, despite some within that group believing Gandhi's methods ineffective . Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike . All events leading to his assassination in 1948 . It's an enjoyable historical drama story where the protagonist , Ben Kingsley , is awesome . Ben Kingsley looked so much like Mohandas K. Gandhi, many natives thought him to be Gandhi's ghost , Kingsley was recommended for the role by Harold Pinter, who had seen him in a play. This exciting , overproduced and immortal story is plenty of emotion , realized in documentary style , though sometimes results to be overlong . It is an epic and moving tale , as the starring fights violent forces , taking on the risks to survive in a world surrounded by hatred , racism and intolerance . The script relies heavily on the Gandhi life but it doesn't originate boring . It's a brilliant story and though is slow-moving , isn't tiring . Ample support cast formed by notorious secondaries playing brief roles , many of them performing historical characters , such as Candice Bergen as photographer Margaret Bourke-White , Edward Fox as General Dyer , John Gielgud as Lord Irwin , Trevor Howard as Judge Broomfield , John Mills as The Viceroy , and Indian actors such as Saeed Jaffrey as Sardar Patel , Alyque Padamsee as Mohammed Ali Jinnah , Om Puri , Amrish Puri as Khan and Roshan Seth as Pandit Nehru . Furthermore , uncredited Daniel Day Lewis , Dominic Guard , Richard Griffiths , Bernard Hill and John Ratzenberger's brief scene ; being the last film of John Boxer and Sir John Clements. Lush cinematography woven into a rich and exotic tapestry from Ronnie taylor and Billy Williams . Sensitive score by George Fenton , including musical sounds with Hindu motives by Ravi Shankar . The picture was stunningly directed by Richard Attenborough , though no studio was interested in financing the film . Richard cited that most of the financing were solicited from Joseph E. Levine whom agreed to finance in exchange of Attenborough directing A bridge too far and Magic. Richard won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for this film . The motion picture was correctly based on historic events , these are the following : Gandhi returns to India in 1915 from South Africa , there he carries out the 'salt march' , he subsequently declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops . The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided . The actual division between the two new dominions was done according to what has come to be known as the 3 June Plan or Mountbatten Plan . The border between India and Pakistan was determined by a British Government-commissioned report usually referred to as the Radcliffe Line after the London lawyer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe, who wrote it. During 1947, after 350 years of occupying India, the British decide to leave, but not before separating Islamic Pakistan and secular India. Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan, while an equal number of Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians crossed over from the other side .Pakistan came into being with two non-contiguous enclaves, East Pakistan (today Bangladesh) and West Pakistan, separated geographically by India. India was formed out of the majority Hindu regions of the colony, and Pakistan from the majority Muslim areas. Countries of Modern Indian sub-continent . On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act that finalized the partition arrangement. The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border. Estimates of the number of deaths range around roughly 500,000, with low estimates at 200,000 and high estimates 1.000.000. Gandhi spent his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.",splendid biopic about lawyer who became prestigious leader indian revolts against british through his philosophy non violence,biography mohandas k mahatma gandhi lawyer who became famed leader indian revolts against british rule through his philosophy nonviolent protest gandhi excellent ben kingsley realizes that laws are biased against indians decides start non violent protest campaign rights all indians south africa gandhi returns india 1915 when he has now abandoned his western clothing more basic self made garb shawls loincloths too weak world war ii continue enforcing its will india britain finally grants indias independence indians celebrate this victory but their troubles are far over he is asked by prominent indian figures day such as jawaharlal nehru roshan seth sardar vallabhai patel saeed jaffrey mohammad ali jinnah padamsee join fight indian independence british despite some within that group believing gandhis methods ineffective religious tensions between hindus muslims erupt into nation wide violence gandhi declares hunger strike all events leading his assassination 1948 its enjoyable historical drama story where protagonist ben kingsley is awesome ben kingsley looked so much like mohandas k gandhi many natives thought him be gandhis ghost kingsley was recommended role by harold pinter who had seen him play this exciting overproduced immortal story is plenty emotion realized documentary style though sometimes results be overlong it is epic moving tale as starring fights violent forces taking risks survive world surrounded by hatred racism intolerance script relies heavily gandhi life but it doesnt originate boring its brilliant story though is slow moving isnt tiring ample support cast formed by notorious secondaries playing brief roles many them performing historical characters such as candice bergen as photographer margaret bourke white edward fox as general dyer john gielgud as lord irwin trevor howard as judge broomfield john mills as viceroy indian actors such as saeed jaffrey as sardar patel alyque padamsee as mohammed ali jinnah om puri amrish puri as khan roshan seth as pandit nehru furthermore uncredited daniel day lewis dominic guard richard griffiths bernard hill john ratzenbergers brief scene being last film john boxer sir john clements lush cinematography woven into rich exotic tapestry ronnie taylor billy williams sensitive score by george fenton including musical sounds with hindu motives by ravi shankar picture was stunningly directed by richard attenborough though no studio was interested financing film richard cited that most financing were solicited joseph e levine whom agreed finance exchange attenborough directing bridge too far magic richard won oscars best picture best director this film motion picture was correctly based historic events these are following gandhi returns india 1915 south africa there he carries out salt march he subsequently declares hunger strike saying he will not eat until fighting stops fighting does stop eventually but country is divided actual division between two new dominions was done according what has come be known as 3 june plan or mountbatten plan border between india pakistan was determined by british government commissioned report usually referred as radcliffe line after london lawyer sir cyril radcliffe who wrote it during 1947 after 350 years occupying india british decide leave but not before separating islamic pakistan secular india millions muslims crossed india pakistan while equal number hindus sikhs christians crossed over other side pakistan came into being with two non contiguous enclaves east pakistan today bangladesh west pakistan separated geographically by india india was formed out majority hindu regions colony pakistan majority muslim areas countries modern indian sub continent 18 july 1947 british parliament passed indian independence act that finalized partition arrangement newly formed governments were completely unequipped deal with migrations such staggering magnitude massive violence slaughter occurred both sides border estimates number deaths range around roughly 500 000 with low estimates at 200 000 high estimates 1 000 000 gandhi spent his last days trying bring about peace between both nations he thereby angers many dissidents both sides one whom finally gets close enough assassinate him,0.4576545454545455,0.1252141414141414,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

This great and simple little man made the India Independent and was against all types of prejudices existent, since racial prejudice until the religion's one. He started his anger with the British Empire when he was going to South Africa, and was throw away from the train because he was in the first class, and the prejudice of that time could not allow any non white man,specially being Indian or black to have the same rights as the white men. From that time, until his death, he made people from India and the English to think about the prejudice and the fact that all people should have the same rights. He was also followed by many white people, in the movie showing the clergyman Charlie Andrews and Miss Slade.PS:A thing that I discovered watching this movie was the fact that Gandhi was an attorney...I would never imagine that the peaceful leader made Law School!",his triumph changed india,gandhi is great movie i cannot think anyone better then ben kingsley play his role guy is perfect movie so perfect that i read trivia part imdb that many people india actually thought that ben was gandhis ghost gandhi was murdered 1948 by indian rebel when he was going make one his prayers this great simple little man made india independent was against all types prejudices existent since racial prejudice until religions one he started his anger with british empire when he was going south africa was throw away train because he was first class prejudice that time could not allow any non white man specially being indian or black have same rights as white men that time until his death he made people india english think about prejudice fact that all people should have same rights he was also followed by many white people movie showing clergyman charlie andrews miss slade ps thing that i discovered watching this movie was fact that gandhi was attorney i would never imagine that peaceful leader made law school,0.3639233954451345,0.21317287784679084,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"

He vowed that he will never lie in his life. Is it possible for you and me not to lie in life? He took vow about his cloths and wore same cloths (he was half naked in those cloths) while he was in London in winter!!! Just imagine a freedom fight against Britain without any kind of weapon or violence!!! And he was successful. He gave freedom to India without any army. In fact his principles should be followed in today's world. I must say this movie was not enough to describe his principle. He was more than movie GANDHI.

You may know more about him than I did before I watched this - it might be quite likely to be honest, I did not know too much about his life, more about his message and achievements of sorts.

10.0,You don't have to know the history to get something from this film.,"While I am sure there are inaccuracies the screenplay of this film does a remarkable job of explaining the political landscape of India. The Hindu-Muslim split is apparent from the opening scenes and the film effortlessly orientates the viewer to the various fractions. The resulting film is long, slow but deeply engrossing. Further, the screenplay, perhaps too little, does show Gandhi as a human being with foibles and limitations. In particular a scene where he is asked what about Hitler really presses his philosophy. A weaker film would not have had those tensions. While the films glorifies Gandhi it does so in a tasteful way. It is also nice to see a British co-production not sugarcoat the British atrocities against India all that much. The story seems fair to all those involved.The technical aspects are first rate. The cinematography, especially, as an exotic and spiritual edge to it. The final shot of the film is heartbreaking in its beauty. Likewise, the scope of the story is handled very well by the director and editor. The film is sprawling. It isn't however a mess. There is also a sense of forward movement and there are the required pauses for the more spiritual aspects of the film.Obviously,Kingsley is astounding in the title role. He somehow manages to capture the essence of Gandhi without doing a mere impression. The scenes when Gandhi is fasting are especially engaging. I also like how Kinsley and the visuals leaned into Gandhi's small statue. If nothing else Kinsley is the beating heart of this epic.I am glad I re-watched this.

,One of the most outstanding screen biographies,"Until very recently major Hollywood Studios seldom attempted to produce biographies, but when they did the subjects were usually legendary figures or long dead historic characters that impose few restraints on the screenwriters freedom - some pseudo-biographies even featured fictional characters. We have only to think of The Ten commandments, Cleopatra, Jason and the Argonauts or even Ben Hur to recognise that freedom from the rigours of historical veracity is the first requirement for the production of such epics. It is British films which have established an enviable reputation for widely acclaimed biographies that do not seriously distort historical facts. These include such masterpieces as Lawrence of Arabia, The Young Winston, Elizabeth (1998), Isadora, and That Hamilton Woman. Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"" also takes a very high place in this collection. As a Hindu mystic Gandhi is not an easy character for a Western European to fully appreciate but after watching this film one does really begin to develop some understanding of his life and times. Historically there are only a few recorded triumphs of non-violent revolts over the government of the day - the best known are probably the rise of Christianity in pagan Rome, and the independence of India from the British Raj. The latter is better documented, and this film is significant because of the way in which it shows how non-violent protest can be successful against what appear to be all the odds. However this is of less importance than the fine re-creation of life as it was lived in India at the time, and the magnificent acting - particularly the award winning performance of Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi. The film is lengthy (running for 188 min.) but utterly fascinating, and not overlong as it has such a vast sprawling canvas to cover. It should certainly be seen by every film lover. However it is probably best viewed in two parts as it is too fine a work to allow ones attention to flag.In the 20 years since this film was made the indigenous Indian film industry has developed to the point where there are now some very fine Indian Directors and a large pool of other talent. There have also been some changes in historical perspectives because of the ongoing friction between Hindus and Muslims on the Indian subcontinent. It can only be a matter of time before an Indian production company creates a new film about Gandhi's life from a strictly Indian point of view. When this occurs it will make a fascinating comparison with this film which still remains one of the truly great screen biographies.

10.0,Sweeping Epic With A Bravura Performance,"A magnificent movie by Attenborough and a career-topper for Ben Kingsley. Brilliant story of the man who almost single-handedly brought India kicking and screaming into the world as an independent nation. One of this century's true heroic figures, it is a crying shame that more than 50 years later, we are still dealing with the dangerous fallout of the Indian-Pakistani aggression that he so desperately sought to end.Count this movie amongst the great epics of cinematic history. All the supporting performances, particularly that of Roshan Seth as Nehru, are an absolute joy to behold. Classic cinematography, and a masterwork of a score by Ravi Shankar. Attenborough, of course, when he's not out raising dinosaurs, is a director of epics par excelllence (""A Bridge Too Far"" is another stroke of genius). Ben Kingsley spends the better part of 3 hours on screen in an absolutely riveting performance. The road to peace is a hard road. Just ask Nelson Mandela or John Lennon.

3.0,A simple collage of events and a big lie,"As a film lover, I have recently gotten suspicious of biopics and historical films. These kinds of movies tend to sugarcoat the truth to present almost typical Hollywood stories, for instance, making some people who weren't all that bad, the main villains, simply so the audiences can identify an antagonist (The Aviator is a big offender in this category). Gandhi (1982) falls into many of the these traps that other biopics fall into and as a result, becomes an over- glorification, a complete lie, and something that almost doesn't resemble a story, but merely a collage of events.The film basically presents us with the major events of Gandhi's career: his time working against British oppression of Indians as a lawyer in South Africa, the Amritsar massacre, the March of Salt, Gandhi's assassination, etc. The events are simply presented, very accurately from what I read about them, but the film leaves out many things about him that weren't very noble. Reading about events in Gandhi's life from all different sources, like books and online articles, I can safely say that I am appalled by some of the things that this man has done.When fighting British oppression of Indians in South Africa, he basically ignored native South Africans that have lived in the country much longer than any Indian or British person. Second, he was cruel to his family, so much so that his son spoke out against him and later died as a drunk; he even negatively compared his own wife to a cow. Additionally, when his wife was sick, he refused to give her British medicine and yet was willing to take it himself when he had malaria. After Hitler came to power and WWII started, he wrote to Hitler, addressing him as a friend, and after the war was over, he himself said that many of the Jews from the Holocaust should have let themselves die and submit to the oppression of the Nazis. Any sensible man or woman would know that this is could be nothing more than an insane and horrible suggestion and that it would be simply impossible to deal with the Nazis using Gandhi's ideas. This was the Gandhi that so many people idolized? I even read an article from The Guardian saying that a biography about Gandhi was forbidden for publication because it revealed too many things about his life.Other than the fact that the film is lying to everyone who sees it, the film is just too preachy. It doesn't barrage you with moral lessons every second of screen time, but half of the dialogue is moral lessons and guidelines on life and doesn't feel very natural. Even in the beginning, when it shows Gandhi's funeral, an announcer covering the funeral outright tells the audience (indirectly) what to think of Gandhi and how others, like Albert Einstein viewed him, and that we should view him that way too. Richard Attenborough, the director and producer, was actually advised against glorifying Gandhi. I don't get why he didn't take that advice to heart, considering that this was a passion project to him. Even some of the British officials in the film act like two-dimensional bad guys. One of the only positive things I can say about this film is that Ben Kingsley nails it as this film's version of Gandhi. He makes me wish that the Gandhi that has been glorified by the world was a real person, instead of the flawed and sometimes frightening human being that actually existed on this Earth. The film also has a genuinely good message, but like I said, it's just turned into a preachy sermon throughout most of the movie.What else can I say? I was so disappointed to realize that so much of this man's life was left out and simplified simply to be more Hollywood-friendly and attract more crowds. That is complete BS. What a movie biopic should do, I think, is have the courage to present the uglier details of a person's life and as a result, feel more challenging. Plus, don't preach a moral lesson to us if a person lived by one, because that's being unsubtle. Let us figure it out for ourselves. Some of those things I said were applied in the excellent film, Raging Bull, by Martin Scorsese. Not only is the film mostly true to life, according to Jake LaMotta, whom the film was based on, but it wasn't afraid to portray LaMotta as a brute of a man like he was in his boxing heyday and it didn't outright tell you what to think of LaMotta or how he was thinking; instead, it kept you guessing with Robert De Niro's performance and the cinematography. Gandhi is just too afraid to turn a man who undeniably made major contributions to humanity into anything less than what people wish to see him as. As a result, this film is disgraceful and is too much of a piece of Oscar bait to be genuinely good. I'm sorry, members of the Academy, but you made a terrible choice for the Best Picture of 1982.",simple collage events big lie,as film lover i have recently gotten suspicious biopics historical films these kinds movies tend sugarcoat truth present almost typical hollywood stories instance making some people who werent all that bad main villains simply so audiences can identify antagonist aviator is big offender this category gandhi 1982 falls into many these traps that other biopics fall into as result becomes over glorification complete lie something that almost doesnt resemble story but merely collage events film basically presents us with major events gandhis career his time working against british oppression indians as lawyer south africa amritsar massacre march salt gandhis assassination etc events are simply presented very accurately what i read about them but film leaves out many things about him that werent very noble reading about events gandhis life all different sources like books online articles i can safely say that i am appalled by some things that this man has done when fighting british oppression indians south africa he basically ignored native south africans that have lived country much longer than any indian or british person second he was cruel his family so much so that his son spoke out against him later died as drunk he even negatively compared his own wife cow additionally when his wife was sick he refused give her british medicine yet was willing take it himself when he had malaria after hitler came power wwii started he wrote hitler addressing him as friend after war was over he himself said that many jews holocaust should have let themselves die submit oppression nazis any sensible man or woman would know that this is could be nothing more than insane horrible suggestion that it would be simply impossible deal with nazis using gandhis ideas this was gandhi that so many people idolized i even read article guardian saying that biography about gandhi was forbidden publication because it revealed too many things about his life other than fact that film is lying everyone who sees it film is just too preachy it doesnt barrage you with moral lessons every second screen time but half dialogue is moral lessons guidelines life doesnt feel very natural even beginning when it shows gandhis funeral announcer covering funeral outright tells audience indirectly what think gandhi how others like albert einstein viewed him that we should view him that way too richard attenborough director producer was actually advised against glorifying gandhi i dont get why he didnt take that advice heart considering that this was passion project him even some british officials film act like two dimensional bad guys one only positive things i can say about this film is that ben kingsley nails it as this films version gandhi he makes me wish that gandhi that has been glorified by world was real person instead flawed sometimes frightening human being that actually existed this earth film also has genuinely good message but like i said its just turned into preachy sermon throughout most movie what else can i say i was so disappointed realize that so much this mans life was left out simplified simply be more hollywood friendly attract more crowds that is complete bs what movie biopic should do i think is have courage present uglier details persons life as result feel more challenging plus dont preach moral lesson us if person lived by one because thats being unsubtle let us figure it out ourselves some those things i said were applied excellent film raging bull by martin scorsese not only is film mostly true life according jake lamotta whom film was based but it wasnt afraid portray lamotta as brute man like he was his boxing heyday it didnt outright tell you what think lamotta or how he was thinking instead it kept you guessing with robert de niros performance cinematography gandhi is just too afraid turn man who undeniably made major contributions humanity into anything less than what people wish see him as as result this film is disgraceful is too much piece oscar bait be genuinely good im sorry members academy but you made terrible choice best picture 1982,0.46459120425029526,0.0032347009051554563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,One of Richard Attenborough's best films,"I am all for ambitious and stately films, which is why I watched Gandhi. And I like Richard Attenborough, I think not only was he a talented actor and director but his films are very interesting. Gandhi is certainly one of his more interesting films, along with the underrated Cry Freedom.Gandhi is just a wonderful film, and do I think it's one of Attenborough's best? Along with Cry Freedom and Shadowlands, yes it is. This film is for me his most ambitious and his most stately, and it is very compelling. True, it is long and perhaps leisurely in pace, but it is well worth the watch for several reasons.Visually it is superb to look at. It was almost like watching a David Lean film, it has the beautiful scenery, the stunning cinematography and the sweeping colours that a Lean film does. I also loved George Fenton's score, it was very epic and moving. Is it his best? Perhaps not, but it is one of his better scores. Attenborough's direction is superb, and the script is thought-provoking. The story, starting with Gandhi's assassination and told mostly in flashback, is interesting and compelling, while the acting also helps drives the film. Words cannot describe how good Ben Kingsley's performance was, composed yet inspirational, sometimes I felt as thought I was actually seeing Gandhi rather than Kingsley. In fact, this is probably the Richard Attenborough-directed film that feels the most authentic in terms of characters and story. Kingsley also gets superb support from Candice Bergen, Edward Fox, John Gielgud and Roshan Seth. Best scene? Lots to pick, but Gandhi's funeral was brilliantly done and one of the most emotional scenes in film and had massive scope to it.Overall, brilliant and one of Attenborough's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",one richard attenboroughs best films,i am all ambitious stately films which is why i watched gandhi i like richard attenborough i think not only was he talented actor director but his films are very interesting gandhi is certainly one his more interesting films along with underrated cry freedom gandhi is just wonderful film do i think its one attenboroughs best along with cry freedom shadowlands yes it is this film is me his most ambitious his most stately it is very compelling true it is long perhaps leisurely pace but it is well worth watch several reasons visually it is superb look at it was almost like watching david lean film it has beautiful scenery stunning cinematography sweeping colours that lean film does i also loved george fentons score it was very epic moving is it his best perhaps not but it is one his better scores attenboroughs direction is superb script is thought provoking story starting with gandhis assassination told mostly flashback is interesting compelling while acting also helps drives film words cannot describe how good ben kingsleys performance was composed yet inspirational sometimes i felt as thought i was actually seeing gandhi rather than kingsley fact this is probably richard attenborough directed film that feels most authentic terms characters story kingsley also gets superb support candice bergen edward fox john gielgud roshan seth best scene lots pick but gandhis funeral was brilliantly done one most emotional scenes film had massive scope it overall brilliant one attenboroughs best 10 10 bethany cox,0.5926984126984128,0.5007619047619047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.15}"
,"""Repent, Harlequin!"" said the Ticktockman","Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"" charts the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the political and spiritual figure who led a non-violent resistance movement against British Colonial rule in India. The film touches upon all the now famous cornerstones of Gandhi's life. We watch Gandhi being educated in Britain, follow his life as a provincial lawyer, and observe his work in South Africa. It is here, in 1893, that he began to represent indentured Indian labourers, emerging as a voice of conscience and a representative of those subjected to racial discrimination.The film then watches as Gandhi returns to India in 1915. Here he seeks to ignite a ""moral reformation"" which renders the British occupation - responsible for almost 1.8 billion deaths over a roughly 200 year period - defunct. Gandhi's strategies for non-violent civil disobedience (satyagraha) initially appear impractical, but they soon begin drawing support. In 1920, under Gandhi's leadership, local Congress was reorganised and given the explicit goal of seeking self governance. Gandhi then urged the Indian people to boycott British education institutions, courts and products, to resign from government employment, to refuse to pay taxes, and to forsake British titles and honours; full spectrum resistance. Gandhi's party was then transformed from an elite organisation to one of mass national appeal. In his writings Gandhi would express his belief that ""radical non violence ultimately brings one's oppressor around to one's own side"". This was true to some extent, as Attenborough ably shows. On the other hand, it was really WW2, many violent Indian protests and the sheer contradictions of capitalism which made the Empire collapse. The British Raj was itself but the outcome of the nationalization or ""bailing out"" of failing private financial cartels. In other words, Gandhi simply struck when the system was crumbling anyway.But Attenborough doesn't care. Instead he offers your typical Gandhi tale: against the Goliath of the modern, imperial super-state, it was the diminutive Gandhi who stood up, David-like, against its might. He showed the modern world that people should never be overlooked. He paralysed Britain, thwarting its imperial ambitions, revealing the limits of its power by undermining its economic self-sufficiency through coordinated, mass campaigns of non-violent non-cooperation. This, some say, was also the path that in the end ""defeated"" the even more muscular Soviet Union. We also see the emergence, during this very same period, of Gandhi's more violent alter ego, Mao Tse-Tung, whose revolutionary violence was equally effective in winning independence from his more brutal foes, both the imperial Japanese and the industrial Nationalists.""Gandhi"" contains a last-act subplot in which Gandhi rejects the proposal for the partitioning India and the ""creation"" of Pakistan. But of course it was Gandhi who first signed onto the proposal. He was a thoroughly caste-oriented Hindu, offering only moral friendship to Muslims, who shrewdly wanted political power too. When Pakistan and India split, you then had much bloodshed, many massacres and long-lasting tensions. Blaming this on Gandhi, though, is perhaps unfair. The British Empire tirelessly pushed for the splitting of India; all Empires practise divide and conquer tactics, especially when ""granting independence"" to their ex-colonies. The goal is destabilisation, fragmentation and the continual plundering of these nations by proxy.""Gandhi's"" pure Hollywood, so other complexities are ignored. The irony of Gandhi ""freeing"" Indians in South Africa, for example, whilst being outwardly racist to Africans is neglected (in 1906 he'd actively participate in the war against blacks). The caste system - where society is arranged on a four level hierarchy based on skin colour - is itself the bedrock of Hinduism, the darker skinned relegated to the lower levels. None of this is in Attenborough's film. One other irony is that Gandhi emerged at a unique historic moment just as the Age of Empire began its rapid post-War decline, beginning its de-colonial contraction from an era marked by a global land grab to a more insular and self-governing age. But how much did the effectiveness of Gandhi's channelling of ""latent energy into massive non-violent expression"" depend directly on violent expression, namely Hitler, WW2's toil on the British Empire and massive bloodshed in Europe? Attenborough's film is well shot, paced, epic and engrossing, but also ultimately shameless hagiography, with a little Oscar baiting and David Lean pretensions sprinkled about. Attenborough, an actor himself, is very much a man or surfaces, direct statements and the literal. What you see is what you get.The film stars Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, whom Attenborough elevates to sainthood by mercilessly stripping away all psychology or inner life. Kingsley's fitting or wildly miscast (a white guy as Gandhi?) depending on what you smoke. Attenborough also errs in seeing the independence struggle solely as a battle between British colonialists and the Indian nationalist leadership. This is an elitist history that suppresses the voices and actions of the subaltern, the Indian peasantry, who were highly engaged in fighting colonial rule. Both the British and Indian elites wrongly viewed the subaltern as being pre-political and regressive.Today India has adopted Western-styled economic reforms. She is now one of the largest economies in the world (as she once was pre the arrival of the British). This has not abated massive rises in poverty, income inequality, environmental damage, exploitation and malnutrition. Over half of India's population now lives below the poverty line, and she contains more poor people than all of sub-Saharan Africa. Attenborough directed ""Cry Freedom"" in 1987, a preachy film about apartheid.8/10 – Good, but overly reverential, one-note, holy and white.

9.0,Powerful Movie About a Man with a Pure Heart!,"""I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you.""-Ben Kingsley (as Gandhi).The above quote, spoken by Ben Kingsley in the 1982 drama Gandhi, shows what kind of man Mahatma Gandhi was. In a harsh world filled with violence and racism, this one man became a prophet, a messiah if you will. He wanted to change the world for the better using non-violent tactics. He wanted to use nonviolence to end segregation against Indians in South Africa, to end British rule in India, to create a peaceful country for Muslims in a country today known as Pakistan. Through his methods, Gandhi achieved what only most people dream of achieving in their lifetimes. He was a man for the people and no matter who the person is or what kind of religion that person believes in, he loved you no matter what. In this long, sprawling epic, you will become a believer of this spiritual man. At least I did. This is the kind of man that we need in our world today. A man full of hope, compassion, love, nonmaterialistic-just to name a few adjectives.Director Richard Attenborough had been wanting to make this film for decades prior to the films release. Attenborough had meetings set up with and approval from various key figures to make this film happen-but it was never meant to be at first. Also, David Lean wanted to make a film based on Gandhi's life after he completed production on The Bridge on the River Kwai, but instead went to work on Lawrence of Arabia. Later on, David Lean met with Attenborough and you can see his influence in this epic. I saw portions of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago at times. Once Attenborough was able to get funding from the Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi- he was able to make the film he wanted. Attenborough was the perfect director for the movie. He wanted to create a grand epic, but one with the feeling of a smaller film. He didn't care too much about the landscapes or the scope of the film. All he wanted to do was focus on telling a careful, level-headed story about the person who changed the world for many-and he was able to do thanks to his sure-handed direction.The film starts in 1893 with a young lawyer named Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) traveling first-class on a South African train. He was not aware of any segregation laws and thus was thrown off the train. To combat these laws, he starts a non-violent protest against segregation of Indians in South Africa. These protests led in many arrests and global attention for Gandhi, but he still achieved victory in the end. After he returns to India, he is asked to assist in the independence of India from Great Britain's rule. He agrees, but faces more issues such as imprisonment, violence against protestors, etc. But with England still suffering from World War 2, they granted India their freedom. However, there was still more work to do. There was internal conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims. Gandhi declares a hunger strike to stop these groups from fighting, in which he does eventually succeed. In addition to making many followers, Gandhi also made many enemies and that might make him a target.The role of Gandhi was played to utter perfection by a newcomer named Ben Kingsley. Kingsley, who had Indian descent, was able to create the mannerisms and the style that made Gandhi one of the most important, influential figures of the twentieth century. This is one of the best acting performances you will ever see. Love it or hate it, there is no denying the power of Kingsley's performance-which led him to claim the Best Actor Academy Award. The supporting cast does fill out nicely around Kingsley. There are some excellent British thespians such as John Gielgud and Trevor Howard. Some Americans- Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen deliver strong performances, although their characters were pushed away somewhat. Also, keep an eye out for young Daniel-Day Lewis!Gandhi is a spellbinding tour-de-force epic with a lead acting performance that perfectly captures the essence of one of the most beloved and influential historical figures. The lush cinematography by Ronnie Taylor and the stirring music by Ravi Shankar adds an ""epic"" feeling seen in films like Lawrence of Arabia, but Attenborough was able to perfectly capture the intimate character moments that we know this man of. Whether it is watching Gandhi suffer from his hunger strike or seeing his followers shot down by the British-there is no shortage of powerful scenes. The movie does clock in well over three hours and it can be felt at times, but in no way in this movie boring. It is a movie well-deserved of its Best Picture victory. To help see the good in themselves, this is the perfect movie to see.My Grade: A-",powerful movie about man with pure heart,i am muslim hindu christian jew so are all you ben kingsley as gandhi above quote spoken by ben kingsley 1982 drama gandhi shows what kind man mahatma gandhi was harsh world filled with violence racism this one man became prophet messiah if you will he wanted change world better using non violent tactics he wanted use nonviolence end segregation against indians south africa end british rule india create peaceful country muslims country today known as pakistan through his methods gandhi achieved what only most people dream achieving their lifetimes he was man people no matter who person is or what kind religion that person believes he loved you no matter what this long sprawling epic you will become believer this spiritual man at least i did this is kind man that we need our world today man full hope compassion love nonmaterialistic just name few adjectives director richard attenborough had been wanting make this film decades prior films release attenborough had meetings set up with approval various key figures make this film happen but it was never meant be at first also david lean wanted make film based gandhis life after he completed production bridge river kwai but instead went work lawrence arabia later david lean met with attenborough you can see his influence this epic i saw portions arabia doctor zhivago at times once attenborough was able get funding indian prime minister indira gandhi he was able make film he wanted attenborough was perfect director movie he wanted create grand epic but one with feeling smaller film he didnt care too much about landscapes or scope film all he wanted do was focus telling careful level headed story about person who changed world many he was able do thanks his sure handed direction film starts 1893 with young lawyer named mohandas k gandhi ben kingsley traveling first class south african train he was not aware any segregation laws thus was thrown off train combat these laws he starts non violent protest against segregation indians south africa these protests led many arrests global attention gandhi but he still achieved victory end after he returns india he is asked assist independence india great britains rule he agrees but faces more issues such as imprisonment violence against protestors etc but with england still suffering world war 2 they granted india their freedom however there was still more work do there was internal conflict between hindus muslims gandhi declares hunger strike stop these groups fighting which he does eventually succeed addition making many followers gandhi also made many enemies that might make him target role gandhi was played utter perfection by newcomer named ben kingsley kingsley who had indian descent was able create mannerisms style that made gandhi one most important influential figures twentieth century this is one best acting performances you will ever see love it or hate it there is no denying power kingsleys performance which led him claim best actor academy award supporting cast does fill out nicely around kingsley there are some excellent british thespians such as john gielgud trevor howard some americans martin sheen candice bergen deliver strong performances although their characters were pushed away somewhat also keep eye out young daniel day lewis gandhi is spellbinding tour de force epic with lead acting performance that perfectly captures essence one most beloved influential historical figures lush cinematography by ronnie taylor stirring music by ravi shankar adds epic feeling seen films like lawrence arabia but attenborough was able perfectly capture intimate character moments that we know this man whether it is watching gandhi suffer his hunger strike or seeing his followers shot down by british there is no shortage powerful scenes movie does clock well over three hours it can be felt at times but no way this movie boring it is movie well deserved its best picture victory help see good themselves this is perfect movie see my grade,0.5329900124843944,0.25918048867487076,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"
