7.0,A classy character study of a disturbed individual—but what is the point?,"Insomniac Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job driving a New York taxi cab, becomes obsessed with beautiful political campaigner Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who gives him the cold shoulder after he tries to take her to a skin flick on a date. Bickle then becomes obsessed with underage hooker Iris (Jodie Foster), buys lots of guns, and goes trigger happy on her pimp (Harvey Keitel).As a fan of gritty 70s movie-making, I find it hard to believe that, until now, I hadn't seen Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver; I think perhaps the problem was that, having heard so many good things about the film, I didn't want to risk disappointment. Unfortunately, that's precisely what I felt when I finally got around to watching the film.It's not that it's a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination—on the contrary, it's a skilfully assembled character study of a self-destructive loose cannon that boasts excellent cinematography, great music, and superb performances—BUT in the end it just didn't grab me as much as I would have liked. The story progresses very slowly, which in itself isn't a massive issue for me, but the payoff simply isn't as satisfying as I felt it needed to be given all that has gone before.After all of his stalking, inane rambling and meticulous planning, Travis Bickle's rampage is over in a flash, after which he is proclaimed a hero and freed to roam the streets once more (unless you prescribe to the theory that everything after the shootout is in Bickle's mind as he slowly bleeds to death). Perhaps Scorsese's point was to show us just how easy it is for a dangerous loony like Bickle to be overlooked by society until its too late—but it sure felt like a letdown to me.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for Keitel's hair.",classy character study disturbed individual but what is point,insomniac vietnam veteran travis bickle robert de niro takes job driving new york taxi cab becomes obsessed with beautiful political campaigner betsy cybill shepherd who gives him cold shoulder after he tries take her skin flick date bickle then becomes obsessed with underage hooker iris jodie foster buys lots guns goes trigger happy her pimp harvey keitel as fan gritty 70s movie making i find it hard believe that until now i hadnt seen martin scorseses taxi driver i think perhaps problem was that having heard so many good things about film i didnt want risk disappointment unfortunately thats precisely what i felt when i finally got around watching film its not that its bad movie by any stretch imagination contrary its skilfully assembled character study self destructive loose cannon that boasts excellent cinematography great music superb performances but end it just didnt grab me as much as i would have liked story progresses very slowly which itself isnt massive issue me but payoff simply isnt as satisfying as i felt it needed be given all that has gone before after all his stalking inane rambling meticulous planning travis bickles rampage is over flash after which he is proclaimed hero freed roam streets once more unless you prescribe theory that everything after shootout is bickles mind as he slowly bleeds death perhaps scorseses point was show us just how easy it is dangerous loony like bickle be overlooked by society until its too late but it sure felt like letdown me 6 5 out 10 rounded up 7 keitels hair,0.6792290442290442,0.08002992502992505,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Robert De Niro!,"Taxi Driver, the classic that made Robert DeNiro Robert DeNiro. It's amazing to see how far this man has come in cinema, some of my friends ask me questions about films and advice, one of my friends had asked if they wanted to see where Bobby got the big notice I usually recommend Taxi Driver, granted he was in The Godfather Part 2 and was incredible, but Taxi Driver made him stand out as a strong lead actor. Taxi Driver is just all together a great film that is absolutely perfection. Martin Scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back to the film noir genre. He made this great classic and I don't even think he realized how much it would stand against the test of time, to this day we still know this film and even if you don't know it, you know the infamous speech ""You talking' to me?"". This is a film about isolation, loneliness, and self destruction at it's worst.Travis Bickle who claims to be an honorably discharged Marine it is implied that he is a Vietnam veteran is a lonely and depressed young man of 26. He settles in Manhattan, where he becomes a night time taxi driver due to chronic insomnia. Bickle spends his restless days in seedy porn theaters and works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Bickle becomes interested in Betsy, a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine. She is initially intrigued by Bickle and agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. On their date, however, Bickle is clueless about how to treat a woman and thinks it would be a good idea to take her to a sex film. Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain. Rejected and depressed, Bickle's thoughts begin to turn violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys a number of pistols from an illegal dealer and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm ""You talking' to me?"". Bickle is revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Shocked by the occurrence, Bickle fails to drive off and the pimp, Sport, reaches the cab. Later seeing Iris on the street he pays for her time, although he does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind. But after her rejection as well, Travis decides to take things into his own hands, ""Pow!"".This is one of the most memorable movies of all time and has really stood it's ground. It's personally one of my favorites and made me fall in love with Robert DeNiro all over again. The script to Taxi Driver is just so incredibly powerful and the performances were just perfect. Jodie Foster, this little girl at the time was such a presence on screen, she pulls in what was a very tricky performance and was hauntingly beautiful. Cybill Sheppard was also very beautiful and I was absolutely in love with her character and felt so bad for her. Everything about Taxi Driver is just great, I don't know how much I could go on about the love I have for this film. It's a film that you will never forget and trust me, if you haven't seen it, go out and rent it immediately, you won't regret it. It's bloody, it's twisted, it's crazy, but it's one of the best films of all time.10/10",ladies gentlemen mr robert de niro,taxi driver classic that made robert deniro robert deniro its amazing see how far this man has come cinema some my friends ask me questions about films advice one my friends had asked if they wanted see where bobby got big notice i usually recommend taxi driver granted he was godfather part 2 was incredible but taxi driver made him stand out as strong lead actor taxi driver is just all together great film that is absolutely perfection martin scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back film noir genre he made this great classic i dont even think he realized how much it would stand against test time this day we still know this film even if you dont know it you know infamous speech you talking me this is film about isolation loneliness self destruction at its worst travis bickle who claims be honorably discharged marine it is implied that he is vietnam veteran is lonely depressed young man 26 he settles manhattan where he becomes night time taxi driver due chronic insomnia bickle spends his restless days seedy porn theaters works 12 or 14 hour shifts during evening night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs new york city bickle becomes interested betsy campaign volunteer new york senator charles palantine she is initially intrigued by bickle agrees date with him after he flirts with her over coffee sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness their date however bickle is clueless about how treat woman thinks it would be good idea take her sex film offended she leaves him takes taxi home alone next day he tries reconcile with betsy phoning her sending her flowers but all his attempts are vain rejected depressed bickles thoughts begin turn violent disgusted by petty street crime that he witnesses while driving through city he now finds focus his frustration begins program intense physical training he buys number pistols illegal dealer practices menacing speech mirror while pulling out pistol that he attached home made sliding action holster his right arm you talking me bickle is revolted by what he considers moral decay around him one night while shift iris 12 year old child prostitute gets his cab attempting escape her pimp shocked by occurrence bickle fails drive off pimp sport reaches cab later seeing iris street he pays her time although he does not have sex with her instead tries convince her leave this way life behind but after her rejection as well travis decides take things into his own hands pow this is one most memorable movies all time has really stood its ground its personally one my favorites made me fall love with robert deniro all over again script taxi driver is just so incredibly powerful performances were just perfect jodie foster this little girl at time was such presence screen she pulls what was very tricky performance was hauntingly beautiful cybill sheppard was also very beautiful i was absolutely love with her character felt so bad her everything about taxi driver is just great i dont know how much i could go about love i have this film its film that you will never forget trust me if you havent seen it go out rent it immediately you wont regret it its bloody its twisted its crazy but its one best films all time 10 10,0.5590302374393284,0.08806982159254885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,A wonderfully engaging and convincing slide into a modern madness from a director and actor showing some of their best form,"Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl, Betsy, and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night, looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of.Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit; a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way, Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and, to a point, all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing ""society"" accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world.Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it, others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role, while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless, the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding.Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to ""do"" modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label.",wonderfully engaging convincing slide into modern madness director actor showing some their best form,travis bickle is vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night just ends up travelling around try use time effectively he becomes taxi driver things start look up him as he works nights slowly starts live little bit he meets girl betsy arranges see her few times despite fact that he is little bit out ordinary quality that seems interest her his connection night allows him see young prostitute iris being bullied by her pimp matthew he begins see his role perhaps save her him playing his part cleaning up sewer that he feels new york has become however when his view normal life puts betsy off him he starts retreat more more into night looking meaning his life growing more more outraged by world he is part hardly most uplifting films it is engaging impressive truly deserves reputation it has martin scorsese paul schrader have produced film that convincingly portrays man cut out society who has slightest connection normality before finding it eroded away script is brilliant because detail is engaging but it is this descent into very modern type madness that drives film forward travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy go along with rest his madness major part this is getting feeling right about living cesspit city that seems have forgotten its way morally new york is strongest example but elements it could be parts any city i suspect painting this world such real way scorsese has made travis all more convincing point all easier follow his fall like i said it is not film morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair there is no redemption this modern world although it appears that violence at end somehow redeems travis reality by showing society accepting his action it drags rest us down nearer world that he hates has become part i love king comedy same reason albeit different world scorsese injects real understanding place real sense foreboding into even earliest scenes he inserts clever meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight his choice scene shot compliments script is depicting travis descending into madness what makes film even better is de niro showing type form that makes his recent form such major disappointment he is outstanding as he moves travis being relatively normal being eaten up inside out his eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as gradual slide he depicts over course film although he dominates it others impress as well foster stands out small role while keitel makes good impression as pimp shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as others so it isnt all down her regardless film belongs de niro although quotable scenes are ones that are remembered it is quieter moments where he excels shows genuine talent understanding overall impressive morally depressing film that deserves its place cinematic history portrayal city man slipping into moral insanity is convincing engaging it shows how well do modern madness effects moral void parts society scorsese directs as master despite this being at early stage his career de niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates film quiet moments quotable moments alike i rarely use phrases like modern classic because i think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such label,0.5339155419743653,0.217642899584076,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Still has the power to shock...,"Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",still has power shock,not only one scorseses best films but one best 70s it is very hard hitting dark still has resonance power shock cinematography is measured chilly yet very atmospheric while bernard hermanns swansong score is superb yet more proof at how amazing composer he was story is unsettling but wonderfully told script is brilliantly written scorcese also directs impeccably while acting is just excellent robert deniro gives one his best performances whole film is worth watching just his performance thats how good it is but thats not dismiss jodie foster harvey keitel cybill sheppard supporting cast they are just as good while scorseses own cameo is genuinely frightening there you have it another one scorseses best with brilliant atmosphere mesmerising central performance 10 10 bethany cox,0.6020061728395062,0.41743827160493824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,"Disturbing, powerful, relevant, important","A towering classic of American cinematic power. Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation. Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world. Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film. He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones. The film fools you on a first viewing. Is Travis an endearing eccentric? Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor. His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing. But on a second view, you see it for what it is. The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift. This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot. To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially. Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed. With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show. The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches. What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)? Nothing at all. He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives. But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever. But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind. The story doesn't end when the credits roll. We know Travis will snap again. But the story doesn't end with Travis either. It continues today in the cities and in the schools. The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine, or Hawaii, or Seattle, or wherever you care to look, even with all of its disturbing images of violence. It didn't cause those things. It predicted them.",disturbing powerful relevant important,towering classic american cinematic power martin scorsese teams up with one most intense actors that time create masterpiece urban alienation paul schraders magnificent script paints portrait loneliness largest city world travis never once enters into meaningful relationship with any character anywhere film he is most hopelessly alone person ive ever encountered film he is alone with his thoughts his thoughts are dark ones film fools you first viewing is travis endearing eccentric sure hes odd but hes so polite hes got quirky sense humor his affection betsy is actually rather endearing but second view you see it what it is audience comes see traviss psychosis gradually but theres actually far less development than one might think when he talks about cleaning up city repeat viewer knows he doesnt mean some sort giuliani facelift this is less film about character development as it is kind snapshot be sure it takes stimulus provoke response but does that imply some kind central change character tremendous supporting roles are brought life through vivid performances by keitel foster especially shepards character betsy is little more than foil highlight traviss utter alienation society but she is still impeccably portrayed with only two scenes that dont center travis it is unavoidably de niros show life with which supporting cast imbues their characters is credit themselves directors willingness let film develop intersection diverse ideas approaches what would plot lose by eliminating albert brooks character tom nothing at all he makes almost no impact traviss life which is where plot lives but his inclusion makes film as whole much richer fuller as piece american cinema history this film will live forever but far more important than that this film will survive as universal ever relevant examination workings alienated mind story doesnt end when credits roll we know travis will snap again but story doesnt end with travis either it continues today cities schools film is about brutal power disaffected mind this film didnt cause incidents colombine or hawaii or seattle or wherever you care look even with all its disturbing images violence it didnt cause those things it predicted them,0.5697851153039832,0.1610634648370497,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Excellent,"A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5",excellent,lonely vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as taxi driver dirty streets new york where he encounters young prostitute who he tries help make difference this is very good film one martin scorsese best goodfellas being my fave excellent portrayal robert de niro as travis bickle cabbie good performances jodie foster as child prostitute iris steensman cybill shepherd peter boyle harvey keitel as pimp called sport you actually get drawn into isolation anger that travis is feeling towards these lowlifes because that you really feel sympathy him though after while loneliness city really starts haunt traviss mind causing violent instincts paranoia this film is filled with such memorable lines e g travis bickle you talking me well im only one here many powerful scenes that stay your head after its finished hypnotic cinematography is standout as if your seeing harsh gritty new york streets twisted people through eyes travis when he is driving his cab great screenplay stunning score by bernard herrmann superb atmosphere created this is brutally compelling bleak look at decaying corrupt society 70s unsettling gem film 5 5,0.6663360881542699,0.14190082644628096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,An incredibly dark thriller with an exceptional central performance,"Quite rightly regarded as one of the best films of all time, TAXI DRIVER is without a doubt compelling viewing. What the film lacks in plot it makes up for in characterisation: De Niro is with us from the start, we follow on his journey as he slides into extreme violence and becomes a vigilante. Although it's obvious that this man is disturbed from the very beginning - a man who considers pornography to be ""just another movie"", who is always at breaking point. You can't really blame him though. After all, his empty life is forever surrounded by people who don't deserve to live, who don't deserve to populate this planet, and nobody is doing anything about it. It's up to Bickle to do the dirty work himself. He is the new rain coming down on the streets to clear away all the garbage.Just about everyone involved here is extremely lucky in not putting a foot wrong. Martin Scorsese basks in his finest hour, even later classics like GOODFELLAS just can't hold a candle to match the intensity and complexity of this film. Check out the clever cameo where he plays a passenger spying on his cheating wife. The film focuses on De Niro's character, meaning that a lot of other roles are underwritten; Cybill Shepherd appears only fleetingly as a kind of idealistic fantasy figure. Jodie Foster excels as a child prostitute, hard and yet fragile at the same time, and Harvey Keitel is suitably slimy as a no-good pimp. In small roles are Peter Boyle and Joe Spinell. However it's De Niro who commands the screen, this is his film, we see things through his eyes. I don't think his quiet, brooding darkness here has ever been matched.There are countless moments to enjoy. Bickle talking to a 'secret service' man, a deliciously pleasant conversation full of deceit and lies; the infamous ad-libbed sequence in front of the mirror, where ""You talking' to me?"" became a classic movie quote; the almost tragic conversations with Iris. The ending itself is a shock, a total bloodbath made all the more horrific because the violence has been relatively tame up to then. Only three people are killed, but each shot and stabbed a number of times; fingers a blown off, necks spray blood, faces riddled with holes, heads splattering over walls. And then the ironic ending, where Bickle is revered as a hero instead of a cold-blooded killer; a more telling portrait of today's society there couldn't be. For a study of the reasons a person is driven to extreme violence, you couldn't do much better than this.",incredibly dark thriller with exceptional central performance,quite rightly regarded as one best films all time taxi driver is without doubt compelling viewing what film lacks plot it makes up characterisation de niro is with us start we follow his journey as he slides into extreme violence becomes vigilante although its obvious that this man is disturbed very beginning man who considers pornography be just another movie who is always at breaking point you cant really blame him though after all his empty life is forever surrounded by people who dont deserve live who dont deserve populate this planet nobody is doing anything about it its up bickle do dirty work himself he is new rain coming down streets clear away all garbage just about everyone involved here is extremely lucky not putting foot wrong martin scorsese basks his finest hour even later classics like goodfellas just cant hold candle match intensity complexity this film check out clever cameo where he plays passenger spying his cheating wife film focuses de niros character meaning that lot other roles are underwritten cybill shepherd appears only fleetingly as kind idealistic fantasy figure jodie foster excels as child prostitute hard yet fragile at same time harvey keitel is suitably slimy as no good pimp small roles are peter boyle joe spinell however its de niro who commands screen this is his film we see things through his eyes i dont think his quiet brooding darkness here has ever been matched there are countless moments enjoy bickle talking secret service man deliciously pleasant conversation full deceit lies infamous ad libbed sequence front mirror where you talking me became classic movie quote almost tragic conversations with iris ending itself is shock total bloodbath made all more horrific because violence has been relatively tame up then only three people are killed but each shot stabbed number times fingers blown off necks spray blood faces riddled with holes heads splattering over walls then ironic ending where bickle is revered as hero instead cold blooded killer more telling portrait todays society there couldnt be study reasons person is driven extreme violence you couldnt do much better than this,0.5837581352887474,0.03237182318814971,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Disturbing Look into a Disturbed Mind,"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab.

6.0,Did I Miss Something?,"Did I miss something or this movie doesn't have any purpose?Do people just call this a masterpiece just for the sake of it?I've seen old movies like Clockwork Orange that people consider ""weird"" and liked it and even find this one weirder than that! And the only reason I'm giving a 6 and not a 5 is because of De Niro's acting.With all the ""masterpiece"", ""such a great film"" ""revolutionary masterpiece of a film"" I heard about it I was expecting to be blown away by the story and dialogue, but there's near to no story here other than an incel's journey to being a hero!The dialogue is bafflingly bad and empty, I was expecting great dialogue from this one but it's just not there. Just go and watch the scene with Travis talking to the other taxi driver on the street and see what I mean. It's a 5 minute of nothing. The whole dialogue is ""well I mean.... It's just.... I mean.... well.... yeah.... you know..."".

10.0,Diary of a madman,"The script of ""Taxi Driver"" is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't, while violence accumulates inside him. One of those unnoticed people with dark things on their mind, one of those who break up the news one day with some extraordinary outburst of rage, to fall back immediately into anonymity.The gradual transformation of man into beast in this movie is chilling. It's still funny and pathetic when the hero threatens himself in front of the mirror (""you're talking to me?""), but when he comes out with a mohawk hairdo and dark glasses, it is obvious that nasty stuff is going to take place. As in ""A Clockwork Orange"", violence is recuperated by society depending on what purpose it is used for. Whereas he was about to murder the candidate for presidency, ""god's lonely man"" fails and instead kills a vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. The potential criminal becomes a hero for a day.Such stories happen everywhere of course, but it seems that the bewildering atmosphere of New York City's summer night was the best choice. ""Taxi Driver"" gives us a very realistic approach of New York, in a way that is not seen on screen so often, at least not anymore, whilst that city is probably the one in the world that has been filmed the biggest number of times.Most of the movie takes place at night. The credits open on the blazing lights of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly in the dark rainy streets. A kaleidoscope of neonlight appears through the dripping windows as the driver's eyes blink in the front mirror. The night is the hero's universe, it's the time when ""all the animals come out"", as he says. By contrast, the few daylight scenes look somewhat off-key, but this was definitely intentional.The final scene still appears today as extremely violent, but at least, it shows murder for what it is. Brutal, ugly, crude. It is something one tends to forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often that it gets casual. Real violence is not casual when you face it, and here is a film that makes you face it.The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema, like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released.Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character, but his presence on screen is so intense that it's no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster, she already appeared in films as a child, but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge, and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress.""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it came out, both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and served as a trend setter for many later films, like for instance Quentin Tarantino's and Abel Ferrara's. But even today, the original model seems difficult to emulate, probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing, by definition.",diary madman,script taxi driver is built like diary diary very ordinary guy who gets hired as night taxi driver back vietnam because he cant sleep at night very ordinary guy who tries break his isolation but cant while violence accumulates inside him one those unnoticed people with dark things their mind one those who break up news one day with some extraordinary outburst rage fall back immediately into anonymity gradual transformation man into beast this movie is chilling its still funny pathetic when hero threatens himself front mirror youre talking me but when he comes out with mohawk hairdo dark glasses it is obvious that nasty stuff is going take place as clockwork orange violence is recuperated by society depending what purpose it is used whereas he was about murder candidate presidency gods lonely man fails instead kills vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes potential criminal becomes hero day such stories happen everywhere course but it seems that bewildering atmosphere new york citys summer night was best choice taxi driver gives us very realistic approach new york way that is not seen screen so often at least not anymore whilst that city is probably one world that has been filmed biggest number times most movie takes place at night credits open blazing lights yellow taxi cab moving slowly dark rainy streets kaleidoscope neonlight appears through dripping windows as drivers eyes blink front mirror night is heros universe its time when all animals come out as he says by contrast few daylight scenes look somewhat off key but this was definitely intentional final scene still appears today as extremely violent but at least it shows murder what it is brutal ugly crude it is something one tends forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often that it gets casual real violence is not casual when you face it here is film that makes you face it directing is first class deservedly made path scorsese as world renowned artist some techniques he used here are unusual american cinema like focusing details few seconds movie is enhanced by excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer bernard herrman who died before picture was even released two actors also deservedly made it stardom robert de niro plays very unglamorous character but his presence screen is so intense that its no wonder it made such impression as jodie foster she already appeared films as child but playing teenage prostitute was certainly not easy challenge probably it was that role that really turned her into major actress taxi driver was big hit when it came out both public critics it won palme dor cannes served as trend setter many later films like instance quentin tarantinos abel ferraras but even today original model seems difficult emulate probably because achieving masterpiece is rare thing by definition,0.5582111436950148,-0.07066837732160312,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,"Best movie of the Seventies, and one of the greatest of all time.","So much has been written and talked about 'Taxi Driver' that it seems almost redundant to add anything more. But watching it again the other night for the nth time I was, as I have been every single time I've seen it, struck by just how perfect this movie is. It is as powerful and disturbing now as it was twenty-five years ago. It has not only NOT aged, it gets better and more relevant every year. This is without doubt a modern classic, and one of the handful of truly great, timeless movies.Scorsese and Schrader went on to make other great movies after this, both separately ('The King Of Comedy', 'Light Sleeper') and together ('Raging Bull', 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'), but this is easily the best movie of their careers. And Robert De Niro's too. He has yet to top his stunning performance here as the deeply disturbed and alienated Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, cabbie and would be assassin. This character has not surprisingly entered movie legend. Scorsese surrounds De Niro with a first rate supporting cast, including small but effective roles from Harvey Keitel ('Reservoir Dogs'), Peter Boyle ('Hardcore'), the underrated Victor Argo ('The King Of New York') and Joe Spinell ('Maniac'). Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster are also very good, and even Cybil Shepherd, the butt of many jokes, is fine as Bickle's obsession. When you combine these actors, Schrader's outstanding script, and Scorsese's brilliant direction, with the stunning cinematography (Michael Chapman) and haunting score (Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann's final effort), you have yourself a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' I urge you to do so immediately. It is a masterpiece, pure and simple.",best movie seventies one greatest all time,so much has been written talked about taxi driver that it seems almost redundant add anything more but watching it again other night nth time i was as i have been every single time ive seen it struck by just how perfect this movie is it is as powerful disturbing now as it was twenty five years ago it has not only not aged it gets better more relevant every year this is without doubt modern classic one handful truly great timeless movies scorsese schrader went make other great movies after this both separately king comedy light sleeper together raging bull last temptation christ but this is easily best movie their careers robert de niros too he has yet top his stunning performance here as deeply disturbed alienated vietnam veteran travis bickle cabbie would be assassin this character has not surprisingly entered movie legend scorsese surrounds de niro with first rate supporting cast including small but effective roles harvey keitel reservoir dogs peter boyle hardcore underrated victor argo king new york joe spinell maniac albert brooks jodie foster are also very good even cybil shepherd butt many jokes is fine as bickles obsession when you combine these actors schraders outstanding script scorseses brilliant direction with stunning cinematography michael chapman haunting score hitchcock fave bernard herrmanns final effort you have yourself truly unforgettable cinematic experience if you havent seen taxi driver i urge you do so immediately it is masterpiece pure simple,0.5601736521054703,0.32210350255804804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,A Masterpiece,"Taxi Driver (1976) **** (out of 4) Scorsese's masterpiece is a raw, powerful and nerve wrecking look at depression and loneliness. The film centers on taxi driver Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a man clearly with his own demons who finds a purpose in life when he meets a 12-year-old hooker (Jodie Foster) who he plans on saving from her pimp (Harvey Keitel). To me this is one of the richest films ever made and it's one that can easily be overlooked in some circles if you don't really connect to what the film is trying to say. I didn't care too much for the movie the first few times I watched it because I was too young to really understand depression and loneliness. After I understood what those things could do to a person is when I fully became aware of the power in this film and today it remains one of the most powerful films ever made. To me the entire film is pretty much about Travis trying to find someone to fit in with but of course it never really happens until he meets the hooker. He tries fitting in with the Cybill Shepherd character but falls flat on his face. He tries fitting in with his co-workers but that doesn't work out too well. No matter what Travis tries he keeps ending up alone and as he put it, he's God's lonely man. This film works on so many levels but I think the psychological one is where it's best at. Getting us into the mind of Travis works for many reasons but the biggest keys are the direction by Scorsese, the brilliant music score by Bernard Herrmann and DeNiro's groundbreaking performance. Putting those three things together is what makes this a classic but we can also throw in the screenplay by Paul Schrader, which rightfully gives the movie the time and patience to let the Travis character grow right in front of our eyes. DeNiro's performance is certainly one for the ages, although I think he would get even better with Scorsese's RAGING BULL, which would follow in four years. His performance here is nothing short of amazing because you can't help but be terrified by this guy because of the look in DeNiro's eyes. You can't help but feel sorry for him at the same time because there are countless moments where he embarrasses himself because he simply doesn't know how to fit in. The word anti-hero gets used a lot and perhaps that's a good term but I think it's something much deeper than that. DeNiro hits all the right marks without a false note anywhere. Foster is also impressive in her few scenes in the film as is Keitel as the pimp. Shepherd is also good as his Albert Brookes and the underrated Peter Boyle who has one of the best scenes in the movie where he's trying to talk some sense into Travis. The visual look of the film is mighty impressive and Scorsese's directing style is nothing short of amazing. The slimy looking streets and the dark atmosphere are one of a kind and something many films tried to copy but could never get it as perfect as it is here. This here remains one of the greatest American films ever made and I'm really not sure any movie could top it in showing the effects that loneliness can have on a person.",masterpiece,taxi driver 1976 out 4 scorseses masterpiece is raw powerful nerve wrecking look at depression loneliness film centers taxi driver travis bickle robert de niro man clearly with his own demons who finds purpose life when he meets 12 year old hooker jodie foster who he plans saving her pimp harvey keitel me this is one richest films ever made its one that can easily be overlooked some circles if you dont really connect what film is trying say i didnt care too much movie first few times i watched it because i was too young really understand depression loneliness after i understood what those things could do person is when i fully became aware power this film today it remains one most powerful films ever made me entire film is pretty much about travis trying find someone fit with but course it never really happens until he meets hooker he tries fitting with cybill shepherd character but falls flat his face he tries fitting with his co workers but that doesnt work out too well no matter what travis tries he keeps ending up alone as he put it hes gods lonely man this film works so many levels but i think psychological one is where its best at getting us into mind travis works many reasons but biggest keys are direction by scorsese brilliant music score by bernard herrmann deniros groundbreaking performance putting those three things together is what makes this classic but we can also throw screenplay by paul schrader which rightfully gives movie time patience let travis character grow right front our eyes deniros performance is certainly one ages although i think he would get even better with scorseses raging bull which would follow four years his performance here is nothing short amazing because you cant help but be terrified by this guy because look deniros eyes you cant help but feel sorry him at same time because there are countless moments where he embarrasses himself because he simply doesnt know how fit word anti hero gets used lot perhaps thats good term but i think its something much deeper than that deniro hits all right marks without false note anywhere foster is also impressive her few scenes film as is keitel as pimp shepherd is also good as his albert brookes underrated peter boyle who has one best scenes movie where hes trying talk some sense into travis visual look film is mighty impressive scorseses directing style is nothing short amazing slimy looking streets dark atmosphere are one kind something many films tried copy but could never get it as perfect as it is here this here remains one greatest american films ever made im really not sure any movie could top it showing effects that loneliness can have person,0.507688969017094,0.2731241414835165,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,A Descent Into Madness,"""Taxi Driver"" starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer, Bernard Hermann, as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to ""Raging Bull,"" and among the finest acting performances of all time. Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed, ""God's lonely man."" Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war, and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause: Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, ""So long."" As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war.",descent into madness,taxi driver starts off with beautiful perfectly fitting score composer bernard hermann as we see blurred city new york as fast paced lights cars signs are distorted put into slow motion taxi driver is one martin scorsese finest achievements as he teams up with robert de niro travis bickle de niro is title character acting as whole is exceptional harvey keitel has extremely small part as pimp named sport he brings forgettable character center stage keitel is so good this you wish you would get see more his character jodie foster plays prostitute under sports rule iris is 12 years old 14 year old actress at time foster deals with some heavy extremely adult material she handles it incredibly well keitel foster have scene together where sport holds her slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is have woman like her its utterly repulsive scene look his face mixed with calm safe look face iris is pretty disgusting its extremely well acted even though its pretty quick minor scene this one scene we see type control sport has over young impressionable child that he abuses takes advantage these are kinds things that set travis bickle off film is classic that dissects fallout one mans loneliness his thirst acceptance recognition notice editing is very good direction is great but its carried by magnificent script paul schrader great lead performance this probably stands as de niros second best work raging bull among finest acting performances all time travis bickle is self proclaimed gods lonely man bickle walks amongst people filthy crowded streets new york city wherever he goes he goes unnoticed like ghost meandering through lifes morbid boredom repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into next bickle suffers inability sleep so he goes porno theaters after 12 hour shifts his mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms pills abuses alcohol former vietnam veteran has damaged psyche that continues get worse worse as disgust lowlifes new york eat away at his consciences first act films starts with normal looking man with regular hair cut regular job irregular city we watch bickle go through everyday routines his work habit is main focus derive attention away his bloodlust we dont see much wrong with him other than some signs frustration restlessness he decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back his days as marine he meets up with gun dealer buys three pistols 44 magnum hes ready war table is set ending film is controversial its vagueness its inability state clear purpose reality or fantasy film strongly suggests dream like state as we watch with long running overhead shot possibly signifying bickles departure world carnage left bickles wake then theres music dream inducing state at end scene which is strongest hint towards dream like state what we do know is that travis bickle takes lives lowlifes degenerates scum earth hes treated as hero glorified by media his actions this is slap face media finding that vigilante did right thing because it was good cause kill 5 scumbags save 1 final scene film is also controversial we see betsy first time since their big fight shes no longer disgusted with travis now media has changed her opinion him too travis has reverted back same look he spouted first act film hes quiet reserved humble he looks harmless as ride home goes along we find out that palantine has won nomination after travis drops betsy off he leaves without taking her money with smile his face he gives her simple so long as travis drives off he menacingly looks back into mirror representing problem still exists then we fade back start film with symbolic scenes throughout film depicting bickles brooding boiling rage within symbolizing fact that nothing has changed near death experience doesnt cure him accolades media recognition everyday people doesnt make it any better hes still ready war,0.49039791749469175,0.08920937485453614,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10.0,An Unforgettable Movie and Lead Character,"""Travis Bickle"" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era ""noirs"" ever made.Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with ""cleaning up"" New York City.In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.Bickle's transformation from a ""disturbed"" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, ""You talking' to me?"" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes I'll never forget.The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film. Director Martin Scorcese has made a number of well-known (but not particularly box-office successful) films, and I still think this early effort of his was his best. He's never equaled it, although I think he and De Niro almost pulled it off five years later with another whacked-out character, ""Rupert Pupkin"" In ""The King Of Comedy.""

9.0,Explains What It`s Like To Be Male,"***** SPOILERS *****How would anyone be able to relate to Travis Bickle ? He`s a freak show , a fantasist and a loner who watches porn films in cinemas with a cola in one hand and a candy bar in another and to all intents and purposes is an assassin and a stalker , but he also strikes a cord with any man who`s been angry and young and rejected . He`s an outsider that society has turned its back on : "" Why won`t you talk to me "" is the heartbreaking question every young angry man screams at the world when he`s very alone Scorsese directs Paul Schrader`s low concept script on a shoestring budget - That`s not a criticism , quite the reverse because this leads to a hyper-realism and it`d be impossible to think that a major Hollywood studio would produce something like this nowadays where everything is about making money while playing it safe : A character study of a disturbed loner ? 12 year old prostitutes ? Vigilante executions ? Too controversial , not enough explosions , not enough CGI . If there`s a flaw in the screenplay it`s at the end where Travis wipes out the pimp business and becomes a hero which left me confused . Doesn`t society punish murderers even if they kill scum that use 12 year olds as prostitutes ? Even if he was cleared by the jury surely Travis would still have stood trial for murder ? but this is never referred to in the closing scenes , but I guess this is a comment on how society can quickly make a hero out of a villain and how a nobody can become the talk of the town , but still it seems to go against the grain of the script where we - Or at least the young males in the audience - recognise that an uncaring society is the villain where as Travis is the hero all along Despite the flawed ending of the screenplay ( Which is superb untill the last ten minutes ) this is still a movie masterpiece with Scorsese getting an acting tour de force from his cast . Jodie Foster as a child who sells her body on the streets of New York , a totally disturbing , brilliant performance , and DeNiro and Keitel in the same movie ! I`ve no idea if this is just hype but I heard all the stage schools in the USA were swamped at the time by applications from applicants in Compton , Hell`s Kitchen , South Central and The Bronx who`d seen DeNiro and Keitel in the "" I`m hip "" scene ( A scene that was totally adlibbed by the actors ) and decided that acting could be cool and macho after all . As I said I don`t know how true this is but the performances of these two actors has given a massive amount of credibility to the acting profession and it really is sad to see the DeNiro of today churn out so much garbage .

10.0,Notes from Above Ground.,"Somewhere in the shadows of the night, hidden within the restraints of his taxicab, a lonely man watches with disgust. His eyes survey the streets with all the malice and passion of a burning fire, his large pupils an open doorway leading into his soul. The demons haunt him; voices in his head convince him that the world is closing in and the only way out is through some form of moral redemption; a physical and emotional catharsis.The stranger's name is Travis Bickle and he is God's Lonely Man: a discharged Vietnam veteran who wanders the streets at night in a permanent state of confusion and self-loathing.Travis takes a job as a cab driver to keep out of the porn theaters that have been occupying his time  deciding he might as well get paid for roaming since he does it anyway.But Travis' filtered input and odd output seems to suggest something is dreadfully wrong. The mild insanity of our protagonist begins to escalate. He approaches an attractive political campaign adviser, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), and asks her out to dinner. She agrees, but the date is cut short when Travis takes her to an X-rated film.Travis soon meets a young underage prostitute named Iris (a fourteen-year-old Jodie Foster), whom he feels a desire  nay, a need -- to rescue from slavery. Iris' pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), becomes another of Travis' demons.Taxi Driver was released in 1976 to split praise. Some critics hailed it as a masterpiece, whilst others were a great deal more reserved in their accolade. In Newsweek, Jack Kroll wrote ""() in their eagerness to establish rich and moral ambiguities, the Catholic Scorsese and the Calvinist Schrader have flubbed their ending. It's meant to slay you with irony, but it's simply incredible."" Some critics just hated the film in general and felt the entire runtime was a mess of pretentious storytelling and depressing, gritty themes.Depressing? Yes. Gritty? Yes. Brilliant? Most definitely. Scorsese does not merely address Travis as a character; he puts us inside his head. And even so, there are instances of abnormality in Scorsese's camera work that suggest paranoia and schizophrenia; moments of displaced subjectivity in which we are neither looking quite through the eyes of Travis nor through those around him, but more at length to his sideyet it seems that his body (primarily his hands) are below us, at the side of the frame, indicating an altered version of the traditional P.O.V.Scorsese's movie is structured using diverse narrative elements  one of the most prominent being dramatic irony rooted in Greek tragedy (in this case, many set-up and pay-off moments). When Travis exits the brothel for the first time, a Mafioso figure says, ""Come back any time."" Travis responds, ""I will."" We know he will, too, and when he does, that's the pay-off.Above all else the film is rooted in the basic existentialism philosophies of Berdyaev, Heidegger and Nietzsche. Scorsese later admitted this his toying of genres and philosophy was entirely incidental (""It just felt right"") but one can't help but imagine Schrader may have been influenced by Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, in which our narrator begins, ""I am a sick manI am a spiteful man."" This brings to mind the scene in which Bickle dictates his journal entries to us and delivers an ultimatum to the ""filth"" on the streets, preceded by senseless introspective rambling.Moving on, the ultimate puzzle of the film: Does our hero live or die? After Travis is shot in the climactic battle, he lies on a sofa, presumably dying, and makes a gesture with his fingers, pretending to shoot himself in the head. The camera pulls up, overhead, and exits the brothel. It then pulls back across the street and up into the heavens, surveying the crowd below.In the next scene, Travis is alive and well, presented to the world as a hero through the media. Yet as Travis pulls away from the curb at the end of the film, Herrman's familiar four notes (the same ones as used for the final shot of Psycho, implemented when Norman Bates' lack of absolute sanity is finally revealed) come into play. A bell rings. Travis looks in his rearview mirror, as if maybe something caught his eye And then, suddenly, the movie ends.Taxi Driver's ending cannot be resolved further more than conjecture and opinion. Scorsese himself says on the DVD making-of documentary that he believes the ending is open for analysis. Did Travis live? Did he die? Are the demons on the street still haunting him? Are we meant to sympathize with him and believe he is a hero, or are we meant to refuse him as one? (Or is this our natural reaction against Scorsese's own wishes -- which would explain the negative reviews in '76?) But it is ultimately the haunting image of Bickle drifting through the endless hordes of nameless people on the streets of Manhattan that lingers with us after the film has ended, and remains the most prescient today. How effortlessly this man can disappear into the multitudes  God's Lonely Man once again alone, alienated and betrayed by the world he has come to loathe. That, above all else, is the most poignant aspect of Taxi Driver.",notes above ground,somewhere shadows night hidden within restraints his taxicab lonely man watches with disgust his eyes survey streets with all malice passion burning fire his large pupils open doorway leading into his soul demons haunt him voices his head convince him that world is closing only way out is through some form moral redemption physical emotional catharsis strangers name is travis bickle he is gods lonely man discharged vietnam veteran who wanders streets at night permanent state confusion self loathing travis takes job as cab driver keep out porn theaters that have been occupying his time deciding he might as well get paid roaming since he does it anyway but travis filtered input odd output seems suggest something is dreadfully wrong mild insanity our protagonist begins escalate he approaches attractive political campaign adviser betsy cybill shepherd asks her out dinner she agrees but date is cut short when travis takes her x rated film travis soon meets young underage prostitute named iris fourteen year old jodie foster whom he feels desire nay need rescue slavery iris pimp sport harvey keitel becomes another travis demons taxi driver was released 1976 split praise some critics hailed it as masterpiece whilst others were great deal more reserved their accolade newsweek jack kroll wrote their eagerness establish rich moral ambiguities catholic scorsese calvinist schrader have flubbed their ending its meant slay you with irony but its simply incredible some critics just hated film general felt entire runtime was mess pretentious storytelling depressing gritty themes depressing yes gritty yes brilliant most definitely scorsese does not merely address travis as character he puts us inside his head even so there are instances abnormality scorseses camera work that suggest paranoia schizophrenia moments displaced subjectivity which we are neither looking quite through eyes travis nor through those around him but more at length his side yet it seems that his body primarily his hands are below us at side frame indicating altered version traditional p o v scorseses movie is structured using diverse narrative elements one most prominent being dramatic irony rooted greek tragedy this case many set up pay off moments when travis exits brothel first time mafioso figure says come back any time travis responds i will we know he will too when he does thats pay off above all else film is rooted basic existentialism philosophies berdyaev heidegger nietzsche scorsese later admitted this his toying genres philosophy was entirely incidental it just felt right but one cant help but imagine schrader may have been influenced by fyodor dostoevskys notes underground which our narrator begins i am sick man i am spiteful man this brings mind scene which bickle dictates his journal entries us delivers ultimatum filth streets preceded by senseless introspective rambling moving ultimate puzzle film does our hero live or die after travis is shot climactic battle he lies sofa presumably dying makes gesture with his fingers pretending shoot himself head camera pulls up overhead exits brothel it then pulls back across street up into heavens surveying crowd below next scene travis is alive well presented world as hero through media yet as travis pulls away curb at end film herrmans familiar four notes same ones as used final shot psycho implemented when norman bates lack absolute sanity is finally revealed come into play bell rings travis looks his rearview mirror as if maybe something caught his eye then suddenly movie ends taxi drivers ending cannot be resolved further more than conjecture opinion scorsese himself says dvd making documentary that he believes ending is open analysis did travis live did he die are demons street still haunting him are we meant sympathize with him believe he is hero or are we meant refuse him as one or is this our natural reaction against scorseses own wishes which would explain negative reviews 76 but it is ultimately haunting image bickle drifting through endless hordes nameless people streets manhattan that lingers with us after film has ended remains most prescient today how effortlessly this man can disappear into multitudes gods lonely man once again alone alienated betrayed by world he has come loathe that above all else is most poignant aspect taxi driver,0.5161228689006466,0.0756186200630645,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,Gut Wrenching,"It's interesting to read the reviews by people who really disliked this film. Can we dislike virtually every character in a movie and yet keep watching it, even respect it? I don't have a definitive answer to this, but I was captivated by this film. I get this feeling every time I see films that glorify organized crime. DeNiro's performance so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. Contrary to the critics, his every expression reveals his skill as an actor. While his motivations are confusing, they are his motives. He is an unbalanced war survivor who can't tolerate the cesspool the world has become. I mean, ""What did I fight for?"" His social skills are wasted. When he goes on the date, it's one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever spent in a theater. The efforts to save a small part of his world is met with disdain and resistance. So he flips out and decides to clean it up himself. He is suspicious of politicians and authority figures. He becomes his own man and takes matters into his own hands. The key thing is that he is true to himself and even though he is a frightening figure, he gets his way. I guess most think he should have been killed. That's not a valid criticism.

10.0,A Shattering Tale In First Person Singular,"The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on the contrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions. Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does.",shattering tale first person singular,impact that taxi driver had its day hasnt diminished contrary it has acquired relevance shakesperean proportions traviss loneliness is hyper representation same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times different measures it is always associated with nightmare martin scorsese delivers it like nightmare travis possessed by robert de niro at zenith his powers cruises his taxi enveloped bernard herrman we well were passengers everything looks terrifying familiar at same time paul schrader sensational screenplay comes life with jolting force rude awakening like it happens more often than not with masterpieces it signed rather direct way lives ones who live it movie theater ones who made it scorsese being giant that he is survived it will continue startling us im sure but i also bet that years everything he did was compared this movie de niro his you looking at me became such iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it jodie foster awoke insane devotion real life would be killer new york greatest city world was shown with its underbelly up work art superlative reminder what film could actually give us very rarely does,0.5837373737373739,0.13017575757575758,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,"""Here is a man who would not take it anymore"".","In a calculated exercise, I watched ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"" back to back today. Two classics, and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time. Personally, I think Bull was the better showcase for both De Niro and director Scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts. In terms of favorites, that might be a moot point, as both are darkly disturbing and violent films, with main characters that aren't particularly honorable, much less likable.Indeed, both characters, the fictional Travis Bickle and the real life Jake La Motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms of mental illness. La Motta's brand of violence was legal inside the ring, what he carried into his personal life resulted in a lifetime of unintended consequences. The outcomes of fictional characters can be manipulated to suit the priority of the writer or director, so in the case of ""Taxi Driver"", the protagonist winds up as sort of a hero, at least to the parents of twelve year old hooker Iris. I'm not sure if the point of the film had anything to do with showing how one's life can turn on a second's notice or not. However when Bickle's assassination attempt on Palantine (Leonard Harris) was foiled, the succeeding events could have led to his own demise. Instead he's reborn, sort of. One could sequel the story after Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) gets a cab ride from Travis at the end of the picture, but it's probably better left to the viewer's imagination.A tiny detail caught my eye in both pictures today which I'm sure I would never have considered had I seen them days or weeks apart. In the carnage of the shootout scene, when the cops make their presence in the doorway of the rented room, Bickle puts a bloody finger to his head simulating a gunshot, and two drops of blood drip from his finger. Scorsese used the same device again in ""Raging Bull"", when Jake La Motta is badly bloodied in his final fight against Sugar Ray Robinson. As the boxer sags against the ring ropes, the camera focuses on the top rope a few inches away from La Motta's outstretched arm. Two drops of blood fall from the rope to the canvas to further intensify La Motta's defeat. At the time, I couldn't say why I found that to be so fascinating, but now I do.",here is man who would not take it anymore,calculated exercise i watched raging bull taxi driver back back today two classics two films generally recognized by critics fans be among best all time personally i think bull was better showcase both de niro director scorsese as four years between films allowed both improve their respective crafts terms favorites that might be moot point as both are darkly disturbing violent films with main characters that arent particularly honorable much less likable indeed both characters fictional travis bickle real life jake la motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms mental illness la mottas brand violence was legal inside ring what he carried into his personal life resulted lifetime unintended consequences outcomes fictional characters can be manipulated suit priority writer or director so case taxi driver protagonist winds up as sort hero at least parents twelve year old hooker iris im not sure if point film had anything do with showing how ones life can turn seconds notice or not however when bickles assassination attempt palantine leonard harris was foiled succeeding events could have led his own demise instead hes reborn sort one could sequel story after betsy cybil shepherd gets cab ride travis at end picture but its probably better left viewers imagination tiny detail caught my eye both pictures today which im sure i would never have considered had i seen them days or weeks apart carnage shootout scene when cops make their presence doorway rented room bickle puts bloody finger his head simulating gunshot two drops blood drip his finger scorsese used same device again raging bull when jake la motta is badly bloodied his final fight against sugar ray robinson as boxer sags against ring ropes camera focuses top rope few inches away la mottas outstretched arm two drops blood fall rope canvas further intensify la mottas defeat at time i couldnt say why i found that be so fascinating but now i do,0.4320216049382716,0.05185185185185185,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,An individual's fight- against loneliness and for justice.,"""Taxi Driver"" is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way, in the hectic and dangerous New York of the '70's. He already isn't a stable person to begin with (he's a Vietnam veteran) but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea's of society and the world, he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands.Beauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie. The story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.The movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.The entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous 'You talking' to me?' sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression.It's still a movie that applies today, after 30 years now. Because lets face it, what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes ""Taxi Driver"" a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the 'classic'-status.

4.0,Still don't get it?,"Just forced myself to watch this film again for the third time thinking maybe I had some Natural Born Killer prejudice against this movie, which I kicked, but after painfully sitting through this thing again for the last time all I can say is I'm tired, depressed, and befuddled at the high praise for this darkly disturbing film. Or maybe that's the alure for some people. If you look at the votes for this thing people either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent. The problem I have with Taxi Driver is that there are too many unanswered questions about Travis' background, experience in the Marine Corp, etc. We know he was discharged while Vietnam was winding down but we don't have a clue what the source of his ""instability"" is! Are we to assume that he had suffered some sort of trauma during the war...did he ever see any action...was he really discharged because of his instability? In fact, the guy seems perfectly normal other than a slightly obsessive compulsive complex which 70% of society is sporting, and he can't sleep. Awwww, poor thing. Well neither can I, and a lot of people can't sleep at nights. Does that alone make Travis a candidate for the nuthouse? Nope. The truth is, we don't know what his problems stem from and that is a major problem with this movie. His descent is so spontaneous when Betsy reacts about being dragged to an adult film, and he just snaps, we don't know why?!? (spoiler alert) Next thing you know the guy is buying guns like there's no tomorrow to feed his all-of-a-sudden John Wayne complex that springs from a source we can't as an audience connect with. Good performances overall don't salvage the many holes that litter the canvas of this highly overrated drama.
