10.0,One of the most intelligent movies ever made about gangsters,"SATYA stands out from the normal Bollywood romance fair, being a rather dark and gritty look at the crime underworld of Mumbai. The movie follows the fortunes of a guy called Satya (lit: ""Truth"") in the underworld, and the subtle script explores the theme with a lot of depth.Satya himself is a wonderful character, one of my favourite screen characters ever in fact. Part of this is due to his fantastic beard, but the depth and humanity his character and the performance of J.D.Chakravarti have contribute a lot too.The script and direction of SATYA show a sharpness that cuts to the core of its subject matter in a way that the song and dance routines of the blockbuster movies from any country do. The 3 hour running time allows it to develop and nurture its themes very thoroughly. The result is one of the most palpably intelligent movies ever made about gangsters.This is no romanticised ""cool of the killer"" type movie, it's a pretty honest and thought provoking look at a lifestyle that hopefully nobody reading this has direct involvement with.Strong recommendation to see!",one most intelligent movies ever made about gangsters,satya stands out normal bollywood romance fair being rather dark gritty look at crime underworld mumbai movie follows fortunes guy called satya lit truth underworld subtle script explores theme with lot depth satya himself is wonderful character one my favourite screen characters ever fact part this is due his fantastic beard but depth humanity his character performance j d chakravarti have contribute lot too script direction satya show sharpness that cuts core its subject matter way that song dance routines blockbuster movies any country do 3 hour running time allows it develop nurture its themes very thoroughly result is one most palpably intelligent movies ever made about gangsters this is no romanticised cool killer type movie its pretty honest thought provoking look at lifestyle that hopefully nobody reading this has direct involvement with strong recommendation see,0.662719298245614,0.3162280701754386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,A piece of art by the master,"Satya is a realistic drama which tells the story of its title character, a simple orphaned guy who tries to live life honestly and make a fair living, but is unable to. Only when he enters the underworld, the most dangerous and seemingly dreadful place, does he find financial success, friendship and love. But when he tries to run away and return to his previous simple world, he finds out that all doors are closed for him. Satya is a film that brings very distinct points to its subject matter in comparison to previous films dealing with similar themes. The film is not about underworld. It's about a guy who finds himself trapped in the world of mafia. It's about the pluses and minuses of being involved in such a terrible world. The film is very authentic, and everything in it, from cinematography to music, contributes to this style almost perfectly. The characters are all simple and easy to relate to, they all have dreams of a better life. The story of each character is presented through the eyes of Satya in a minute and unique way.Satya has been blamed for depicting Mumbai as a dirty city of crime, terror and violence. Ram Gopal Varma has also been accused of trying to glorify the mafia. But this view is according to me incorrect; the film clearly shows that anyone who enters this world will end up living under constant threat for his life and eventually find himself killed in the most dire of circumstances. The success, the friendship, the love the film's hero finds, all of it is lost in one unfortunate chain of tragic incidents: the death of his friends, the rejection of his girlfriend, and ultimately his own defeat. That's the result and that's what Varma probably tried to convey. Obviously the hero is portrayed as a good human being and you feel for his ill-fate, but that's to be expected. It's of course partly his own fault, but it's mainly a situation created by circumstances.The acting is terrific. The most sincere performance is that of Manoj Bajpai, who is simply outstanding. He paid attention to both the dark and the bright sides of his character. Urmila Matondkar sheds her well-known image and transforms into a simple dreamy girl in this film. She lets go of her sex appeal and intensity and skillfully creates a sensitive young woman who believes that a better life does exist. An out-and-out excellent performance. Shefali Shah has an extremely small role with little importance. Yet, she is flawless in every possible scene and makes the best of what she is given, which is commendable. The only actor who is not as emotionally convincing is ironically the main protagonist, played by J.D Chakravarthy. He is average in everything he does and was not really a great choice for the part. Satya, while not a film that works for everyone, is an extraordinary film and one of the greatest from its genre.

10.0,CRIME NEVER PAYS,"Ramgopal Varma's hard hitting film on the Bombay Underworld. This movie is a classic from scene one to the climax. When you see this movie you will see history in the making. A hard hitting story of a person from nowhere , Satya. How he joins the underworld gang led by bhiku mhatre. This movie gives one message hard ""CRIME NEVER PAYS"".The scene where chander(snehal dabi) tells a joke, the scene where bhiku mhatre satya vidya and pyaari go for a dinner, the scene where yedda scares the music director romu sagar, the theatre scene, the climax, all these scenes will go down in the history of indian cinema as classic scenes. Urmila Matondkar as Satya's Girlfriend and Shefali Chaaya as bhiku mhatre's wife are excellent. J.D.Chakravarthi is brilliant as Satya. Manoj Bajpai gives an excellent and award winning performance as bhiku mhatre.He has managed to make the character of bhiku mhatre an immortal one like late amjad khan did for gabbar singh. Govind Namdeo is brilliant as Bhau. Co-script writer saurabh shukla is superb as kallu mama.It is so nice to see that first time writers saurabh shukla & anurag kashyap wrote such a brilliant script. A special mention must be made of the best cameo since rajesh khanna's cameo in andaz, by paresh raawal as commissioner of police.Satya was supposed to be made as a songless film but co-producer Bharat Shah felt that no distributor will buy the film and it will be too tense. Music director Vishal Bharadwaj and lyricist Gulzar were roped in to provide the music for this film and they did a brilliant work. The song ""Sapne Main milti hai"" and ""kallu mamma"" are too good.

8.0,The one truly great Hindi film of the 1990s,"I am not a big fan of Hindi films - infact I'm not a fan of commercial Hindi films at all. But then there's Satya, Ram Gopal Varma's classic 1998 Indian mafia fan is brilliant, innovative and despite certain directorial flaws is nonetheless so vastly different from the run of the mill Hindi films (ie. 99% of Hindi films) that it is unforgettable. It is 175 minutes long, the typical duration, but it grabs you instantaneously as you follow the journey of Satya who comes to Mumbai to make a life for himself.Before getting into a long winded review, I shall just point out a few plusses and minuses of this great movie. The minuses are minor and are nothing compared to the mishaps in a normal hindi film.Plusses: - Manoj Bajpai, Manoj Bajpai and lastly, Manoj Bajpai. This is probably the single best acting performance by an Indian in the 90s. The realism and flawlessness he brings to the role is amazing. He does to go a bit over the top, but without losing any of his characters identity (hell, Pacino has been doing it for years now). - The rest of the cast. Urmila is incredibly refreshing as the innocent girl next door with the usual handicapped Dad and perennially miserable Mom. Saurabh Shukla as Kalu Mama is brilliant and comes quite close to Bajpai performance-wise. The realism he brings is equally breathtaking. Just seeing the scene where he, Bajpai and Govind Namdeo (Bhau) literally makes you a member of the gang, standing there and smiling along with them. - The plot is largely excellent. - (see weakness #2) Golimaar and Sapne Me are hilarious musical numbersNow for two minor flaws: - Ram Gopal Varma's directorial synchronization of music and plot is often out of sync. A classic example is during the scene after the gangland shootout (when Kalumama first sees Vidya and Satya). There are certain other flaws as well in his direction as well. - Barring numbers from classic Hindi films (known for their music), I have never been even a remote fan of Hindi film singing and dancing. I feel three out of five songs in this movie are totally unnecessary and I would've enjoyed an ""all-out"" realistic film for a change w/o any songs. Having said that, the film is all the more memorable due to the two main numbers: Goli Maar and Sapne me milti hai - mainly due to Bhiku's gang and their histrionics.All in all a refreshing Hindi film that made me a part of the main gang for the three hour duration and left me wanting more. I hope this inspires a revival of GOOD hindi films as was in the late 70s and early 80s.",one truly great hindi film 1990s,i am not big fan hindi films infact im not fan commercial hindi films at all but then theres satya ram gopal varmas classic 1998 indian mafia fan is brilliant innovative despite certain directorial flaws is nonetheless so vastly different run mill hindi films ie 99 hindi films that it is unforgettable it is 175 minutes long typical duration but it grabs you instantaneously as you follow journey satya who comes mumbai make life himself before getting into long winded review i shall just point out few plusses minuses this great movie minuses are minor are nothing compared mishaps normal hindi film plusses manoj bajpai manoj bajpai lastly manoj bajpai this is probably single best acting performance by indian 90s realism flawlessness he brings role is amazing he does go bit over top but without losing any his characters identity hell pacino has been doing it years now rest cast urmila is incredibly refreshing as innocent girl next door with usual handicapped dad perennially miserable mom saurabh shukla as kalu mama is brilliant comes quite close bajpai performance wise realism he brings is equally breathtaking just seeing scene where he bajpai govind namdeo bhau literally makes you member gang standing there smiling along with them plot is largely excellent see weakness golimaar sapne me are hilarious musical numbersnow two minor flaws ram gopal varmas directorial synchronization music plot is often out sync classic example is during scene after gangland shootout when kalumama first sees vidya satya there are certain other flaws as well his direction as well barring numbers classic hindi films known their music i have never been even remote fan hindi film singing dancing i feel three out five songs this movie are totally unnecessary i wouldve enjoyed all out realistic film change w o any songs having said that film is all more memorable due two main numbers goli maar sapne me milti hai mainly due bhikus gang their histrionics all all refreshing hindi film that made me part main gang three hour duration left me wanting more i hope this inspires revival good hindi films as was late 70s early 80s,0.5069480519480519,0.23755411255411243,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,"Without a doubt, the best Indian film ever made.","Now, this is what I call a great film. 'Satya' is no highly-stylized, cool-guy-with-a-gun gangster film but a gritty, honest portrayal of a man who is dragged into a life of crime.The movie starts outside a crowded station when a young man named Satya (J.D. Chakravarthy) comes to Mumbai in search of a job. Living in a small slum, he finds a petty job soon. But his life is turned upside down when he gets into trouble with the egoistic local goon who beats him up and throws him into jail where he is charged for a crime he did not commit. There, he meets the psychotic gangster Bhiku Mhatre (Manoj Bajpai) who agrees to help him avenge his humiliation in a bid to get rid of his own enemies.One of the primary reasons why 'Satya' works is that Ram Gopal Varma is not scared to take risks. He doesn't try too hard to make the audience feel sympathy for the characters. The film does not boast of picturesque locations and you're glad that it doesn't, because it makes the viewing even more meaningful. Varma masterfully toys with the script in a way that every dialog and nuance falls perfectly into place. J.D. Chakravarthy, who plays the lead role, turns in a convincing performance and so does Urmila Matondkar who plays his love interest in the film. The performances of the rest of the cast are worth bragging about but the real star of the film is Manoj Bajpai. I would happily single out his performance as one of the best I've seen and he deservedly won a National award for it. The screenplay, jointly written by Saurabh Shukla and Anurag Kashyap is pitch-perfect, because they have a wonderful ear for the local lingo. Gerard Hooper's and Mazhar Kamran's stark cinematography is an absolute wow, adding to an already long list of the film's positives.If I have to criticize 'Satya' for something, it would be the timing of the songs. I feel that the film could've done without the songs, but then, the film is so near-perfect that you tend to not pay attention to the film's negatives.For me, 'Satya' will always remain the greatest Indian film ever made. The film's depiction of a desperate man struggling to make an honest living but failing to do so is so realistic that it terrifies you. It defies every single rule on how to make a perfect Bollywood-style film. Grab a DVD and watch it.

8.0,"Bloody, tough and well worth seeing.","This is one of those films where I wish I really understood the language. That's because although the captioning is decent, for some inexplicable reason, the songs are NOT! I said songs because that is one of those quirky things about Indian movies--the ones made during the last few decades all seem to have song and dance numbers--even a gangster movie like ""Satya"". Is this always the case? I dunno--you'll have to ask some Indians or experts on the films if this is the case. I do know that older Indian films often don't have singing, as the Satyajit Ray and Merchant-Ivory films I have seen are song-free. But here, in a film that is gritty and violent you STILL have the obligatory musical numbers. I like them and have learned to expect them...but really wish I could have understood them.Satya is new to Mumbai (Bombay). However, he soon finds himself face to face with a gangster with an attitude. Satya is very proud and a bit foolish and does not handle it well--and eventually gets beaten for not showing the thug proper deference. Later, he meets up with the gangster again and Satya tries to kill him--and once again, he's beaten. He's also set up for a crime he didn't do and is sent to prison. In prison, he continues to have an attitude--like a lone wolf. Soon, he finds himself standing up to another gangster and this time Satya is able to hold his own. Because he's so fearless (and a bit crazy) he's earned the respect of the gang in prison and they arrange for his release--and for a job in their mob. Throughout all this, Satya is VERY emotionally constricted and bright and soon works his way further and further up the ranks.Although Satya is a bad man, so far in the film he's confined all his killing to bad guys from other mobs. He also has fallen for a nice young lady--and he manages, at least for a while, to keep these two lives separate--the thug and the respectable lover. The two worlds collide, however, when he and his friends decide to 'help' her in her musical career--using threats to convince a record producer to giver her a record contract--though she has no idea that this is occurring. Will they fall in love? Will Satya be able to balance his two lives or will he be forced to choose a life or crime or a life of love and respectability? Tune in and see for yourself in this gangster love story--a combination of genres you certainly won't find here in the States.Overall, this is a very gritty and realistic film. Now I am not saying it's perfect. The Satya character seemed way too non-emotive to me--almost zombie-like. And, while song and dance numbers are a sweet addition to Indian films, they just seemed out of place here and distracted from an otherwise intense and adult story. But, apart from these minor problems, the film was very well done...and quite bloody. I liked how Satya and his friends were NOT likable or over-glamorized. Well worth seeing but not a film for younger audiences or people who will be put off by the realistic gore.By the way, since I am not an Indian I really have no idea how realistic all this is.

7.0,Jijamata Park,"Being left breathless after seeing Ram Gopal Verma's astonishing Giallo- style Thriller Kaun?,I decided to take a quick look at the directors IMDb and Wiki page.Comparing both of the pages,one of the first things that I noticed right away was that a Gangster film of his called ""Satya"" seemed to be held up as one of Verma's most praised movie on both sites.Reading some more intriguing info on various boards,led to me getting set to come face to face with one of Bollywood's most famous gangsters.The plot:Finding himself in Mumbai without a penny in his pocket,Satya quickly gets in trouble with some of Mumbai's iron-fist underground rulers.Getting confrontational with one person too many,Satya ends up being sent to jail.Desperate to make his time in the slammer pass by in anyway possible,Satya starts to become friends with a group of gangsters who have been arrested for assassinating a film director.Wanting Saya to prove his loyalty,the gangsters arrange for him to get an early release,so that he can kill the man who put them all behind bars.Committing the murder,Satya is officially made a member of the gang,and given a small flat,Where he runs into a girl called Vidya (played by a charming Urmila Matondkar),who quickly starts to pull on his heart strings.Quickly rising through the ranks of the under world,Satya becomes an in separable solider for his increasingly ruthless gang,as other rivals start to wage attacks on ""their land"",and the police begin to contemplate making the dreaded decision of ""crossing the line"" head on.View on the film.Using the brilliant on location filming to give Satya a rawness that would be almost impossible to reproduce in a studio,Verma takes his gangsters as far from any glamour as he possibly can,with the film being covered in the grit that all the characters are desperately trying to pull themselves out from.For the scenes showing the power and violence of the gangsters,Verma uses elegantly handled,long tracking shots to show the friendship developing between Satya and the others in run down prisons and nightclubs.Impressivly moving away from elegance,Verma makes the violence something which is brilliantly brutal,fast and extremely aggressive.As an interesting comparison to how the violence is shown,Verma makes most of the gruesome deaths that happen in buildings occur on around the corners of the screen, so that the viewer is left with a strong imprint for which to form their own ideas on how ruthless the killings actually were.Going in the opposite direction,Verma makes the stunning outdoor killing scenes almost feel as if they are coming from a war zone!,thanks to having the camera scatter- shooting round and always feeling like it is at the front of the turf war battle lines.Whilst Verma's terrific directing and the tremendous performances from the whole cast (with J.D. Chakravathy giving an excellent performance as the title character,who always seems to have something mysterious lurking behind his eyes) giving this great movie a strong feeling of urgency.The screenplay by Anurag Kashyap and Saurabh Shukla disappointingly dilutes some of the films rawness,by focusing less on some of the most interesting aspects of the story, (such as the police force having to decay from within in order to tackle the gangs)to instead focus on the growling love that Satya has for Vidya,which whist well performed by both actors,just feels out of place in an otherwise terrifically raw and tough Gangster movie.",jijamata park,being left breathless after seeing ram gopal vermas astonishing giallo style thriller kaun i decided take quick look at directors imdb wiki page comparing both pages one first things that i noticed right away was that gangster film his called satya seemed be held up as one vermas most praised movie both sites reading some more intriguing info various boards led me getting set come face face with one bollywoods most famous gangsters plot finding himself mumbai without penny his pocket satya quickly gets trouble with some mumbais iron fist underground rulers getting confrontational with one person too many satya ends up being sent jail desperate make his time slammer pass by anyway possible satya starts become friends with group gangsters who have been arrested assassinating film director wanting saya prove his loyalty gangsters arrange him get early release so that he can kill man who put them all behind bars committing murder satya is officially made member gang given small flat where he runs into girl called vidya played by charming urmila matondkar who quickly starts pull his heart strings quickly rising through ranks under world satya becomes separable solider his increasingly ruthless gang as other rivals start wage attacks their land police begin contemplate making dreaded decision crossing line head view film using brilliant location filming give satya rawness that would be almost impossible reproduce studio verma takes his gangsters as far any glamour as he possibly can with film being covered grit that all characters are desperately trying pull themselves out scenes showing power violence gangsters verma uses elegantly handled long tracking shots show friendship developing between satya others run down prisons nightclubs impressivly moving away elegance verma makes violence something which is brilliantly brutal fast extremely aggressive as interesting comparison how violence is shown verma makes most gruesome deaths that happen buildings occur around corners screen so that viewer is left with strong imprint which form their own ideas how ruthless killings actually were going opposite direction verma makes stunning outdoor killing scenes almost feel as if they are coming war zone thanks having camera scatter shooting round always feeling like it is at front turf war battle lines whilst vermas terrific directing tremendous performances whole cast with j d chakravathy giving excellent performance as title character who always seems have something mysterious lurking behind his eyes giving this great movie strong feeling urgency screenplay by anurag kashyap saurabh shukla disappointingly dilutes some films rawness by focusing less some most interesting aspects story such as police force having decay within order tackle gangs instead focus growling love that satya has vidya which whist well performed by both actors just feels out place otherwise terrifically raw tough gangster movie,0.62055602517141,0.08477693246924017,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,"Rivals and outdoes ""The Godfather""","I've been newly introduced to Indian film, so I'm no expert. But clearly it is more than just Bollywood. Viewing ""Satya,"" after previously seeing another film by Ram Gopal Varma, ""Company,"" I would have to say that Varma is one of the greatest filmmakers now working. With these two movies that are deft, unsentimental, and at the same time not hard-boiled, he seems to add something unique to the gangster genre: the emotionally rounded portrait of the gangster, the gangster inside-out. Unlike American gangster movies of the 30s, which ""Satya"" and ""Company"" remind me of somewhat, Varma's movies are more philosophically ambitious and do something more difficult: they manage to be moral without moralizing. And differently than Coppola's ""Godfather"" trilogy, where people seem born into a life of crime, Varma shows them becoming criminals and the results of the choices they've made. I should also say, from the point of view of entertainment, Varma's films are riveting and earn every second of their ""Bollywood"" length. They do not have unnecessary ""filler."" Even the de riguer musical numbers ""work"" and have arrangements and choreography you could imagine on a hip New York stage. If it hasn't already happened, Varma is ready to be discovered by the festival circuit. I myself am ordering everything I can find by him on DVD and can't wait to check out his other work.

,India's Greatest Gangster Film of All Time,"It doesn't get better than this. Innovative, Groundbreaking, Unforgettable, Intense, Realistic & completely different from standard Bollywood films. Satya is RGV's best & most matured effort, along with Company. Riding on smart direction by Ram Gopal Varma, taut script by Anurag Kashyap (Black Friday, Dev D) and Saurabh Shukla, brilliant camera-work, great performances & an exceptional background score by Sandeep Chowta, Satya, even today, remains the standard by which all Bollywood Gangster films are measured.It is a crime drama which tells the story of Satya, an immigrant who comes to Mumbai seeking his fortune but instead gets sucked into the Mumbai underworld. The movie goes deep in exploring the lifestyle of criminals & gangsters.. & exposes it too.But the highlight of this film was Manoj Bajpai. His performance as Bhiku Mhatre is truly the best performance in Bollywood in the 90s. He stole the limelight, every time he appeared on screen. The only thing that didn't seem important were the unwanted songs. Except Goli Maar n Sapney Mein, which looked great because of brilliant choreography, the other songs could've been avoided.The background music, composed by Sandeep Chowta is simply brilliant, the first film that treated soundtrack as an important feature in Hindi films. Its intense, its haunting, its horror... succeeding in taking the viewer into the mind of the character, working completely parallel to the film's mood, contradicting what the audience is watching & contributing a lot to the film's success.Satya & Company will always be remembered as the greatest gangster films in Bollywood history. Which one is better, its up to the viewers to decide. For me, Its Satya (minus its 3 unwanted songs) all the way.. Company follows closely.Strongly Recommended.If you don't want to watch it, then ""Goli Maar Bheje Mein"".",indias greatest gangster film all time,it doesnt get better than this innovative groundbreaking unforgettable intense realistic completely different standard bollywood films satya is rgvs best most matured effort along with company riding smart direction by ram gopal varma taut script by anurag kashyap black friday dev d saurabh shukla brilliant camera work great performances exceptional background score by sandeep chowta satya even today remains standard by which all bollywood gangster films are measured it is crime drama which tells story satya immigrant who comes mumbai seeking his fortune but instead gets sucked into mumbai underworld movie goes deep exploring lifestyle criminals gangsters exposes it too but highlight this film was manoj bajpai his performance as bhiku mhatre is truly best performance bollywood 90s he stole limelight every time he appeared screen only thing that didnt seem important were unwanted songs except goli maar n sapney mein which looked great because brilliant choreography other songs couldve been avoided background music composed by sandeep chowta is simply brilliant first film that treated soundtrack as important feature hindi films its intense its haunting its horror succeeding taking viewer into mind character working completely parallel films mood contradicting what audience is watching contributing lot films success satya company will always be remembered as greatest gangster films bollywood history which one is better its up viewers decide me its satya minus its 3 unwanted songs all way company follows closely strongly recommended if you dont want watch it then goli maar bheje mein,0.6227633477633479,0.4224025974025975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.18}"

Sure, the characters are ruthless and without any real honor, but that's how the world of crime is.

10.0,Best Crime Movie in Indian Cinema History,"Now folks .... This is the best crime movie ever made in Indian Cinema. The film is so mature, so aggressive. Ram Gopal Verma is a real matured, brainy director. Besides that, credit also goes to the writing duo Anurag & Saurabh shukla. The writing, screenplay, background music, editing, cinematography are just amazing. And above all .... Manoj Bajpai comes as a storm !!!!!! He has literally lived the life of Bhiku. Stunning performance. Saute to this great actor. Mumbai(formarly Bombay) is the centre of most of the underworld activities. And this city remains on top in such crimes for obvious reason ---- the money. Being the financial hub of Indian subcontinent, this city em-brasses the biggest names in underworld. Many characters in this movie are based on real-life persons. For example Inspector Khandilkar. This guy is encounter specialist. This character is based on one famous ACP in Mumbai Police. And then bhiku, his wife, DCP, bhau thakur etc. all these are closely similar to real people. As a Bombayite, I have been hearing & reading about these people since childhood. This is a story of a newcomer in underworld, his progress in the criminal world, his brains, his awesome decisions at crisis times, his fellow criminals, his rivals/friends, his race against time, and finally his downfall. The story moves so well. Its like all is happening in ur neighborhood. and so well picturized. I can tell at least 25 scenes which are one of the best-shot-scenes of all time...like for example the theatre scene, or death of guru, or death of bhiku, Satya's first ever crime, police encounter sequence, murder of DCP and so on & on & on. There are so many unforgatable scenes. I have seen this movie 13 times. And will keep on watching again & again. Its a sheer joy. Highly recommended. 10/10.

But what we get here is a man who looks and acts like an amateur from scene one. Chakravarthy has one expression on his face the entire movie. Looks the same when he's angry. Looks the same when he's happy and same applies to practically every other human emotion. His dialog delivery was so kid-like and so badly lacking in genuine intensity that a bunch of scenes involving him were ruined for me.....despite the brilliant cast around him. It was also hard to believe that this guy was a cold-blooded member of a Mafia gang.Some other cons: A slow first 1/2 hour. Story-telling gets a little uneven at times. Songs aren't really necessary.Negatives aside, Satya does feature EXCELLENT performance from practically everybody else. Bajpai was perfect as Bhiku Mahtre and lived up to all the expectations i had from him b4 watching Satya. He actually starts off being quite over-the-top(Jail scene, tapori Dance sequences), but once he settles in the role...i knew I was in for a treat. Only Manoj can play a character with such chilling intensity and then be just as effective while performing the lighter scenes involving 'Bhiku'. He along with Aamir Khan are the best actors in India post-1998.Urmila was mesmerizing as the struggling singer living with her old and suffering parents. Not only does she look gorgeous(nobody has looked better in a Sari until Gayatri Joshi starred in 'Swades') but gives a very realistic and touching performance. Her pairing with Chakravarthy was a mismatch though, from physical chemistry to talent-level. Of course, none due to any shortcomings in her.Among the supporting cast special mention goes to Saurabh Shukla(Kallu Mama) as the member who takes care of the financial side of the gang's operations. An extremely likable and realistic portrayal. Same goes for Goving Namdeo, the corrupt politician(or aspiring to be one). Shefali Shetty as Bhiku's wife was another extremely likable character. Gotta love her speaking style ;). Paresh Rawal is adequate as the 'preachy officer' and so is everybody else.Background music is first-rate, as it always is in an RGV flick. I also prefer Satya to RGV's Company due to its emotional appeal. Plenty of heart-wrenching scenes involving Bajpai and especially Urmila. Both give such a human touch to their performances. If only the main character was a little better, then we're talking masterpiece here. Nonetheless, Satya is still good stuff!",weak performance main character satya,what couldve been great movie is merely resorted just being good thanks performance put by jd chakravarthy satya couldnt rgv have found someone better character satya is supposed be played with great intensity good deal emotional depth but what we get here is man who looks acts like amateur scene one chakravarthy has one expression his face entire movie looks same when hes angry looks same when hes happy same applies practically every other human emotion his dialog delivery was so kid like so badly lacking genuine intensity that bunch scenes involving him were ruined me despite brilliant cast around him it was also hard believe that this guy was cold blooded member mafia gang some other cons slow first 1 2 hour story telling gets little uneven at times songs arent really necessary negatives aside satya does feature excellent performance practically everybody else bajpai was perfect as bhiku mahtre lived up all expectations i had him b4 watching satya he actually starts off being quite over top jail scene tapori dance sequences but once he settles role i knew i was treat only manoj can play character with such chilling intensity then be just as effective while performing lighter scenes involving bhiku he along with aamir khan are best actors india post 1998 urmila was mesmerizing as struggling singer living with her old suffering parents not only does she look gorgeous nobody has looked better sari until gayatri joshi starred swades but gives very realistic touching performance her pairing with chakravarthy was mismatch though physical chemistry talent level course none due any shortcomings her among supporting cast special mention goes saurabh shukla kallu mama as member who takes care financial side gangs operations extremely likable realistic portrayal same goes goving namdeo corrupt politician or aspiring be one shefali shetty as bhikus wife was another extremely likable character gotta love her speaking style paresh rawal is adequate as preachy officer so is everybody else background music is first rate as it always is rgv flick i also prefer satya rgvs company due its emotional appeal plenty heart wrenching scenes involving bajpai especially urmila both give such human touch their performances if only main character was little better then were talking masterpiece here nonetheless satya is still good stuff,0.5212105969148223,0.1544433266264252,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
