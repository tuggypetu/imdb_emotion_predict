9,One of the best films in TFI in recent years,"As a fan of detective/thriller movies, I couldn't miss this and I'm even more surprised by how much I loved this movie which usually doesn't happen when I watch a hyped movie. So thankful to Naveen for bringing this brilliant mystery to Telugu audience and dealing with a subject that's making a fool of the innocents. However, the sad thing remains that the film is unable to reach that set of audience.Coming to the performances, Naveen just nailed it, the way he balances humor, emotion, and intelligence is commendable. Shruthi also did her job very well. It was good to see Suhas as the Kannada version of Agent (although he could've been used better). The screenplay was tight, always keeps you guessing till the end, lots of twists which don't seem to be coming. The pace of the film was so good that you can't think of anything else or search for goofs. The exposition in the film feels justified and that's not very common in Tollywood. There were little cons but that's negligible consider how power-packed the whole movie is, it's a must watch for everyone and I hope there's more to come from Naveen and Swaroop for the Telugu Film Industry.",one best films tfi recent years,as fan detective thriller movies i couldnt miss this im even more surprised by how much i loved this movie which usually doesnt happen when i watch hyped movie so thankful naveen bringing this brilliant mystery telugu audience dealing with subject thats making fool innocents however sad thing remains that film is unable reach that set audience coming performances naveen just nailed it way he balances humor emotion intelligence is commendable shruthi also did her job very well it was good see suhas as kannada version agent although he couldve been used better screenplay was tight always keeps you guessing till end lots twists which dont seem be coming pace film was so good that you cant think anything else or search goofs exposition film feels justified thats not very common tollywood there were little cons but thats negligible consider how power packed whole movie is its must watch everyone i hope theres more come naveen swaroop telugu film industry,0.5401831501831502,0.23663232600732603,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.19}"

9,Got to watch this enthralling 'Telugu' film and atlast my Amazon subscription feels 'Worth it',"Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya is nothing like films I've watched. It has a new theme, new story, new awareness to make and I salute the makers for coming up with it. Not only that, the screenplay was really great, the lead actor was charming as hell and the humor works out even for one who gets a bit of Telugu and reads a lot of subtitles. The only disappointment in my case was that the actors who spoke 'bad' Tamil in a scene. The directors will have to do enough work before casting such actors or making Telugu vadus speak Tamil or any other language because Tamil is not alien to us. We are not living in Japan and creating German Title song with bad pronunciation. We speak Dravidian, why not be Dravidian as well? Next time, I wish they show the same level of acceptance with Tamil and Malayalam languages as well as they are showering towards Kannada. It's definitely a good changeover from ever masala Telugu film industry and hope this trend continues instead of following films like Bahubali. Big budget flop film. We don't want that, right?",got watch this enthralling telugu film atlast my amazon subscription feels worth it,agent sai srinivasa athreya is nothing like films ive watched it has new theme new story new awareness make i salute makers coming up with it not only that screenplay was really great lead actor was charming as hell humor works out even one who gets bit telugu reads lot subtitles only disappointment my case was that actors who spoke bad tamil scene directors will have do enough work before casting such actors or making telugu vadus speak tamil or any other language because tamil is not alien us we are not living japan creating german title song with bad pronunciation we speak dravidian why not be dravidian as well next time i wish they show same level acceptance with tamil malayalam languages as well as they are showering towards kannada its definitely good changeover ever masala telugu film industry hope this trend continues instead following films like bahubali big budget flop film we dont want that right,0.4787583628492719,0.05430932703659976,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"

He desperately seek an opportunity to prove his worth and strength as a detective. His assistant Sneha (Shruti Sharma) followed her boss despite knowing that he is not a well known detective. Due to the nosy nature of being a detective, Sai once found an unknown deadbody besides railroad track and eventually arrested by police as a suspect. Police kept him at the lock-up and planned to put charge against him. In the cell, Sai met an old man who requested him to find out the culprits of his dead daughter who brutally raped and killed her. Sai considered it as a chance of raising himself as a prominent detective in the country and start investigating immediately after getting bail from the court. However, the apparent murder case turns into an unexpected twists and turns and Sai and his team had to deal with a dangerous crime group. Acting of Naveen was really amazing. He is a good actor.
