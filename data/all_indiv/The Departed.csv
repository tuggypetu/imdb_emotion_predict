10.0,Moles And Rats,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small.",moles rats,when departed finally gained martin scorsese best director oscar it was felt it might have been work lifetime its not my favorite scorsese film that honor belongs casino me but it certainly was best film that year as well rivaled my humble opinion by blood diamond instead italian atmosphere departed scorsese decided use boston irish who are dominant group that city everything including crime film is simple enough police want take down organized crime kingpin jack nicholson who plays character named frank costello that was scorseses little joke because real frank costello was one mafia overlords back day although his real name was italian one nicholsons character is based whitey bulger who was real life organized crime chieftain boston area he came really interesting family because brother his william bulger had long political career that culminated that bulger being elected president massachusetts state senate i didnt add word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life getting this man wont be easy because he has full bag tricks one them being that years ago he put young man played by matt damon through boston police academy concealing juvenile record damon moved gradually up ranks got work boston pd internal affairs division great spot mole keep eye pending investigations but boston pd has put one their own undercover person leonardo dicaprio whose family knows nicholson neighborhood at that point whole film becomes cat mouse game both sides with each having their informants other side there are no dummies either side police arent keystone cops criminals as shrewd brutal as they come scorsese probably had lot help having both matt damon mark wahlberg cast both these players are well known their boston roots they fit really well into their parts mark wahlberg his role as one task force trying take nicholson down got oscar nomination best supporting actor he lost alan arkin little miss sunshine wahlberg was only one who came up short at oscar time departed won additional oscars best adapted screenplay best film editing go with best picture best director oscars scorsese leonardo dicaprio had career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasnt up best actor blood diamond real whitey bulger is 80 years old now real life he was as full tricks as nicholsons character is film if you think you know how this film ends i guarantee you will be wrong nicholsons character has survived many ways thats all i can say scorsese has nice feel bostons atmosphere as good as what he had goodfellas new york casino las vegas he assembled great cast people who all got crack at working with one best film directors all time cast didnt let martin down at oscar time they wont let you down when you see it big screen or small,0.419440775796708,0.2387586518942451,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,One of Scorsese's very best movies,"Martin Scorsese returns to familiar territory with this story of the lives of cops and gangsters living in America. However, a few things are different this time around – it's Irish gangsters rather than Italian, and for the first time in his life, Scorsese is shooting a remake, of the Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS. I haven't yet watched the original film but I'm pleased to say that THE DEPARTED is an example of the director at the top of his game and I'm completely satisfied that he finally won his best director Oscar for his efforts here.To say too much would be to spoil the experience. Cinematography is spot on and the ensemble cast fantastic – headlined by DiCaprio, playing it on the edge as the undercover cop, and Damon as the hateful cool cucumber, a con on the inside. Jack Nicholson plays it OVER the edge as a past-his-prime gangster; gradually losing his marbles in a world of violence, while Ray Winstone's heavy is another weighty performance from this underrated star. Kudos to newcomer Vera Farmiga for holding her own among the established talent and Martin Sheen for taking a small role and running away with it. Mark Wahlberg also deserves mention for his Oscar-nominated supporting role as a foul-mouthed cop, the best of his career.The plot twists and turns and is chock-full of Scorsese's trademark violence, with bloody shootings and beatings taking place throughout. The story is complex, forcing the viewer to give the film their full attention, so the 2 ½ hours just fly by as you're watching it. Things culminate in what I think is a very effective, brutal, shocking, sudden climax, which some people have criticised as being too rushed and too violent, but which I think is perfectly realistic, an example of how a house of cards can come tumbling down so suddenly. A perfect ending to a perfect film – and a must for all fans of twisty thrillers and gangster flicks.",one scorseses very best movies,martin scorsese returns familiar territory with this story lives cops gangsters living america however few things are different this time around its irish gangsters rather than italian first time his life scorsese is shooting remake hong kong film infernal affairs i havent yet watched original film but im pleased say that departed is example director at top his game im completely satisfied that he finally won his best director oscar his efforts here say too much would be spoil experience cinematography is spot ensemble cast fantastic headlined by dicaprio playing it edge as undercover cop damon as hateful cool cucumber con inside jack nicholson plays it over edge as past his prime gangster gradually losing his marbles world violence while ray winstones heavy is another weighty performance this underrated star kudos newcomer vera farmiga holding her own among established talent martin sheen taking small role running away with it mark wahlberg also deserves mention his oscar nominated supporting role as foul mouthed cop best his career plot twists turns is chock full scorseses trademark violence with bloody shootings beatings taking place throughout story is complex forcing viewer give film their full attention so 2 hours just fly by as youre watching it things culminate what i think is very effective brutal shocking sudden climax which some people have criticised as being too rushed too violent but which i think is perfectly realistic example how house cards can come tumbling down so suddenly perfect ending perfect film must all fans twisty thrillers gangster flicks,0.5877177177177177,0.17611111111111108,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us.

8.0,This one is about the mark of a great director,"Like i said, this film is about the mark of a great director, in this case a well paced, well written, violent movie with a great choice of songs, a mark that Scorsese is known for doing so well, but this one here is not his best film (not saying it's bad, far from it) but definitely not the one he should have won the oscar for, in my opinion the film that the Academy should give his best director award, was way back for Raging Bull, also not forgetting that he wasn't even nominated for Taxi Driver, but anyway, judging this film, it have a great cast, full of good performances, especially by Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Wahlberg.Also, this movie is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, the second time that Scorsese did a remake, the first one being Cape Fear (1991).",this one is about mark great director,like i said this film is about mark great director this case well paced well written violent movie with great choice songs mark that scorsese is known doing so well but this one here is not his best film not saying its bad far it but definitely not one he should have won oscar my opinion film that academy should give his best director award was way back raging bull also not forgetting that he wasnt even nominated taxi driver but anyway judging this film it have great cast full good performances especially by leonardo dicaprio mark wahlberg also this movie is remake 2002 hong kong film called mou gaan dou second time that scorsese did remake first one being cape fear 1991,0.578125,0.31875000000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.14}"
,"Lies, Betrayal, Sacrifice. What will you believe?","First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it? At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10",lies betrayal sacrifice what will you believe,first off this is american stylized remake hong kong hit infernal affairs i have give credit that good film i have seen both infernal affairs departed i personally prefer departed i think because one thing martin scorsese this is master behind such greats as taxi diver raging bull goodfellas hes at it again film has all star cast with leonardo dicaprio matt damon jack nicholson mark wahlberg martin sheen alec baldwin direction was amazing maybe one reasons why he won oscar it i loved how some scenes were shot set up especially regarding chinatown police interrogation scenes among many others film is perfectly set up with intense suspense scenes while adding amounts humor at times it works really well script is top notch also oscar winning realistic strong dialogue scene scene another thing i liked more departed as opposed infernal affairs was acting dicaprio really seemed earn lot respect this role here he takes tough guy persona so well sure it was known he was good actor his oscar nominated performances whats eating gilbert grape aviator but he really takes it another level here i cant see anyone else as character he fits so perfectly with it matt damon mark wahlberg being massachusetts natives also give solid performances with their natural accents nicholson works well his role as well everyone was extremely solid everything seemed so real set boston departed takes all boston like atmosphere beautifully shot scenes massachusetts golden dome state capital building is just one part landscape dropkick murphys song im shipping up boston really fits great use songs scorsese usually works music into his films really well cops or criminals when youre facing loaded gun whats difference this quote really represents film matt damon plays state officer police working crime boss area frank costello nicholson while damons character can be described as bad guy he is really misunderstood as kid he is sort mentored into crime business by costello while costello becomes father figure damons character never had leonardo dicaprio plays young guy coming bad crime ridden family hes decides become police officer get away crime life hes been surrounded by taking all this into account captain queenen sheen seargent dignam wahlberg decide send dicaprios character undercover find out more about criminal underworld costello with his familys crime record he fits perfectly into situation now you have highly ranked officer working bad guy undercover cop criminal underworld working state police here its all out suspenseful thrill ride whos who whos working who who can you trust paranoia threatens everyone lies betrayal sacrifice how far will you take it at heart this film is character development we really feel characters we feel like we know them its really amazing part this story film tremendous story telling here this is one most entertaining suspenseful crime dramas i have seen while while infernal affairs came first i think departed expands it so many ways really solid crime drama check both out when you get chance its really worth it 9 10,0.5465348399246704,0.23058380414312615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,10 out of 10 and WOW does this film deserve it!

10.0,Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",martin scorsese hits streets again,please dont make negative comments like some aforementioned people have been doing if you havent seen film yet i have seen it at press screening last week not only is it best film year so far it marks return form martin scorsese ranks with likes goodfellas as being one best his canon films im fan hong kong film infernal affairs upon which this is based while departed keeps basic structure original it is very much its own movie so much so that screenwriter william monahan didnt even watch original film while adapting its screenplay thus enabling him infuse script with his scorseses respective visions all actors are first rate yes even leo all you dicaprio bashers out there turn some their best performances date departed is sure garner host oscar nods if not wins including hopefully scorseses long overdue statuette best director plus with actors like martin sheen alec baldwin playing supporting roles that says lot about quality film they signed up departed is tough stuff not faint heart that said it is must see adult viewers who long intelligent gritty stories grace our movie screens once again,0.48545267489711935,0.26374485596707814,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"

,Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time,"The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had.",enjoyable thriller but there are failings missed targets across running time,war between police organised crime boston has reached new heights both oliver queenan target frank costello have placed mole into each others organisations billy costigan is selected infiltrate costellos ranks thanks family background criminals working men meanwhile colin sullivan has been groomed since youth come up inside ranks bpd as costigan makes progress it becomes clear his police superiors that they too have rat feeding information outwards with only frank knowing sullivans identity queenan dignam knowing costigans race begins with first one expose other winning having enjoyed original film i was quite looking forward this film not really worried that hollywood would mess it up way it does deliver but it is hard ignore problems failings film if i didnt realise how imdb put together their top 250 list i would be amazed that film is running so high up it original was tight cop thriller which i remember thinking owed much american cinema style tone so surely america can only do it better well if not better then this is certainly bigger with stars oozing out every pore big director long running time regards latter film should be commended moving slickly through 150 minutes not feeling as long as it is fact that it is cool engaging quite exciting will be enough most audiences indeed sheer volume positive votes this site shows it has struck something chord but this is not say it is classic those putting it alongside goodfellas are simply out their trees script here tries give more room growth characters explore their feelings outside tension fear their situation unfortunately this produces many scenes that are bit dull unconvincing as they attempt deepen material specifically i am talking about thread involving girlfriend her scenes add little dialogue session scenes is obvious as sopranos viewer i was surprised by this secondary downside this although not totally blame is that it is not as gripping claustrophobic as i would have liked yes it is thrilling at times but i wanted it be consistent like real catnmouse game with noose tightening palatably around each characters neck as they raced hang other first ending is also little less effective than it should be because added originals strong ending is extra scene that doesnt have strong foundation is not as good as it should have been ironically such starry affair some performances are bit weak im thinking specifically damon he never seems like flipped version costigan i never really got feeling him being trapped panicked hunted same way as his opposite number was conversely then dicaprio is pretty strong is convincing as he loses himself into costellos gang murderers he works well alongside scene stealing nicholson at times he threatens completely tip over into ham but most part he is just larger than life provides lot energy film this energy is harnessed well by director scorsese who directs with this usual eye setup also enjoyable soundtrack use sudden stops music quick cuts is perhaps bit much get used but it is strangely effective support cast is impressive depth but they are not all that well used walhberg has all best lines but it seems like he has wandered another movie at times funny as he was he is never developed involved character that he needed be way narrative required baldwin is same although he is more restrained fits better while sheen is nice touch class woman playing girlfriend is as weak as her material although she did have important part story she adds very little beyond writing page overall though this is strong professional film it is shame that it isnt as good as i wanted attempts paint detailed complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed be with damon particular left out there with little work with comparison dicaprio moments slick tension action are very good though only downside was that it made me wish more same that scorsese had focused keeping it tight taut same way that superior original had,0.5061228433402347,0.15321950875211743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Identity,"This is kind of the ideal remake. It takes a concept with great potential that the original didn't fully realize, deepens it, does more with it, and transplants it to a completely different setting. This isn't just Infernal Affairs in America, this is Infernal Affairs in Boston. The script by William Monahan, a Boston native, ends up so intimately tied to the reality of the city, its different cultures, locations, and even history that it gives the movie such a wonderfully distinctive flavor that sets it apart from the original. Add in Scorsese's incredible skill behind the camera, his ability to coax great performances from all of his actors, and the editing prowess of his long time editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and you've got one of the most entertaining mob movies of the past twenty years.This film follows the original plot point for plot point, and yet they feel like entirely different movies. They're made differently with vastly different focuses that provide incredibly different experiences. Those who value plot over every other element of narrative would probably gravitate towards Infernal Affairs more naturally, while I see The Departed as a much more well-rounded experience that provides wonderful characters to enjoy. It's the story of two young men, one a police recruit and the other a protégé of the local mob boss, going undercover in the oppositional organization. There's Billy Costigan who goes from the police academy to the mob, and then there's Colin Sullivan, who follows the local mob boss, Frank Costello, around as a very young man who enters the police academy as his mole. The two moles end up on each other's tails, just behind as they try to figure out who the other is.Where this movie really differs from its predecessor is ability to really let its characters breathe. That starts with Leonardo DiCaprio's Billly Costigan. A young man of two worlds from the start (his mother lived on the north side of town while he adopted a Southie accent when he went to visit his father), he's pulled from the police academy and given an undercover job to infiltrate the mob organization of Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Costigan, especially deeper in the film when he begins to feel cornered, desperate for a way out. The other side is Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan. Overconfident, probably to mask some inner turmoil (potentially some homosexuality), he's a star trooper, helped along by Frank who offers up ironclad proof for crimes against unconnected people that Sullivan can present to his bosses and wrap some bows on cases. Sullivan is the much more improved version of Lau. His inner turmoil combined with the actual relationship with Frank he has that steadily frays as Frank gets more and more commanding and paranoid is a fully believable train of thought and action that sells the final act completely.Both Costigan and Sullivan are at war with themselves. They both want to be good and loyal, but to whom should they be loyal? Should Costigan be loyal to Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam who leave him exposed to danger for years? Should he be loyal to Costello who takes him under his wing and ends up trusting him more than anyone else in his organization? Should Sullivan feel support to Costello who treats him terribly, threatens him constantly, and could potentially be an informant to the FBI (like Whitey Bulger, an inspiration for the character)? Should he feel loyalty to Captain Ellerby who promotes him and gives him greater authority? It's really interesting how often the two characters' journeys mirror each other, and it never feels heavy handed, like when Costigan has to get his broken arm recast while Sullivan is on the fancy date with Madolyn, the pretty psychologist.Madolyn represents one of the major improvements from Infernal Affairs. None of the female characters in the original Hong Kong production could have been really called characters. They were thin placeholders for dialogue and little else. Madolyn gets into relationships with both Costigan and Sullivan, and she ends up being a driver for both characters. She meets Sullivan first, falls for his easy charm, moves into his nice apartment overlooking the state capitol, and gets engaged. They seem happy, but he's at war with himself and he can't open up to her, outright telling her that he can't tell her things. Costigan, on the other hand, is a patient that she sees a single time in a meeting so mean spirited but honest that she can't see herself helping him on a professional manner, but he manages to ask her to coffee immediately afterwards. There comes an honesty between the two that gives Costigan his one safe outlet in a dangerous world. She becomes his guiding light in the fog. Played with intelligence and poise by Vera Farmiga, Madolyn is a very good addition to the story.Matthew Modine, in this video from the Criterion Collection, said that in theater actors create performances, but in film it is directors who create performances based on their choices of takes. Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello is quite a creation that fits this theory pretty well, I think. From the stories I've read of this film's production, Scorsese gave Nicholson a very wide berth to create Costello. The scene where Costello confronts Costigan on whether he's a rat or not was filmed with a few props just out of view that Nicholson could pull from if he was feeling like it. The take that Scorsese left in was where he grabbed the gun and pointed it at Costigan. What I'm saying is that Scorsese has learned how to both allow his actors to go off in any direction they want but to piece together a cohesive performance through the chaos. It helps that Nicholson is playing a man who's steadily feeling cornered and out of control, a psychopath struggling to keep control of his environment, but that could be a recipe for getting lost, like what Scorsese oversaw in New York, New York.The film's resolution as the moles work their ways out of their holes, Costello comes to his end, and Madolyn discovers the true natures of the two men in her life, is a surprisingly affecting ending. There's a lot going on across a fair number of characters, but while ensemble pieces are hard they are far from impossible to pull off. Everyone's dealing with similar issues, centered around the idea of duality. Even smaller events have this implication like when Costello confronts the older priests about how they abuse young boys, the men of the cloth being corrupted. Costigan finally facing off with Costello's mole is the ultimate bringing together of all the parts, though, and the suddenness of the turns in this scene fit the story, fill out details, and it never feels cheap.The Departed is the work of a screenwriter providing concrete settings and intelligent character work to an existing plot while an incredibly talented director builds performances that fill out the characters and pulls all of the other disparate elements into a complete package. It really is a great film.",identity,this is kind ideal remake it takes concept with great potential that original didnt fully realize deepens it does more with it transplants it completely different

10.0,Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling.

7.0,Scorsese Should Have Made His Own Movie,"I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment ***** SPOILERS ******The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichéd and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't",scorsese should have made his own movie,i had massive expectations departed violent mob drama directed by martin scorsese greatest film maker world today after seeing it i did have slight feeling something i have experienced throughout my life disappointment spoilers film starts typical scorsese style sweeping framing sequence with musical soundtrack by rolling stones similar work he did goodfellas unfortunately director doesnt sustain this whilst never becoming mediocre we dont see much way what cinematic beauty scorsese is capable several scenes most notably death queennan original film infernal affairs did it far more better departed suffers very uneven screenplay courtesy william monahan when its bad its woeful but when its good its great it should be pointed out however that when its good its entirely down siu fia maks original script if youve seen infernal affairs youll notice how tight storytelling was how loose cluttered monahans adaptation is comparison did we really need romantic subplot there seems lack thought put into costello hes spent years as crime boss so how come it appears its only now that boston police department have come up with bright idea putting several moles into costellos crew are we seriously believe that costello is being protected plot revelation that i wont give away just because tough gangster likes opera that doesnt make him multi layered it just makes him clich d unconvincing most ridiculous scene is where costello meets his police mole cinema if its clandestine meeting then why does costello draw attention himself by grunting pulling out his penis possibly most stupid sequence ive ever seen scorsese film theres been many other criticisms this movie movie that seems have split critics right down middle one is cast i do think dicaprio is much better actor than what hes given credit but i was never entirely convinced when he has dish out violence someone little less pretty should have been cast while youre left with impression that deniro pesci were first choices costello rather than nicholson damon does merely okay as sullivan while ray winstone as french is somewhat distracting because hes widely regarded actor household name britain seeing him attempt american accent is something shock system one performance i wasnt keen was mark wahlberg as dignam down fact he plays one those fast talking foul mouthed cops that weve seen far too many films hbo series perhaps im being somewhat harsh cast general wahlberg particular because dialog monahans screenplay contains far too much swearing yeah i know swearing exists real life but its almost like its included every line just so audience know that its hard hitting adult drama i think everyone knew that when we saw name scorsese title no need over egg pudding or include fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think theyre watching tarintino movie as good points well if youve liked most this great auteurs movies then youll certainly like departed just not as much as youve liked scorsess previous output if you have loved most scorseses films then youll be slightly disappointed its not helped by fact that this is first movie directed by scorsese pick up oscar best film where as master works like taxi driver raging bull goodfellas didnt,0.5183573323228494,0.11877145523697247,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.25}"

7.0,"Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers","Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10.",good but very familiar story cops robbers,remake infernal affairs is not second coming gangster film that some proclaimed it it is very good if decidedly over long tale cops battling robbers with moles each side trying remain hidden plot is simple cop is sent undercover mob at same time crook works his way into police force complicating matters is fact that bosses both sides quickly realize that rat is among they begin search ferret out mole original infernal affairs is one better hong kong films last ten years its well told tale with some nice stylish twists if original has any flaws its that film falls love with itself second half becomes bit too showoffy thats not case here here story has been refashioned rethought into gritty tale irish cops robbers boston its different enough discourage comparisons which is good thing these days shot shot remakes martin scorsese has fashioned really good film cast is mostly excellent with only jack nicholson ruining things with occasional lapse into stereotypical jackisms leonardo dicaprio has at last arrived as actor turns excellent performance as cop gone deep undercover his performance is sure garner oscar nomination i really liked this film but i didnt love it film carries sense having been down this road before not because its remake as i said it different enough rebuke comparison rather its because it takes gangster films past thirty years compresses them together has very familiar feel it reminded me several other films about irish mobs state grace particular so it didnt strike me as ground breaking way godfather or goodfellas did upon first seeing them my one real complaint with film is that it takes too log get where its going yes its tense it keeps you edge your seat but when it was over i felt as though i had been watching it twice its length good movie should fly by make you lose track time i was checking my watch through out much second half this movie definitely worth seeing but im not sure youre going love it so much as youre going like it 7 out 10,0.4744632034632035,0.2012929292929293,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,A masterpiece right up Scorsese's alley,"Director Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"", a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller ""Internal Affairs"", goes without saying as perhaps his best work since ""Goodfellas."" Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity.Set in Boston, the Massachusetts State Police sends young cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate an Irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns the trust of leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello's informant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit. Soon, stakes are raised when both the police and the mob realize there's a traitor among them, and that both Billy and Collin are both in danger of losing their cover and even their lives.Nicholson, yet again playing another villain, owns every scene he's in with his portrayal of Costello, providing a paradoxical attraction to his menacing character. DiCaprio, increasingly maturing as an actor since becoming Scorsese's ""muse"", fits right in as the streetwise cop, while Damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor to the part. They are complemented by the ensemble performances of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga.Scriptwriter William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") retains much of the structure of ""Internal Affairs"" but adds depth to its characters and an acerbic quality to its witty dialog. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is brooding and morbid, capturing the character of its Boston setting while Howard Shore's score is as good as a soundtrack can be.At its core, ""The Departed"" is a well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted film noir. In an age where style usually triumphs over the narrative quality, ""The Departed"" is one of the best films I have seen so far in recent memory.",masterpiece right up scorseses alley,director martin scorseses departed gangster flick based hong kong thriller internal affairs goes without saying as perhaps his best work since goodfellas working genre thats right up his territory scorsese is back top his game recreates new dimension genre this crime thriller treads same theme as much its directors previous films does its about two young men people around them complications brought about by their characters ambiguity set boston massachusetts state police sends young cop billy costigan leonardo dicaprio go undercover infiltrate irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns trust leader frank costello jack nicholson meanwhile costellos informant collin sullivan matt damon works police departments special investigation unit soon stakes are raised when both police mob realize theres traitor among them that both billy collin are both danger losing their cover even their lives nicholson yet again playing another villain owns every scene hes with his portrayal costello providing paradoxical attraction his menacing character dicaprio increasingly maturing as actor since becoming scorseses muse fits right as streetwise cop while damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor part they are complemented by ensemble performances martin sheen alec baldwin mark wahlberg vera farmiga scriptwriter william monahan kingdom heaven retains much structure internal affairs but adds depth its characters acerbic quality its witty dialog cinematography by michael ballhaus is brooding morbid capturing character its boston setting while howard shores score is as good as soundtrack can be at its core departed is well crafted well written well acted film noir age where style usually triumphs over narrative quality departed is one best films i have seen so far recent memory,0.4163718465442603,0.16439020749365577,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,"Never will be ""departed"" from the pantheon of premiere American directors.","""The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated."" Shakespeare, The Winter's taleIt's not Taxi Driver or even Goodfellas, but Martin Scorsese's Departed is one of the year's best films and one of his best, after his 2 or 3 indisputable classics such as Raging Bull. The director has assembled a first-rate cast, who, right down to Jack Nicholson as mobster kingpin Frank Costello, are having a great time nudging each other's performances toward excellence through collaboration.Remade from a 2002 Hong Kong smash called Infernal Affairs, The Departed tells of moles within the Boston State Police Department and the South Boston Irish-American mob. When the director opens the film with Costello's brief narration and the Stones' Gimme Shelter for background music, we're in for a whole lot of no shelter for anyone and uncommon acting for everyone. The set up is just complex enough to act as a metaphor for the nasty workings of the United Nations, Iraqi Assembly, and US Congress. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) willingly serves as a mole in the South Boston Irish-American mob for the State Police, while Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) does the same in the State Police for the mob.Amongst the intertwining machinations of cell phones and lies is a triangle with those two operatives and a psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), as well played by the three as could be hoped for in such a trumped-up situation that provides little sexual payoff for audience voyeurs and many scratched heads for those who enjoy well-structured plots. This triangle is the only disappointment in a film layered expertly to show how intertwined crime and punishment can be in a world last laid bare by Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Mystic River (2003).Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Kristie Zea are winning collaborators with the director for a look that is authentic (I worked in South Boston for 3 years), crisp, and dark. But in the end the film belongs to the actors, chief among them DiCaprio as a young Scorsese acolyte showing the master's handiwork after 3 films with him. And Matt Damon has never been better in his hometown, as has fellow South Bostonian Mark Wahlberg in his role as a detective with a barbed tongue and equally sharp intuition.Welcome back, Martin S.
