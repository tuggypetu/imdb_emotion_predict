8.0,Laughter Guaranteed!!,"Storyline: Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) and his gang are the typical 'Bhai's in Mumbai who claims to be a social worker helping out people in recovery (through kidnapping, haath-pair todna) etc and has lied to his father that he is a doctor. When the truth is discovered, an insulted Munna then makes a resolve to become a doctor. Coincidentally, he joins the same college where his enemy Dr. Asthana (Boman Irani) is a strict Dean. A comedy of troubles starts when the 'cool' don confronts strict Asthana.Comment: Although the story is quite similar to Hollywood's 'Patch Adams', the movie can make u laugh non-stop except for some serious scenes that are very few in that movie. The tapori style of Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi is just too good. Sunil Dutt has acted after a really really long time of 17 years. Gracy Singh is graceful and sweet. Boman Irani has done a good job as a Strict Dean of the medical college who accidentally believes in Laughter therapy. Although the punchline of the movie says ""He might just cure you"", forget about the curing, he will surely make you laugh!! Truly Amazing Humour!!

,The introduction to Munnabhai and Circuit,"Inspired by the Hollywood movie 'Patch Adam', 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' tells the comedic story of a thug who wants to become a doctor. The film has its major share of comedic moments and its dramatic moments. It is indeed an entertaining film with the famously lovable characters like Munnabhai and Circuit. Rajkumar Hirani may have taken the idea of an older outsider wanting to become a doctor from 'Patch Adams' but in essence 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' is its own film and it is the performances and comedy that make it worth the watch because most the dramatic moments are a little over the top. While the dialogue in the comedic scenes are witty and hilarious, the ones in the dramatic scenes are a mess.Sanjay Dutt totally nails Munnabhai. It's hard to picture anyone else in the title role. The actor does full justice. It was nice to see Sunil Dutt after a long time and that too as father to his own son. The actor has a strong presence, even in a brief role. Gracy Singh is cute and adorable. Jimmy Shergill is awesome and holds his own as Zaheer and Boman Irani too does very well. However, it is Arshad Warsi who steals the show in a breakthrough performance as one of the most memorable film characters of recent time, Circuit.Most of the songs are well balanced and are good additions to the film. I found Munnabhai's romantic ballad hilarious when he tries to convince the suicider to cut the crap. On the technical side, it's alright. On the whole this is one enjoyable flick. One would have expected more from the second Munnabhai film which I found boring but why should that prevent the pleasure that comes from this movie?",introduction munnabhai circuit,inspired by hollywood movie patch adam munnabhai m b b s tells comedic story thug who wants become doctor film has its major share comedic moments its dramatic moments it is indeed entertaining film with famously lovable characters like munnabhai circuit rajkumar hirani may have taken idea older outsider wanting become doctor patch adams but essence munnabhai m b b s is its own film it is performances comedy that make it worth watch because most dramatic moments are little over top while dialogue comedic scenes are witty hilarious ones dramatic scenes are mess sanjay dutt totally nails munnabhai its hard picture anyone else title role actor does full justice it was nice see sunil dutt after long time that too as father his own son actor has strong presence even brief role gracy singh is cute adorable jimmy shergill is awesome holds his own as zaheer boman irani too does very well however it is arshad warsi who steals show breakthrough performance as one most memorable film characters recent time circuit most songs are well balanced are good additions film i found munnabhais romantic ballad hilarious when he tries convince suicider cut crap technical side its alright whole this is one enjoyable flick one would have expected more second munnabhai film which i found boring but why should that prevent pleasure that comes this movie,0.597037037037037,0.2001851851851852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Real nice comedy,"I saw Munnabhai MBBS primarily because of Sunjay Dutt. He has always been good in comedy, and his movies make you laugh without having to take help of double meaning dialogues or crossing the line into bitchiness. Ofcourse, Sunjay Dutt has to have a gangster connection, only then the movie can sell. He is the eternal gangster and those roles fit him well, no body can deny that. But where you really have to give director the full points is that he saw the comedic talents of the junior Dutt and put them into a simplistic, well made movie. All the characters, be it ""Circuit"" (Arshad Warsi) or the ""Dean"", or Sunil Dutt, have been portrayed well enough in the movie. Some of the scenes, like the one where Sanjay Dutt ""rags"" the seniors make you laugh out from the heart, because this is something which every fresher in the college dreams of. I think, the movie deserves full points for direction, story, acting, nice title.... This movie was a real treat to watch when most of the other Hindi movies (especially the over-hyped stuff) turn out to be below average.10 out of 10.",real nice comedy,i saw munnabhai mbbs primarily because sunjay dutt he has always been good comedy his movies make you laugh without having take help double meaning dialogues or crossing line into bitchiness ofcourse sunjay dutt has have gangster connection only then movie can sell he is eternal gangster those roles fit him well no body can deny that but where you really have give director full points is that he saw comedic talents junior dutt put them into simplistic well made movie all characters be it circuit arshad warsi or dean or sunil dutt have been portrayed well enough movie some scenes like one where sanjay dutt rags seniors make you laugh out heart because this is something which every fresher college dreams i think movie deserves full points direction story acting nice title this movie was real treat watch when most other hindi movies especially over hyped stuff turn out be below average 10 out 10,0.47875000000000006,0.22125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.21}"

10.0,A Laugh Riot!,"The funniest film of 2003 and perhaps the DECADE. Munna Bhai MBBS is a non-stop laugh riot! Sanjay Dutt gives another mind-blowing performance.Rajkumar Hirani is the new kid on the Block, but it doesn't show, one of would think he's a veteran filmmaker by the way he has directed his debut venture. Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not know for producing comedies, but his risk has paid off BIG TIME!!! The film also stars Sunil Dutt, after a very long gap, but he does full justice to his role, he's in full form and doesn't miss a single beat. Rohini Hattangadi is excellent. Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani simply steal the show. Gracy Singh is Sweet, Sensitive and spellbinding.

Murli Prasad Sharma (Sanjay Dutt) becomes a bhai after coming to Mumbai. His father(Sunil Dutt) wanted him to become a doctor. Every time his father visits him in the city, his dhobi ghaat place has to be transformed into a hospital to show that he is a doctor. That scene is hilarious.But once Sunil Dutt finds out the reality, he is heart-broken and leaves. So now Sanjay Dutt has a point to prove and gets an admission to become a doctor. He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college. He is also in love with his daughter (Gracy Singh). The story now focuses on how people in the hospital need to be loved and appreciated. Arshad Warsi provides humour after every few scenes. Songs weren't that great except I really liked the ""Subah Ho Gayi Mamu"".Sanjay Dutt does justification to his role as the Bhai.

9.0,Magic Hug.,"With a poll coming up on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2003,I started searching around for Bollywood movies that I could watch for the poll.Taking a look at the top grossing Bollywood films for 2003,I was delighted to spot a flick which I had seen the first half of at a friends house a few years ago,which led to me quickly booking an appointment with Dr.Munna Bhai.The plot:Finding out that his mum and dad are coming down to pay him an early visit,underworld gangster Munna Bhai orders his gang to completely change the appearance of his mansion,in order to keep his underworld life hidden from his parents.With no time to spare,Munna Bhai and his fellow friend/gangster decide to pretend to be dr's,so that Bhai's family can be happy at him having a 'traditional' job.Keeping everything under wraps,Bhai is caught by surprise,when his mum and dad reveal that they are going to arrange for him to get married to a former school friend of his nicknamed 'Chinki.'Keeping his underworld links under wraps,Bhai's parents run into the head doctor (Dr.J.C. Asthana) of a leading medical university.Talking about how proud they are of their son,Asthana destroys any sense of pride that Bhai's family have,by revealing that Bhail is actually a major gangster.Sickened by the sadness that his parents feel,Bhai decides that the only way he can bring happiness back to his parent's lives is to enter medical school with his gangster buddies by his side.View on the film:Running at 2 and a half hours,the screenplay by co-writer/ (along with Lajan Joseph,Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Abbas Tyrewala)editor/director Rajkumar Hirani moves at a lightning fast pace,with the writers jam packing the movie with hilariously sharp one dialogue and quick-paced slap-stick which is smartly always rooted to the characters current situations which helps the jokes to never feel disconnected from the drama taking place.Making sure to never become sickly sweet,and backed by a wonderful score from Anu Malik, (with almost all of the songs thankfully being subtitled)the writers wisely use the running time to gradually give the film a real heart,as Munna Bhai discovers the skills that he used to keep his gang together,can be put to better use for people who are in desperate need.Returning to the screen for the first time in 16 years,Sunil Dutt gives a very good performance as Munna Bhai's dad,with Dutt showing a real sorrow towards his real life son,as he discovers the lies that he has been told.Meeting up with his dad on screen,Sanjay Dutt gives an excellent performance as Munna Bhai,with Dutt delivering each one liner with a real relish,whilst also making sure that the comedy moments never get away from Bhai's aim of making his mum and dad proud.Despite there being a 20 year gap,Gracy Singh gives a charming performance as 'Chinki',with Singh showing a real sincerity as Chinki finds herself being taken by Bhai's charms,whilst Arshad Warsi shows a real comedic bite as Bhai's loyal sidekick Circuit,and Boman Irani (covered in expertly done make up effects) gives a tremendously ruthless performance,as the Dr who is determined to make Munna Bhai fail at the school.",magic hug,with poll coming up imdbs classic

7.0,fab. movie.,"Sunil Dutt was the original funny man of the Indian Cinema (Padosan)even though he did not mean to be, he had a vacant,stupid look that came across better than his romantic roles that he had to endure in countless movies. Now we have his prodigal son Sanjay Dutt who has a physique for a gangster and a facade that is as vacant as his father which makes him perfect for a comic role (The Burt Reynolds of Bollwood). He is a disaster in romantic movies and many may feel the same way too. He is very adept at playing the intensity of a gangster as in ""Plan"" or a gangster/fake Doctor as he does here.As Munnabhai he fills the coat to the fullest with his talent. The story is poignant and moralistic where the audience comes out with a message instead of glossy eyed teeny- boppers watching the recent string of bubble gum movies like KKHH, DDLJ, KHNH, most of them starring mediocre actors albeit saved by catchy music.

9.0,One prescription of Munnabhia MBBS please!,"They say laughter is the best medicine, so here comes Dr. Murli Prasad Sharma to cure you. He may not be the brightest, he may not be the most polite, hell, he may not even be an actual doctor but he will put a smile on your face and make you forget all your problems. So if you haven't seen the tactics of Munnabhai, then forget your problems for 2 and half hours and treat yourself to his funny and endearing classic.Murli Prasad Sharma, aka Munnabhai is a gangster who claims to be a social worker. He ran away from his village years ago to make a life in Mumbai. However, he ended up becoming a goon who lives with the a lie he told his parents. He's a doctor. So once every year, Munna's parents come to see their ""doctor"" son and his clinic full of small time cons who pose as other doctors/patient. One circumstance leads to another and Munna's parents come to find out his real identify due to Dr. Asthana. A shattered and disappointed father, Hari Prasad Sharma leaves Munnaa in anger.A Munna full of shame is now destined to become a real doctor and so begins a tale of laughter, emotions and important lessons in life.When i initially saw the promos of this movie, I wasn't really interested. I was more interested in watching a star studded dud named L.O.C. Kargil which came the same month. I expected Munnabhi MBBS to be a slapstick comedy with no logic whatsoever.Firstly, there is no silly comedy in this movie. The lines are fresh, some are make your chuckle and some turn you in tears. The situations are fresh and nothing is forced. The very first scenes catch your eye and put a smile on your face.Sanju kidnapping the man in the first scene, Sunil Dutt scene at the railway station, the act put up by Sanju in front of his parents. You're just 15 minutes into the film and you're laughing out loud. The sequences in the hospital only get funnier.The film is a comedy but does not shy of trying to touch your emotions and it succeeds big time. Sunil Dutt confronting his son is heartbreaking to watch. Sanju's scenes with Jimmy Shergill is brilliant.The music is situational so it isn't conventional in any way. Although, the songs are different, they're good for the most part. The title song, Dekh Le, Chan Chan etc all go well with the screenplay and are soothing to the ears. There may not be a chartbuster in the soundtrack but the songs are still good.The writing is just brilliant. No loop-holes in the script. No dip in the screenplay. Characters are fully developed. Raju Hirani's story is fresh.Another highpoint - Abbas Tyrewala's dialogues. Just outrageous. They are funny, and not a bit over the top. The emotion filled dialogues are perfect too.Gracy Singh, Jimmy Shergill, Krush Debo etc all lend great support. It was a pleasure watching Sunil Dutt with Sanju.Baman Irani is a great talent and I'm sure he would agree with me that this movie boosted his acting career. He's hilarious. A brilliant act! Murli Prasad Sharma would not be what he is without his side-kick Circuit, played by Arshad Warsi. Arshad is a scene stealer. His best act yet. This role was a turning point for Arshad.Now to Sanjay Dutt. Before Munnabhia, Sanju was doing mediocre movies and mediocre roles. He hadn't give a box office hit in ages. Munnabhi MBBS is Sanjay Dutt's role. He was born to play the character and nobody can do it better than him. Not SRK, not Aamir - NOBODY! Although these people mentioned above are a huge part of the movie, none of them deserve more credit than the real hero of this masterpiece.Before naming him, I'd like to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for finding this guy. Yes, I'm talking about Indian cinema's current best filmmaker - Raj Kumar Hirani.This is Raju's film and no one can deny it. A perfectly directed movie and a novel idea. Hats off to this guy, who gave 2 more classics after this movie. (Lage Raho Munnabhai & 3 Idiots) What is there left to say? Just watch it, enjoy it, and watch it again.

8.0,"hilarity, heart, and hugs","Munna Bhai is the leader of a kidnapping gang in Mumbai. In order to make his father proud, he told him that he's a medical doctor. When his parents visit, he turns his compound into a fake hospital and pretends to be the head doctor. His father is an honorable man from the country who treats even a pickpocket with kindness. His father runs into old acquaintance Dr. Asthana who once upon a time treated their village. The parents decide to bring together Munna with Asthana's daughter Chinki who is also a doctor. Asthana outs Munna's deception and his father is humiliated. Munna decides to go to medical school for real where he is met by the disbelieving dean Dr. Asthana and Chinki although unknowingly by her real name Dr. Suman.This is funny. It's got heart. It's Bollywood. Early on, it demonstrates both comedy and tragedy. When the mother asks Munna if he's actually a doctor, my heart almost broke. The emotional scene is devastating. Then the movie turns into Patch Adams goes to Medical School. I do have issues with some of his actions although leeway must be given since his character is a goon. Comedy in a foreign language can often be problematic. About half is lost in translation but the general sense of humor is never lost. One problem does stick. There's no denying the two decade age difference between Sanjay Dutt and Gracy Singh. Older men and younger women have been staples in cinema forever and I'm not objecting to that. It's a matter of logic since Munna and Chinki are supposed to be childhood friends who played doctor together. Either lose that past history or get an older actress. It doesn't make sense.

2.0,"Not a comedy, unbearably unrealistic drama","This movie is a fantasyland that defies all logic. The story is centered around a ruthless mob boss who enforces his rule with smiles and ""Magic Hugs."" Yes, you read that right. He doesn't want to disappoint his parents with his kindhearted life of benevolence, so he tries to cheat his way into med school. Of course he fails spectacularly, but two (only two) medical miracles happen around him for no real reason, which somehow makes everyone want him to be a doctor despite his complete lack of knowledge.The movie is presented as a comedy, but it's far from that. It's primarily a drama with a few comedic scenes, and it astounds me how anyone thought this movie would be taken seriously when you take out all characters' common sense and replace it with over 18 minutes of Bollywood musicals.

3.0,"Yet another incredibly overrated Bollywood oddity, skewed by its loyal domestic voters","""Munna Bhai M. B. B. S."" (2003) is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani.Honestly, this seems like a strange film like so many other Bollywood films, it is a mess, both in terms of writing, direction and editing. Meanwhile, the lead performances by Sanjay Dutt, Gracy Singh, Arshad Warsi, and Boman Irani, among others, are all way over the top. This is quite understandable, since they all had very little to work with in terms of screenwriting qualia.As I've noted before in my reviews of Bollywood films, it is high time for IMDb to improve their rating algorithm and start to take into account demographic diversity (or lack thereof), which badly skews the average ratings of films. I find this to be a very prevalent issue particularly surrounding Bollywood cinema and their loyal domestic voters.""Munna Bhai M. B. B. S."" is not as horrible as the mentions below, but mediocre at the very best for anyone from outside Eastern film tradition. Like many others from this region, this is a quite odd film, and ironically part of the infamous IMDb top 250, due to the violent skew imposed by user ratings from lovers of these atrocious - to mediocre at best - Bollywood oddities.Other examples include so-called ""films"" such as ""Andhadhun"", ""Drishyam"", and ""Airlift"", all of which are provocatively bad by Western standards. Not only are they without substance or morale and formed through hideous scripts, they lack humanity, and by this I mean in a dualistic sense, as neither good or bad are portrayed anything vaguely close to authentic.Not recommended for Western audiences.",yet another incredibly overrated bollywood oddity skewed by its loyal domestic voters,munna bhai m b b s 2003 is 2003 indian hindi language comedy drama film written directed by rajkumar hirani honestly this seems like strange film like so many other bollywood films it is mess both terms writing direction editing meanwhile lead performances by sanjay dutt gracy singh arshad warsi boman irani among others are all way over top this is quite understandable since they all had very little work with terms screenwriting qualia as ive noted before my reviews bollywood films it is high time imdb improve their rating algorithm start take into account demographic diversity or lack thereof which badly skews average ratings films i find this be very prevalent issue particularly surrounding bollywood cinema their loyal domestic voters munna bhai m b b s is not as horrible as mentions below but mediocre at very best anyone outside eastern film tradition like many others this region this is quite odd film ironically part infamous imdb top 250 due violent skew imposed by user ratings lovers these atrocious mediocre at best bollywood oddities other examples include so called films such as andhadhun drishyam airlift all which are provocatively bad by western standards not only are they without substance or morale formed through hideous scripts they lack humanity by this i mean dualistic sense as neither good or bad are portrayed anything vaguely close authentic not recommended western audiences,0.5455487804878051,-0.004380081300812978,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,Pretty good but also a case of too much....,"Munna has spent the last decade trying to pretend to his parents that he's a responsible doctor. However, he's actually a gangster. When they find out the truth, he decides to go to medical school and does. Out of the blue, the previously evil Munna suddenly notices how dispassionate and love-deprived the medical school and hospital are--so he begins doing everything he can to change the place. And, oddly, he begins calling everyone 'dude' and talking like a surfer.""Munna Bhai MBBS"" is a film that has way too much in it. Now I know that it was popular in India...so the filmmakers made the right choices for this movie. But outside of India, I can't see the film doing as well because it actually looks like about five films shoved into one! IMDb says it's a remake of ""Patch Adams""....and much of the movie is also like that. But there's also a lot of Rodney Dangerfield's ""Back to School"", a gangster film, ""Animal House"" as well as, of all things, a Pauly Shore picture! A great example of too much--and a tighter focus could have made the film great.

7.0,"""There's always a first time, dude!""","There were a couple of great takeaways I got from this film. The first was a description of Munna Bhai's (Sanjay Dutt) real profession as a gangster - that of a 'loan default prevention specialist'. I think the Mafia could learn something about softening their strong arm approach by using a term like that. The other idea that came across rather successfully was the concept of a Magic Hug. That was reinforced a few times throughout the story for a positive effect. Other reviewers here on IMDb mention the American film ""Patch Adams"" as the basis for the story line in this picture, but not having seen it, the thought that came to my mind was another Hindi film, "" 3 Idiots"". In that picture, the message that came across was about believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life. In this one, Murli Prasad 'Munna Bhai' Sharma is shamed by his past and decides to make his family proud by becoming a doctor instead of pretending to be one. Additionally, as regards ""3Idiots"", there's also the conflicted relationship between Murli and the dean of his medical colllege, who's daughter serves as a romantic interest for the ex-gangster.The film's best moments appear whenever Murli's unorthodox, humanistic and compassionate side reveals itself, as in his treatment of the near comatose wheelchair patient Anand (Yatin Karyekar). His ability to make friends with everyone he comes in contact with serves him well when the Dean attempts to formally rusticate him from medical school. You know there was only one way for this story to end, and it does, with plenty of magic hugs to go around.",theres always first time dude,there were couple great takeaways i got this film first was description munna bhais sanjay dutt real profession as gangster that loan default prevention specialist i think mafia could learn something about softening their strong arm approach by using term like that other idea that came across rather successfully was concept magic hug that was reinforced few times throughout story positive effect other reviewers here imdb mention american film patch adams as basis story line this picture but not having seen it thought that came my mind was another hindi film 3 idiots that picture message that came across was about believing ones self doing what you really want do with your life this one murli prasad munna bhai sharma is shamed by his past decides make his family proud by becoming doctor instead pretending be one additionally as regards 3idiots theres also conflicted relationship between murli dean his medical colllege whos daughter serves as romantic interest ex gangster films best moments appear whenever murlis unorthodox humanistic compassionate side reveals itself as his treatment near comatose wheelchair patient anand yatin karyekar his ability make friends with everyone he comes contact with serves him well when dean attempts formally rusticate him medical school you know there was only one way this story end it does with plenty magic hugs go around,0.5039772727272728,0.20669191919191918,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.18}"
