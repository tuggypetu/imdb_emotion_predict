10,Sarpatta Parambarai is a rousing boxing marvelous drama. Predictable but worth watch movie. Master class from Arya and Ranjith,"I will start with the negative first, What I have felt negative is caste related dialogues. Ranjith should try to reduce the caste related dialogues. Its not the first movie, each and every movie he is doing the same. Except that movie is fantastic and Must watch movie. Below my opinion about this fantastic movie.One more rocking performance from Arya after Mahamuni. Arya is brilliant as Kabilan and this is definitely one of his top-class performances. Arya is an absolute delight to watch when he is inside the boxing ring. His physical fitness has definitely added more authenticity to the film. However, he looks a little lesser intense in some emotionally charged sequences. Pasupathy is an actor par excellence and he manages to fit into any given character. Pasupathy, as a mentor figure is highly impressive and it is a treat to watch him perform. John Kokken, as Vembuli, strikes well with the action moves. He doesn't have major scope to emote, but with actions, he scores full marks.Dushara Vijayan, as Mariyamma, the female lead, is promising and it looks like Ranjith has spotted another talented actor. Dushara (as Mariyamma) emotes really well when she tries to strike a chord with her husband. Kalaiyarasan leaves a good impact with the limited scope that he gets. John Vijay did his best as anglo Indian. None of the movie, director use him properly. Its one of the best movie for him after Mouna Guru. GM Sundar, Anupama Kumar, Santhosh Prathap, and others play their part well. One of my fav role in this movie is Shabeer Kallarakkal as DANCING ROSE - what an extraordinary character and what a transformation by the actor to play the role. The casting equation is fantastic and due credits to Ranjith and team for picking the right set of actors. After you finish watching the film, it feels like all the actors have lived in their respective roles.Santhosh Narayanan's musical score is one of the biggest strengths of Sarpatta Parambarai. His powerful scores during the boxing matches elevate the energy to a different level. 'Neeye Oli' is great.Sarpatta Parambarai definitely deserves a watch and it will definitely make your time worth it. Watch it for the awe-inspiring dedication of Arya and the effective execution of Pa Ranjith.",sarpatta parambarai is rousing boxing marvelous drama predictable but worth watch movie master class arya ranjith,i will start with negative first what i have felt negative is caste related dialogues ranjith should try reduce caste related dialogues its not first movie each every movie he is doing same except that movie is fantastic must watch movie below my opinion about this fantastic movie one more rocking performance arya after mahamuni arya is brilliant as kabilan this is definitely one his top class performances arya is absolute delight watch when he is inside boxing ring his physical fitness has definitely added more authenticity film however he looks little lesser intense some emotionally charged sequences pasupathy is actor par excellence he manages fit into any given character pasupathy as mentor figure is highly impressive it is treat watch him perform john kokken as vembuli strikes well with action moves he doesnt have major scope emote but with actions he scores full marks dushara vijayan as mariyamma female lead is promising it looks like ranjith has spotted another talented actor dushara as mariyamma emotes really well when she tries strike chord with her husband kalaiyarasan leaves good impact with limited scope that he gets john vijay did his best as anglo indian none movie director use him properly its one best movie him after mouna guru gm sundar anupama kumar santhosh prathap others play their part well one my fav role this movie is shabeer kallarakkal as dancing rose what extraordinary character what transformation by actor play role casting equation is fantastic due credits ranjith team picking right set actors after you finish watching film it feels like all actors have lived their respective roles santhosh narayanans musical score is one biggest strengths sarpatta parambarai his powerful scores during boxing matches elevate energy different level neeye oli is great sarpatta parambarai definitely deserves watch it will definitely make your time worth it watch it awe inspiring dedication arya effective execution pa ranjith,0.523236331569665,0.2513447971781306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.3}"

9,Talk of the town,"Sarpatta Parambarai - My review After the immensely disappointing experience with Jagame Thandhiram I did not have high hopes for Sarpatta Parambarai. I assumed Pa. Ra would have undergone the post-Rajni movie disorientation that Ka. Su went through. Pa. Ra proves otherwise, and I did not regret a minute of watching SarPar.While I was growing up in a small town, there used to be kabaddi tournaments (much before street cricket took over). A rough game that kept many like me away from playing, but we used to enjoy the watching experience. SarPar brings alive that nostalgia. There is this unabashed nativity about this movie with no pretention, that makes you sit up and say 'That's what I wanna watch Bugga'.Here the sport is boxing, which is not played in most of South India. Yet Pa. Ra has creates a convincing experience, which makes you sit for close to 3 hours, with occasional difficulties.The storyline is nothing creative. But the premise and the characters are. The movie opens up and goes on till it sets the stage for what is coming, and only then the title slide comes up. By then, you are either bought in to the plot or you are logging out. There is no in-between.The screen-time of the key characters as compared to the protagonist says it all. It is not a movie about one man. It is about the sport, pride, the clan and the place. Daddy (John Vijay) and Dancing Rose (Shabeer) deserve a loud applause. A memorable role for Pasupathi after a long while.Arya shines with his sincere effort. Arguably his best so far, though his voice fails him yet again. Every other character is worth mentioning. The boxers' references and the research behind their styles are impressive. Very few Tamil directors succeed in that.This movie is not without its flaws. It has many. Make no mistakes, this is an out and out mass entertainer.Looks like it is an unwritten rule (since Rocky or even before) that sports movies should show the routine done-to-death workout sessions where the protagonist turns around from a paunch wielding (fake one though) uncle to 7 packs (or whatever, I lost count) athlete.And that 'slo-mo' for the climax fight was totally unnecessary. The fights in the first half were raw and real.Why should Pa. Ra's strong women be screaming all the while? Every time Arya's (Anupama Kumar) mom comes on screen I could feel my ears bleeding. This woman's shrill voice is deadlier than Vembuli's (John Kokken) punches.The decibel levels of all the characters are unnecessarily high. Everyone is screaming all the time. Anupama still stands out.These flaws, in no way come in the way of the pace of the movie. SarPar is likely to be an everyday topic for many days to come. A must watch.",talk town,sarpatta parambarai my review after immensely disappointing experience with jagame thandhiram i did not have high hopes sarpatta parambarai i assumed pa ra would have undergone post rajni movie disorientation that ka su went through pa ra proves otherwise i did not regret minute watching sarpar while i was growing up small town there used be kabaddi tournaments much before street cricket took over rough game that kept many like me away playing but we used enjoy watching experience sarpar brings alive that nostalgia there is this unabashed nativity about this movie with no pretention that makes you sit up say thats what i wanna watch bugga here sport is boxing which is not played most south india yet pa ra has creates convincing experience which makes you sit close 3 hours with occasional difficulties storyline is nothing creative but premise characters are movie opens up goes till it sets stage what is coming only then title slide comes up by then you are either bought plot or you are logging out there is no between screen time key characters as compared protagonist says it all it is not movie about one man it is about sport pride clan place daddy john vijay dancing rose shabeer deserve loud applause memorable role pasupathi after long while arya shines with his sincere effort arguably his best so far though his voice fails him yet again every other character is worth mentioning boxers references research behind their styles are impressive very few tamil directors succeed that this movie is not without its flaws it has many make no mistakes this is out out mass entertainer looks like it is unwritten rule since rocky or even before that sports movies should show routine done death workout sessions where protagonist turns around paunch wielding fake one though uncle 7 packs or whatever i lost count athlete that slo mo climax fight was totally unnecessary fights first half were raw real why should pa ras strong women be screaming all while every time aryas anupama kumar mom comes screen i could feel my ears bleeding this womans shrill voice is deadlier than vembulis john kokken punches decibel levels all characters are unnecessarily high everyone is screaming all time anupama still stands out these flaws no way come way pace movie sarpar is likely be everyday topic many days come must watch,0.567973137973138,0.11240231990231991,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"

7,World class cinema,"There are two new movies on boxing that are streaming on Prime and it is inevitable that both would be compared with each other. I have one suggestion to the cast and crew of Toofan, that they should hang up their gloves, once and for all.Sarpatta is a length film, clocking at 170 minutes. To me, it seemed like two different movies.The first one that lasts till intermission is 90 minutes long and is mind-blowing. It is humbling to see such world class cinema come out from India. These 90 minutes for me rank amongst the best cinema on boxing, of all time and stand their ground against all time classics such as Raging Bull, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. They are populated by unforgettable characters, moored by their societal roots. There is an element of caste consciousness and strong over current of discrimination. The boxing scenes are shot brilliantly. As I wrote earlier, this is too notch and can be compared with any boxing film of any time.The second half was a let down for me. It ticked all the suspected boxes, which was a let down and ended predictably. It seemed like the effort of lazy writing.The director, Pa Ranjith, gives a masterclass of sense and time. It is the screenplay of the first half, which has so many unforgettable scenes and interactions between real world characters that is the hero. But it's banality in the second half also makes it the unintended villain.Still this is very highly recommended. It might be India's entry to the Oscars and if that happens, it would be worthy of that laurel.",world class cinema,there are two new movies boxing that are streaming prime it is inevitable that both would be compared with each other i have one suggestion cast crew toofan that they should hang up their gloves once all sarpatta is length film clocking at 170 minutes me it seemed like two different movies first one that lasts till intermission is 90 minutes long is mind blowing it is humbling see such world class cinema come out india these 90 minutes me rank amongst best cinema boxing all time stand their ground against all time classics such as raging bull rocky million dollar baby they are populated by unforgettable characters moored by their societal roots there is element caste consciousness strong over current discrimination boxing scenes are shot brilliantly as i wrote earlier this is too notch can be compared with any boxing film any time second half was let down me it ticked all suspected boxes which was let down ended predictably it seemed like effort lazy writing director pa ranjith gives masterclass sense time it is screenplay first half which has so many unforgettable scenes interactions between real world characters that is hero but its banality second half also makes it unintended villain still this is very highly recommended it might be indias entry oscars if that happens it would be worthy that laurel,0.5136441077441077,0.1191639730639731,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,"Director Ranjit, Take a bow, Sir !!","What a comeback, it's been for director Pa. Ranjit, after a great start to his career with films like Attakathi and Madras and losing his way while collaborating with a big star for two lacklustre movies. Ranjit fires on all cylinders, and against all odds to deliver something that has never been delivered to Tamil cinema audiences, a perfect sports drama. Sarpatta Parambarai doesn't have a parallel in the history of Tamil cinema, where the directors usually stick their guns to, age old proven formula laced movies or dud mass entertainers , they very rarely stick out to experiment anything with a substance. Sarpatta Parambarai, delivers not only the substance, but along with it a sting too. The movie not only focuses on the Madras boxing scene in the late 1970s, it also highlights the politics, rivalry, relationships, infrastructure and things at stake during those times. Using Indira Gandhi's emergency as a backdrop within the story is a classic touch indeed.Cinematography is terrific, highly detailed 4K visuals presented in 1:1.85:1 ratio is just perfect for home audiences. Screenplay is fantastically written with so many vibrant characters. I don't think I have seen a Tamil movie with so many characters that are colourful and equally important after Kamal Hassan's Virumandi. Production design just is top class for a Tamil movie, costumes and makeup are highly convincing and excel throughout the movie. Editing is again, fantastic, as the editor doesn't let the pace and intensity drop for a major portion of the movie that has a runtime of a whopping 174 minutes. Santosh Narayan's Background score is apt and doesn't not overshadow Ranjit's hard work. Watch out for the song when the end credits roll.It has been a long time in Tamil cinema where the whole cast has collectively delivered strong acting performances to match Sarpatta Parambarai's quality. The stand out performers in the supporting roles are led by, John Viyay as Kevin/Daddy, Kalaiarasan as Vetriselvan and Pashupathy as Rangan Vaathiyaar. The Rival boxers John Kokken as Vembuli, Santosh Pratap as Raman and Sabeer K as dancing rose too play their parts convincingly. Arya is definitely a much improved actor since Mahamuni, and his acting performance and bodily transformation adds a lot of positives to his career. Even Dushara as wife and Anupama Kumar as the mother have delivered wonderful performances.Overall, Sarpatta Parambarai has a lot of things to work in its favour, be it the Treatment, Quality, characters, acting performances and a wonderful storyline that will make this movie a cult classic. Sarpatta Parambarai will not only end up just as a much loved film, it will carve a place of its own in the history of Tamil cinema and be remembered for a very long time. The movie is Highly Recommended for audiences all over the world, yes it's bit lengthy on the runtime but rest assured the story is packed with lots of vibrant characters and fireworks to keep the movie interesting for, almost its entire duration, I wish it was a 15 minutes shorter. But I am sure that Sarpatta Parambarai will definitely walk into the the hall of fame of Tamil cinema, maybe Indian cinema. It's a shame that movie couldn't make it to cinemas due to the pandemic. Thanks to Amazon prime for delivering it home. 8.0 stars out of 10 for a movie that replicates fifteen rounds of boxing in its storyline & filmmaking.

10,Spectacular !!,"Pa Ranjith may have had strong politics in all his movies but recent ones were boring, uninspiring and plain emotionless. This is the return of Pa Ranjith who made ""Madras"".'Sarpatta Parambarai' is not just another sports drama. This has everything needed for a classic film. An underdog who struggled all his life, a coach who believed in him, haters within his clan and the antagonists.Arya does shine in this film as Kabilan, the protagonist who is looked down upon by the society thanks to his caste ( shown symbolically with dialogues and Ambedkar's poster) and his mother's hatred towards boxing that killed his father. As usual, there is a fitness montage and a fat to fit transformation.Pasupathi is at his best in a role that he brilliantly portrayed as Rangan vadyar (coach Rangan). His body language and acting prowess is the main pillar of the film despite Arya being the main protagonist. At times even we join Kabilan's path in finding out what impresses him and what his reactions are. This is the actor we loved in films like Virumandi.Though the main rivalry between Sarpatta and Idiyappa clan, the ultimate fight of Kabilan vs Vembuli being the major plot target, one man that stays in the mind is 'Dancing Rose' the boxer who flies like the wind, flips inside the ring like a capoeira fighter and stands as a true sportsman even criticized his own men for cheating. Shabeer was made to play Rose. This deserves a standalone film.Overall Sarpatta Parambarai is a bit lengthy yet extremely entertaining with proper character depth and strong story.",spectacular,pa ranjith may have had strong politics all his movies but recent ones were boring uninspiring plain emotionless this is return pa ranjith who made madras sarpatta parambarai is not just another sports drama this has everything needed classic film underdog who struggled all his life coach who believed him haters within his clan antagonists arya does shine this film as kabilan protagonist who is looked down upon by society thanks his caste shown symbolically with dialogues ambedkars poster his mothers hatred towards boxing that killed his father as usual there is fitness montage fat fit transformation pasupathi is at his best role that he brilliantly portrayed as rangan vadyar coach rangan his body language acting prowess is main pillar film despite arya being main protagonist at times even we join kabilans path finding out what impresses him what his reactions are this is actor we loved films like virumandi though main rivalry between sarpatta idiyappa clan ultimate fight kabilan vs vembuli being major plot target one man that stays mind is dancing rose boxer who flies like wind flips inside ring like capoeira fighter stands as true sportsman even criticized his own men cheating shabeer was made play rose this deserves standalone film overall sarpatta parambarai is bit lengthy yet extremely entertaining with proper character depth strong story,0.5081916099773242,0.2223568594104308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10,Best of Ranjith,"Expected this movie to be of the usual sports drama template. Though the overall plot is predictable to some extent, the way the story unfolds will leave you awestruck.Director has taken advantage of the runtime to flesh out so many characters with rich details. Its like each and every characters are worth their own seperate movies. With ripped muscles and unusual accent, Arya lived as Kabilan.",best ranjith,expected this movie be usual sports drama template though overall plot is predictable some extent way story unfolds will leave you awestruck director has taken advantage runtime flesh out so many characters with rich details its like each every characters are worth their own seperate movies with ripped muscles unusual accent arya lived as kabilan,0.4800000000000001,0.24250000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,3 hours of awesomeness!!,"Okay I had huge expectations for this film before watching and I'm afraid this film won't satisfy your expectations. Like it will be even more impressive than you thought this would be.Haven't seen any other sports film in India that's so much raw, detailed, well edited like Sarpatta parambarai. This is like an FPS game where yours is a POV of Chennai in the 1970s.Just to give you how much engaging this film is, the opening scene in this film is 22 minutes. Like just one scene and it's bloody 22 minutes but it was also bloody engrossing. The film runs for 173 minutes and not once do you feel bored.I have to say this but Sarpatta has to be easily the best Indian sports film ever produced just cause this is the actual representation on how life and sports works in India! No hiding from the truth. Not even shying away from political interests among the sportsmen when the 1970s emergency happened. This is way too realistic that sensitive people can easily get offended. Almost gives the same experience Scorsese gave you in Raging bull!The performances gives you a standard to measure someone's performamce next time you watch a good film. Arya is just outstanding! So are Pasupathy,John Vijay, Kalaiyarasan and the ensemble cast out of whom, everyone performed excellently!Pa Ranjith has given a masterpiece to not miss in your life. Go watch Sarpatta Parambarai on Amazon prime NOW!",3 hours awesomeness,okay i had huge expectations this film before watching im afraid this film wont satisfy your expectations like it will be even more impressive than you thought this would be havent seen any other sports film india thats so much raw detailed well edited like sarpatta parambarai this is like fps game where yours is pov chennai 1970s just give you how much engaging this film is opening scene this film is 22 minutes like just one scene its bloody 22 minutes but it was also bloody engrossing film runs 173 minutes not once do you feel bored i have say this but sarpatta has be easily best indian sports film ever produced just cause this is actual representation how life sports works india no hiding truth not even shying away political interests among sportsmen when 1970s emergency happened this is way too realistic that sensitive people can easily get offended almost gives same experience scorsese gave you raging bull performances gives you standard measure someones performamce next time you watch good film arya is just outstanding so are pasupathy john vijay kalaiyarasan ensemble cast out whom everyone performed excellently pa ranjith has given masterpiece not miss your life go watch sarpatta parambarai amazon prime now,0.5828155818540435,0.1632396449704142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.49}"

7,"Great first half, was a drag beyond that.","The downside of doing a boxing movie is there have been several movies before, so what story can you come up with that's new? The first half of this 3hr movie makes you feel like this would be different, but things go downhill after 1.5 hrs, after which, it ends up becoming any other generic boxing movie.The acting was really good by the cast overall, my pick of the lot was John Vijay (Remember Son of Gun from Oram Po?) Great set-design for a period drama, decent music and boxing choreography.This had the potential to be so much more, but I don't think the film lived up to its potential. Too long, too much going on. Toofan was a let down, so was this, but maybe that's just me.If you like a ripped Arya, some good acting + a fast paced first half and don't mind if the 2nd half lets you down, check it out.",great first half was drag beyond that,downside doing boxing movie is there have been several movies before so what story can you come up with thats new first half this 3hr movie makes you feel like this would be different but things go downhill after 1 5 hrs after which it ends up becoming any other generic boxing movie acting was really good by cast overall my pick lot was john vijay remember son gun oram po great set design period drama decent music boxing choreography this had potential be so much more but i dont think film lived up its potential too long too much going toofan was let down so was this but maybe thats just me if you like ripped arya some good acting fast paced first half dont mind if 2nd half lets you down check it out,0.3761770935158032,0.13387911371782338,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.25}"
