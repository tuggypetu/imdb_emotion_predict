8,Subtle and heart touching,"I went to watch this movie under the influence of good reviews and had fairly high expectations. This movie just stood to this test.I would call this story as euphemism - a harsh reality presented in a mild way. Though the story is about two slum kids and the problems they face owing to their poverty, no fuss is made about their craving. Instead it takes shape of a story of their hard work and dedication to fulfill their desire. It manages to touch your heart.Direction is just superb which is assisted by some catchy music. The combination of the story of slum dwellers with some peppy music reminded me of slumdog millionaire.Watch it. Such movies are hard to come by.",subtle heart touching,i went watch this movie under influence good reviews had fairly high expectations this movie just stood this test i would call this story as euphemism harsh reality presented mild way though story is about two slum kids problems they face owing their poverty no fuss is made about their craving instead it takes shape story their hard work dedication fulfill their desire it manages touch your heart direction is just superb which is assisted by some catchy music combination story slum dwellers with some peppy music reminded me slumdog millionaire watch it such movies are hard come by,0.5923333333333333,0.15766666666666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9,Kaaka Muttai is a heart-touching phenomenal apologue of two brothers and their pursuit of wanting to earn Pizza.,"Kaaka Muttai (காக்கா முட்டை) is a Tamil film written, directed and filmed by M Manikandan. Awesome debut with a masterpiece! This film had seen its release in Toronto International Film festival last year on 5th September, 2014. Manikandan has set a new benchmark for the film industry. The film is an apologue of sorts, which deals with so much of relevant and vital issues of our country. Although, we know these realities, we have failed to acknowledge the same, our sensory organs deny to notice these. It appears to be Children's movie since two boys are the lead protagonists, but it actually turns out to be everyone's movie. Manikandan has handled issues viz. Social Class divide, underprivileged children struggling to fulfill their desires, pain of compromising with poverty, child labour, businessmen's power to strike the right chord using money, politician's selfish agenda to cash-in every incident & to turn it in their favour, media's desperate attempts to show a story even without crosschecking the facts etc. Beauty of the movie is that Manikandan is able to convey these messages in a very light but heart-touching manner. I was choked with emotions while watching this movie. I was reflecting continuously how am I contributing to change the things for better. Probably no efforts at all. I just end up writing this film's review and with due respect to every section of the society, somebody will be highlighting the issues through media, people in power might be promising a lot, but in reality, action is missing. How many of us actually become the reason for the change which makes our country a better place for every citizen? The grimness of the issues dealt in the movie is leavened most of the times with a steady stream of fabulous characters. The life of the characters in the movie is being shown through a cinematic spectrum, but it looks like as if we are watching it live and in person. Kaaka Muttai (means Crow's eggs) is the story of two brothers (real names: Vignesh and Ramesh) who live in the area of Chennai. They stay with their mother (Aishwarya Rajesh), paternal grandmother and a pug. Filmmaker has chosen not to give names to these siblings. The two brothers call themselves as Periya Kaaka Muttai (Vignesh) and Chinna Kaaka Muttai (Ramesh). Father is in jail and mother is trying to bail him out. She is working hard to make ends meet. The opening scene itself is an interesting one with younger Kaaka Muttai's bed- wetting. The two brothers enjoy going to a playground where the elder Kaaka Muttai feeds crow with rice which was his share of food and he had filled his pocket with the same hiding from mother and grandmother. They both enjoy having raw kaaka muttai as well. It is disturbing to see these kids (one of them hasn't even stopped bed- wetting), not going to school, but to pick up coal from the railway lines, sell the same to earn a meager sum of Rs. 10 a day. Manikandan's magic is to make these tough scenes also appear light with siblings' banter. If elder Kaaka Muttai demands cell phone from his father, younger one keeps on telling mother to get a TV for him. It is a delight to watch their joy when mother does finally bring a TV and another TV was delivered at home to grandmother as part of government's scheme. The kids lose the playground to developmental activities happening in the city and in no time, trees were cut, ground was leveled and tall structure was standing there. A Pizza store opened which was inaugurated by the actor Silambarasan. Kaaka Muttai(s) and his friends were elated to see the actor eating Pizza. There starts a new desire for both the brothers i.e. to have Pizza. When they learn that it would cost them Rs. 299/- for a Pizza, they decide to earn it. They start working very hard, get help from their friend (an adult friend) Fruit Juice in collecting more coal, sell the same and earn more every day. What happens thereafter? What all these two brothers do? Do they manage to earn Pizza for themselves? If yes, how do they do it? What all they had to face in the process? How do they arrange the resources to have a bite of Pizza. How rest of the cast make a part of this story? It appears to be a simple tale of two brothers desiring to have a bite of Pizza, but this story has been conveyed with so much of depth.Vignesh and Ramesh are the true heroes of the film. They are so convincing throughout the movie. Aishwarya is brilliant as their mother and she has done such a powerful work in the movie. She is persistent in following up with advocate to get her husband back. As a loving mother of two naughty children, she adds so much value. Grandmother is also superb. Rest of the cast are all very good.Lot many scenes are worth mentioning but that may reveal this beautiful story. Let me mention a few scenes. Grandmother's pizza making efforts when she learns about boys' desire to have one. Children going beyond their limits to earn Pizza for themselves. Their befriending a rich boy, and communicating with one another by standing on either side of iron fencing – the social divide is so nicely conveyed. Everyday when they meet, they have some stories to talk about. Another scene is where heart-to-heart conversation between mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law happens. It is heartening to see the relationship between them even amidst crisis.

The amazing subtext of this movie is that humans can find happiness and joy even in the most miserable of situations.Sadly, it also shows how the poor can be completely ignored and humiliated by the ""haves"".

10,Absolutely brilliant subtext. Must watch movie,"To the average viewer this might just be another really good movie. But others who catch the absolutely brilliant subtext throughout the movie will thoroughly enjoy it while at the same time introspect how we never stop to contemplate the miserable inequality in the country in our busy lives(even if we are aware of it and find it woeful, visuals always remind us how bad it really is). It will definitely change the outlook of a lot of people on equality, privilege and related things.The movie follows the life of two slum kids as they aspire to eat from the new pizza shop opened next to their home(if you can call it one). The movie captures their journey as they try to make the money needed for the pizza and the eventual turn of events. The movie beautifully captures the glaring social inequality without you having to cry through it. The movie addresses a lot of issues too in the most subtle manner. There is no dearth for humor either which makes this movie a complete package though it is a bit saddening that we need to look for humor in this movie. And all the actors have done a brilliant job. Kudos to Iyshwarya Rajesh who has gone out of her comfort zone to give a brilliant performance. As for the title you'll figure it out yourself.

8,Great Movie with Award Winning Performances by the Kids,"A simple movie with a simple thought with simple direction with simple little kids' wondrous performances.. The story revolves around two little boys living in the slum and their desire to taste Pizza. Vignesh and Ramesh who portrayed Periya Kakkamuttai and Chinna Kakkamuttai delivered excellent performances throughout the movie. Ishwarya Rajesh did a good job acting as their mother (i think she in her mid 20s). Babu Antony fared well, Yogi Babu & Ramesh Thilak did their comic role in a good way..Thanks for Simbu (after a long time in a feature film) participating in this Dhanush's small venture.Director M. Manikandan did an exciting job with his pen as well as his actions.. His direction was top notch.

7,Subtitle based review of the Crow's nest,""" You can not complete the Indian modern cinema panorama without considering movies from Southern India. My quest for quality cinema has taken a positive beating due to parenthood but this weekend was a lucky one where I choose to see The Crow's egg -Kaakkaa Muttai. I do not know Tamil and this review is based on subtitles. I grew up in gateway of North East part of India ad mist the tea gardens of Darjeeling and my maternal family was from one such tea gardens. As you may know; there were lots of tribes in India and during one of these childhood visits I meet a young tribal man. I profoundly remember his name as Mongru as he befriended me as a child of 5 years old. He used to work as our part time domestic help and always had stories for me, mostly hunting. 'Mongru' had once told me that crow's meat tastes more bitter than Karela(bitter gourd). It was so yuck as a moment that I remember that line even now and writing down today. However, coming back to Kaakkaa Muttai – it puts up a grave social commentary from the angle of a cinema. The story is about two slums kids , brothers, known as elder crow and junior crow as their quest of protein (eggs) makes them steal eggs from the nest and gets them this nick name from the community kids. They dnt mind it at all and even call's their slum home as crow's egg's house.Their act is also supported by their grand mother just because she knows that family can't afford the chicken eggs. The crow brother's father is in Jail and their mother works in a factory to meet ends & legal fees for their father's bail. As life would have it, crow brothers lands up to know about Pizza which sells at INR 300 & does what it takes to have a pizza. The rest of the film is a cinematic journey about the brother's quest to eat a pizza. What makes Kaakkaa Muttai appealing as a cinema is its undercurrent and the flows. It puts forward to you the social issues we see every day but skilfully avoid. The film does take you on the journey of the brothers and their aging grand mother for the quest of the pizza. The film exposes you to child labour, politics, media , consumerism yet it does to lecture you. The cult innocence of the poor brothers who make 10 bucks a day by picking coal off the railway tracks steals your heart. This genre is not new & critic can indeed say that highlighting poverty does not end it. But I wondered Kaakkaa Muttai highlighted the bringing of innocence verses the social imbalance beautifully. This film did indeed remind me of I am Kalam because of close synergies of the casting of leads child actors & back drop but overall both films are brilliant and different. It's a must watch if you like to watch a good cinema & I intentionally avoided the term off beat; as this word depends on which side of fence you are really.But then - I concluded, I thought over & now I know why 'Mongru' tasted that bitter crow's meat. It just took me thirty years to find it. Thank you Kaakkaa Muttai.""",subtitle based review crows nest,you can not complete indian modern cinema panorama without considering movies southern india my quest quality cinema has taken positive beating due parenthood but this weekend was lucky one where i choose see crows egg kaakkaa muttai i do not know tamil this review is based subtitles i grew up gateway north east part india ad mist tea gardens darjeeling my maternal family was one such tea gardens as you may know there were lots tribes india during one these childhood visits i meet young tribal man i profoundly remember his name as mongru as he befriended me as child 5 years old he used work as our part time domestic help always had stories me mostly hunting mongru had once told me that crows meat tastes more bitter than karela bitter gourd it was so yuck as moment that i remember that line even now writing down today however coming back kaakkaa muttai it puts up grave social commentary angle cinema story is about two slums kids brothers known as elder crow junior crow as their quest protein eggs makes them steal eggs nest gets them this nick name community kids they dnt mind it at all even calls their slum home as crows eggs house their act is also supported by their grand mother just because she knows that family cant afford chicken eggs crow brothers father is jail their mother works factory meet ends legal fees their fathers bail as life would have it crow brothers lands up know about pizza which sells at inr 300 does what it takes have pizza rest film is cinematic journey about brothers quest eat pizza what makes kaakkaa muttai appealing as cinema is its undercurrent flows it puts forward you social issues we see every day but skilfully avoid film does take you journey brothers their aging grand mother quest pizza film exposes you child labour politics media consumerism yet it does lecture you cult innocence poor brothers who make 10 bucks day by picking coal off railway tracks steals your heart this genre is not new critic can indeed say that highlighting poverty does not end it but i wondered kaakkaa muttai highlighted bringing innocence verses social imbalance beautifully this film did indeed remind me i am kalam because close synergies casting leads child actors back drop but overall both films are brilliant different its must watch if you like watch good cinema i intentionally avoided term off beat as this word depends which side fence you are really but then i concluded i thought over now i know why mongru tasted that bitter crows meat it just took me thirty years find it thank you kaakkaa muttai,0.43100600600600586,0.12689735189735188,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8,Soul Touching !!,"Kaakkaa Muttai Is a soul touching story of two little boys living in the slums of Chennai city. The story follows the daily lives and the routine hardships endured by kids along with their single mother and grandmother living together in a tiny house, sans any decent facilities. The story takes a bizarre turn when the kids wish to have a pizza in a newly constructed nearby outlet.The beauty of Kaakkaa Muttai lies in its collage of simple characters, whom we come across in our everyday life but never pay any attention about them. Director Manikandan's presents us a barrage of painful moments endured by the characters, like a seasoned painter using rare acrylic colours on a canvas. Full credit to the cinematographer for his presence of mind in capturing the slums with a rustic beauty beyond imagination. Screenplay must be appreciated for its usage of humour in a rather interesting way that I have rarely come across before. Music by GV Prakash Kumar adds soul to Kaakkaa Muttai. Production design, makeup and costumes are all very good and takes Kaakkaa Muttai to a much higher level than it is. Sync sound makes a great difference to the movie and adds a certain flavour to the storytelling.Actors are just outstanding with the best being Aishwarya Rajesh whose terrific performance as a single mother deserves a thunderous applause. The kids, their grandma and the two local goons played by Yogi Babu and Tilak add the necessary Vibrance to Kaakkaa Muttai.Overall the artistry in the actors performance and the dedication to the project by both the cast & crew aided by a great visionary director makes Kaakkaa Muttai a great treat to watch and will be remembered for a long time. A must watch movie for all audiences across the world to understand that everyone will have their desires no matter however small or poor they are.

10,When PIZZA was replaced for the CROW'S EGG.,"India is the world's largest film producer, but when it comes to the international standards, it falls short. They make movies for the domestic market only, just like the largest mango producer in the world and consumes it all with a 1% export rate. Even small countries that have no big market like India competes with the European standards. But in the recent times the changes have been seen, lots of parallel cinemas are made; is what called alternate to the masala films (mixed genres). The young generation supporting it, both from the audience and the filmmaker.The sad thing is they're choosing a wrong movie to represent the country in the Oscars, so as a result ending up with a disappointment every time. I thought last year they failed to pick 'The Lunchbox' as similar to this one for this year. I don't know whether they would have won the trophy, but these films need to be recognised in a big stage like that. Making into the final five reveals all the India films are not random musical beats. So my point is India missed the bus to the venue Dolby Theatre Hollywood, LA, USA for the second consecutive time.This film feels like a feather fallen out of the British film 'Slumdog Millionaire', but it was totally a different genre except sets in and about the slum kids. A simple story, yet very moving. Two young brothers go regularly to pick the crow's egg in an vacant site near their slum since they can't offer chicken eggs. When the place is bought by a largest pizza chain in the city to bring up their new branch, the kids fix their mind to taste their first pizza and put all the effort to make it happen. But again, they have to face all the odds and that's where the narration takes the turn before heading the end.""I want pizza too, not dad.""Without the prior experience the two kids were so awesome in their performances. They two won the best child actor award at the Indian Academy Awards, including the film as the best children's movie of the year. The debutant director really did a great job, especially knowing there's no mass market for newcomers. I think the producers, Dhanush and Vetrimaran to appreciate for this movie to happen. No doubt why it did better at foreign markets than the local. Especially Kollywood does good in the East and Southeast Asia, unlike Bollywood that dominates Europe and North America.You know why this little film is a must see, because Indian films are known for different standards to the rest of the world, but when they make one out of their comfort that puts automatically a must watch. That's not the only reason, there are hundreds of themes yet to explore in Indian cinema and this is one of that. Like the two cute movie characters and their one innocent task, the scenes and music were well supported throughout.Some of the domestic issues that India is suffering from long back like the social status brought into the light with this. There's no equal respect in society for all the communities, only it is judged by their lifestyle. Most of the third world's social backward is only for this reason and obviously the lack of basic education. So it is really good when a movie is not only identified for its entertainment, but the message it carried out. It is an adorable, smart, funny, emotional, enjoyable family movie and one of the best of 2015 other than the Hollywood's or English language films.

9,On a quest to taste pizza,"Two young brothers, living in a Chennai slum area are attracted by the TV advertisement of a pizza outlet. The story is about how the two boys save up enough money to savour the taste of their dream cuisine, despite their destitute existence. The two boys usually eat crows' eggs as a snack, thus naming each other 'Periya Kaaka Muttai' and 'Chinna Kaaka Muttai' respectively. Their roles are played by child actors Ramesh and Vignesh, who would later go on to win the National Film Award for Best Child Actor in 2015. Aishwarya Rajesh excels as the boys' mother who saves every little penny she can, to bail her husband out of jail. Shanti Mani as the boys' grandma is endearing.

8,An Outstanding Satire,"Their father is in jail and the mother is doing her best to cobble together the lawyer's fee so that he can be brought home on bail. But the two kids, in a Chennai slum, whom we know only as Little Crow's Egg and Big Crow's Egg, nonchalantly go about their daily routine, which includes stealing eggs from crow's nest and coal from the nearby railway tracks. This, dare I say, tranquil world is rocked when a pizza chain sets up shop outside their slum, and gets it inaugurated by a film star. The 2 kids start lusting for a slice of the pizza. 300 Rupees, which is required for the pizza, is far beyond their reach. But when they finally have that money in hand, a dramatic turn of events shakes up the entire city.Kaaka Muttai (Crow's Egg) uses the pizza as a metaphor to deliver a powerful social message. It is to the credit of the director that he doesn't make a sermon out of it. Kaaka Muttai is thoroughly enjoyable, even entertaining in a comical way, but every frame is replete with meaning. It asks uncomfortable questions of us, much like an innocent child is wont to do. The script is clever and takes unexpected twists towards an entirely unpredictable denouement. The performances are natural by non-actors and this further uplifts the film to a brilliant satire. Kaaka Muttai's family gets 2 TV sets from the government because they have 2 ration cards, but they don't have enough food for even one square meal. The cuckoo lays its eggs in the crow's nest and fools it into hatching them.

7,Worth all the hype.,"Whenever I go for a movie with great expectations, even if it turns out to be reasonably good, I won't usually be satisfied. But Kaaka Muttai is no such movie. Go in with great expectations and it will deliver a lot more. (Well I should warn it's no typical mass pot boiler as well.) it has a simple plot of two young brothers from a Chennai slum and their desire to eat pizza. But it's actually an allegory of the disparity between the affluent and the poor in our society.The film is all light hearted and feel - good and witty on the surface but it pivots around the serious issue of class divide. The rich throwing their influence and money around for further advancements of their interests, wily politicians and their cunningness to exploit both the rich and the poor according to how the situation suits them, the poor and their hardships with no chance of any advancement, the media with its penchant for sensationalizing any news, it's all very well depicted.There is a scene where the brothers, who unassuming to them are in the middle of a media/social storm, walk by a TV reporter covering about them, are shooed away from getting in the 'frame' of the shoot. The message is not emphasized upon. But it gets through clearly.Vignesh and Ramesh who play the lead characters.. how can they act so well? Iyshwarya who plays the kids mother, have given a performance that could shame any established star. And what a directorial debut by Manikandan! He is a name to look forward to.It was heartening to see subtitles being played in a theater in Kottayam. The film having had a run in the festival circuit before its mainstream release might have had something to do with it. Subtitles would only bring in more crowd to theaters and I don't understand why regional movies don't use them.Beautifully shot, very well written, Kaaka Muttai is definitely worth a visit to the theater.",worth all hype,whenever i go movie with great expectations even if it turns out be reasonably good i wont usually be satisfied but kaaka muttai is no such movie go with great expectations it will deliver lot more well i should warn its no typical mass pot boiler as well it has simple plot two young brothers chennai slum their desire eat pizza but its actually allegory disparity between affluent poor our society film is all light hearted feel good witty surface but it pivots around serious issue class divide rich throwing their influence money around further advancements their interests wily politicians their cunningness exploit both rich poor according how situation suits them poor their hardships with no chance any advancement media with its penchant sensationalizing any news its all very well depicted there is scene where brothers who unassuming them are middle media social storm walk by tv reporter covering about them are shooed away getting frame shoot message is not emphasized upon but it gets through clearly vignesh ramesh who play lead characters how can they act so well iyshwarya who plays kids mother have given performance that could shame any established star what directorial debut by manikandan he is name look forward it was heartening see subtitles being played theater kottayam film having had run festival circuit before its mainstream release might have had something do with it subtitles would only bring more crowd theaters i dont understand why regional movies dont use them beautifully shot very well written kaaka muttai is definitely worth visit theater,0.5459293394777266,0.23978494623655913,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.51}"

3,Could had been better,"The movie is OK, but not worth the hype. There are better movies of the same theme. The award was a good ad for the movie. Most jokes are gross, the movie seems long, boring. The theme maybe great or new for people who never even thought or read about slum kids, overall a 'average boring social themed' movie made great by awards and media hype.My friend said me not to go for this movie, but i went based on newspaper reviews. After 20 minutes i understood why my friend advised me not to go.",could had been better,movie is ok but not worth hype there are better movies same theme award was good ad movie most jokes are gross movie seems long boring theme maybe great or new people who never even thought or read about slum kids overall average boring social themed movie made great by awards media hype my friend said me not go this movie but i went based newspaper reviews after 20 minutes i understood why my friend advised me not go,0.44977718360071295,0.12468805704099821,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
