9,It's just riveting and picture perfect,"Yes it is remake, but that doesn't mean it's any lesser. In fact i believe making a remake is a difficult job. For all the people who say the original movie was better, of course you would believe that as this concept and movie did not exist before the original script so you will like it more. But now that you have a frame of reference, doing a remake of a successful movie is very difficult as you have cater to the demographic who know what the movie is about.Yes people might say it is hit only because of a remake, but i would strongly disagree, it is a delight to watch because the remake is done just right. Kadhalaku Mariydhai, Nanban are prime example.Leave aside all those controversies, from the premise till the end, this is one movie that paces really well. Though a simple concept of saving the family, the actors have brought their A-game, fantastic performances from everyone. Needless to say anything about Kamal Hassan, he makes everything looks so easy and so realistic, he has always been best in any role that he plays and even here he just steals the show. Having said that, it would be easy for the director to be tempted to keep Kamal in all frames and make the movie a success, but not to be. Everyone has been given a fair share of the screen space and they have given a scintillating act every time.Although i know the movie was long, i never felt bored at any point, a feel that i get from a Tarantino movie. The screenplay was perfect, the actors were placed in the right place at right time. The plot twists were great and just when you thought you know everything the movie creeps with something new, i really loved that.In a intriguing movie like this, you have to feel for the characters and you really do. That's a exceptional win-win for the actors in the movie. Even though ethically what they are doing are wrong, you understand what will happen if only you were truthful at all times, and you totally buy that. Frame by frame the movie passes with wonderful continuity and even when it ends, it just does not snap, it is a thorough and clear closure, which says a lot about the director It's easy for movies such as this to be absurdly stupid and leave many plot holes for the audience to explore but the director covers all plot syncs and when you backtrack what went on, you can easily connect the dots and agree to the fact though the hero is selfish, you have to be selfish at some times to survive in this world. What happened was a accident, but in a perfect world you could come out with the truth and people will look at 2 sides of a coin and take the right judgment, but we are not in a perfect world. At the end when Kamal explains what would happen if the tables were turned, it is a right explanation. How a Mother would handle would be different from what a Mother with power would handle a situation.A Small negative would be that the premise about the Hero could have been shortened a bit, maybe less 15 minutes, his love interest for his wife was totally unwarranted, looks like Kamal's personal choice than anything else. But that does not affect the movie in anyway and can be easily overlooked.You will like every character, you could relate to the fear in their eyes, the plot was simple and understandable, the connectors were very well used and screenplay was paced just right. A movie for everyone in the family and through entertainer",its just riveting picture perfect,yes it is remake but that doesnt mean its any lesser fact i believe making remake is difficult job all people who say original movie was better course you would believe that as this concept movie did not exist before original script so you will like it more but now that you have frame reference doing remake successful movie is very difficult as you have cater demographic who know what movie is about yes people might say it is hit only because remake but i would strongly disagree it is delight watch because remake is done just right kadhalaku mariydhai nanban are prime example leave aside all those controversies premise till end this is one movie that paces really well though simple concept saving family actors have brought their game fantastic performances everyone needless say anything about kamal hassan he makes everything looks so easy so realistic he has always been best any role that he plays even here he just steals show having said that it would be easy director be tempted keep kamal all frames make movie success but not be everyone has been given fair share screen space they have given scintillating act every time although i know movie was long i never felt bored at any point feel that i get tarantino movie screenplay was perfect actors were placed right place at right time plot twists were great just when you thought you know everything movie creeps with something new i really loved that intriguing movie like this you have feel characters you really do thats exceptional win win actors movie even though ethically what they are doing are wrong you understand what will happen if only you were truthful at all times you totally buy that frame by frame movie passes with wonderful continuity even when it ends it just does not snap it is thorough clear closure which says lot about director its easy movies such as this be absurdly stupid leave many plot holes audience explore but director covers all plot syncs when you backtrack what went you can easily connect dots agree fact though hero is selfish you have be selfish at some times survive this world what happened was accident but perfect world you could come out with truth people will look at 2 sides coin take right judgment but we are not perfect world at end when kamal explains what would happen if tables were turned it is right explanation how mother would handle would be different what mother with power would handle situation small negative would be that premise about hero could have been shortened bit maybe less 15 minutes his love interest his wife was totally unwarranted looks like kamals personal choice than anything else but that does not affect movie anyway can be easily overlooked you will like every character you could relate fear their eyes plot was simple understandable connectors were very well used screenplay was paced just right movie everyone family through entertainer,0.6545365703947791,0.20977337339277638,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,A GOOD Film,"One might wonder why state an obvious fact as Kamal Haasan is brilliant in the movie. But this reputation is what acts as the value addition to his presence in Papanasam. What connects Kamal Haasan and Suyambu Lingam (Kamal's character in Papanasam) is the image they have earned among their people. While the nation would vouch for Kamal's unmatchable skills in the field of acting, Suyambu Lingam has his people in Papanasam to vouch for his character and intellect. Suyambu Lingam also reflects another well known trait of Kamal - the self learned genius. Last, but definitely not the least, all credits to director Jeethu Joseph and his team of writers, for a brilliant tale and for extracting the best from each member of the team.Papanasam is an honest remake with every bit of element retained to its full strength.Again KAMALHASAN proved he is the GREATEST ACTOR in India.",good film,one might wonder why state obvious fact as kamal haasan is brilliant movie but this reputation is what acts as value addition his presence papanasam what connects kamal haasan suyambu lingam kamals character papanasam is image they have earned among their people while nation would vouch kamals unmatchable skills field acting suyambu lingam has his people papanasam vouch his character intellect suyambu lingam also reflects another well known trait kamal self learned genius last but definitely not least all credits director jeethu joseph his team writers brilliant tale extracting best each member team papanasam is honest remake with every bit element retained its full strength again kamalhasan proved he is greatest actor india,0.5742424242424242,0.509090909090909,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9,Every act is fair from their own perspective!,"The title represents a small town where the story takes place. An opportunity to see the old Kamal Haasan. It was like been ages, seen him in this kind of attire, especially Tirunelveli accent was phenomenal. As usual, his performance and expressions stole the show and none others were matched his par in the movie. Nothing wrong to call it was his show. Kind of addicted to 'Yeya En Kottikkaara' song. A typical Tamil song, if you are, you might feel the deep.It was a remake of the Malayalam movie 'Drishyam', which was inspired by the Japanese novel 'The Devotion of Suspect X'. I have not seen the original movie, but seen the Japanese version based on the same book. There are no major comparisons, except the crime, the rest was completely rewritten to suit the Indian audience. But the writer denies, by saying neither book adaptation nor inspired.I have heard that the narration was very emotional and the characters were more guilt feel than the Malayalam. Initially Rajnikath was considered for the main role, but happy it went to Kamal Haasan. None other than him would have suited better to portray Suyambulingam. He would definitely bring the emotions out of you easily. After Sivaji, he's the king of those roles. At the plenty of the scenes I was amazed by his execution, especially in the end scene when he finally breakdown with guilt.I don't believe when people say the original version is a must watch. Every film industry in India has fine actors, especially this film recruited their best as of I have heard. So I recommend your native version or the closest one to opt. The advantage in the remakes are, a chance to fix if there were any flaws in the original. Since it was directed by the same filmmaker, I strongly suggest the neural audience to pick between the original and this one, because of the naturalistic portrayal of the rural family. But if you prefer stylish, especially for the non- Indian, there's always Bollywood.9/10",every act is fair their own perspective,title represents small town where story takes place opportunity see old kamal haasan it was like been ages seen him this kind attire especially tirunelveli accent was phenomenal as usual his performance expressions stole show none others were matched his par movie nothing wrong call it was his show kind addicted yeya en kottikkaara song typical tamil song if you are you might feel deep it was remake malayalam movie drishyam which was inspired by japanese novel devotion suspect x i have not seen original movie but seen japanese version based same book there are no major comparisons except crime rest was completely rewritten suit indian audience but writer denies by saying neither book adaptation nor inspired i have heard that narration was very emotional characters were more guilt feel than malayalam initially rajnikath was considered main role but happy it went kamal haasan none other than him would have suited better portray suyambulingam he would definitely bring emotions out you easily after sivaji hes king those roles at plenty scenes i was amazed by his execution especially end scene when he finally breakdown with guilt i dont believe when people say original version is must watch every film industry india has fine actors especially this film recruited their best as i have heard so i recommend your native version or closest one opt advantage remakes are chance fix if there were any flaws original since it was directed by same filmmaker i strongly suggest neural audience pick between original this one because naturalistic portrayal rural family but if you prefer stylish especially non indian theres always bollywood 9 10,0.5861904761904764,0.19350198412698416,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,Birth of the Family-Thriller Genre.,"Amir Khan once said about Kamal Haasan, ""There are some things he can do that others can but there are many things Kamal can do that no other actor can."" Once again, this film stands as a testament, particularly in witnessing that this same film is being remade in several Indian languages, showcasing the talents of several lead actors, since its conception as the Malayalam film; Drishyam, with Mohanlal.I've heard many people say that they are partial to the original malayalam version - perhaps because they saw it first? But there is another side to this story. A filmmaker rarely gets the chance to do the same film twice, and if he is still as passionate about the story the second or third time, each time he makes it, he perfects the telling just a little more... I often hear stories about writers/directors lamenting about how they would look back at their work and notice mistakes they made that they would love to do-over had they been given the chance.With Papanasam, what I see is the director, Jeethu Joseph, having improved upon himself. Of all the versions of the film I have seen, the tamil film comes across by far the most subtle - and that is in particular due to Kamal Haasan's sensibilities and energy permeating and influencing the cast, I feel.So, personally, yes, the tamil version is the best! I understand that people who are sentimental towards 'originals' might not agree, but I think if you were willing to be impartial and unbiased, it is difficult to miss the perfection of this film in the tamil version.Great thrills in the second half - a real roller-coaster ride!",birth family thriller genre,amir khan once said about kamal haasan there are some things he can do that others can but there are many things kamal can do that no other actor can once again this film stands as testament particularly witnessing that this same film is being remade several indian languages showcasing talents several lead actors since its conception as malayalam film drishyam with mohanlal ive heard many people say that they are partial original malayalam version perhaps because they saw it first but there is another side this story filmmaker rarely gets chance do same film twice if he is still as passionate about story second or third time each time he makes it he perfects telling just little more i often hear stories about writers directors lamenting about how they would look back at their work notice mistakes they made that they would love do over had they been given chance with papanasam what i see is director jeethu joseph having improved upon himself all versions film i have seen tamil film comes across by far most subtle that is particular due kamal haasans sensibilities energy permeating influencing cast i feel so personally yes tamil version is best i understand that people who are sentimental towards originals might not agree but i think if you were willing be impartial unbiased it is difficult miss perfection this film tamil version great thrills second half real roller coaster ride,0.4232323232323233,0.13510101010101008,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8,The DRISHYAM saga continues to make us proud of our Indian Cinema with the team excelling once again led by Kamal Hassan.,"Beginning on a serious note, I really feel sorry looking at the way our Indian regional cinema is ignored by the Hindi film viewing audience, considering it always something loud, over the top and action based fast moving drama to be eluded. In fact it really makes you feel the pain finding a film like DRISHYAM (Malayalam) not reaching a wider audience all over the country despite being capable of redefining 'Indian Cinema' breaking all the preset notions and assumptions about regional movies.Anyway moving ahead of the film's original concept and its similarities with a foreign flick here are my honest views about the worthy, must watch remake given below.Directed by Jeethu Joseph himself (the man behind DRISHYAM), PAPANASAM is a very loyal remake of its original since it even follows the lengthy first half as it is, that was pointed out to be 'a drawback' by many viewers and critics together. But looking at these initial 40 minutes of the film from a different viewpoint, it does help in building a solid base of individual friendships, rivalry and family-bonding having their own interconnected importance in the later crucial part of the film as required.The biggest attraction of PAPANASAM (literally meaning 'Destruction of Sins') remains Kamal Hassan returning to his much adored portrayal of a simple, common man that was missing in most of his recent films featuring all 'heroic' or 'larger-than-life' characters away from reality. So here we have a loved maestro (Kamal) carrying the bright torch lit by another hugely respected maestro (Mohanlal) with the same dedication, sincerity and perfection that deserves to be experienced as a must.Plus PAPANASAM also has Gauthami reappearing on screen after many years, once again proving her immense talent in the tough role superbly. In fact it was great watching them together as a couple making me recall those lighter days of APPU RAJA and many more. Just like the original the entire supporting cast here is again well chosen (a few retained from the original), contributing hugely in the overall impact of the film with many key sequences bringing you onto the edge of your seats repeatedly. Having a longer duration (3 hours) than the Malayalam film, PAPANASAM has a couple of catchy tracks and a powerful background score that successfully takes the film to the next level undoubtedly. And one of the major highlights of the film is its climax conversation scene between Ananth Mahadevan (better than the original) and Kamal Hassan that forces you to join your hands together praising their commendable job wholeheartedly.No doubt, comparison between the two veterans is bound to become a matter of debate within film institutions & keen students of cinema in the coming months or years. But ideally instead of comparison, one should focus on the different approaches followed by the two in their individual portrayals on screen deserving a huge applause.To give you the exact gist, where Mohanlal's solid act in DRISHYAM stressed more on intelligence, confidence, patience and ruthless expressions in his interpretation of a concerned father, there Kamal Hassan in PAPANASAM keeps emotions in front and stays an intelligent emotional father right till the finale sequence crying in front of Ananth Mahadevan. And this major difference in their respective visions can be studied in the police torture scene & the climax in particular, dealt distinctively.However in my personal opinion since a super composed, intelligent and less emotional personality remains more close to the 'thinking' character of the father hiding the unintentional crime, therefore Mohanlal and his DRISHYAM stays 'one step ahead' venture for me putting it honestly. But at the same time that doesn't allow me to rate PAPANASAM any lower deserving an equal praise, successfully giving you the same pulsating, unpredictable, emotional and mind boggling experience in the theatre that needs to be cherished at the earliest without any slightest of doubt. Moreover it also becomes a must watch for the younger generation in particular since it raises a valid question on the use of all new age gadgets that can become both a boon as well as a curse if used with wrong intentions following an evil mind.Coming back to the subject of regional films, if after reading and listening such strong positive views about the exceptional content of Malayalam DRISHYAM and now the Tamil PAPANASAM all over the media, if you still haven't seen any of these films due to some of your own (silly) language reservations. then that's like a crime committed will-fully by a supposedly true lover of great cinema if I must say that.",drishyam saga continues make us proud our indian cinema with team excelling once again led by kamal hassan,beginning serious note i really feel sorry looking at way our indian regional cinema is ignored by hindi film viewing audience considering it always something loud over top action based fast moving drama be eluded fact it really makes you feel pain finding film like drishyam malayalam not reaching wider audience all over country despite being capable redefining indian cinema breaking all preset notions assumptions about regional movies anyway moving ahead films original concept its similarities with foreign flick here are my honest views about worthy must watch remake given below directed by jeethu joseph himself man behind drishyam papanasam is very loyal remake its original since it even follows lengthy first half as it is that was pointed out be drawback by many viewers critics together but looking at these initial 40 minutes film different viewpoint it does help building solid base individual friendships rivalry family bonding having their own interconnected importance later crucial part film as required biggest attraction papanasam literally meaning destruction sins remains kamal hassan returning his much adored portrayal simple common man that was missing most his recent films featuring all heroic or larger than life characters away reality so here we have loved maestro kamal carrying bright torch lit by another hugely respected maestro mohanlal with same dedication sincerity perfection that deserves be experienced as must plus papanasam also has gauthami reappearing screen after many years once again proving her immense talent tough role superbly fact it was great watching them together as couple making me recall those lighter days appu raja many more just like original entire supporting cast here is again well chosen few retained original contributing hugely overall impact film with many key sequences bringing you onto edge your seats repeatedly having longer duration 3 hours than malayalam film papanasam has couple catchy tracks powerful background score that successfully takes film next level undoubtedly one major highlights film is its climax conversation scene between ananth mahadevan better than original kamal hassan that forces you join your hands together praising their commendable job wholeheartedly no doubt comparison between two veterans is bound become matter debate within film institutions keen students cinema coming months or years but ideally instead comparison one should focus different approaches followed by two their individual portrayals screen deserving huge applause give you exact gist where mohanlals solid act drishyam stressed more intelligence confidence patience ruthless expressions his interpretation concerned father there kamal hassan papanasam keeps emotions front stays intelligent emotional father right till finale sequence crying front ananth mahadevan this major difference their respective visions can be studied police torture scene climax particular dealt distinctively however my personal opinion since super composed intelligent less emotional personality remains more close thinking character father hiding unintentional crime therefore mohanlal his drishyam stays one step ahead venture me putting it honestly but at same time that doesnt allow me rate papanasam any lower deserving equal praise successfully giving you same pulsating unpredictable emotional mind boggling experience theatre that needs be cherished at earliest without any slightest doubt moreover it also becomes must watch younger generation particular since it raises valid question use all new age gadgets that can become both boon as well as curse if used with wrong intentions following evil mind coming back subject regional films if after reading listening such strong positive views about exceptional content malayalam drishyam now tamil papanasam all over media if you still havent seen any these films due some your own silly language reservations then thats like crime committed will fully by supposedly true lover great cinema if i must say that,0.5682066404543468,0.18572289076876242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10,Surpasses the original!,"This is a rare instance where the remake surpasses the original. Not many remakes do that. But Tamil cinema has quite a few memorable instances like Ghilli and Vasoolraja MBBS that stepped above the remakes and became better films. Papanasam joins that list now. Kamal Haasan makes Mohanlal look so uninteresting, bland and inept. Yes, that final climax scene was slightly overdose of the melodramatic Kamal Haasan but that's his strength and that's why people love him. He comes from the Sivaji school of acting (his mentor is Sivaji Ganesan as said by him umpteen times).The film is so superbly blended into the Tamil nativity that a lot of effort and detail have been done by the makers to achieve this. The girl who plays the elder daughter is top notch, and so is the younger one. Gautami passes muster. Asha Sharrath (the cop) is as brilliant as she did in the original. Kalabhavan Mani goes one step above the original's actor to deliver a knockout performance. The music greatly aids the film with the haunting background score (very well done Ghibran). Overall, the Kamal Haasan factor lifts the film above the original easily. Note: I watched Drishyam (Malayalam) first, but now I regret it. I wish I watched Papanasam first. But out of the two, I will end up watching Papanasam again.",surpasses original,this is rare instance where remake surpasses original not many remakes do that but tamil cinema has quite few memorable instances like ghilli vasoolraja mbbs that stepped above remakes became better films papanasam joins that list now kamal haasan makes mohanlal look so uninteresting bland inept yes that final climax scene was slightly overdose melodramatic kamal haasan but thats his strength thats why people love him he comes sivaji school acting his mentor is sivaji ganesan as said by him umpteen times film is so superbly blended into tamil nativity that lot effort detail have been done by makers achieve this girl who plays elder daughter is top notch so is younger one gautami passes muster asha sharrath cop is as brilliant as she did original kalabhavan mani goes one step above originals actor deliver knockout performance music greatly aids film with haunting background score very well done ghibran overall kamal haasan factor lifts film above original easily note i watched drishyam malayalam first but now i regret it i wish i watched papanasam first but out two i will end up watching papanasam again,0.5166666666666667,0.2537037037037037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.54, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.15}"
5,Appealing To The Tamil Audience. ♦ 50%,"Please skip this review if you have not watched the original Malayalam film, Drishyam (2013).The idea behind Papanasam is a cash cow from filmmaker Jeethu Joseph. While he cashed in on the original Malayalam film, which was terrific for a Malayali like me, he also dressed as the writer for the Telugu and Kannada remakes and will also be donning the same cap for the Hindi release.Sparing you further insight about the maker and his traits, the film works mostly because of its village setting, a family drama, and the suspense that grips its viewer for most of the 160 minutes. There are lots of things to think about here, starting from the ethics that surrounds a crime.It will highly appeal to the Tamil audience, but if you are one of that guy who has already watched the original version or one of its two remakes, chances are that you will definitely compare the films. And the comparison will let you down.BOTTOM LINE: Papanasam is of course a brilliant thriller, and it will look amazing if and only if you have not watched the original Malayalam film and you have not read the book The Devotion of Suspect X.VERDICT: 5 stars out of 10.

7,How far would you go to save your loved ones,"Papanasam (2015) review: Remakes from Malayalam are not new for Tamil film industry. To name a few the recent successful 36 vayadhinile, Yester year's success movies like Friends, kadhaluku Mariyadhai, Chandramookhi, Ninaithale Inikum Kuselan, perazhagan etc Drishyam was a one of the blockbuster Malayalam movies of all times. The successful movie went to speak Telugu, Kannada and proved its worth in both reprisals. Following that it was remade in Tamil and Hindi (yet to hit the screens). Who knows this script might be reprised in other languages as well in future.Papanasam is a family drama – thriller. Since the story and screenplay is well known for almost all south Indian Cinema viewers. Kamal has not added anything extra to the script he seems to be the clear director's artist in the movie. The story is about an ordinary village man trying to save his loved ones who has committed a situational crime. The Nellai nativity flows all over the story applause the writer Jeya Mohan who has penned the dialogues. When it comes to the performances obliviously we have the ultimate show from the Ace actor and the legendary film star Kamalhassan. Asha Sharath who has reprised the same role has done 100% justice to her role as an I.G and a sobbing mother. Nivedha Thomas as the daughter fits comfortably on the role. The entire team was a good pick for the roles.Plus points of the film would be definitely Kamal's acting, the script and the gripping story line. On the contrary the length of the movie seemed too long almost 3 hours ten minutes and the initial portion of the movie to introduce the characters was bit long journey before the actual turning point of the movie.Overall for those who didn't watch Drishyam this would be an ultimate family thriller. For the other viewers definitely the flavour of Drishyam would be missing throughout because originals stay in your mind which is inevitable.-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran",how far would you go save your loved ones,papanasam 2015 review remakes malayalam are not new tamil film industry name few recent successful 36 vayadhinile yester years success movies like friends kadhaluku mariyadhai chandramookhi ninaithale inikum kuselan perazhagan etc drishyam was one blockbuster malayalam movies all times successful movie went speak telugu kannada proved its worth both reprisals following that it was remade tamil hindi yet hit screens who knows this script might be reprised other languages as well future papanasam is family drama thriller since story screenplay is well known almost all south indian cinema viewers kamal has not added anything extra script he seems be clear directors artist movie story is about ordinary village man trying save his loved ones who has committed situational crime nellai nativity flows all over story applause writer jeya mohan who has penned dialogues when it comes performances obliviously we have ultimate show ace actor legendary film star kamalhassan asha sharath who has reprised same role has done 100 justice her role as i g sobbing mother nivedha thomas as daughter fits comfortably role entire team was good pick roles plus points film would be definitely kamals acting script gripping story line contrary length movie seemed too long almost 3 hours ten minutes initial portion movie introduce characters was bit long journey before actual turning point movie overall those who didnt watch drishyam this would be ultimate family thriller other viewers definitely flavour drishyam would be missing throughout because originals stay your mind which is inevitable reviewed by sivakumar balachandran,0.4573021885521886,0.14532828282828283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.44}"

6,"Great story, but too long and excessively violent 2nd half","The movie's story is really good & no wonder the original movie Drishyam was a superhit. However this tamil version Papanasam is too long, especially in the 2nd half. I feel that the no. of interrogation scenes could have been reduced as several of them were redundant & pointlessly adding to the length of the movie. Secondly, the police brutality in the 2nd half was too excessive and uncalled for. I don't care if the Director wanted to portray the harsh reality of police torture, he should be knowing that this is a U-rated family drama that kids will also like to watch, unlike a violent action movie that you'll want them to avoid watching. I heard that the original Drishyam movie is not as violent as the Tamil version and not as long, hence in that aspect I would not rate Papanasam highly.",great story but too long excessively violent 2nd half,movies story is really good no wonder original movie drishyam was superhit however this tamil version papanasam is too long especially 2nd half i feel that no interrogation scenes could have been reduced as several them were redundant pointlessly adding length movie secondly police brutality 2nd half was too excessive uncalled i dont care if director wanted portray harsh reality police torture he should be knowing that this is u rated family drama that kids will also like watch unlike violent action movie that youll want them avoid watching i heard that original drishyam movie is not as violent as tamil version not as long hence that aspect i would not rate papanasam highly,0.44125,-0.060000000000000005,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.35}"
