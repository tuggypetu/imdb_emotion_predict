8.0,King of Comedy.,"Mehmood, was not only a comedian's comedian. but a great actor. He left indelible mark with this movie, which will remain the Classic of Hindi Comedy. The movie was shot on Location in Mysore, where Visveshwarya the ""Einstein"" of India built the K.R. Sagar Dam and the breath taking Brindavan Gardens.The beauty of this movie, was the incredible casting. Sunil Dutt,was perfectly cast as the naive and stupid ""Bhola"" and, what a natural performance from an actor. The newer genre of actors are pale by comparison and their mediocre talent is put on pedestal and worshiped. Rahul Dev Burman, the son of the legend Sacchin Dev Burman (Guide), created some of the best tunes (""Thumhi Dulahi"" ""Kehna Hai"",and the greatest romantic and heart-tugging song ever in an Hindi movie ""Sharm Aati Hai Magar"" when 'Bindu' sings for 'Bhola' at his bed-side) for this movie, every song, is hummable immortal melody that was picture perfect on the characters, that included the greatest singing/acting talent of Kishore Kumar as ""Guru"". Saira Banu, who was at the peak of her career, looked gorgeous. She eventually caught the attention of the then thespian, Dilip Kumar, ending in matrimony. The Ace, was Mehmood, with his inimitable accent and style as ""Masterji"" will remain forever in our memory. I would consider this movie as one of the ""Top Ten Hindi Films of All Times."" The only movie that would come close is ""Hera-Pheri"" and Paresh Rawal, is the only comedian, that would come close to the Comedic Genius--that was Mehmood.",king comedy,mehmood was not only comedians comedian but great actor he left indelible mark with this movie which will remain classic hindi comedy movie was shot location mysore where visveshwarya einstein india built k r sagar dam breath taking brindavan gardens beauty this movie was incredible casting sunil dutt was perfectly cast as naive stupid bhola what natural performance actor newer genre actors are pale by comparison their mediocre talent is put pedestal worshiped rahul dev burman son legend sacchin dev burman guide created some best tunes thumhi dulahi kehna hai greatest romantic heart tugging song ever hindi movie sharm aati hai magar when bindu sings bhola at his bed side this movie every song is hummable immortal melody that was picture perfect characters that included greatest singing acting talent kishore kumar as guru saira banu who was at peak her career looked gorgeous she eventually caught attention then thespian dilip kumar ending matrimony ace was mehmood with his inimitable accent style as masterji will remain forever our memory i would consider this movie as one top ten hindi films all times only movie that would come close is hera pheri paresh rawal is only comedian that would come close comedic genius that was mehmood,0.6634848484848485,0.288939393939394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,One of the greatest comedies of Indian Cinema,"Padosan, who hasn't heard of it? Well if you are one of those unfortunate souls who hasn't, I feel terribly saddened for your state. You my friend, need a good lesson in Indian Cinema. I suggest you start by watching this film.Padosan, which means 'Neighbor' is the story of Bhola (Sunil Dutt) who li ke his name is a very naive and innocent soul who happens to see Bindu(Saira Banu) and falls in love with her. He later finds out that she is his neighbor. We find out that Bindu is enamored with music and into the picture comes her music teacher, Masterji (Mehmood) who aside from being a bumbling fool who speaks in Tamil accented Hindi, is also in love with Bindu. So back to our Bhola bala hero. He tries to woo her but to no avail until he enlists the help of his friend and mentor Guru (Kishore Kumar) who owns an acting troupe of which Bhola is a part of.After much investigation, Guru and his friends discover that Bindu's soft spot is music. But unfortunately our Bhola is quite the novice when it comes to singing, sounding more like a braying donkey than a singing suitor. And so begins one of the whackiest cons in cinema. Guru sings, and Bhola lip-syncs. Guru's (Kishore Kumar's) voice being what it is, bewitches Bindu and she starts falling for Bhola. This development thwarts Masterji's master plan of marrying Bindu. So now begins a jugal-bandi between Masterji and Guru (ahem Bhola) for Bindu's affections.With such a whacky plot, there are laughs aplenty. Add master comedians Mehmood and Kishore Kumar and a funny looking Sunil Dutt, you have the perfect recipe for a hilariously whacky romantic comedy. Saira Banu, oozing of charm is quite good as the spoilt Bindu. Music is also excellent. R.D. Burman masterfully comes up with songs fit for the situations. The most famous of all being ""Mere samnewali khidki mein"" which is hummed even today. ""Meri chatur naar"" is extremely fun to watch and kishore kumar's vocals are excellent. All this making Padosan an exquisite classic that MUST NOT BE MISSED!!",one greatest comedies indian cinema,padosan who hasnt heard it well if you are one those unfortunate souls who hasnt i feel terribly saddened your state you my friend need good lesson indian cinema i suggest you start by watching this film padosan which means neighbor is story bhola sunil dutt who li ke his name is very naive innocent soul who happens see bindu saira banu falls love with her he later finds out that she is his neighbor we find out that bindu is enamored with music into picture comes her music teacher masterji mehmood who aside being bumbling fool who speaks tamil accented hindi is also love with bindu so back our bhola bala hero he tries woo her but no avail until he enlists help his friend mentor guru kishore kumar who owns acting troupe which bhola is part after much investigation guru his friends discover that bindus soft spot is music but unfortunately our bhola is quite novice when it comes singing sounding more like braying donkey than singing suitor so begins one whackiest cons cinema guru sings bhola lip syncs gurus kishore kumars voice being what it is bewitches bindu she starts falling bhola this development thwarts masterjis master plan marrying bindu so now begins jugal bandi between masterji guru ahem bhola bindus affections with such whacky plot there are laughs aplenty add master comedians mehmood kishore kumar funny looking sunil dutt you have perfect recipe hilariously whacky romantic comedy saira banu oozing charm is quite good as spoilt bindu music is also excellent r d burman masterfully comes up with songs fit situations most famous all being mere samnewali khidki mein which is hummed even today meri chatur naar is extremely fun watch kishore kumars vocals are excellent all this making padosan exquisite classic that must not be missed,0.6348958333333333,0.2914583333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.16}"
,Moments of bliss,"The most delightful thing to me about this light comedy is the ""invention"" of playback singing as a seduction strategy for Sunil Dutt. His Guru in the movie is a director of what appears to be neighborhood Mahabharat dramas, with pan juice usually dripping toward his chin, played by Kishore Kumar.Sunil wants to be able to sing to impress the sexy neighbor girl -- but he can't -- so Kishore comes up with the brilliant idea that HE will sing out of sight, and Sunil will -- well, picturise the singing! Fantastic idea!! Which generates wonderful scenes of Sunil picturising seductively while we also see Kishore hopping around behind him singing the songs. (I imagine Kishore is actually playbacking himself here, so it's a great Bollywood-y hall of musical mirrors.)Kishore also sings and dances a number in which I believe he is doing a ladies' dance, playing the part of the beloved, as part of the enterprise of coaching Sunil in his love quest. His comic talent and body language are spectacular. I''ll probably buy this one just to watch this scene 1000 times. ~Virginia in New YorkETA: Nov. 16, 2006 - I just read an interview in which Shah Rukh Khan names this as his favorite movie comic scene.

9.0,Padosan,"I have watched this movie quite a few times, but I think its one of the rare movies I tend to watch with equal enthusiasm every time. Although, it was a remake of a Tamil film ""Adhutha Vittu Penn"", I thought the Hindi version was EQUALLY amazing and not to mention immensely entertaining =) I thought performance-wise Kishore, STOLE THE SHOW! I cannot imagine the movie without him. The guy is incredible at comedy. Sunil Dutt was fabulous, I just adore him to bits, he is so underrated...he put in a stupendous performance! ROFL gotta love the scene where he attempts to learn music from Kishore...he had me in splits. As for Mehmood, he simply rocked. 'Daaaaaai' bhola . I liked his unique accent. haha. I think its imitated by plenty of actors till date and yes, its annoying to the core. Saira, well I usually find her very irritating in most of her films, I thought she was passable. The soundtrack was amazing. Ahhh...man I can just listen to them all day long. My personal favorites include kehna hai, mera samne wali ladki ne and main chali is one of best female duets sung by Asha and Lata. The movie is a must watch, it's a classic in every sense.

10.0,"Well, the cake has to be distributed amongst all!","This is a hilarious and fantastic plot and producer Mahmood has truly justified the quote below the film title 'The first ambitious Motion Picture'. It is a splendid performance by one and all concerned with this film.Rather than the film's heroine Saira Banu, the film focuses on the duel of wits between her two suitors Mehmood and Sunil Dutt, who is helped by his Guruji Kishore Kumar (doing an imitation of Popol, a famous Bengali artiste) with a floppy middle-partitioned hairstyle and paan stained mouth. Mehmood has excelled as the South-Indian music and dance teacher, with mannerisms such as clutching the hems of his dhoti and the oft-repeated 'aiyo'... One of the high points of this film is the 'Ek Chatur Naar...' during which Mehmood's harmonium gets stuck, making him mumble, 'ennaiya idu...

10.0,Indian comedy up top!,"After reviewing this film over and over again, I feel I have to make a lot of changes to this post again.Without a doubt, this is one of the best Indian comedies joining the list of Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, and AAA (the latter two which I haven't seen). The oldies were the true meaning of Indian cinema and this was one of them. Led by 3 comedic aces, Om Prakash, Mehmood and Kishore Kumar (my favorite singer by the way), a buffoonish Sunil Dutt and a irritating Saira Banu and you have a farce! A farce in its own right! Bhola (Sunil Dutt) is a young simpleton living with his pedophile uncle (Om Prakash). He follows the Prem Shastra book very serious, until he realizes that he has wasted a year of married life and must get married before it's too late. Suddenly the line begins to shake and he thinks he's caught a fish. Only he's fished out a girl named Bindu (Saira Banu). He falls head over heels for her only to be pushed into the lake!! Later, he discovers about his uncle's pedophilic ways and disgusted, leaves to live with his mami (aunt).Next we go to Bhola's best friend, Vidyapati aka Guru (Kishore Kumar) and his wacky troupe (Raj Kishore, Keshto Mukherjee and Mukri) who perform dramatic plays (well in their own way I guess, making them more like farces). Bhola arrives and tells Guru about his new found love and enlists Guru's help in getting the girl.But what Bhola and Guru don't know is that another man is after Bindu. And he's in the form of a South Indian Sangeetham Masterji (Mehmood) who teaches Bindu music and dance and wants to get married to her. And Bindu is attracted to Masterji's singing voice. So Guru tries to make Bhola sing, but that fails when Bhola's voice is worse than a donkey's! Then BOOM! Guru comes up with a great idea and tells Bhola to lipsinc while he himself sings (seeing Kishore singing for Kishore singing for Sunil), WAH, WAH, WAH! The plan works and Bindu finally falls for Bhola and his ""singing"". Who could forget the over-the-top confrontation between Masterji and Bhola/Guru?! However, the truth must be exposed and when Bindu finds out about Bhola's singing, she is enraged and goes back to Masterji. And so Bhola decides that death would be better than to remain a bachelor. Soon a fake dramatic parody of Bhola's death spreads to the wedding of Masterji and Bindu. A frantic Bindu runs to mami's house and upon seeing Bhola, she repents about what she did and that she truly loves Bhola. And Bhola springs back alive!!!! And they all live happily ever after!!! Except for poor Masterji who cries during the wedding while he plays the flute.The first half of the film is probably the best half of the film as this provokes much hilarity in these situations (2X10/10, I could watch it forever). However, the second half brings the film down, when it becomes a little too serious and most of the jokes fall flat. But that doesn't stop it from being one of the greatest Indian comedies. I must say I haven't laughed so hard from any comedy than this one.Sunil Dutt dumbs himself down from his overly serious roles into a buffoonish, yet kind-hearted simpleton, although he takes the role a bit too seriously and does overdo it in some scenes. Yet, this will remembered as one of his better performances. Saira Banu is decent, yet annoying and you really want to slap her in the face, but the script said she had to be irritating, didn't it? Raj Kishore, Keshto Mukherjee and Mukri are great comic support and Om Prakash's mama is probably one of his most underrated to date.But the show belongs to Kishore Da and Mehmood and basically they rock the house. Once again Mehmood succeeds in creating a character that is so out there, you forget who the actor is. His accent is good that you'd believe that he actually did come from Tamil Nadu! The way he woos Bindu was outstanding.Kishore Da with his hair all over the place, Bengali style, paan chewing and crazy guru takes the cake. His reactions and funny antics are one of the main reasons to watch this film. This was one of his last best known comedic performances before his singing career blossomed in 1969 and he never looked back after that.Underrated RD Burman music right here. Not only does he create a great soundtrack, but his background score can be classified as one of his most underrated to date. Who can forget the songs Main Chali Main Chali, Saanwariya, Mere Saamnewaali Khidki Mein, Meri Bhole Balam and Kehna Hai? But Ek Chatur Naar Karke Singar, the music fight between Masterji and Bhola/Kishore steals the show. Just repeat the song over and over again and it never gets old.I recommend this great comedy to everyone. If you haven't watched this film, you are missing out. Don't worry if you don't get it, because you don't have to! Just let the movie take you for a ride. 10 out of 10! (14 out of 10- first half, 6 out of the 10- second.

8.0,Mehmood is Masterji,"...yet Kishore Kumar rules. Sunil Dutt holds his own as the straight man, and the best things about Saira are her figure and her clothes. The rest of the cast is good, too, but for me the main interest was to see a film where the actors (Mehmood & Kumar) do their own playback singing, which I believe became fairly uncommon after the 1940s. These guys deliver, and steal the show whenever they are on screen. Then on top of that, Kishore's character, Guru, after Bhola (Dutt) hilariously demonstrates that he can't learn to sing, pulls a Cyrano and provides the voice for Bhola's picturizing. Then song duel with Masterji, too much, Guru working Bhola like puppet. Guru's troupe (including Bhola) are a gang of 5, working like a chorus, double-takes timed to the music. The scene where they go to Bhola's uncle to change his mind about his engagement is structured as a pretty much a cappella song. I love that. I chose this film to see Kishore work, and I feel like I picked a good one, plus I learned about Mehmood, I'm looking forward to seeing more of both of them.",mehmood is masterji,yet kishore kumar rules sunil dutt holds his own as straight man best things about saira are her figure her clothes rest cast is good too but me main interest was see film where actors mehmood kumar do their own playback singing which i believe became fairly uncommon after 1940s these guys deliver steal show whenever they are screen then top that kishores character guru after bhola dutt hilariously demonstrates that he cant learn sing pulls cyrano provides voice bholas picturizing then song duel with masterji too much guru working bhola like puppet gurus troupe including bhola are gang 5 working like chorus double takes timed music scene where they go bholas uncle change his mind about his engagement is structured as pretty much cappella song i love that i chose this film see kishore work i feel like i picked good one plus i learned about mehmood im looking forward seeing more both them,0.5770833333333333,0.4635416666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.41}"

8.0,One of the best comedies,"Mehmood was the king of comedy in 60's, 70's and gave us several laughriots PADOSAN is one of the finest comedies ever remembered till today. The film is a laughriot throughout.

1.0,"If it was made today, it would be considered among the worst films","You read it right. I didn't like it. Infact, I absolutely hated it. May be in those day there were no critics or if there were, they were definitely not well known. Because today's critics don't leave a single chance to point a hole in a film, especially when it's a comedy film.Film starts with Sunil dutt(as Bhola) reciting a book and shouting ""Ab main 25 baras ka ho gaya hoon"". In next scene, we see him flirting(sort of) with girls in skimpy clothes. In first few minutes, I felt like watching an another Housefull (Housefull was bashed by critics). Then he left his house to live in his Mama's house. A girl(one of the mentioned above) lives in his neighbour. So, like in every other hindi film, he tries to impress her, but there's someone else trying to do so. He is Pillai, a music teacher (played by Mehmood). So, Bhola decides to learn music. From then it's all about music. There's a song every ten minutes. The story is non-existent. Just a long list of songs is there. Though, it is not as mind less as today's films but today's films are atleast a little funny. Some people may find the character of Pillai(a tamilian) offensive.Coming to the music, the songs are just amazing. The best ever you can find any where, Hindi or otherwise. But, that alone doesn't overhaul its flaws.",if it was made today it would be considered among worst films,you read it right i didnt like it infact i absolutely hated it may be those day there were no critics or if there were they were definitely not well known because todays critics dont leave single chance point hole film especially when its comedy film film starts with sunil dutt as bhola reciting book shouting ab main 25 baras ka ho gaya hoon next scene we see him flirting sort with girls skimpy clothes first few minutes i felt like watching another housefull housefull was bashed by critics then he left his house live his mamas house girl one mentioned above lives his neighbour so like every other hindi film he tries impress her but theres someone else trying do so he is pillai music teacher played by mehmood so bhola decides learn music then its all about music theres song every ten minutes story is non existent just long list songs is there though it is not as mind less as todays films but todays films are atleast little funny some people may find character pillai tamilian offensive coming music songs are just amazing best ever you can find any where hindi or otherwise but that alone doesnt overhaul its flaws,0.4208333333333334,-0.005084120425029512,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Greatest comedy of Hindi cinema.,"Padosan review :Comedian Mehmood Ali's maiden production; Padosan was a hilarious rom com based on a short Bengali story 'Pasher Bari' by Arun Chowdhury with Sunil Dutt, Saira Banu, Kishore Kumar and Mehmood himself in lead roles.The story revolved around Bhola (Sunil Dutt) who falls for his next door neighbour Bindu (Saira) and tries to woo her through the melodious voice of his pal Vidyapati (Kishore Kumar) and his naatak mandali. Mehmood plays Bindu's tamilian music teacher who is also trying to woo her.The situational comedy is perfectly integrated with RD Burman's memorable songs like ""Mere Saamne wali Khidki"", ""Ek Chatur naar"" and my personal fave ""Meri Pyaari Bindu"". The way Kishore Kumar grooves in that song is sure to make you lol.Sunil Dutt was fantastic as the gullible Bhola who cannot fight even four goons in one scene. Unfortunately, he received considerable flak from his fans for choosing such a role which was radically different from his tough action wala guy image. It may shock you to know that Padosan wasnt a huge hit in its first run but earned more revenue for Mehmood Saahab in its subsequent re-runs.Mehmood and Kishore da's performances became a benchmark for future comedians and mimic artists. Kishore da was initially reluctant to sign on for the role and producer Mehmood had to literally coaxe him in to it.Eventually, Padosan attained such universal popularity that it was remade in almost all Indian languages. In 1990, it was remade in Marathi as Patli Re Patli with top stars Laxmikant Berde and Varsha Usgaonkar in lead roles. A Hindi remake called Nayee Padosan also followed in 2003 but it was a colossal flop. After all, classics cant be replicated!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",greatest comedy hindi cinema,padosan review comedian mehmood alis maiden production padosan was hilarious rom com based short bengali story pasher bari by arun chowdhury with sunil dutt saira banu kishore kumar mehmood himself lead roles story revolved around bhola sunil dutt who falls his next door neighbour bindu saira tries woo her through melodious voice his pal vidyapati kishore kumar his naatak mandali mehmood plays bindus tamilian music teacher who is also trying woo her situational comedy is perfectly integrated with rd burmans memorable songs like mere saamne wali khidki ek chatur naar my personal fave meri pyaari bindu way kishore kumar grooves that song is sure make you lol sunil dutt was fantastic as gullible bhola who cannot fight even four goons one scene unfortunately he received considerable flak his fans choosing such role which was radically different his tough action wala guy image it may shock you know that padosan wasnt huge hit its first run but earned more revenue mehmood saahab its subsequent re runs mehmood kishore das performances became benchmark future comedians mimic artists kishore da was initially reluctant sign role producer mehmood had literally coaxe him it eventually padosan attained such universal popularity that it was remade almost all indian languages 1990 it was remade marathi as patli re patli with top stars laxmikant berde varsha usgaonkar lead roles hindi remake called nayee padosan also followed 2003 but it was colossal flop after all classics cant be replicated regards sumeet nadkarni,0.5421626984126984,0.19146825396825398,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
