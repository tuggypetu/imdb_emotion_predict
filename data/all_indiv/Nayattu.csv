8,"The Third Malayalam Classic of 2021. Nayattu is not a film but a slap to the dirty system which includes politicians, police, casteism wolves and unfortunately common man too","Nayattu (2021) : Brief Review -The Third Malayalam Classic of the year after The Great Indian Kitchen and Drishyam 2. Nayattu is not a film but a slap to the dirty system which includes politicians, police, casteism wolves and unfortunately common man too. Nayattu is told as a thriller and it somewhat thrilling too but it's not enough to be called a complete thriller as the genre requires more thrill. But it has got much more than that mainstream thrill to provide you a cinematic experience that will shatter your mind, heart and perspective and maybe you'll start looking at things differently. You need guts to make a film like Nayattu where you fearlessly expose all the dirty secrets of the system and then give a tight slap on common man's face by proving that he is also the part of this system afterall. Yes, we are all part of this absurd system because we are the Voters and we always fall for their tricks without knowing the actual truth behind it. Nayattu is about Three police officers who are on a run for life, escaping the outbreak against them due to the unlawful arrest and torture of a civilian. It brings in a few shades of arrogant yet very much human police officers and their helplessness and how they fail to fight the powerful system who just exactly know how to handle things.l according to their comfort. The film is bounded by realistic surroundings throughout the narrative and it doesn't fear to show ugly side of all the people who are involved in this system. Martin Prakkat has achieved something brilliant of a whole new level with his extraordinary directorial technique as he compiles multiple genres and themes so well together in one narrative. All the actors are superb in their roles. Dialogues are decent but very realistic and maybe that's why they are not that filmy. Overall, Nayattu is Classic Film but more than that it is a miserable realisation of our own mistakes that we can never correct as far as we are living in this society.

8,"A gutsy, hard-hitting survival drama thriller! [+75%]","It's always interesting to see filmmakers who revel in light-hearted commercial cinema take the plunge into darkness. Martin Prakkat - director of Best Actor, ABCD, and Charlie - comes up with a gutsy, hard-hitting affair in Nayattu, starring Kunchacko Boban, Joju George, and Nimisha Sajayan. This is a survival-drama-thriller set against the backdrop of elections in Kerala.Nayattu begins with an interesting tug-of-war scene that you'll circle back to at the end for several reasons. For instance, in thrillers, cops are the quintessential hunters. Here, they're the hunted. Three cops (played by the actors mentioned above) are torn between the government's racy attempt at solving an accidental death case (to appease their vote banks in the upcoming elections) and their ongoing personal issues. A set of immediate personal problems are introduced: Maniyan's daughter is set to participate in a youth festival, which he hopes to attend. Praveen's mother is unwell. Sunitha's house is a work-in-progress.Writer Shahi Kabir (who previously penned 'Joseph', a film I only mildly liked) keeps the characters and situations rooted in contemporary realism. The cops are often playtoys of the ruling government; we see that politicians are quick to wash their hands off when the public eye is involved. A dialogue from Maniyan early on - an analogy between cops and goons - hits you out of nowhere. I'd say the first half of Nayattu is more of a nail-biter thriller while the second stretches slightly into dramatic territory but in just the right doses.A slew of solid performances dominates Nayattu. The three leads are terrific. Joju George lives and breathes as Manikyan, adding subtleties that help differentiate him from the other cop roles he has played. Kunchacko Boban is also spot-on as Praveen; he's the more rational one amongst the three and his lines reflect that. Nimisha Sajayan's role is subdued and less vocal, but she ensures that her emoting compensates. The supporting cast is equally good - be it Jaffer Idukki (as the cunning CM), Yama Gilgamesh (as SP Arundhathi), or Anil Nedumangad.DOP Shyju Khalid's frames focus on the right things. Palpable tension gushes through almost every scene in the first half and even when the setting shifts to Munnar, the camera rarely halts to appreciate the incredible beauty of this place. That final shot of a blind woman casting her vote is a statement in itself - a classic example of good writing boosted by the right visuals. Vishnu Vijay's score elevates the underlying emotions of several scenes.The only issue I had with Nayattu was its fundamental implication that laws empowering Dalits are often misused. In reality, reported cases of Dalit oppression far outnumber such instances. That hiccup aside, Nayattu is a worthy case study in how to tackle survival thrillers.",gutsy hard hitting survival drama thriller,its always interesting see filmmakers who revel light hearted commercial cinema take plunge into darkness martin prakkat director best actor abcd charlie comes up with gutsy hard hitting affair nayattu starring kunchacko boban joju george nimisha sajayan this is survival drama thriller set against backdrop elections kerala nayattu begins with interesting tug war scene that youll circle back at end several reasons instance thrillers cops are quintessential hunters here theyre hunted three cops played by actors mentioned above are torn between governments racy attempt at solving accidental death case appease their vote banks upcoming elections their ongoing personal issues set immediate personal problems are introduced maniyans daughter is set participate youth festival which he hopes attend praveens mother is unwell sunithas house is work progress writer shahi kabir who previously penned joseph film i only mildly liked keeps characters situations rooted contemporary realism cops are often playtoys ruling government we see that politicians are quick wash their hands off when public eye is involved dialogue maniyan early analogy between cops goons hits you out nowhere id say first half nayattu is more nail biter thriller while second stretches slightly into dramatic territory but just right doses slew solid performances dominates nayattu three leads are terrific joju george lives breathes as manikyan adding subtleties that help differentiate him other cop roles he has played kunchacko boban is also spot as praveen hes more rational one amongst three his lines reflect that nimisha sajayans role is subdued less vocal but she ensures that her emoting compensates supporting cast is equally good be it jaffer idukki as cunning cm yama gilgamesh as sp arundhathi or anil nedumangad dop shyju khalids frames focus right things palpable tension gushes through almost every scene first half even when setting shifts munnar camera rarely halts appreciate incredible beauty this place that final shot blind woman casting her vote is statement itself classic example good writing boosted by right visuals vishnu vijays score elevates underlying emotions several scenes only issue i had with nayattu was its fundamental implication that laws empowering dalits are often misused reality reported cases dalit oppression far outnumber such instances that hiccup aside nayattu is worthy case study how tackle survival thrillers,0.4496428571428572,0.13864285714285715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10,Open question to your political conscience,"Theme is brilliant. Bold. Realistic.You are watching the movie thinking that the protagonists are going to escape from impossible situations as the script writer is on their side.However, that is a decoy. The makers have bigger fish to fry. And they present it in a way that you simply cannot ignore. You are all intent and looking for how the protagonists are going to escape the hunt, and then the movie springs it's net and traps you with realities that you can no longer shut your eyes to.The depth of corruptness in the system, and how justice is trapped across so many deep layers of trenches that you are left feeling helpless on how justice can be served amidst all this.At the end of the movie, in the protagonists, you see yourself and you are asked whether you would add another trench in the way of justice. The ending of the movie felt like the beginning of a much bigger saga.Background sounds have been pretty good and captures the tensions in the movie really well. Script is great and realistic.On the costumes and make-up side, there were some scenes that stood out like a sore thumb. Kunjacko Boban is seen with excessive makeup after days of struggling through the hunt - something that you would not see in a Dileesh Pothan movie for instance. However, in terms of subject, ""Nayattu"" beats ""Joji"" by miles in terms of how ""Nayattu"" presents something fresh where as ""Joji"" is old wine in new bottle.The communication between the makers and the viewers do not stop at the movie. Viewer is forced to probe his own conscience. And that is the power of the movie. The movie ""Court"" had left me in a similar state. This one feels closer home as the movie is set in my native.Joju and Kunjacko have performed really well. Nimisha has less of an opportunity on this one. All the other character actors have also performed really well.Martin Prakkat - take a bow!!

9,A Gripping Tale.,"Nayattu is Martin Prakkat's film after much celebrated ""Charlie"" 6years ago. The film starts with usual introductions of various characters and their background. The film stays aloof in terms of story for half an hour post which it takes a complete U turn pulling the viewers into the story pumping them with adrenaline, keeping them engaged throughout without even allowing them to blink for a moment. It does hold its pace till the very end but keeps it open for viewers to assume a non-tragic climax.Joju, Kunchako and Nimisha carries the entire film without a problem, portraying very well the emotions the characters go through on every moment.Anil Nedumangad and Yama Gilgamesh were other plus points. . Technical crew including the cinematography, music and editing were spot on. Doesn't fall short. Doesn't pop like a sore thumb. Perfect.Overall this is a well made thriller that can keep ons engaged for 2hours.",gripping tale,nayattu is martin prakkats film after much celebrated charlie 6years ago film starts with usual introductions various characters their background film stays aloof terms story half hour post which it takes complete u turn pulling viewers into story pumping them with adrenaline keeping them engaged throughout without even allowing them blink moment it does hold its pace till very end but keeps it open viewers assume non tragic climax joju kunchako nimisha carries entire film without problem portraying very well emotions characters go through every moment anil nedumangad yama gilgamesh were other plus points technical crew including cinematography music editing were spot doesnt fall short doesnt pop like sore thumb perfect overall this is well made thriller that can keep ons engaged 2hours,0.4572916666666666,0.06614583333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"
