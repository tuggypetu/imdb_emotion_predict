3,"Mediocre at its best, terrible at its worst","""I see what you're going for, but it's not really working."" This was my feeling numerous times during this movie. So many things feel off or ingenuine. Almost like it's a ""factory-made"" movie rather than something hand-crafted.I didn't care about the characters. There are lots of stupid moments and things that make you raise an eyebrow. The treasure hunting stuff feels so random like they are making it up on the spot. The comedy isn't terrible, it made me smirk a bunch of times. But I don't think I laughed one single time. And a few of the jokes are super cringe-y.The action is alright. I like crazy, outrageous action movies. But none of scenes impressed me. I think part of it is not caring about the characters, which drains the tension. And the fight scenes are once again, for the millionth time, filled with quick-cuts and close-ups so you can't see. When will they learn?I really wish movies would go for the R rating more often. But if you're going to go with PG-13, please stop trying to show (but not show) things that should be in a rated R movie. For example, if someone's throat is slit, don't blatantly cut away at the last second. And then continue to show that person multiple times, with ZERO blood coming out. It makes the movie feel amateur.On four occasions I thought to myself, ""Look, Tom Holland is Spider-Man-ing."" And it's not because I can't see the actor in any other role. He is very different in Cherry. But things he said sounded exactly like something Peter Parker would say, and things he did looked exactly like Spider-Man would do them. At one point I wondered if they were doing it on purpose. Odd.

4,"Doesn't do the games justice, by any stretch","Ideal for fans of Tom Holland and devil-may-care treasure hunts, ""Uncharted"" is a solid action movie with crazy stunts, beautiful locations and surprising star power. It's a good reason to leave the house for that big-screen spectacle that we all live for. If you've never owned a Playstation, that's really all you need to have a good time.. . .But sweet merciful Jesus, this is not an Uncharted movie and that is a torpedo that sinks the whole thing. Because to have that, you need Drake and Sully, and both Holland and Mark Wahlberg are way off; they're not even close. They don't look like these characters and they don't sound like them, despite the mid-credits afterthought of a scene that's supposed to satisfy this requirement.And as a result, I have to admit, I was bored to tears. To the movie's credit, it picks up considerably in the third act, and even goes nuts in the set piece department (that airlift scene was pretty cool). But to make us wait ninety-odd minutes for Drake to even pick up a gun is ridiculous.I admit personal bias in the strongest sense; this series of games makes my desert-island list, no question, and I wanted to be surprised by this. It just didn't happen, and I couldn't make these actors fit these characters. As it stands, that Nathan Fillion fan film from a few years back (I'm serious, go watch it) still reigns supreme. I try to be a movie-goer that steers clear of fanboyism, but it didn't work here. And it was not fun.",doesnt do games justice by any stretch,ideal fans tom holland devil may care treasure hunts uncharted is solid action movie with crazy stunts beautiful locations surprising star power its good reason leave house that big screen spectacle that we all live if youve never owned playstation thats really all you need have good time but sweet merciful jesus this is not uncharted movie that is torpedo that sinks whole thing because have that you need drake sully both holland mark wahlberg are way off theyre not even close they dont look like these characters they dont sound like them despite mid credits afterthought scene thats supposed satisfy this requirement as result i have admit i was bored tears movies credit it picks up considerably third act even goes nuts set piece department that airlift scene was pretty cool but make us wait ninety odd minutes drake even pick up gun is ridiculous i admit personal bias strongest sense this series games makes my desert island list no question i wanted be surprised by this it just didnt happen i couldnt make these actors fit these characters as it stands that nathan fillion fan film few years back im serious go watch it still reigns supreme i try be movie goer that steers clear fanboyism but it didnt work here it was not fun,0.4633333333333333,0.13510101010101006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6,"Forgettable. It's a mediocre copycat, it'll do for some brainless entertainment, but dont expect originality or quality.","I'm being really generous with 6 stars, because this movie is neither really funny, nor really exciting.Not any good? The CGI effects are pretty special, but personally I often get bored when the CGI effects are the only thing keeping a movie afloat. And there are basically only 2 CGI spectacle scenes that are noteworthy and even those I found somewhat overkill and boring.Let's forget about the story. This is merely another adventure movie, like the Pirates of the Carribean meets National Treasure.

5,An Average Adventure Film,"After many years we finally have an Uncharted film, this film is based on the really popular video game franchise and today I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man getting recruited to go on a hunt for a long lost treasure.Main Character Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake and I can't help myself he is really entertaining to watch and I think this is just because of Holland's natural charm and charisma manages to drag him through. But the issue is that he just isn't what I wanted from Nathan Drake as a character, he is nothing like his video game counterpart and that is a big shame. I was watching the film and all I saw was Peter Parker just without his Spider-Man costume. Hopefully, this is only because this film came out just after Spider-Man: No Way Home but I do worry that Holland might become typecast and a one trick pony.Supporting Characters Mark Wahlberg plays Sully and it is a similar story to our main character. He has plenty of natural charisma to him and his chemistry with Holland is really good and at least there is some sort of character development on show. But I felt like it was Mark Wahlberg walking around and the character of Sully from the video games and that was the issue for me, he is just the same as he is in every other film and this is a slight shame for me. Sophia Ali plays Chloe and I actually quite liked her, maybe because she was the one performer I didn't recognise made her feel like an actual character and somebody who was actually interesting to watch. The bad guys didn't work though, Antonio Banderas is here but he is just your generic villain and I don't know when but it seems like when a European bad guy is needed then he is the one cast and it just didn't work here. Tai Gabrielle is better as a villain but she isn't that great either but was at least a physical enemy to Drake.Story The story did a pretty good job of showing a young Nathan Drake starting his career and leading us on a fun adventure story across the globe that had shades of Indiana Jones to it. There is some sort of character development attempted and the actors seemed like they were having fun here. But there is a lack of depth and direction for the overall plot of the film. I think it could needed to pace itself a bit better and focus on the characters a bit more and give the villains way better motivations.Script The film actually has a surprising amount of humour to it and I was chuckling my way through most of the film, mixed with a bit of heart made this alright. But there isn't enough here, I didn't care about the characters enough and sometimes it felt like the film relied on its star power instead of actually crafting these better written heroes and villains.Style The style has some really good action scenes, including the crazy cargo plane scene that was in all of the trailers. The film is quite relentless too, the adventure moves at a pretty break neck pace which is good but it also harms the characterisation and plot of the film. It was a fun action film without the depth needed to become a good film.Overall Overall, Uncharted is a pretty average adventure film. There is some good here for sure and Sony are hoping to make this a franchise but it doesn't do enough for me to get me excited for that or recommend this for a watch.Rating - 5/10.",average adventure film,after many years we finally have uncharted film this film is based really popular video game franchise today i have watched it here is my review it premise film sees young man getting recruited go hunt long lost treasure main character tom holland plays nathan drake i cant help myself he is really entertaining watch i think this is just because hollands natural charm charisma manages drag him through but issue is that he just isnt what i wanted nathan drake as character he is nothing like his video game counterpart that is big shame i was watching film all i saw was peter parker just without his spider man costume hopefully this is only because this film came out just after spider man no way home but i do worry that holland might become typecast one trick pony supporting characters mark wahlberg plays sully it is similar story our main character he has plenty natural charisma him his chemistry with holland is really good at least there is some sort character development show but i felt like it was mark wahlberg walking around character sully video games that was issue me he is just same as he is every other film this is slight shame me sophia ali plays chloe i actually quite liked her maybe because she was one performer i didnt recognise made her feel like actual character somebody who was actually interesting watch bad guys didnt work though antonio banderas is here but he is just your generic villain i dont know when but it seems like when european bad guy is needed then he is one cast it just didnt work here tai gabrielle is better as villain but she isnt that great either but was at least physical enemy drake story story did pretty good job showing young nathan drake starting his career leading us fun adventure story across globe that had shades indiana jones it there is some sort character development attempted actors seemed like they were having fun here but there is lack depth direction overall plot film i think it could needed pace itself bit better focus characters bit more give villains way better motivations script film actually has surprising amount humour it i was chuckling my way through most film mixed with bit heart made this alright but there isnt enough here i didnt care about characters enough sometimes it felt like film relied its star power instead actually crafting these better written heroes villains style style has some really good action scenes including crazy cargo plane scene that was all trailers film is quite relentless too adventure moves at pretty break neck pace which is good but it also harms characterisation plot film it was fun action film without depth needed become good film overall overall uncharted is pretty average adventure film there is some good here sure sony are hoping make this franchise but it doesnt do enough me get me excited that or recommend this watch rating 5 10,0.4328876236484933,0.15893719806763282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
5,Average,"I actually enjoyed this movie. But after hearing fans of the game talking about the weird casting. I have to take a couple of points off. I mean, you should always try to keep the fans happy. As well as bringing in newcomers.So Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are totally wrong choises for these characters here. Holland in particular is really just the same as he is in Spiderman, and that's maybe what the money people wanted.Outside of the actors though, I was expecting this to be a CGI heavy mess. And though there is alot of CGI in its later parts. I still liked the action in the movie. The plane scene does feel like it belongs more in a game. But some of the realistic action, and the over the top finale were well done.

7,An enjoyable action adventure...,"Well, oddly enough then I actually never have played the games, but I am well familiar with them and the concept that is ""Uncharted"". So I sort of knew what I was in for here, as I sat down to watch the 2022 movie ""Uncharted"" from writers Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Amy Hennig, Jon Hanley Rosenberg, Matt Holloway and Mark D. Walker.And just as expected, then director Ruben Fleischer definitely delivered a wholesome and spot on action adventure that delivers a fast-paced adventure that will make the boy-that-never-wants-to-grow-up-in-us-all more than happy. The storyline in ""Uncharted"" was a great mixture of fast-paced action, great adventure much in the likes of ""Indiana Jones"", treasure hunting and good characters. So yeah, chances are great that there is something for just about everyone in the audience here.The movie stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, whom actually carries the movie quite well together. But the movie also have the likes of Antonio Banderas, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle and Steven Waddington on the cast list.I was more than genuinely entertained by this action adventure, and it certainly is a franchise that could spawn more movies to sequel this one. I had heard some reviewer mention that ""Uncharted"" was just a popcorn munchin movie that required no thinking of any kind. But I found ""Uncharted"" to be more than just a lean-back-and-munch-on-the-popcorn type of movie, luckily. If you enjoyed the ""Indiana Jones"" movies, then you will certainly also enjoy ""Uncharted"".As for realism, well just neatly wrap that notion in a small wrapping and place it on the shelf for the nearly two hours that ""Uncharted"" plays. This movie is all about entertainment, surprise, surprise.My rating of ""Uncharted"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",enjoyable action adventure,well oddly enough then i actually never have played games but i am well familiar with them concept that is uncharted so i sort knew what i was here as i sat down watch 2022 movie uncharted writers rafe judkins art marcum amy hennig jon hanley rosenberg matt holloway mark d walker just as expected then director ruben fleischer definitely delivered wholesome spot action adventure that delivers fast paced adventure that will make boy that never wants grow up us all more than happy storyline uncharted was great mixture fast paced action great adventure much likes indiana jones treasure hunting good characters so yeah chances are great that there is something just about everyone audience here movie stars tom holland mark wahlberg whom actually carries movie quite well together but movie also have likes antonio banderas sophia ali tati gabrielle steven waddington cast list i was more than genuinely entertained by this action adventure it certainly is franchise that could spawn more movies sequel this one i had heard some reviewer mention that uncharted was just popcorn munchin movie that required no thinking any kind but i found uncharted be more than just lean back munch popcorn type movie luckily if you enjoyed indiana jones movies then you will certainly also enjoy uncharted as realism well just neatly wrap that notion small wrapping place it shelf nearly two hours that uncharted plays this movie is all about entertainment surprise surprise my rating uncharted lands seven out ten stars,0.44764109347442677,0.275870811287478,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.47}"
3,Can popcorn movies be any less ambitious?,"36/100Uncharted is Sony's latest attempt to fit an acclaimed franchise with 42 hours of content and story into just 2... Make your own judgment from that.It's funny to think that, no matter how hard you try, these days you cannot adapt a video game into a film, and vice versa. While one tries to be as efficient as possible with his limited time, the other can pack as much information as it can in order to become more extensive or ambitious.This indicates that, even if someone has the courage to adapt something like the Uncharted series to the big screen, whether they wanted to or not, they must summarize, or flatly ignore, certain plot points to prioritize others. The problem is that this selection process has such a complex naturalness that, with a single mistake, it can feel like the film is trying to contextualize as much as it can, ignoring not to feel overwhelming.Even if that is your purpose, you have to be subtle. Uncharted binned that advice completely.From European villains to straight up pirate ships, Uncharted feels like one of the least ambitious popcorn flicks I've come across in quite some time.The plot seems to have been invented while the filming process of the film was being executed, which would not surprise me at this point if it were true, while clinging to the mediocrity of the actors' work.

4,"Decent Film, Horrible Adaptation","As video games continue to rise in popular culture, it's only natural that they should receive more film adaptations. Uncharted, which is one of the most popular franchises under the PlayStation brand, is very cinematic in its own right. Inspired by adventure films like Indiana Jones, the games are practically interactive movies themselves. For this, the ideal is to make a movie that appeals both to general audiences and to fans of the series. Uncharted is a movie that succeeds to a certain extent to the former and fails tremendously in the latter. The movie throws the canon of the games out the window, although it does directly adapt some scenes from the games. It takes the auction house scene from Uncharted 4, the plane scene from Uncharted 3, the whole arc with Sam from 4.As an adventure movie, it's nothing special, but nothing too terrible. If you know nothing about the source material, you may even find yourself enjoying it. It's got some fun moments in it. It's got a heist at an auction house, ancient puzzles in a Gothic church, and plenty of action in the sky. Some of these action scenes really do capture the spirit of adventure movies, which is always great fun. While some of them are lifted right from the games, they do play out well for what they're worth. There are moments when the adventure spirit kicks in, and that is welcome. Ancient mysteries and action scenes are always fun. The main theme from the games appears, which was a nice addition.As an adaptation of the games, it falls massively short. The casting is horrendous. Tom Holland is way too young to play Nathan Drake, as he lacks the suave personality that makes Drake who he is. Nathan's personality is completely absent in this character. Drake's movie personality feels more like MCU Spider-Man than the Nathan Drake in the games. This character on the screen is not Nathan Drake. Mark Wahlberg as Sully is an equally bad casting. While it's unlikely that anyone on this cast played the games, this is just Marky Mark, with no resemblance to Sully whatsoever. The lack of the moustache hurts, but there's nothing at all to signify that this is supposed to be Sully. Sully in the games is a classic ""scoundrel with a heart of gold."" This guy is just a scoundrel. Wahlberg is also way too young to play Sully. Chloe was probably the closest to being like the games, but that's not saying much. She at least looks the part, which is more than what the others have going for them. She does the classic double agent thing from the games as well, which is one of the few things they got right. Elena is not in it at all, which was disappointing. The villains were bland, nothing more to say about them, other than that they squandered Antonio Banderas (although in fairness, most of the villains in the games are bland too). There's also a really awesome cameo from Nolan North, which was probably the best scene in the entire movie.If this movie wasn't connected at all to the Uncharted games, it would be a harmless action adventure movie that would have some similarities to the games, like how the games are inspired by adventure movies. By attaching it to the Uncharted franchise, it puts the expectation that it's going to be something like the games. While there are snippets of the games here and there, it's simply not enough. This does not feel like an Uncharted movie.By the way, the PlayStation Studios logo, with Nathan Drake, Kratos and Atreus (boy), Jin Sakai, Joel and Ellie, Aloy, and Sackboy was awesome. I guess we'll be seeing that on the upcoming Last of Us and Ghost of Tsushima adaptations.",decent film horrible adaptation,as video games continue rise popular culture its only natural that they should receive more film adaptations uncharted which is one most popular franchises under playstation brand is very cinematic its own right inspired by adventure films like indiana jones games are practically interactive movies themselves this ideal is make movie that appeals both general audiences fans series uncharted is movie that succeeds certain extent former fails tremendously latter movie throws canon games out window although it does directly adapt some scenes games it takes auction house scene uncharted 4 plane scene uncharted 3 whole arc with sam 4 as adventure movie its nothing special but nothing too terrible if you know nothing about source material you may even find yourself enjoying it its got some fun moments it its got heist at auction house ancient puzzles gothic church plenty action sky some these action scenes really do capture spirit adventure movies which is always great fun while some them are lifted right games they do play out well what theyre worth there are moments when adventure spirit kicks that is welcome ancient mysteries action scenes are always fun main theme games appears which was nice addition as adaptation games it falls massively short casting is horrendous tom holland is way too young play nathan drake as he lacks suave personality that makes drake who he is nathans personality is completely absent this character drakes movie personality feels more like mcu spider man than nathan drake games this character screen is not nathan drake mark wahlberg as sully is equally bad casting while its unlikely that anyone this cast played games this is just marky mark with no resemblance sully whatsoever lack moustache hurts but theres nothing at all signify that this is supposed be sully sully games is classic scoundrel with heart gold this guy is just scoundrel wahlberg is also way too young play sully chloe was probably closest being like games but thats not saying much she at least looks part which is more than what others have going them she does classic double agent thing games as well which is one few things they got right elena is not it at all which was disappointing villains were bland nothing more say about them other than that they squandered antonio banderas although fairness most villains games are bland too theres also really awesome cameo nolan north which was probably best scene entire movie if this movie wasnt connected at all uncharted games it would be harmless action adventure movie that would have some similarities games like how games are inspired by adventure movies by attaching it uncharted franchise it puts expectation that its going be something like games while there are snippets games here there its simply not enough this does not feel like uncharted movie by way playstation studios logo with nathan drake kratos atreus boy jin sakai joel ellie aloy sackboy was awesome i guess well be seeing that upcoming last us ghost tsushima adaptations,0.47489583333333324,0.18260788690476187,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"
2,"Watered down, uneventful, wrong cast","It's so dull, there's no real action, no fights or violence and the supposed lead as in the video games is a weak side piece. This is not a hood reimagining.I like wahlberg he was fine, about the only character that worked except the female explorer. He over-shone Holland to the point it was pretty embarrassing for the guy.I thought I was a Holland fan but I've fast realised anything that isn't Spider-Man that he's done has been literally abysmal, that mute, dream power mess and various other awful messes he's been in, fast going off him, looks to young to be a believable badass or heart throb, has no presence, no authority and delivers the lines exactly like spider man, that cheeky, childish dialogue, pretty one dimensional. He is no leading man, awfully wrong for the role, see why you got him as he's popular but he just played it wrong and just looked like a child.

2,LEAVE THE LOST TREASURE ALONE...!,"And the 'we don't have a clue how to translate video games into movies' train departs w/Sony's belated adaptation of the popular videogame series. Never having played the games (even though I own them, something to do during my retirement years I figure!) but having seen footage & knowing the fanbase was lobbying for Nathan Fillion (of Firefly fame) to be cast as Nathan Drake, we now have our favorite current webslinger, Tom Holland, playing a younger version of him who is seduced by a worldly fortune hunter, played by Mark Wahlberg (who ironically was slated to play Drake when his go to guy David O. Russell was attached to the project) who go after some famed treasure whose clues (similar to clues seen in The DaVinci Code or National Treasure which beg the viewer's credulity in the over-complicated breadcrumbs left behind by the treasure hoarders) lead to hidden gold w/the requisite mustache twirling baddie, here played by Oscar nominee Antonio Banderas & his henchperson (who was once Wahlberg's protégé/partner), played by the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Tati Gabrielle foiling Holland/Wahlberg's plans at every turn. Another partner, played by Sophia Ali, is in the mix as well but her distrust of her partners (something that after a while starts to grate on the viewer, if you don't trust them...leave!) soon upsets the flow of things. W/an overall sense of wrong people, wrong story permeating my feelings on the film, I soon tuned out & waited for the theater's house lights to dim up.

6,"Very Average Overall, but Still Very Fun","The Uncharted video game franchise is my favourite series of games ever made. I thought I should get that out of the way before diving into my review. Upon the countless storylines I'm sure they went over and numerous directors leaving the project before settling on Ruben Fleischer, I was worried, but still very excited to see these characters on the big screen. This will also be a completely unbiased review because I can't even compare it to the games. Too many things have been changed to really compare it. With all of that said, let's dive in.The story begins with young Nathan Drake, a bartender who had one day planned on finding treasure with his brother Sam. After the disappearance of his brother, he never felt the need to get back into the game. When Victor Sullivan (Sully) appears after his shift one night, he brings up the past, saying that he worked with his brother Sam. This instantly makes Nathan want to be a part of this story and the two of them form a bond. These two believe that a fortune left behind by Ferdinand Magellan over 500 years ago is still sitting somewhere in the world. They take this journey together, but they're not the only ones after this treasure, which leads to a lot of predictability as well.When I first heard that Tom Holland was cast to play Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg would be playing Sully, I, like many other fans, was left scratching my head. It was clear that they wanted to start these characters younger than they were in the game in order to build a long-running franchise, but it just didn't seem right. Again, I'm wasn't about to let my love of the games sway me in any direction though. I'm a huge fan of both Holland and Wahlberg, so here's the catch-22 happening in my head. Did I enjoy this movie overall and did I enjoy these two in their respective roles? I absolutely did! Do I still feel that it was a little miscast and that they should've been older? I absolutely do! For both of those reasons and for a few negatives I'm about to get into, I believe Uncharted is an okay, entertaining movie for the most part.Ruben Fleischer has been a very hit-or-miss director for me, directing both Zombieland films, which I think are great, as well as Venom, which I had some fun with, but he has also done some pretty bad films in Gangster Squad and 30 Minutes or Less. His films always have a very clean look to them and a silly/fun tone. I was worried that tone wouldn't fit an Uncharted movie and I do feel that way after having seen the film as well. Bright and colourful (other than landscapes around them) is not how I ever saw an Uncharted movie looking, but again, it was adapted and I'm not going to complain about the look. What I feel is the weakest aspect of this film is the fact that there's absolutely no grit. Nobody is ever dirty, there's barely any blood, and it never feels like stakes are high because these characters can go through a lot without a scratch.Overall, I probably have more to critique than praise when talking about Uncharted, but that's just because the Screenplay felt like it was hitting random bullet points instead of fleshing out the world they're living in. It never felt lived-in. Still, I love the cast (including Antonio Banderas and Sophia Ali as well), the banter between Nathan and Sully was fun, the action is cool, and I left the theatre feeling positive enough about the film that I would love to see them continue. I will gladly go back for a sequel, but I just hope they evolve these characters more and get down to a grittier, dirtier story. Yes, the point of Uncharted is to have fun and tell a great story, but I felt the story was a little hollow here. I think it's a movie worth seeing and I recommend it because I think there is potential for so much better in the future. This film is just okay overall, but the groundwork has now been laid for something even better.",very average overall but still very fun,uncharted video game franchise is my favourite series games ever made i thought i should get that out way before diving into my review upon countless storylines im sure they went over numerous directors leaving project before settling ruben fleischer i was worried but still very excited see these characters big screen this will also be completely unbiased review because i cant even compare it games too many things have been changed really compare it with all that said lets dive story begins with young nathan drake bartender who had one day planned finding treasure with his brother sam after disappearance his brother he never felt need get back into game when victor sullivan sully appears after his shift one night he brings up past saying that he worked with his brother sam this instantly makes nathan want be part this story two them form bond these two believe that fortune left behind by ferdinand magellan over 500 years ago is still sitting somewhere world they take this journey together but theyre not only ones after this treasure which leads lot predictability as well when i first heard that tom holland was cast play nathan drake mark wahlberg would be playing sully i like many other fans was left scratching my head it was clear that they wanted start these characters younger than they were game order build long running franchise but it just didnt seem right again im wasnt about let my love games sway me any direction though im huge fan both holland wahlberg so heres catch 22 happening my head did i enjoy this movie overall did i enjoy these two their respective roles i absolutely did do i still feel that it was little miscast that they shouldve been older i absolutely do both those reasons few negatives im about get into i believe uncharted is okay entertaining movie most part ruben fleischer has been very hit or miss director me directing both zombieland films which i think are great as well as venom which i had some fun with but he has also done some pretty bad films gangster squad 30 minutes or less his films always have very clean look them silly fun tone i was worried that tone wouldnt fit uncharted movie i do feel that way after having seen film as well bright colourful other than landscapes around them is not how i ever saw uncharted movie looking but again it was adapted im not going complain about look what i feel is weakest aspect this film is fact that theres absolutely no grit nobody is ever dirty theres barely any blood it never feels like stakes are high because these characters can go through lot without scratch overall i probably have more critique than praise when talking about uncharted but thats just because screenplay felt like it was hitting random bullet points instead fleshing out world theyre living it never felt lived still i love cast including antonio banderas sophia ali as well banter between nathan sully was fun action is cool i left theatre feeling positive enough about film that i would love see them continue i will gladly go back sequel but i just hope they evolve these characters more get down grittier dirtier story yes point uncharted is have fun tell great story but i felt story was little hollow here i think its movie worth seeing i recommend it because i think there is potential so much better future this film is just okay overall but groundwork has now been laid something even better,0.43707079296365026,0.1303761681440253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7,Brother in ... Raid,"Let's keep it real: this is as losely put together as is possible. The movie tries to incorporate as many references to the games as it can, while covering as much ground as it can. Some might even say it takes on too much ... I am not one of those people. Some may be dissapointed, because they expected something ... that was sort of a copy of the games - which would not make much sense in my book to be honest.Or you may not like the casting. Holland aside, it is Wahlberg who seems missplaced as Sully. I reckon since he was considered for the Nathan Drake part (which I guess tells you how long this must have been in development, no offense), they thought ""well at least he can play this mentor role"".Well Mentor may be stretching it a bit .. but you get where I am going with this. Drakes and Sullys relationship is explored or rather established in a different light and tone ... which you'll either find fine or disturbing I guess. Also Holland still seems so incredibly young you may feel he's too young ... again, you have to get over certain things.There's enough entertainment and action in this to keep you on the edge of your seat. Solid stunts and digital effects work. Not all twists work, but even the weird choice for Wahlberg as Sully actually can work for the viewer (again: suspension of disbelief) ... one thing is for sure: the chemistry between the two leads is incredible!

5,"Better than most video game adaptations, Uncharted still doesn't strike gold","Going through a far more arduous process than many feature films would come close to experiencing when it comes to simply seeing the light of day, with news of an Uncharted movie being bandied about all the way back in 2008 with announcements following in 2010 that director David O. Russell would be the man in charge of the film as it stood those many moons ago, the first feature of the newly minted Sony Playstation Productions is thankfully more entertaining than most video game adaptations but in the harsh reality of the real world, that's not much of an achievement.Full of life, spectacle, lovable characters and more than its fair share of Indiana Jones DNA, Sony's incredibly popular Uncharted video game series is a deservedly praised property that many were excited to see be turned into a real life living and breathing entity but while director for hire Ruben Fleischer nails a few set pieces and continues on the type of form he showed with the second Zombieland and the first Venom (with his 2009 Zombieland debut feature feeling more and more like a fluke occurrence), there's a blandness too Uncharted that is unavoidable, as the low hanging fruit it clearly was attempting to reach sits firmly in its grasp.Following the treasure hunting exploits of new partners in crime, Tom Holland's daring Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's long time swindler Victor Sullivan, as the two miss-matched operators attempt a globe spanning hunt of Ferdinand Magellan lost fortune that also is being hunted down by Sophia Ali's Chloe Frazer and Antonio Banderas's villain by the numbers Santiago Moncada, Uncharted is absolutely Indiana Jones lite, just without the winning jokes, the constant inventiveness and the wholly engaging characters.Getting started with a fairly eye-popping set piece that quickly gives way to an extended predominantly pedestrian formula of Drake and Sullivan getting to know each other while tracking down the next clue to their golden dreams, Uncharted struggles to do much of note for a significant amount of time with the film and us an audience awaiting something or someone to awake the films sleepwalking feeling that only really ever comes far too late in the equation when flying pirate ships and daring plane escapes take hold.Showcasing that Fleischer does know his way around an action set piece and a comedic set-up and that his tried and true performers have engaged and entertained audiences around the world countless times before, there's stages late in the piece here where Uncharted shows a little more energy and showmanship giving it more winning moments than your average video game adaptation but it's not enough to save the film entirely from its monotonous moments and uninspiring chemistry from its two main leads.Involved in the project for better part of a decade, Wahlberg was always a somewhat controversial choice as Sullivan and he does nothing to try and elevate himself from his recent funk of paycheck collecting performances and can't do enough to make us think we're watching anyone but Marky Mark while the so hot right now Holland commits himself physically as Drake, his turn also isn't worth celebrating with the two well-liked actors unable to generate much spark together let alone individually, a problem the film was never going to overcome no matter how much else it may've gotten right.Final Say -There is fun to be had from Uncharted but most of the good times start rolling in a little too late to save the day, with it's off the boil leads and by the numbers storytelling, this latest video game come to life blockbuster may not be sunken treasure but its unable to provide a reason to get excited about another hunt anytime soon.2 1/2 Naughty Dog stickers out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",better than most video game adaptations uncharted

All was going well until they killed off the best character in the movie just to ""subvert expectations"".Antonio Banderas' villain performance was everything I wanted from this type of movie.

7,switch Wahlberg and Banderas,"Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is a bartender and a thief in NYC. He gets recruited by Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to find Magellan's gold. Victor claims to be a former comrade of his estranged missing older brother Sam. They join forces with fellow thief Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) but there is no trust among them. Corrupt tycoon Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) is also searching for the treasure with help from mercenary Braddock (Tati Gabrielle).First of all, I've never played the game and don't know anything about these characters. I kept thinking of Spider-Man whenever Tom Holland does his parkour chases. His boyish humor doesn't really fit with his criminal activities. He's too nice and seems on the verge of being scammed all the time. I do like the actor and thereby the character. I'm much less enamored with Mark Wahlberg. I wouldn't mind another actor in the role. He's giving off too much bad Transformers vibes. He should consider doing villain roles in these action adventure flicks. Why not switch him with Banderas? Victor should be half rival and half mentor. Banderas would be a better fit.
