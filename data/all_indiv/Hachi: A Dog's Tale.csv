9,Unprecedented loyalty in a story of age-old friendship,"Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.Before my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik≈ç Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.In retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue.",unprecedented loyalty story age old friendship,knowing real life story behind it hachiko dogs story 2009 has been made sort staged documentary style similar kind movies often seen documentary channels e g natgeo however without narrator so common documentaries including well known actors richard gere sarah roemer joan allen making it more suitable theatrical distribution before my last years visit tokyo ive been unaware true life story this movie is based upon time occasion came up meet friend shibuya city contemporary center tokyos youth culture shopping fashion nightlife thats how ive learned about popular local meeting point all tokyoites hachik akita dog statue just outside shibuya train station but real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since after seeing this movie some additional research web all pieces have fallen into place retelling story common bonding between dog its owner so usual that it comes so natural film is moving at slow pace following events ordinary life though not without occasional comedic dramatic overtones even past dramatic highpoint when common acts affection loyalty evolve towards such unheard faithfulness ultimate devotion pace storytelling does not change relying primarily fine details emotional build up course this might not attract everybody providing that majority movie audience today is highly dependent fast paced action packed scenes getting thrills 3d cg stylized ambiance suspense high volume amplitudes aggressive often rude highlights any other nature however those who can do without it keep alive their interest even simple story who wont shy away emotional involvement as if this can be controlled they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty warmth usual mans best friend story spiced with intriguing yet inspiring detail shall leave you bit sad inevitably pensive but ultimately delighted even more so after reading real life epilogue,0.4638587848932676,0.04905172413793104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10,Enough to make a grown man cry!,"Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away.I have never seen the original Japanese version of the movie but know the story well as I have been told by many people here in Japan. There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes, this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actors/actresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story, people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning, do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though, every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 10/10.",enough make grown man cry,hachi is movie based true story about dog japan hachiko who would wait at train station every day his owner arrive even after owner passed away i have never seen original japanese version movie but know story well as i have been told by many people here japan there is statue hachiko that stands outside shibuya station tokyo now statue is most popular place tokyoites meet their friends before going out shopping or dining shibuya unlike other japanese remakes this movie actually gives credit original story so that you dont get sense that hollywood wants call it its own all actors actresses movie do superb job making you feel as if you were part community embracing dog compared original story people were more accepting hachi rather than considering him nuisance course this is going be released u s as holiday movie so goal is make it uplifting just warning do take many tissues i am grown man can honestly say that i have never really cried during movie i think score movie plus dog being so adorable made me lose myself when i looked around theater though every single person was crying i saw lot red eyes as i left mens restroom any movie that can make me do that deserves 10 10,0.4735714285714285,0.2591428571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10,Loyalty: A Trait To Be Admired,"I don't think you find a better example of a dog's devotion to his master than this one, a based-on-a-true-life tale of a dog who was into a routine of meeting his beloved male owner every day at 5 p.m. at the train station.I saw this movie a week ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. If the words ""love"" and ""loyalty"" mean anything to you, this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story, the dog runs free around the town/city, which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever, the story is still very good, very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one: if you fear watching an animal film with a bad/sad ending, you're safe: the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, ""I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no."" The story was too good for him to pass up. That's my recommendation to you: go rent the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend.",loyalty trait be admired,i dont think you find better example dogs devotion his master than this one based true life tale dog who was into routine meeting his beloved male owner every day at 5 p m at train station i saw this movie week ago i still cant get it out my mind if words love loyalty mean anything you this is nice story see unfold only major mistake made this movie is that it should have been done as 1920s period piece i say that because throughout story dog runs free around town city which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere whatever story is still very good very memorable very touching spots near end only spoiler ill use is good one if you fear watching animal film with bad sad ending youre safe dog survives thats all ill say that kudos richard gere nice performance this is definitely not he kind film he usually does but he explains bonus feature i read script cried couldnt say no story was too good him pass up thats my recommendation you go rent dvd sit back enjoy nice memorable tale mans best friend,0.7091666666666667,0.21591397849462365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.11}"
9,So Touching and Real!,"I just saw this movie today, and I'm so glad I did.It is based on a true story and it's only natural that the movie is great because the real story itself is very touching. One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.Sometimes they show things through Hachi's eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.This is not just a kids' movie. In the end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved. It is a must-see.",so touching real,i just saw this movie today im so glad i did it is based true story its only natural that movie is great because real story itself is very touching one things that sets this movie apart other movies that involve animals is how they stuck reality instead throwing some little hard believe elements here there just make it more entertaining sometimes they show things through hachis eyes as opposed human eyes which helps you relate him understand how he felt what he thought then as well as emphasizes that hachi is main character movie this is not just kids movie end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved it is must see,0.5411764705882353,0.21544117647058825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10,You cannot get it any better than this,"Its really hard to articulate when you have so much to write and so little words to express. And even lesser words which could actually help you convey what you want to say. The closest word which comes to my mind in this case is 'stupendous'.Hachiko is a true story about a dog in Japan and the special bond he shared with a professor whom he met when it was a little puppy. The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.The movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.Lastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10.",you cannot get it any better than this,its really hard articulate when you have so much write so little words express even lesser words which could actually help you convey what you want say closest word which comes my mind this case is stupendous hachiko is true story about dog japan special bond he shared with professor whom he met when it was little puppy story has been put forward exceptionally well by cast director movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort scenes yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after couple minutes into movie as other reviews suggest making whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is lastly coming someone who also rates eight below as one his favorites high rating hachiko would seem little biased many but my honest opinion i dont think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10,0.502595238095238,0.20023214285714283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8,"""You want to wait for him, don't you?""","Oh my, hold everything. You want to be prepared to watch this movie with plenty of Kleenex on hand. It really does resonate for viewers who have a special bond with their pets, but I think it probably moves a few hearts of those who don't share hearth and home with a favorite canine. It's a bit ironic actually, to think about the picture's impact on a person, when a dog's reaction to it's missing owner invites more sympathy than one feels for the owner himself, who died of a heart attack.Well, not to get too morbid, this was a sensitively told tale that one finds astonishingly hard to believe when it's revealed that Hachi celebrated his master for ten years after the man's death by showing up daily at a train station at the end of the work day to greet him. Based on an actual event that occurred in Japan in the 1920's, the film has been Westernized for an American audience with Richard Gere in the lead role as a university professor who adopts a wayward Akita puppy found wandering around a train station. But the real star is the pup who matures into the adult Hachi and takes full possession of the viewer's emotions on the way to a heart tugging finish.

Although the movie centered on the bond/love between Hachi and his human parent, this is also a story about love between spouse, love between friends, father-daughter love and most of all, a close knit community of people with a big heart...My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting, so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating, Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station.....This is a must see movie for every dog lovers.

10,A true story and one of the best films of all time ! (not exaggerating),"I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s-1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akita-breed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work, really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG (9 FREAKING YEARS). This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away (9 years is like 7 decades in dog years) waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Real-life Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years- wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life, Hachiko's was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners (Ueno and his wife and kids) too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners. Eventually, Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him, This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE (INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS) do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in real-life, the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead. I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years. You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachiko Or you can just Yahoo! Or Google Hachiko's real life story for more information.",true story one best films all time not exaggerating,i have watched some touching moving movies my lifetime about 2 movies have made me cry however i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this hachiko movie i was crying good 10 15 minutes even after this movie ended i have browsed through comments reviews this imdb board other online forums have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried i really think no other movie has made so many people cry whenever i saw hachiko go station sit there waiting oblivious fact his owner died my heart died little each time knowing that this movie was actually based real life story set 1920s 1930s tokyo whereby akita breed dog waited front shibuya train station day by day around same time at same spot nine whole years his beloved university professor professor ueno come back work really breaks my heart no animal or human would ever sit front station wait someone they love this long 9 freaking years this dog hachiko must have had such enormous love his owner that he would throw his life away 9 years is like 7 decades dog years waiting front station at right time each day how clever are dogs real life hachiko somehow knew how read time order wait at station at same time everyday 9 years waiting 9 years wow i never knew that extent animals love dedication persistence could reach those heights real life hachikos was given away after his masters death but he routinely escaped showing up again again at his old home this showed that hachiko loved his original owners ueno his wife kids too much let go his master ueno or his memory him wanted return his remaining living owners eventually hachikos apparently realized that his professor ueno no longer lived at house so he went look his master at train station where he had accompanied him so many times before how smart clever is that dog other original owners hachiko had moved different location hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is dog so he decided wait front railway station like he always used do his master turn up be reunited with him this real life story hachiko clearly demonstrated undying unconditional love another since both physical absence his owner professor ueno passing time would not diminish hachikos love unflinching loyalty his original master ueno this real life story also reminds us about how love can make anyone including animals dogs do crazy things someone they love somehow i just wished that real life wife family professor ueno should have just placed lifeless body professor ueno floor while hachiko sniff inspect body this might sound crazy all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life death would be able tell if fellow dog or human is dead i am quite sure that hachiko being clever enough wait at station at same time everyday 9 years would be able figure out that ueno was dead then this would have given hachiko at least closure then he would not have wait 9 years you can read up real life story hachiko this wikipedia page which also lists all japanese films made about hachiko or you can just yahoo or google hachikos real life story more information,0.470372088229231,0.17159090909090907,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7,It's hard to hate a cute doggy film...,"""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is a remake of a Japanese film, ""Hachi-Ko"" (1987). Oddly, however, this American version keeps SOME of the original Japanese story (such as the breed of dog, the dog's name and SOME of the events in the dog's life) and completely changes so much--especially since ""Hachi-Ko"" is based on a real life Japanese occurrence, not in America. Back in the 1920s and 30s, the real Hachi was a dog owned by a Japanese professor. One thing that set him apart from most dogs was that Hachi would meet the professor at the train station after work each day! But, even more unusual is that after the professor's death, Hachi CONTINUED this routine--waiting patiently for his master every day! In many ways, the story is like that of the very famous Scottish dog, Greyfriars Bobby--who is memorialized in Edinburgh outside the pub and church where the do would do its daily ritual (lying at his master's grave and then visiting the pub). In fact, I did some reading and found several other similar accounts throughout the world. This leads me to wonder WHY the film did a semi-remake. Why not just make a fictionalized story? Why keep a few details and change others--especially when this Japanese dog inexplicably shows up in Rhode Island!So does this lack of attention to detail mean I hate the film? Even as a retired history teacher, I cannot, as I must confess that I've owned dogs for years and currently have two massive hairy beasts who adore me (in addition to my two cats who alternate between adoration and ambivalence). I am a sucker for a film about a cute dog--and the Hachi in the movie is one of the cutest Akita's ever (much cuter, by the way, than the original Hachi). You cannot help but like the dog and enjoy seeing him interact with his owner (Richard Gere). But, there needs to be more than a cute dog to make a really good film--and currently this fame has an astonishingly high score of 8.2! Is this number, at least in part, less about the quality of the production and more a vote to signify that most everyone loves cute dogs? Well, yes. Objectively speaking, the film is a remake--and that's one strike against it at the onset. And, I just cannot imagine a pleasant doggy film making it to the IMDb's Top 250 List--but it did and it's currently #190--giving it a slightly higher rating than films like ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (one of the greatest films of the 1940s), ""Rocky"" (the first one was very nice), ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""The Celebration""--as well as the original Japanese film!! Overall, it's a nice doggy film that is VERY family-friendly at that and with a lovely and evocative piano soundtrack. By all means watch it-- but don't be surprised if you like it but don't love it.A few final notes: First, I noticed that AFTER the master died in this American adaptation, it ALWAYS seemed to be snowing in this town--for years and years after the death! Second, what's with the professor's wife?! Her husband dies and she finds Hachi at the end years later at the train station and is surprised to see him?! Where was she at the time...off-world or taking a very long nap?! Didn't someone bother to tell her about HER dog or didn't she ask about how old Hachi was doing?! This seems to be a missing plot thread. Third, if you are curious, Hachi's actual remains were stuffed after his death and he is on display at National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. And, there is a statue to him as well as annual celebrations in this country. How these people view an American film company 'appropriating' their story is something I would love to know.",its hard hate cute doggy film,hachi dogs tale is remake japanese film hachi ko 1987 oddly however this american version keeps some original japanese story such as breed dog dogs name some events dogs life completely changes so much especially since hachi ko is based real life japanese occurrence not america back 1920s 30s real hachi was dog owned by japanese professor one thing that set him apart most dogs was that hachi would meet professor at train station after work each day but even more unusual is that after professors death hachi continued this routine waiting patiently his master every day many ways story is like that very famous scottish dog greyfriars bobby who is memorialized edinburgh outside pub church where do would do its daily ritual lying at his masters grave then visiting pub fact i did some reading found several other similar accounts throughout world this leads me wonder why film did semi remake why not just make fictionalized story why keep few details change others especially when this japanese dog inexplicably shows up rhode island so does this lack attention detail mean i hate film even as retired history teacher i cannot as i must confess that ive owned dogs years currently have two massive hairy beasts who adore me addition my two cats who alternate between adoration ambivalence i am sucker film about cute dog hachi movie is one cutest akitas ever much cuter by way than original hachi you cannot help but like dog enjoy seeing him interact with his owner richard gere but there needs be more than cute dog make really good film currently this fame has astonishingly high score 8 2 is this number at least part less about quality production more vote signify that most everyone loves cute dogs well yes objectively speaking film is remake thats one strike against it at onset i just cannot imagine pleasant doggy film making it imdbs top 250 list but it did its currently giving it slightly higher rating than films like best years our lives one greatest films 1940s rocky first one was very nice fistful dollars celebration as well as original japanese film overall its nice doggy film that is very family friendly at that with lovely evocative piano soundtrack by all means watch it but dont be surprised if you like it but dont love it few final notes first i noticed that after master died this american adaptation it always seemed be snowing this town years years after death second whats with professors wife her husband dies she finds hachi at end years later at train station is surprised see him where was she at time off world or taking very long nap didnt someone bother tell her about her dog or didnt she ask about how old hachi was doing this seems be missing plot thread third if you are curious hachis actual remains were stuffed after his death he is display at national science museum japan ueno tokyo there is statue him as well as annual celebrations this country how these people view american film company appropriating their story is something i would love know,0.4664357429718876,0.1451305220883534,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10,This movie is pure heart and soul,"This is my first ever review. I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are.
