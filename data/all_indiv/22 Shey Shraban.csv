9,The Untold Movement...The right References...The melancholic Acting....Those Mystic Songs...and Above all masterpiece Story Telling!,""" Baise Srabon"" ( 22nd Srabon) is Spell Bounding, Erratic, Obnoxious, Mind Crunching and Meaningful all in the right ways! From Direction to Editing, From Songs to Acting, from start to finish it keeps on changing its context! There is so much one can write about the movie, that every anecdote/every phrase/every adjective will fall short of praises! This movie has lot of apt literally influences which makes it all the more special! From the clue containing poetry of the eminent Bengali Poets to the right references of "" hungry Movement"" of 60's to establish the base of a character, everything is a master stroke.And on top of it, there is Prasenit, one has to put this movie as a cross reference for Method acting in Indian Cinema. He is such a vibrant performer which is so easy on the eye that most of the time we tend to neglect his abilities! After "" Autograph"" I was really thinking what difference can he do with this role and he justified his abilities perfectly.The next point of talk has to be Anupam Roy's Music! Spell Bounding! Each track is easy on the ear and is equally soulful and also meaningful! ""Ekbar Bol, Gobheerey Jao and Ei Shrabon"" are perfect examples of music blended with lyrical poetry! Any Blemishes! Yeah, some sub plots are unwanted! could have made the movie ten minutes shorter. Also Raima is wasted to an extend! LAstly, go watch this one! They don't make movies like that anymore!

9,How a simple script can change to an utterly magnificent movie!,"Baishe Srabon, a magnificent movie with simple script but holds you in your seats. Every actor is mind-blowing, and talking about Prosenjit- never once in my mind had I thought that he would be such a pleasure to watch. Prosenjitda is really talented. His acting skills -(minus) his dramewali crying and 'tollywood style' revenge = a perfect blend. And the movie was worth watching, a real pleasure. A movie that talks about obsession. I promise that from next time onwards I will watch Prosenjitda's movie if he chooses scripts like this, and by 'I' , I mean every person who never thought that Prosenjit could act so flawlessly.",how simple script can change utterly magnificent movie,baishe srabon magnificent movie with simple script but holds you your seats every actor is mind blowing talking about prosenjit never once my mind had i thought that he would be such pleasure watch prosenjitda is really talented his acting skills minus his dramewali crying tollywood style revenge perfect blend movie was worth watching real pleasure movie that talks about obsession i promise that next time onwards i will watch prosenjitdas movie if he chooses scripts like this by i i mean every person who never thought that prosenjit could act so flawlessly,0.5267857142857142,0.30583333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10,A must watch movie !!!,"The enigmatic way bumba da act surprises me. Sometime he will act in so called typical 'Bengali' films made specifically for rural audience & then he will give these performances. I am really amazed. About others frankly speaking this is the first time I have liked pramabrata. Raima & Abir were good too. Overall it is a spotless movie, everything ranging from screenplay, music, cinematography, camera, acting, and story were near perfect. There are some bold dialog throwing in the movie and few incidence that will put smile in your face but in most of the parts you will be kept guessing what 's going to happen next. Parambrata is a top cop given charge to solve a serial killing. Now his is struck between his girlfriend who also happens to be Abir's best pal and his work. Prosenjit is a former cop with huge experience and when Parambrata and other officers fail to find out any information about the killer, he arrives at the scene to assist Kolkata Police.

10,Just one word..MAGNIFICENT,"With a watched movie list of around 1800, I sure nowadays can guess a crime thriller within half-time. But I was in for a shock. Or should I say pleasant surprise. Bengali movie is surely being resurrected. Every now and then, you will find a movie that's at par with national standards, if not international. The songs are outstanding, each one surpassing the previous, and aptly, the final end credits song, i.e., Gobheerey jao is the best. Now comes the best part. Am a die-hard Al Pacino fan. A few minutes back, I had a debate with a friend, who has not yet watched the movie. I just said, ""It's pointless not giving credit to an actor just because he's Bengali. This performance is surely up there in my rating books beside Pacino's Colonel of Scent of a Woman."" Dialogues of this movie are a class apart, with extraordinary subtle power, punched with dry sarcastic humor.

8,Must watch!!,"Writer-director Srijit Mukherjee's another masterpiece. Though this film is of the genre 'who-done-it' type thrillers, still there was enough drama and twists in the plot to keep you riveted to your seat. The film is a welcome change from the usual Indian musicals. Instead of stopping the pace of the movie, songs are used as background score and only used in parts in the movie. You have to purchase the soundtrack CD to listen to them in full. Excellent acting by veteran actor Prosenjit and special kudos to Goutam Ghosh for portrayal of the 'Hungryalist' poets of Kolkata of 50's. But Abhijit Pakrashi portrayed by Parambrata did not gel fit the requirements of brilliant and best inspector of Kolkata police department. He was a wimp who only can show anger in wrong places and flash his police badge to get undue advantages every now and then. In smaller roles Abir and Raima did excellent. Excellent music courtesy Anupam Roy. Bodhaditya Banerjee served justice with the scissors to match with the pace of the movie.

8,I won't call it mind-blowing but its definitely WATCHABLE,"I must say that it definitely scores over Srijit Mukherjee's last film 'Autograph'. It has some very bright performances from Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen, Abir Chatterjee and Rajesh Sharma. But one man who easily scores over everyone else is Goutam Ghose. He truly shines as the poetic-minded hardcore intellectual of a by-gone era. As for Parambrata I found it a little hard to imagine him as a tough cop. However his acting is believable.The plot has a couple of good surprises that are hard to predict. The story intermingles very well with the plot. The story-telling involves some non-linear sequences as well.(I would love to see more of these non-linear sequences in his future work)The screenplay is very bold. Its the first time I heard so much cursing in a Bangla film. However I still think that it needed a little more polishing(just my humble opinion).The cinematography is quite good and in a couple of scenes it really stands out. My personal favorite being the first scene where the director successfully captures the eeriness of a north-kolkata gully at night. The climax also has a very unique Ram Gopal Varma-ish kind of camera angle in it.All-In-All a considerably intelligent watch considering the usual play-with-your-emotions masala Bengali/Hindi fare.",i wont call it mind blowing but its definitely watchable,i must say that it definitely scores over srijit mukherjees last film autograph it has some very bright performances prosenjit chatterjee raima sen abir chatterjee rajesh sharma but one man who easily scores over everyone else is goutam ghose he truly shines as poetic minded hardcore intellectual by gone era as parambrata i found it little hard imagine him as tough cop however his acting is believable plot has couple good surprises that are hard predict story intermingles very well with plot story telling involves some non linear sequences as well i would love see more these non linear sequences his future work screenplay is very bold its first time i heard so much cursing bangla film however i still think that it needed little more polishing just my humble opinion cinematography is quite good couple scenes it really stands out my personal favorite being first scene where director successfully captures eeriness north kolkata gully at night climax also has very unique ram gopal varma ish kind camera angle it all all considerably intelligent watch considering usual play with your emotions masala bengali hindi fare,0.538970588235294,0.24388071895424837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8,definitely watchable..,"well, after watching a lot of Bengali movies, this film came as a pleasant surprise to me. Judging the film from its intensity, looks and specially MUSIC ,i would definitely say its a much better movie than some of the huge budget superhit bollywood films. The acting in this film has been good, but what steals your attention is the picturisation of the film. The film has a very good story line. Things to watch out for is the twist at the ending of the film apart from the macho unshaven Prosenjit using abusive language.

8,A very well crafted Movie,"I had the good fortune of watching this movie on Television and was astounded by it's profoundness. The movie recounts the attempt of a frustrated Police Officer Probir Roy Choudhary (Prosenjit)to be accepted back in the Police Force. Abhijit Pakrashi (Parambarta) a young police officer has been asked to solve a series of murders carried out according to verses in Bengali Poetry. The verses allude to a period in Bengali poetry called ""The Hungry Generation Movement""; a period characterized by rejection of conventional poetic canons and a return to the closeness of nature. Nibaron Chakraborty (Gautam Ghosh) is a struggling poet trying to keep the spirit of the Hungry Generation alive. Needless to say, this is a frustrated attempt as publishers continue to reject his offerings. The director keeps these two strands of stories moving at parallel tracks and towards the end a denouement occurs when the two tracks collide resulting in the young Police Officer understanding that to belong and be accepted can drive a person to taking flawed and morally ambiguous decisions. The movie doesn't give any easy answers. Both the main characters Gautam Ghosh and Prasenjit make brave attempts to stand out and be different but in the end are forced to compromise.A brave attempt and definitely deserves commendation for excellent story telling.",very well crafted movie,i had good fortune watching this movie television was astounded by its profoundness movie recounts attempt frustrated police officer probir roy choudhary prosenjit be accepted back police force abhijit pakrashi parambarta young police officer has been asked solve series murders carried out according verses bengali poetry verses allude period bengali poetry called hungry generation movement period characterized by rejection conventional poetic canons return closeness nature nibaron chakraborty gautam ghosh is struggling poet trying keep spirit hungry generation alive needless say this is frustrated attempt as publishers continue reject his offerings director keeps these two strands stories moving at parallel tracks towards end denouement occurs when two tracks collide resulting young police officer understanding that belong be accepted can drive person taking flawed morally ambiguous decisions movie doesnt give any easy answers both main characters gautam ghosh prasenjit make brave attempts stand out be different but end are forced compromise brave attempt definitely deserves commendation excellent story telling,0.4919913419913419,0.08782467532467532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.48}"
6,Too long and lacking in tension,"This is the first Indian movie if have ever watch all of the way through - enticed to it by the IMDb rating.The basic premise is a of serial killings and the police work to try to find the culprit. Usually this kind of movie would have tense moments, a climactic end and hopefully some twists and turns along the way.Instead, this movie had three musical montages! Maybe these are prerequisites in modern Indian cinema. The first montage certainly had a wide variety o settings - far greater than the rest of the movie, or than were needed. Those montages felt strangely out of place to me. I half-expected the cast to start dancing.The acting also came across as over-blown - of a standard found in a low budget straight-to-DVD production. Again, and based on reading the other reviews, perhaps this is the approach taken in Indian cinema. It is reminiscent of silent movie stars.I won't reveal the ending - but that too felt like something out of that aforementioned DVD style.I enjoyed the basic premise and the cinematography. And I enjoyed some of the sights of India.

Just leave it with a shock effect on the audience, who come out of the theatres awestruck. Srijit already announced his arrival with Autograph, but with Baishe Srabon, a new star is born. The use of Hungryalist movement poetry and character, that initial scene through the dark of North Kolkata aisles, everything was to an absolute tee. Goutam Ghose was praiseworthy in his portrayal of the Hungryalist poet and is by far among the best of director turned actors these days. Srijit could himself take a leaf out of his book when he himself has a shot at acting.

6,Worthy and entertaining but lacking a certain spark.,"I'm not sure whether the educational aspects of the film regarding the history of poetry during the 60's (The Hungry Generation) made up for the fact that most of the characters motivations and actions seemed contrived.Injecting new life into the tired old ""Serial killing investigated by jaded/alcoholic/retiring cop"" is clearly going to be difficult at the best of times, but this film was too drawn out for it's own good.The performances were fine, but when (apart from one character) they are not given much of a script to work with in the first place then as another reviewer pointed out, then it feels a bit ""flat"".I probably missed nearly all the dry sarcasm that others referred to and the denouement seemed far fetched to me.***************Spoilers Follow******************* I'll try not to spoil it too much here but the alcoholic ex-cop was the only character I thought was well written, but when he turned out to be what he was then I was left wondering about a few things: 1) The guy is so drunk when we're first introduced to him that it's hard to believe that he was capable of doing what he did. 2) The fact that he was an avid chess player and knew tons of poetry indicated that he was probably going to turn out to be what he was. 3) Don't they have any handwriting analysis in India? 4) Was he the other policeman's real father (the subs weren't good enough for me to fully work this out)? 5) You can be banned for life from the police force but then re-instated at the whim of a local inspector? ***************Spoilers End***********************Like I said: The subs weren't great so if I missed something then I'm sorry, but I think that Kahaani was a much better film in every respect.Cheers, Will",worthy entertaining but lacking certain spark,im not sure whether educational aspects film regarding history poetry during 60s hungry generation made up fact that most characters motivations actions seemed contrived injecting new life into tired old serial killing investigated by jaded alcoholic retiring cop is clearly going be difficult at best times but this film was too drawn out its own good performances were fine but when apart one character they are not given much script work with first place then as another reviewer pointed out then it feels bit flat i probably missed nearly all dry sarcasm that others referred denouement seemed far fetched me spoilers follow ill try not spoil it too much here but alcoholic ex cop was only character i thought was well written but when he turned out be what he was then i was left wondering about few things 1 guy is so drunk when were first introduced him that its hard believe that he was capable doing what he did 2 fact that he was avid chess player knew tons poetry indicated that he was probably going turn out be what he was 3 dont they have any handwriting analysis india 4 was he other policemans real father subs werent good enough me fully work this out 5 you can be banned life police force but then re instated at whim local inspector spoilers end like i said subs werent great so if i missed something then im sorry but i think that kahaani was much better film every respect cheers will,0.5489649900364186,0.10100752422180995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"

1,"A garbage compared to ""The stoneman murders""","Obviously copied or maybe inspired from ""The Stoneman murders"" (2009) featuring kay kay menon in lead role. Whereas ""The stoneman murders"" succeeded in every dimension that makes a crime thriller so enjoyable, this one is a garbage compared to that. Don't get me wrong, it starts off well giving a feeling of excitement of what might happen in the end. But as the film progreesses it gets boring because of it's slow pace, losing that feeling of excitement. And after all that waiting, spending time and energy to see the ending, well it doesn't give you a proper conclusion. Leaving you with not only questions unanswered but leaving you with absolutely no questions answered. It's like the writers and director wasted so much time convulating the simple crime thriller formula which was already so well implemented in ""The stoneman murders"" that they fell short on both time and energy in the end and just ended the film without any proper ending. I was very disappointed. It had very much potential having stars like Prasenjit and Parambrata but fell short delivering on behalf of bad directing, terrible writing and screenplay.Anyways if anyone wants to see this film in a different perspective with a lot better, proper conclusive ending and writing altogether then I shall suggest you to watch ""The stoneman murders"" if you haven't watched already.

The good cop turning bad cop thing is a story we have seen in many many films and needs no new exponents but that is precisely what this film is about. The bright sparks are Gautam Ghosh's acting,which in all fairness was quite good and the soundtrack for the film which is pretty enjoyable. But that is mostly it and that's the problem. While it is a refreshing change to watch Ghosh's acting skills,its not what people go to watch a movie for..Everyone Else's acting is pretty mediocre and the direction,slack. Not a must watch at any rate but more of a film you should watch when you find you have nothing much else to do. Having said that,it is not a bad film,just that it could have been a lot better.",too much melodrama,watchable film perhaps bit too melodramatic at times especially at end general plot is mostly predictable little flat good cop turning bad cop thing is story we have seen many many films needs no new exponents but that is precisely what this film is about bright sparks are gautam ghoshs acting which all fairness was quite good soundtrack film which is pretty enjoyable but that is mostly it thats problem while it is refreshing change watch ghoshs acting skills its not what people go watch movie everyone elses acting is pretty mediocre direction slack not must watch at any rate but more film you should watch when you find you have nothing much else do having said that it is not bad film just that it could have been lot better,0.5449214365881032,0.1896043771043771,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.1}"
1,Poor direction... And Too many unnecessary melodrama,"This movie is one time watchable.. But if you're a busy person then it gonna waste your timr. You will bored by flow of the movie. Pace of the movie is bit slow and too long. The main problem with film is its direction. He showed too many melodrama which weren't even related to the film. Plot is bit predictable & you know what is going to happen next. And it felt like the director just WANTED to make the movie lengthy. If you're a looking for suspense,thrill and mystery.. You will be disappointed as these things is missing from this film. And Bengali actors always do overacting, nothing to say about it.",poor direction too many unnecessary melodrama,this movie is one time watchable but if youre busy person then it gonna waste your timr you will bored by flow movie pace movie is bit slow too long main problem with film is its direction he showed too many melodrama which werent even related film plot is bit predictable you know what is going happen next it felt like director just wanted make movie lengthy if youre looking suspense thrill mystery you will be disappointed as these things is missing this film bengali actors always do overacting nothing say about it,0.4137254901960784,-0.13725490196078435,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.35}"
