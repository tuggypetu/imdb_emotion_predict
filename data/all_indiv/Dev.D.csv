10,A Piece Of Art.,"There are very few movies that make you wait for their day of release just like a torn lover waits for its lost love for that one last glance and Dev.D was certainly one of them. I just knew I had to watch it the moment I saw breathtaking visuals(The snorricam shots inspired from classics like Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting) in the trailer itself. The fact that the movie was directed by Mr. Maverick (of new age Indian cinema) got me even more excited. So now when I have seen the movie I am ecstatic because I got more than what I expected. This movie is all about your sense of perception of art. If you find charm in innovative screenplay, extraordinary photography, symbolic scenes and realistic acting you got to love this cinematic masterpiece and if you have a thing for colors, its an icing on the cake! But if you want to see an entertainer which is going to generate temporary emotions, unfortunately, its not for you. All those who find the story unrealistic must understand it is not the portrayal of what happens in love but the most beautiful depiction of what is going through one's mind when one gets/doesn't get love. So, either you will crave for the movie to go on till forever or wait for it to end. Of course, the story line is based on the original Devdas but this contemporary version has its own twists and turns and you better not expect the expected. Abhay Deol is absolutely fantastic.There is not a single scene where one can doubt the authenticity of the character he is playing. Both the new actresses are equally good. Mahie Gill deserves all the applause for doing many a tough scenes with calming ease and expression that can light a fire. Kalki's eyes never lose the innocence in the truest sense thanks to the beautiful portrayal even though her character transcends into one of the highest zones of maturity. I just fell in love with the movie and wanted to see more of the unpredictable series of events through extraordinary musical narration.The only thing which I missed in Dev.D was a bit of soul but that is exactly how it was meant to be.",piece art,there are very few movies that make you wait their day release just like torn lover waits its lost love that one last glance dev d was certainly one them i just knew i had watch it moment i saw breathtaking visuals snorricam shots inspired classics like requiem dream trainspotting trailer itself fact that movie was directed by mr maverick new age indian cinema got me even more excited so now when i have seen movie i am ecstatic because i got more than what i expected this movie is all about your sense perception art if you find charm innovative screenplay extraordinary photography symbolic scenes realistic acting you got love this cinematic masterpiece if you have thing colors its icing cake but if you want see entertainer which is going generate temporary emotions unfortunately its not you all those who find story unrealistic must understand it is not portrayal what happens love but most beautiful depiction what is going through ones mind when one gets doesnt get love so either you will crave movie go till forever or wait it end course story line is based original devdas but this contemporary version has its own twists turns you better not expect expected abhay deol is absolutely fantastic there is not single scene where one can doubt authenticity character he is playing both new actresses are equally good mahie gill deserves all applause doing many tough scenes with calming ease expression that can light fire kalkis eyes never lose innocence truest sense thanks beautiful portrayal even though her character transcends into one highest zones maturity i just fell love with movie wanted see more unpredictable series events through extraordinary musical narration only thing which i missed dev d was bit soul but that is exactly how it was meant be,0.5901117487163998,0.26760864458538874,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10,Get ready for contemporary Hindi cinema,"Ever thought of going to a 'remake' Hindi movie and getting apprehensive whether it will turn out to be better or as good as the previous, in this case, Devdas? well, here it is. And its not a remake, its much better. The most striking feature of this movie is the part played by Abhay Deol,(guy s got talent) which is simply very subtle and practical. No overacting (unlike any other Hindi hero), no songs around mountains and valleys, no getting emotional over your love (yes, believe me). Just chronological events that takes place with three characters around. Thats it. With a gist of recent events which include the DPS girl blow-job MMS, and the famous Drink n drive BMW mauling case in New Delhi, Anurag Kashyap has proved its possible to relate recent events in Indian cinema, which it lacks today. Never once in the movie you need a toilet break even if u need to pee really bad. Even the boldness in using the words like f*** (which i guess is the first time in commercial Hindi movie)is so well mixed, it never strikes out of the ordinary or routine. Must appreciate- Screenplay, direction, Abahay Deol. Music sucks mostly,( not a very good experiment) except a few times. Overall a very good experience, will be the most appreciated movie of 2009, unless anything else comes up.",get ready contemporary hindi cinema,ever thought going remake hindi movie getting apprehensive whether it will turn out be better or as good as previous this case devdas well here it is its not remake its much better most striking feature this movie is part played by abhay deol guy s got talent which is simply very subtle practical no overacting unlike any other hindi hero no songs around mountains valleys no getting emotional over your love yes believe me just chronological events that takes place with three characters around thats it with gist recent events which include dps girl blow job mms famous drink n drive bmw mauling case new delhi anurag kashyap has proved its possible relate recent events indian cinema which it lacks today never once movie you need toilet break even if u need pee really bad even boldness using words like f which i guess is first time commercial hindi movie is so well mixed it never strikes out ordinary or routine must appreciate screenplay direction abahay deol music sucks mostly not very good experiment except few times overall very good experience will be most appreciated movie 2009 unless anything else comes up,0.4346089931573803,0.10966764418377324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9,"Awesome, Mindblowing, Realistic : One of the Bollywood Best","The movie is a great depiction of modern world or modern love. The movie is absolutely mind blowing. Abhay Deol delivers his best performance till date and he is definitely in main league of actors now. If there is anyone after Aamir khan who we should credited for his choice of movies, its none other than Abhay Deol. I can blindly spent to watch any of his movies without reading any reviews.Coming back to movie apart from the modern remake of Devdas it explores the modern sexuality. It depicts what is going around and the way youngsters explores their sexual needs. This movie isn't for old age people and they will rate it 1 out of 10 as they wouldn't be able to digest the realism shown in the movie. First part of the movie is very charming and indulging. Though its not a comedy but you laugh every minute because of the hard hitting sexual dialogs and realistic talks. Direction is superb and actors did more than justice to their role. Second half is not as enjoyable as compared to 1st half but still its very enjoyable.This movie may turn out to be a flop in actual as its not a family movie, but i think this is more than commercial. Those who understand cinema needs to applaud it all the way.

10,Two thumbs up for AK's piece of art.,"Well I had been waiting for over two months for this film to release. And It has been worth the wait. Anurag Kashyap's Dev.D is a contemporary take on the immortal Devdas, whose boldness will dazzle you, to say the least. The direction and screenplay, as expected, are top-notch. The music is terrific, and has been used creatively to take the story forward. The performances are excellent too, with Abhay Deol delivering a brave, powerful performance that won't be easy to forget. Mahie Gill and Kalki are very impressive too. Watch this movie also for some gems- Paro going in the fields to get laid with Dev with mattresses tied to her bicycle and Chanda and Dev in the sauna-there are many more I promise. AK has successfully ironed out the flaws in the original Devdas, and that's what makes this dark film also a feel-good film at times. AK has handled sexuality and some real-life incidents (MMS scandal, BMW hit- and-run case) in a very mature manner, without being sensationalist. Don't miss it for anything. Watch it for its sheer audacity.""I give a 10/10 and two thumbs up for AK's newest piece of art.""",two thumbs up aks piece art,well i had been waiting over two months this film release it has been worth wait anurag kashyaps dev d is contemporary take immortal devdas whose boldness will dazzle you say least direction screenplay as expected are top notch music is terrific has been used creatively take story forward performances are excellent too with abhay deol delivering brave powerful performance that wont be easy forget mahie gill kalki are very impressive too watch this movie also some gems paro going fields get laid with dev with mattresses tied her bicycle chanda dev sauna there are many more i promise ak has successfully ironed out flaws original devdas thats what makes this dark film also feel good film at times ak has handled sexuality some real life incidents mms scandal bmw hit run case very mature manner without being sensationalist dont miss it anything watch it its sheer audacity i give 10 10 two thumbs up aks newest piece art,0.6323809523809524,0.3621428571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9,DevD is an 'its own movie'.,"This movie is 'not' a remake of Devdas. Probably, Anurag Kashyap wanted to borrow the base story from there, but I repeat if you are a big fan of Devdas then this movie isn't for you. But then again this is one of the most insane movies to come out of Bollywood. You might probably end up with a headache after watching it, but its completely worth it. There are few movies with such exceptional cinematography and music which blends completely with the movie.The characters are well defined, but also over the top. Abhay puts in a real perfect act of a self-sympathetic fool, who drinks and does drugs just in the obsession of Paro. He becomes completely lost and finally ends up in the arms of Chanda. Paro has apparently never known the words 'shy' nor 'blush'. Chanda has seen a lot of pain and is the only character who slowly becomes sure of herself.This movie is more about how they have painted the characters rather than the characters themselves. This is a first in Bollywood and I have never heard such dark, yet at times beautiful music. Its loud at times, but Amit Trivedi's work is a sheer genius one. If you do end up liking the movie, you would give half the credit to the music.Anurag and the entire team have poured in their heart for this movie. Most of the work and the ideas are genuine and is not picked up from some other random movie. It is an 'its own movie'.",devd is its own movie,this movie is not remake devdas probably anurag kashyap wanted borrow base story there but i repeat if you are big fan devdas then this movie isnt you but then again this is one most insane movies come out bollywood you might probably end up with headache after watching it but its completely worth it there are few movies with such exceptional cinematography music which blends completely with movie characters are well defined but also over top abhay puts real perfect act self sympathetic fool who drinks does drugs just obsession paro he becomes completely lost finally ends up arms chanda paro has apparently never known words shy nor blush chanda has seen lot pain is only character who slowly becomes sure herself this movie is more about how they have painted characters rather than characters themselves this is first bollywood i have never heard such dark yet at times beautiful music its loud at times but amit trivedis work is sheer genius one if you do end up liking movie you would give half credit music anurag entire team have poured their heart this movie most work ideas are genuine is not picked up some other random movie it is its own movie,0.608496732026144,0.12352941176470589,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.53}"
8,Devdas Kashyap-Style,"Dev.D, Anurag Kashyap's contemporary take on Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's classic novel Devdas is simply extraordinary. Kashyap's direction is excellent and his interpretation of the original story is a perfect example of how creative and artistic an adaptation of this sort can be. The film is set partly in Punjab and partly in Delhi and captures the atmosphere of both places with precision. Kashyap masterfully portrays the effervescence, colourfulness and rusticity of the rural Punjab areas from one side, and then explores the morbid and dark reality of the urban Delhi. The film is very realistic and aspects which contribute to this include the simple writing, the slick editing and cinematography and the natural acting. It deals with such themes as sexuality, love, drugs, prostitution, self-destruction, and complex relationships. The film's fast-paced narrative style, which includes authentic dialogues, serious proceedings and many many songs (all of which are lovely, modern, and appropriately selected), is very unique and matter-of-fact. Abhay Deol stars as a modern-day Devdas, and he does an excellent job. He shows Dev's confusion, complacence, gradual ruin, and later his self-acceptance and coming to terms, with conviction and depth. Kashyap introduces two young girls in the leading roles. Mahie Gill is the first, and she is first-rate in her debut performance as Paro - very believable and impulsive. Kalki Koechlin is less impressive at first, but grows on you as the story goes by. At some points in the initial portions it looks like she's struggling with her lines, but in the second half, she confidently turns into a charming young lady and ultimately leaves a mark. The film's ending is fantastic and unexpected. To sum it up, Dev.D is Kashyap's gem. It is a prime quintessence of Hindi cinema's capability and coming-of-age. I recommend you to watch it.",devdas kashyap style,dev d anurag kashyaps contemporary take sarat chandra chatterjees classic novel devdas is simply extraordinary kashyaps direction is excellent his interpretation original story is perfect example how creative artistic adaptation this sort can be film is set partly punjab partly delhi captures atmosphere both places with precision kashyap masterfully portrays effervescence colourfulness rusticity rural punjab areas one side then explores morbid dark reality urban delhi film is very realistic aspects which contribute this include simple writing slick editing cinematography natural acting it deals with such themes as sexuality love drugs prostitution self destruction complex relationships films fast paced narrative style which includes authentic dialogues serious proceedings many many songs all which are lovely modern appropriately selected is very unique matter fact abhay deol stars as modern day devdas he does excellent job he shows devs confusion complacence gradual ruin later his self acceptance coming terms with conviction depth kashyap introduces two young girls leading roles mahie gill is first she is first rate her debut performance as paro very believable impulsive kalki koechlin is less impressive at first but grows you as story goes by at some points initial portions it looks like shes struggling with her lines but second half she confidently turns into charming young lady ultimately leaves mark films ending is fantastic unexpected sum it up dev d is kashyaps gem it is prime quintessence hindi cinemas capability coming age i recommend you watch it,0.5381696428571426,0.2752604166666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.38}"

The story deals with a loser ( Abhay Deol ) and how he deals with his life. Its like a modern rip-off from Devdas.Everything about this movie is top notch. Right from the direction to the sets, its stunning. The screenplay is impeccable & the cinematography couldn't get better. The visuals are delightful. The music score is exceptional.

8,The movie that earned Kashyap fame!,"Dev D is a modern-day interpretation of the classic novel ""Devdas"" by Sarat Chandra. Dev (Abhay Deol), Paro (Mahi Gill) and Chanda (Kalki Koechlin) of Dev D reflect the sensibilities, conflicts aggression, and independence. Free thought, exuberance and recklessness of the youth of today. A generation that is jammed between eastern roots and western sensibilities. Dev D is set in the rustic and colorful Punjab and also explores the dingy, morbid, dark underbelly of Delhi. From sprawling mustard fields to a riot of neon. Now we have come through various versions of the novel ""Devdas"", but ""Dev. D"" is way different than all the others. It's not actually the remake of Devdas, yet it can be said as it has been just inspired by it. There are minor similarities yet the characters are similar in a way. The new Devdas likes to have his vodka with Coke, asks Paro for some nude pictures of herself, chats with Paro through IM, likes to have sex, smokes even during pissing after waking up in the morning & does other various stuffs according to the current trend of Indian Youth. There are so many reasons why ""Dev. D"" strikes hard on it's viewers. It's a coming of an age cinema of Bollywood. Bollywood never did witnessed any stuff like Dev. D ever before. The soul of the movie lies within it's characters, specially ""Dev.D"" along with Paro, Chanda & Chunni. The movie also depicts Delhi in a superior way. Anurag Kashyap always trying to do something new & creative with each of his movies. First it was Black Friday, which portrayed some stunning reality behind the blasts in Mumbai in the year 1993, which also made it highly controversial & then it was ""No Smoking"", which was an attempt of a cult movie, though it failed to express the real message behind the movie. Anurag Kashyap this time does it in a Tarantino style. A love story in a Tarantino way. Now that's something really innovative! He gives an extra-ordinary direction, with keeping in mind to entertain the viewers. The humor of the movie with it's witty one liners keeps the viewers hooked during the first half. Though the second half looses it's momentum a bit, the movie still strikes in a powerful way. Now if we talk about the performances, Abhay Deol is one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Not only he performs well, but what he did in this movie is called ""Class Act"". Top class act by Abhay. Also the performances by the two of the new-comers is refreshing & amazing. Adding to all the factors above is the music or the score of the movie. That's something different yet again for Bollywood. The track ""Emotional Atyachar"" is already famous. But the best tracks of the movie are ""Ek Hulchul Si"" & ""Emotional Atyachar (Rock Version)"". It would simply blow the mind of the lovers of rock music. Excellent songs & score by Amit Trivedi.

10,Extraordinarily Brilliant....,"The depiction of a modern day Devdas could not have been done any better then what Anurag Kashyap managed in Dev D through Abhay Deol. The deciphering of the movie in totality, cant really be ascertained in a single viewing. Subtle nuances keep coming up with every viewing, that is very unlike any regular Hindi potboiler but very much like the work of Martin Scorsesse, Coppola and Stanley Kubrick, the directors who have influenced Kashyap a great deal. Few are able to disencumber the wannabe tag of wanting to create something like the illustrious directors, but Anurag crosses this great divide with Dev D. He is truly the best voice in Indian cinema today because he makes a movie for himself first and foremost, (like the other great directors mentioned) and makes it with all his heart and soul. The result of his dedication can be seen in Dev D which is a flawless flick with bluntness that will raise eyebrows in the western world, what to talk of Indian sensibility? Everything is just that perfect in Dev D.Cinematography is delightful & vividly colorful. Delhi has never looked better, looks even better then in Mouna Ragam of Mani Ratnam. Abhay Deol pulls off a remarkable character with consummate ease. The depth and the recklessness and the pain and the disarming smile is very reminiscent of the great performance of Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. Is there is any better young method actor in India, then Abhay Deol? Plain simple, No! In a career spanning just a few films he has shown a repertoire that few actors don't achieve in a lifetime. Kudos, Abhay. Mahi Gill is very competent as a village belle and Kalki Koechlin-just superb. Drugs long seen a taboo in the Indian society, though it remains a rampant problem is dealt with great finesse and audacity in Dev D. People may point this as patronizing drugs but that is not it. He wants to talk about an important social issue and he pulls it off with aplomb. It gives a feeling of hate drugs very reminiscent of Trainspotting, and that is not patronizing but presenting a very important social problem with a difference. The remaining cast is solid and helps in the overall movie compactness. Music by Amit Trivedi is very different from the repetitive bollywood music that we keep churning out. It is fresh and strikingly different from anything that we have heard in Hindi cinema. That this movie is a hit should bolster Anurag's confidence. India, is finally ready for his kind of Cinema as he keeps on saying.",extraordinarily brilliant,depiction modern day devdas could not have been done any better then what anurag kashyap managed dev d through abhay deol deciphering movie totality cant really be ascertained single viewing subtle nuances keep coming up with every viewing that is very unlike any regular hindi potboiler but very much like work martin scorsesse coppola stanley kubrick directors who have influenced kashyap great deal few are able disencumber wannabe tag wanting create something like illustrious directors but anurag crosses this great divide with dev d he is truly best voice indian cinema today because he makes movie himself first foremost like other great directors mentioned makes it with all his heart soul result his dedication can be seen dev d which is flawless flick with bluntness that will raise eyebrows western world what talk indian sensibility everything is just that perfect dev d cinematography is delightful vividly colorful delhi has never looked better looks even better then mouna ragam mani ratnam abhay deol pulls off remarkable character with consummate ease depth recklessness pain disarming smile is very reminiscent great performance robert de niro raging bull is there is any better young method actor india then abhay deol plain simple no career spanning just few films he has shown repertoire that few actors dont achieve lifetime kudos abhay mahi gill is very competent as village belle kalki koechlin just superb drugs long seen taboo indian society though it remains rampant problem is dealt with great finesse audacity dev d people may point this as patronizing drugs but that is not it he wants talk about important social issue he pulls it off with aplomb it gives feeling hate drugs very reminiscent trainspotting that is not patronizing but presenting very important social problem with difference remaining cast is solid helps overall movie compactness music by amit trivedi is very different repetitive bollywood music that we keep churning out it is fresh strikingly different anything that we have heard hindi cinema that this movie is hit should bolster anurags confidence india is finally ready his kind cinema as he keeps saying,0.5114332334332335,0.2891385281385282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Devdas 'Redefined',"DevD is a romantic black comedy movie starring Abhay Deol and debutant Mahie Gill and Kalki Koechlin with Dibyendu Bhattacharya.This movie is a typical Anurag Kashyap Brainchild with Sex, Drugs, liquor and very little violence although Anurag Kashyap is known for violence.The film tells the story of modern Devdas and his life.The movie is been scripted and directed very well and full credit should be given to the director and scriptwriter.The screenplay of the movie is also good and will keep you glued to the movie. Also special mention of the background score of the movie as it supports the scenes with an apt. The special mention to the MMS scandal which shook the country was beautifully linked with the story and also showed the aftermath of that scandal.As far as acting is concerned Abhay Deol is one of the most underrated talent of the Bollywood and he had done an amazing role. Mahie Gill was also very good although she was doing her first film but was very impressive. In my opinion Kalki koechlin is one of the most overrated actress and her immaturity as a fresher can be seen many times during the movie.Overall an entertaining typical 'Anurag Kashyap' movie.",devdas redefined,devd is romantic black comedy movie starring abhay deol debutant mahie gill kalki koechlin with dibyendu bhattacharya this movie is typical anurag kashyap brainchild with sex drugs liquor very little violence although anurag kashyap is known violence film tells story modern devdas his life movie is been scripted directed very well full credit should be given director scriptwriter screenplay movie is also good will keep you glued movie also special mention background score movie as it supports scenes with apt special mention mms scandal which shook country was beautifully linked with story also showed aftermath that scandal as far as acting is concerned abhay deol is one most underrated talent bollywood he had done amazing role mahie gill was also very good although she was doing her first film but was very impressive my opinion kalki koechlin is one most overrated actress her immaturity as fresher can be seen many times during movie overall entertaining typical anurag kashyap movie,0.5703968253968253,0.3221056547619047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10,Daring and Innovative Storytelling,"Take a bow Anurag Kashyap!! With Dev D, he has created a modern masterpiece of Bollywood. This is anything but the typical brainless crap that comes on a weekly basis. A modern rendition of the acclaimed novel Devdas, Dev D is able to show a real depiction of India and the performances by everyone including the supporting actors who have a few lines deserves praise. In particular, Abhay Deol and Kalki Koechlin proved their acting chops in playing complex characters which definitely deserves some recognition. The cinematography is magnificent and the film is a visual treat. However the main reason for the brilliance of this film is its well-written screenplay. Anurag Kashyap has never shied away from doing things differently and with this movie he has proved that he is the best director in Bollywood. As an audience, I believe that we must watch movies like these.

I rewatched Dev D thinking that now that I'm old and mature I'll understand it. But I was so wrong. The movie is still boring and too long.

8,Post-modern take on the eternal loser lover of Indian cinema,"I am not very familiar with Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's 'Devdas'. I know that it was about a rich bugger from Bengal who drank himself to death over a girl he loved. I also know that there have been several filmed versions of the novella though I'd failed to catch any of them, save a couple of scenes from Sanjay Leela Bhansali's version starring SRK. Anurag Kashyap's reputation for art-house genius aside, it was the standout publicity hoardings, wreaking of seduction and psychedelia that pulled me in -- first day, first show. Picture's up and I am greeted with the playful camaraderie between two kids, with the little boy Dev biting little Paro's hand, followed by a scene in which the same brat argues with his father as to why he cannot address him by his pet name -- Sattu. One resounding slap later and Dev is packed off to London, where he magically evolves into a horny, pot-smoking, i-pod-toting cad (Abhay Deol). The little girl whose arm he had nibbled on earlier has now grown into a gorgeous young Paro (or Parminder, played by Mahi Gill). The childhood fondness has evolved with puberty into a teasing romance bathed in sexual innuendo. And when Paro consents to sending Dev a snapshot of herself naked, he promptly decides to head homeward (Kashyap's naughty lines are priceless in this scene). However, destiny intervenes by way of a gross misunderstanding, shattering the 'happily-ever-after' and giving us a story. In the ensuing misunderstanding, Dev shuns Paro, leading to her taking the rather severe step of getting married to a rich widower. Fraught with guilt, Dev begins to sink to the depths of alcoholic depression, as the frustrated loser begins to take shape. After one particularly violent bout with the bottle, Dev passes out and wakes up to find himself in the squalid interiors of a hotel in Delhi's neon-lit Pahar Ganj area. The third vital character in the plot, Chanda / Chandramukhi (played by Indo- French actress Kalki Koelchin) is introduced here. A former victim of a horrible MMS scandal, she now wears the persona of an in-demand, college-going prostitute who, when she is not bringing men to orgasms over the phone in Tamil, dresses up in a variety of imaginative outfits (ironically, one of them happens to be that of an 'all-American school girl') and engages in kinky role play with mama's boys. Through a delightfully slimy pimp Chunni (a fine performance by Dibyendu Bhattacharya), Dev is introduced to Chanda. In Chanda, Dev finds an outlet for his love for Paro, a comforting listener. Just as things begin to warm, Kashyap's tale veers off in a different direction from the original and... I shan't tell you more. Technically, Kashyap's 'Dev D.' is a visually delectable film against the psychedelic backdrop of sex, drugs and some Desi wedding band fare. Cinematographer Rajeev Ravi does a fine job of capturing the grittiness of Pahargunj  whether it be the grimy squalor of Dev's hotel or Chanda's lair drenched in shocking pink. The play with film speeds works particularly well in the heady drinking scenes as do the 'Requiem for a Dream'-like floating shots of a well-hammered Dev wandering back to his room in a chemical daze. Amit Trivedi's music (a bulky, multi-genre score that moves from folk to jazz to hard rock) is a solid character in itself, as it meanders through scenes, hitting the spot every time.The screaming reception his 'Emosanal Atyachar' got in the cinema hall,is testament that brassy wedding band fare can indeed be made to sound hip. The acting department is damn tight. Mahi Gill's Paro is a thrill to watch  a character perfectly aware of her sexuality and surprisingly expressive for her small-town background. Although Kalki Koelchin may run into rough patches with the accent and diction, her emotional scenes make up for it, especially in the film's second-half, as the relationship between her and Dev begins to evolve. Dibyendu Bhattacharya almost steals the show as Chunni (Kashyap's re-incarnation of the original Chunnilal) but in the end, it is Abhay Deol who takes the cake, champagne and the butter chicken home, playing the coke-snorting loser lover, with measured confidence and understated cool. The gentleman's acting chops are firmly in place and I am not surprised as to why everyone is raving about him. It would be good to see more of Mahi Gill, Kalki Koelchin and Dibyendu in the future.So where lie the pitfalls then? For one, the film's length (a heady three hours) is overwhelming and Kashyap might have just managed to overcome this, had it not been for its extended trajectory that runs into an abrupt wall. Some might even argue that Trivedi's score drenches almost all the scenes in the film. But the pros far outweigh the cons here. For the most past, the film's characters are unabashedly honest and real. Kashyap's script-writing chops give us gems like the 'haldi' scene, the 'ticket' scene where Dev gets reprimanded by an old female co-passenger on the bus, after a particularly nasty alcoholic binge as well as Paro's delightfully ingenious solution to finding a venue for her and Dev to consummate their relationship (and the aftermath). Those of you familiar with the medical sitcom 'Scrubs', will take great pleasure in Kashyap's use of the aforementioned dancing boy trio for moments of random delight. ' Dev D.' is an important film to consume as we sit on the cusp of a more progressive Indian cinema  a sign of good things to come. You may not exactly fall in lust, as the film urges one to, but you will certainly want to discuss it, perhaps even fight over it.",post modern take eternal loser lover indian cinema,i am not very

10,One of the best film ever made in Bollywood .,"This is a technical genius of Indian Cinema. One of the best films ever made. One film I personally can even think of parallel y in terms of quality would be Omkara. Dev D is not a film but a reflection of Indian youth as it is in the new century. If there was something called a psychedelic film this would definitely be the one. The soundtrack itself through out the film creates a unparalleled atmosphere. Blended superbly is the story and the characters. I am not a movie critic but I have seen IMDb top 250 and exhaustively Korean, french , Italian and Brazilian movies. This movie stand apart from the rest. There will never be another Dev D like there will never be another Avatar or Schindler's list. The only reason this film did not get worldwide recognition it deserves because it is an Indian film maybe and there should be more exposure of Indian films.If you are not from India, and you are reading this review, watch this film once. Please make a point of watching it with headphones on or good loudspeakers. Watch it at a time, when you are most relaxed and trust me, you will never forget this film. I can personally guarantee that any Indian worth his taste in films, have not watched this movie less than a couple of times.Enjoy the film. I don't write much review, but I like sharing the happiness i get from watching great films. More so, if i can share it with someone not from my country. Dev D is a reflection of India of the 21st century. A India you may have not seen or thought off. This will change your perception of the country to a large extent and will definitely be one of your favorite movies of all time. Blurays are available with subtitles. But trust me, except for some dialogues, the film will reach you beyond the barriers of language.If you are in your 20s, or early 30s, and if you have not watched Dev D , you cannot say you have watched world cinema.I think Schindler's list should be IMDb's no. 1 film and i think Dev D definitely would deserve a place in that list's top 15 if it was watched by the world at large. So watch the film, you will love it, share it with your friends. After-all that's what watching movies is all about. Enjoy with a drink or whatever makes you feel good. :) Adios..",one best film ever made bollywood,this is technical genius indian cinema one best films ever made one film i personally can even think parallel y terms quality would be omkara dev d is not film but reflection indian youth as it is new century if there was something called psychedelic film this would definitely be one soundtrack itself through out film creates unparalleled atmosphere blended superbly is story characters i am not movie critic but i have seen imdb top 250 exhaustively korean french italian brazilian movies this movie stand apart rest there will never be another dev d like there will never be another avatar or schindlers list only reason this film did not get worldwide recognition it deserves because it is indian film maybe there should be more exposure indian films if you are not india you are reading this review watch this film once please make point watching it with headphones or good loudspeakers watch it at time when you are most relaxed trust me you will never forget this film i can personally guarantee that any indian worth his taste films have not watched this movie less than couple times enjoy film i dont write much review but i like sharing happiness i get watching great films more so if i can share it with someone not my country dev d is reflection india 21st century india you may have not seen or thought off this will change your perception country large extent will definitely be one your favorite movies all time blurays are available with subtitles but trust me except some dialogues film will reach you beyond barriers language if you are your 20s or early 30s if you have not watched dev d you cannot say you have watched world cinema i think schindlers list should be imdbs no 1 film i think dev d definitely would deserve place that lists top 15 if it was watched by world at large so watch film you will love it share it with your friends after all thats what watching movies is all about enjoy with drink or whatever makes you feel good adios,0.41223871366728515,0.33137909709338276,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9,Another Step Forward for Hindi Cinema,"The novel 'Devdas' written by Saratchandra Chatterjee has forever fascinated Indian film-makers. The story has all the ingredients which a film-maker can utilize to create a magnum opus. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, Dev.D is a tweaked version of this legendary novel.Bimal Roy's Devdas and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas were the same in terms of the story but differed greatly in treatment. The story was seen and depicted differently by the two directors. Anurag Kashyap, who belongs to the bright new young brigade in Bollywood, a gang which is willing to experiment and truly do different stuff, gives Devdas a smashingly cool urban treatment.The story has the structural frame of the old Devdas, but the building blocks are different. Devdas is Dev, a rich spoilt brat, a highly complex character, a nymphomaniac who asks his childhood love to send her nude pictures via web cam! Paro is a Jattini, not quite the gentle Paro we know from the previous two versions. This Paro is a real toughie. She is passionate, carries a mattress to the dense farms so that she can make love to her sweetheart Dev and runs around with sticks in her hand beating the crap out of guy trying to assassinate her character! Chandramukhi is 'Chanda', a young girl who becomes a prostitute after her own parents give up on her when she is caught in the web of an infamous MMS scandal.The tweaked storyline might sound cheesy for many people but Dev.D does successfully and charmingly retain the major ingredients of the original story - of romance, jealousy, egotism, unrequited love, anguish, addiction and tragedy. The film is anything but melodramatic. The story is real in the truest sense of the word and what happens in the protagonists life could very well have happened to someone you know. Even if that is not the case, one has surely heard of true tales of men completely losing it and going down the drains after a heartburn.The real highlight of Dev.D after the adapted storyline is the brilliance with which it has been shot. Right from the farms of Punjab to the dark creepy lanes of Paharganj in Delhi, Dev.D is a remarkable achievement in Cinematography! In fact, the film captures Delhi in a manner which no film so far has been able to. It is also superb on visuals and art direction. For instance, instead of the clichéd coughing-up-blood-on hand we have the sloshed Dev immersing his face in water and exhaling red bubbles of blood. Yes, that is creative film-making for you! What further supplements the screenplay is an insanely addictive soundtrack incorporated superbly into the storyline.Dilip Kumar did it in the 1955, Shahrukh Khan did it 2002 and now Abhay Deol has done it by playing Dev.D in 2009. Abhay Deol's character is a highly complex character with many grey shades and it's not a role which you would think is suited to his good-guy-next-door image but he excels and prove his mettle once again. Here is one actor in the Industry who has consistently experimented and delivered the goods over a period of time, be it Socha Na THa, Ek Chaalis, Aahista Aahista or Oye Lucky. Abhay Deol just keeps raising the bar with every film.The two newcomers who are the female leads are well cast in their respective roles. The beautiful and mesmerizing actress playing Paro is quite a show stealer. It's a performance which comes across as very natural. The other actress playing Chanda after the initial hiccups, settles into the role and ends up leaving a mark.Dev.D is not by any means an absolutely flawless movie. It has its share of glitches. The major one being the lack of emotional connect with any of the characters, particularly with the character of Dev. But then I don't think it was the intention of the film makers to establish that connect in the first place.Like Luck By Chance which released last week, Dev.D is again a movie which caters to a niche audience but shows the way forward for Hindi Cinema.",another step forward hindi cinema,novel devdas written by saratchandra chatterjee has forever fascinated indian film makers story has all ingredients which film maker can utilize create magnum opus directed by anurag kashyap dev d is tweaked version this legendary novel bimal roys devdas sanjay leela bhansalis devdas were same terms story but differed greatly treatment story was seen depicted differently by two directors anurag kashyap who belongs bright new young brigade bollywood gang which is willing experiment truly do different stuff gives devdas smashingly cool urban treatment story has structural frame old devdas but building blocks are different devdas is dev rich spoilt brat highly complex character nymphomaniac who asks his childhood love send her nude pictures via web cam paro is jattini not quite gentle paro we know previous two versions this paro is real toughie she is passionate carries mattress dense farms so that she can make love her sweetheart dev runs around with sticks her hand beating crap out guy trying assassinate her character chandramukhi is chanda young girl who becomes prostitute after her own parents give up her when she is caught web infamous mms scandal tweaked storyline might sound cheesy many people but dev d does successfully charmingly retain major ingredients original story romance jealousy egotism unrequited love anguish addiction tragedy film is anything but melodramatic story is real truest sense word what happens protagonists life could very well have happened someone you know even if that is not case one has surely heard true tales men completely losing it going down drains after heartburn real highlight dev d after adapted storyline is brilliance with which it has been shot right farms punjab dark creepy lanes paharganj delhi dev d is remarkable achievement cinematography fact film captures delhi manner which no film so far has been able it is also superb visuals art direction instance instead clich d coughing up blood hand we have sloshed dev immersing his face water exhaling red bubbles blood yes that is creative film making you what further supplements screenplay is insanely addictive soundtrack incorporated superbly into storyline dilip kumar did it 1955 shahrukh khan did it 2002 now abhay deol has done it by playing dev d 2009 abhay deols character is highly complex character with many grey shades its not role which you would think is suited his good guy next door image but he excels prove his mettle once again here is one actor industry who has consistently experimented delivered goods over period time be it socha na tha ek chaalis aahista aahista or oye lucky abhay deol just keeps raising bar with every film two newcomers who are female leads are well cast their respective roles beautiful mesmerizing actress playing paro is quite show stealer its performance which comes across as very natural other actress playing chanda after initial hiccups settles into role ends up leaving mark dev d is not by any means absolutely flawless movie it has its share glitches major one being lack emotional connect with any characters particularly with character dev but then i dont think it was intention film makers establish that connect first place like luck by chance which released last week dev d is again movie which caters niche audience but shows way forward hindi cinema,0.5579301058878525,0.21239233380078448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"
5,A More Modern Bollywood Needs The Scissors,"This is not your old-fashioned Bollywood film, with colored saris unfurled in green fields with dancing waves of wheat while romance blooms back at home in spite of interference from the older generation: when those musicals are good they are very good indeed.Instead, this is a gritty modern take on misunderstood romance, on living an attitude rather than a reasoned existence. The story is brilliantly filmed in many ways, with lots of electric neon color, the stunning visuals backed by a modern beat, a trio of moon dancers tossed in at one point for ironic counterpoint. I thought the young actress Kalki Koechlin was sensationally effective as a young woman on the run from her past, but the lead, Abhay Deol, although magnetic, can only carry moody angst so far, and after almost two hours of sulky, unshaven drugged-out, drunken staggering, Id had enough--how many times do I really want Abhay to get drunk or stoned or beat up?. It is fascinating to see the Bollywood product evolving in modern ways, but although sincerity was evident from this film, it went on about an hour too long: someone get the scissors!",more modern bollywood needs scissors,this is not your old fashioned bollywood film with colored saris unfurled green fields with dancing waves wheat while romance blooms back at home spite interference older generation when those musicals are good they are very good indeed instead this is gritty modern take misunderstood romance living attitude rather than reasoned existence story is brilliantly filmed many ways with lots electric neon color stunning visuals backed by modern beat trio moon dancers tossed at one point ironic counterpoint i thought young actress kalki koechlin was sensationally effective as young woman run her past but lead abhay deol although magnetic can only carry moody angst so far after almost two hours sulky unshaven drugged out drunken staggering id had enough how many times do i really want abhay get drunk or stoned or beat up it is fascinating see bollywood product evolving modern ways but although sincerity was evident this film it went about hour too long someone get scissors,0.5383908045977012,0.2354022988505747,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9,Interesting retake on Devdas!!,"Anurag Kashyap's takes the audience through a musical journey and his own theme of grey characters, dark world, and drugs. This is one of the best Bollywood movies that has used music to enhance the screenplay rather than the usual style of a foot-tapping dance of 100+ artists at an unwanted place in the story. The plot gets monotonous at some point later, but still this one is a refreshingly new take of a classic novel.",interesting retake devdas,anurag kashyaps takes audience through musical journey his own theme grey characters dark world drugs this is one best bollywood movies that has used music enhance screenplay rather than usual style foot tapping dance 100 artists at unwanted place story plot gets monotonous at some point later but still this one is refreshingly new take classic novel,0.3171212121212121,0.19530303030303028,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
6,"Different from typical Bollywood, but overrated here","Dev D is certainly a unique take on the Devdas story, but that alone is not enough to warrant this film getting more than 7 stars, tops. It is brash, explicit, and shows Indian youth in a way not often portrayed in Indian cinema (rude, obnoxious, disrespectful). But that doesn't make this a good film. Just different.The acting is passable. I don't think that anyone is grossly miscast, but at the same time, there is very little call for real acting in this film. The biggest problem lies in the script, which never creates any emotional connection between the characters. The only character we develop any sympathy for at all is Chanda. Frankly, making the film from Chanda's point of view, and discarding the ties to the Devdas story, might have been a better direction to go with this.Technically, it is decent work. The use of the Snorricam is unique in Bollywood, but it doesn't break any new ground. Same with the underwater shots. The lighting is excellent, but the direction and cinematography aren't memorable. Most of the songs are forgettable, although one theme is used very well. The songs are not well-integrated, often rendering them an annoying distraction.Overall, this can only be rated an above-average film, at best. I don't think I'd watch it more than twice.",different typical bollywood but overrated here,dev d is certainly unique take devdas story but that alone is not enough warrant this film getting more than 7 stars tops it is brash explicit shows indian youth way not often portrayed indian cinema rude obnoxious disrespectful but that doesnt make this good film just different acting is passable i dont think that anyone is grossly miscast but at same time there is very little call real acting this film biggest problem lies script which never creates any emotional connection between characters only character we develop any sympathy at all is chanda frankly making film chandas point view discarding ties devdas story might have been better direction go with this technically it is decent work use snorricam is unique bollywood but it doesnt break any new ground same with underwater shots lighting is excellent but direction cinematography arent memorable most songs are forgettable although one theme is used very well songs are not well integrated often rendering them annoying distraction overall this can only be rated above average film at best i dont think id watch it more than twice,0.5294306703397613,0.12401859504132234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.23}"

5,This is a very different Bollywood movie,"Not every film is required to entertain its audience, but every film must engage its viewers. Now that's a tall order when the film in question centers around the most boring, uni-dimensional character Indian literature could have possibly produced – the alcoholic, self-destructive romantic, Devdas. Add to that the fact that at least three Hindi films have already transported Devdas' tragic story to the screen. Still, director Anurag Kashyap's Dev D, is a fresh, original take on the subject and the characters, but it's also a long and tiresome film that is not for the fainthearted. Rooted in the real and the contemporary, Kashyap's film stars Abhay Deol as Dev, an aimless Benjamin Braddock-like drifter who returns home to Punjab after a graduation abroad, but has little in terms of future plans, except for getting into the sack with his childhood friend Paro, with whom he's spent many a long night talking dirty on the phone. On learning that she might have had a promiscuous past, Dev rejects Paro and her advances, driving her to marry a man she doesn't love, and landing himself in a downward spiral of booze and drugs and whores. Kashyap takes the basic structure of Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's original story, but in setting it in the now, updates much of the film's narrative, and makes the characters' actions and motivations more relatable. So you get a back-story to the Chanda character, the hooker Dev hooks up with in his desperate, despondent phase; and sex itself becomes the invisible but omnipresent motivation that drives many an important plot-point. In it's first forty odd minutes Dev D sucks you into its drama, shocking you with its brazenness, and more specifically with Kashyap's audacious re-imagination of the plot and its characters.Take that scene in which Paro (played by newcomer Mahie Gill) sends for Dev to join her in a dense field so they can get down to doing what they've been unsuccessfully trying to do for some days. Watch the manner in which she virtually attacks a reluctant Dev into submission; and then the following scene in which she heads back home, mattress folded and tied on her cycle, after Dev spurns her overtures. Watch also the fantastic song Yeh meri zindagi hai and the inventive manner in which Kashyap uses it to introduce Lenny (played by newcomer Kalki Koechlin), the character who goes on to become Chanda. But from the moment Dev's descent into despair begins, the audience too plunges into what seems like a never-ending roller-coaster ride of loud clanging music, neon lights and head-spinning camera moves. Using music instead of dialogue is a unique and interesting narrative tool, but song-after-song-after-song-after-song your patience wears thin. The film's second half is indulgent and repetitive to the point of being excessive, as it focuses much of its attention on Chanda; and let down by a disappointing performance and stilted dialogue delivery by Koechlin, it never really regains the momentum or the sheer bravura of its early parts. In comparison to Koechlin, Mahie Gill makes a more assured debut as Paro, investing both vulnerability and a cocksure attitude into her character. But it's Abhay Deol who's the real scene-stealer, holding together the film with a fearless performance that is so rare to find. Despite the clever new approach and its stylish telling, the flaw that hurts the film ultimately, is the fact that Devdas is never an engaging enough character and his story lacks soul. Speaking purely for myself, I was bored watching him repeatedly drown himself in drink and drugs. Self destruction is never an attractive quality.It's one of those films that's likely to either dazzle you or drain you. There is no middle option. Watch it, and decide for yourself.",this is very different bollywood movie,not every film is required entertain its audience but every film must engage its viewers now thats tall order when film question centers around most boring uni dimensional character indian literature could have possibly produced alcoholic self destructive romantic devdas add that fact that at least three hindi films have already transported devdas tragic story screen still director anurag kashyaps dev d is fresh original take subject characters but its also long tiresome film that is not fainthearted rooted real contemporary kashyaps film stars abhay deol as dev aimless benjamin braddock like drifter who returns home punjab after graduation abroad but has little terms future plans except getting into sack with his childhood friend paro with whom hes spent many long night talking dirty phone learning that she might have had promiscuous past dev rejects paro her advances driving her marry man she doesnt love landing himself downward spiral booze drugs whores kashyap takes basic structure sarat chandra chatterjees original story but setting it now updates much films narrative makes characters actions motivations more relatable so you get back story chanda character hooker dev hooks up with his desperate despondent phase sex itself becomes invisible but omnipresent motivation that drives many important plot point its first forty odd minutes dev d sucks you into its drama shocking you with its brazenness more specifically with kashyaps audacious re imagination plot its characters take that scene which paro played by newcomer mahie gill sends dev join her dense field so they can get down doing what theyve been unsuccessfully trying do some days watch manner which she virtually attacks reluctant dev into submission then following scene which she heads back home mattress folded tied her cycle after dev spurns her overtures watch also fantastic song yeh meri zindagi hai inventive manner which kashyap uses it introduce lenny played by newcomer kalki koechlin character who goes become chanda but moment devs descent into despair begins audience too plunges into what seems like never ending roller coaster ride loud clanging music neon lights head spinning camera moves using music instead dialogue is unique interesting narrative tool but song after song after song after song your patience wears thin films second half is indulgent repetitive point being excessive as it focuses much its attention chanda let down by disappointing performance stilted dialogue delivery by koechlin it never really regains momentum or sheer bravura its early parts comparison koechlin mahie gill makes more assured debut as paro investing both vulnerability cocksure attitude into her character but its abhay deol whos real scene stealer holding together film with fearless performance that is so rare find despite clever new approach its stylish telling flaw that hurts film ultimately is fact that devdas is never engaging enough character his story lacks soul speaking purely myself i was bored watching him repeatedly drown himself drink drugs self destruction is never attractive quality its one those films thats likely either dazzle you or drain you there is no middle option watch it decide yourself,0.5504201434636217,-0.01023616077963906,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.51}"
