,Autobiographical with inspiration from Dil Chahta Hain & Naa Autograph,"Instead of creating a story out of thin air, sometimes the easiest way out is to take inspiration from your own life incidents. Not doubting Mr. Kammula's capabilities, but I wouldn't be surprised to know if it was an autobiography or at least a semi. In fact it wouldn't be wrong to state that ""Happy Days"" is biography of everyone one of us.Characterisation:: Keeping the long story short, every character you see in ""Happy Days"" will be identifiable with each one of our classmates. Ditto for situations, very true to life. It is very difficult to pin-point one single character or one situation which stand out  because ""Happy Days"" is fully-loaded.Romantic track:: The lead pair get the slice of the pie. And its all about KISS ie. Keeping it Simple Stupid! No mushy-mushy stuff or an ode' to Maine Pyar Kiya (read that as ""over the top"").The songs are soothing and blend in with the story quite well. Screenplay is good and the editor has made good use of the scissors to keep the narrative engrossing. ""Happy Days"" is sound from all technical fronts. Without a doubt  Mr. Kammula, you hold the reigns well.The success of ""Happy Days"" proves that the audience is yelling ""ENOUGH!!"" to the ""old wine in the new bottle"" intoxication techniques'. Treading the path unknown, thinking out of the box, executing with passion and conviction are the new buzzwords which will eventually find its way  into the audience's heart.PS: CBIT never looked ""the enshrined temple"" of knowledge until now.",autobiographical with inspiration dil chahta hain naa autograph,instead creating story out thin air sometimes easiest way out is take inspiration your own life incidents not doubting mr kammulas capabilities but i wouldnt be surprised know if it was autobiography or at least semi fact it wouldnt be wrong state that happy days is biography everyone one us characterisation keeping long story short every character you see happy days will be identifiable with each one our classmates ditto situations very true life it is very difficult pin point one single character or one situation which stand out because happy days is fully loaded romantic track lead pair get slice pie its all about kiss ie keeping it simple stupid no mushy mushy stuff or ode maine pyar kiya read that as over top songs are soothing blend with story quite well screenplay is good editor has made good use scissors keep narrative engrossing happy days is sound all technical fronts without doubt mr kammula you hold reigns well success happy days proves that audience is yelling enough old wine new bottle intoxication techniques treading path unknown thinking out box executing with passion conviction are new buzzwords which will eventually find its way into audiences heart ps cbit never looked enshrined temple knowledge until now,0.5841066509248326,0.1895848091302637,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.42}"

7.0,"Are you sure about the ""happy days"" part???????","Another mega hit of 2007. But this time, it's not about the villains, the power or anything else that normal Nagarjuna and Chiranjeevi movies have. It is instead in simple words: about college in Andhra Pradesh. It is about ragging, friends, and relationships during college. I think it is a wonderful idea in general to create a movie with good actors who portray life in college as a time which brings about so many new experiences, if they may be good or bad. However, I didn't buy the whole idea that they summed up your ""happy days."" I mean I think that a person's ""happy days"" cover a very broad span of memories and experiences throughout a lifetime, but not necessarily in four years of undergraduate college. One really good thing though is that throughout the movie, the characters develop friendship and love for each other that we as an audience learn to care about. And the characters are very different from each other. They're thankfully not a husky gang of macho young men. There's a geek, there's a party animal, there's a studious guy, etc. But what makes it all very fun, is that they're three-dimensional. We see the romance, the partying, the drama, and the education (to a certain extent). So Check out the movie and the songs ""Oh my Friend"" and ""Arey."" A pretty good movie.",are you sure about happy days part,another mega hit 2007 but this time its not about villains power or anything else that normal nagarjuna chiranjeevi movies have it is instead simple words about college andhra pradesh it is about ragging friends relationships during college i think it is wonderful idea general create movie with good actors who portray life college as time which brings about so many new experiences if they may be good or bad however i didnt buy whole idea that they summed up your happy days i mean i think that persons happy days cover very broad span memories experiences throughout lifetime but not necessarily four years undergraduate college one really good thing though is that throughout movie characters develop friendship love each other that we as audience learn care about characters are very different each other theyre thankfully not husky gang macho young men theres geek theres party animal theres studious guy etc but what makes it all very fun is that theyre three dimensional we see romance partying drama education certain extent so check out movie songs oh my friend arey pretty good movie,0.6397193495804607,0.29664442039442035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.34, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,"Nice story, one of the best college movies","Sekhar Kammula has done a wonderful job in portraying college life in Andhra Pradesh. Nice story and cinematography, light-hearted movie with friendship and romance. This was the first Telugu movie that I had seen and I was pretty impressed. All the actors have portrayed their part really well, whether it be Tamanna, Varun Sandesh or the other actors. The music is amazing. If you haven't yet listened to the songs, do so.

9.0,Simply...WOW!!!!! Go and Watch it!!!!,"Really amazing movie from Tollywood's most talented Director First half of the film is neat though some of us might feel that Sekhar Kammula kind of emotional scenes are not there. But in the second half of the film, he added good emotional episodes and made sure that you get connected with the film. The plus points of the film are direction, fresh cast, music, cinematography and editing. On the flip side, the pace of the film slackens at times. Sekhar Kammula who did female oriented films like Anand and Godavari came up with a film of different genre this time. The genre might be changed, but his honesty and film-making abilities are in tact. If he sticks to his sensibilities, Sekhar Kammula can never make a bad film. Go and watch 'Happy Days'",simply wow go watch it,really amazing movie tollywoods most talented director first half film is neat though some us might feel that sekhar kammula kind emotional scenes are not there but second half film he added good emotional episodes made sure that you get connected with film plus points film are direction fresh cast music cinematography editing flip side pace film slackens at times sekhar kammula who did female oriented films like anand godavari came up with film different genre this time genre might be changed but his honesty film making abilities are tact if he sticks his sensibilities sekhar kammula can never make bad film go watch happy days,0.5882716049382716,0.2231481481481482,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.13}"
9.0,Nice Portrayal of Friendships-Confusion-Love,"Story : Story is wafer thin. It is just a compilation of some incidents faced by a group of friends in their college life.Performances : All the actors except Tamannah are new and everyone acted well. More than their performances, the characters suit them as all are young, fresh looking and tender.Story-Screenplay-Direction-Dialogues : There is no significant story to keep you hooked but Screenplay did the magic. Sekhar Kammula's narration is absolutely superb. There are only few dull moments in the entire film. His direction is nearly flawless. But following points are little unconvincing, 1) Kamalini Mukherjee's episode -> This is really the baddest part of the movie.2) Scientific techniques used by Tyson -> Unconvincing. If you take it for fun purpose, it is okay. But some critical incidents in the movie happen due to these Techniques.3) Little far from reality -> It is best to be viewed as fantasy than a realistic one. Because, apart from some ragging incidents, most of the scenes are less likely to happen in real engineering life. But the movie as a whole is a beautiful fantasized version of college life.Music & Background Score : Music is the heart and soul of this film. This is easily one of the best soundtracks I heard in my life. Mickey J Meyer's music is both melodious and foot tapping. Background Score is an extension to the songs. Parts of songs are nicely incorporated into background score for some vital scenes and that is great. In a way, the soundtrack makes this film a wonderful musical experience.Other Departments : Editing, Photography and Art work are superb.Final Piece : Watch this film only for its Refreshing entertainment, excellent dialogues and awesome music. But do not expect your college life to be like this. College days are definitely the happiest days of one's life but the incidents shown in the movie are little fantasized and some cinematic liberties were taken. On a whole, it is a beautiful feel good film.",nice portrayal friendships confusion love,story story is wafer thin it is just compilation some incidents faced by group friends their college life performances all actors except tamannah are new everyone acted well more than their performances characters suit them as all are young fresh looking tender story screenplay direction dialogues there is no significant story keep you hooked but screenplay did magic sekhar kammulas narration is absolutely superb there are only few dull moments entire film his direction is nearly flawless but following points are little unconvincing 1 kamalini mukherjees episode this is really baddest part movie 2 scientific techniques used by tyson unconvincing if you take it fun purpose it is okay but some critical incidents movie happen due these techniques 3 little far reality it is best be viewed as fantasy than realistic one because apart some ragging incidents most scenes are less likely happen real engineering life but movie as whole is beautiful fantasized version college life music background score music is heart soul this film this is easily one best soundtracks i heard my life mickey j meyers music is both melodious foot tapping background score is extension songs parts songs are nicely incorporated into background score some vital scenes that is great way soundtrack makes this film wonderful musical experience other departments editing photography art work are superb final piece watch this film only its refreshing entertainment excellent dialogues awesome music but do not expect your college life be like this college days are definitely happiest days ones life but incidents shown movie are little fantasized some cinematic liberties were taken whole it is beautiful feel good film,0.6218822843822843,0.30342365967365964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.42}"
6.0,Definitely better than most of the crap in tollywood but ahem.....,"The movie shows a small chunk of 8 students' life in an Engineering college. Kudos to the director for selecting a really existing college, which I think is one of the basic reasons for the good openings. After watching the movie, I realized that Marketing for the movie is good and Direction... well ahem...At the outset, the students enter the college as singles and leave the college as couples. (One fellow fails only coz he dint trust his friends.) The director created a fantasy world by revolving around the love that develops between these characters.One of the worst parts of the movie is when Kamalini Mukherjee enters... as a lecturer but looks like a hooker. And the second worst part is when a cricket match takes place between the seniors and the juniors. You should watch it to know how bad it is.There is a lot of incoherence in the story told. Climax is synonymous to the director's last two movies. Heroin and hero going out together (In Anand its a car, in Godavari its a walk and... YES YES U R CORRECT!! its a bike here!! ) The director always seems biased towards the female role. The subtle dominance of heroin is quite obvious in all his movies so far. But in this movie it goes a bit too far when the heroine makes the hero strip off his pant and throw it into the river...just bcoz some junior girl touched it. This wonderful event takes place at the necklace road of Hyd!!! So they two happily get onto the bike (on which the junior girls rides too B-)) and go home with the hero in his boxers and saying that it's cool as he is getting air!!! Most of the folks who liked the movie were impressed by the character 'Tyson'. But the boy speaks as though he is brushing all the time. I couldn't figure out half of what he spoke through out the movie. He loves his senior and that girl did well.The telangana accent-wala Rajesh's character was funny. His pair girl was also okie. But I wonder how these two come to each other's hostel rooms during nights. Rajesh even goes into her room and wakes her from sleep during one scene.There is one supposedly-clever-cum-poor fellow who gets off the studying-track for a girl who cheats on him. Neither his character nor his lover's are fully shown evolving. We are left with the question why the girl selected him from all the available choices in the college.Now comes the lead role. Chandu and Madhu. Tamanna Bhatia as Madhu is really charming, and the director shows his obsession with the ladies' waist and back by showing again and again that part full screen. The boy who played Chandu's role reminds us of Siddharth. But knowingly or unknowingly he imitated him too.The movie is more clichéd than it is well-written and the dialogue is not intelligent either. There are some moments in life, when everyone except you agrees on a point. Majority wins (esp. in a democracy) irrespective of what your point is. So I lose here :(",definitely better than most crap tollywood but ahem,movie shows small chunk 8 students life engineering college kudos director selecting really existing college which i think is one basic reasons good openings after watching movie i realized that marketing movie is good direction well ahem at outset students enter college as singles leave college as couples one fellow fails only coz he dint trust his friends director created fantasy world by revolving around love that develops between these characters one worst parts movie is when kamalini mukherjee enters as lecturer but looks like hooker second worst part is when cricket match takes place between seniors juniors you should watch it know how bad it is there is lot incoherence story told climax is synonymous directors last two movies heroin hero going out together anand its car godavari its walk yes yes u r correct its bike here director always seems biased towards female role subtle dominance heroin is quite obvious all his movies so far but this movie it goes bit too far when heroine makes hero strip off his pant throw it into river just bcoz some junior girl touched it this wonderful event takes place at necklace road hyd so they two happily get onto bike which junior girls rides too b go home with hero his boxers saying that its cool as he is getting air most folks who liked movie were impressed by character tyson but boy speaks as though he is brushing all time i couldnt figure out half what he spoke through out movie he loves his senior that girl did well telangana accent wala rajeshs character was funny his pair girl was also okie but i wonder how these two come each others hostel rooms during nights rajesh even goes into her room wakes her sleep during one scene there is one supposedly clever cum poor fellow who gets off studying track girl who cheats him neither his character nor his lovers are fully shown evolving we are left with question why girl selected him all available choices college now comes lead role chandu madhu tamanna bhatia as madhu is really charming director shows his obsession with ladies waist back by showing again again that part full screen boy who played chandus role reminds us siddharth but knowingly or unknowingly he imitated him too movie is more clich d than it is well written dialogue is not intelligent either there are some moments life when everyone except you agrees point majority wins esp democracy irrespective what your point is so i lose here,0.5801282051282052,0.11965811965811965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,nostalgic & poignant college days!!,"This was only the second Telugu movie i was watching, jus got interested in the ""Shekar Khammulla style of movie-making"" after watching ""Anand"". Well, Happy Days turned out to be one of the most beautiful South Indian movies i have seen.Yea true, its about the colorful and youthful college days but it does stamp an everlasting impression as a classic in our hearts for reasons which are inexpressible. The movies got everything - friendship, romance, family, songs and what not. The best thing about the movie though is that we don't see any stupid twists or inane tales in between, its all about college life and no non-sense whatsoever except for some absurd comical scenes - inventions by Tyson which are used in may scenes - albeit it didn't affect the movie at all.Songs were another awesome factor which pumped up the movie experience, both melodic and rocking songs with some beautiful background scores making scenes enjoyable. If u have been to college, you would certainly feel the magic of happy days, for it would ooze out your college life from your heart, giving u that painful nostalgia.",nostalgic poignant college days,this was only second telugu movie i was watching jus got interested shekar khammulla style movie making after watching anand well happy days turned out be one most beautiful south indian movies i have seen yea true its about colorful youthful college days but it does stamp everlasting impression as classic our hearts reasons which are inexpressible movies got everything friendship romance family songs what not best thing about movie though is that we dont see any stupid twists or inane tales between its all about college life no non sense whatsoever except some absurd comical scenes inventions by tyson which are used may scenes albeit it didnt affect movie at all songs were another awesome factor which pumped up movie experience both melodic rocking songs with some beautiful background scores making scenes enjoyable if u have been college you would certainly feel magic happy days it would ooze out your college life your heart giving u that painful nostalgia,0.7299171842650104,0.20134575569358176,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,Good entertainment,"I am a self admitted cinema buff. I watch two movies a day when I am busy. On other days the figure gets inflated by a factor of two!! Yesterday I watched the the first Telugu Movie of my life. It was a movie called Happy Days and about life at an engineering college. The director is himself a engineering grad and so the movie must have been inspired by his experiences. There was little mention of hostel life in the movie probably because either the director himself was a day scholar or his college had no hostels, which was a let down given the fact many like me believe the real spice of engineering days is the life@hostel. I watched with subtitles, and they were a major disappointment. The intensity of laughter of my linguistically less disabled friends (whom i also call 'Gulti(s)')always drowned my infrequent half hearted laughs. As such the less I talk about the screenplay the better it would be. The movie was good entertainment even tough: 1. The songs seemed to start all of sudden (making me feel the director had already paid for the songs and wanted to insert them somewhere), 2. Some of the plot twists looked pretty impossible to happen. 3. The acting left a lot to be desired. 4. The editing could have been tighter. 5. The cinematography and special effects were amateurish many times.Indian film makers are happy selling escapist movies and the Indian audience is happy gulping the prescribed sweet dose of medicine (fully knowing the dosage won't really help except probably increasing the already high blood sugar levels), one could find enough evidence of the malaise in the film. However I liked the characters who looked real and the sets which (the movie had been shot in a real life college) suited the bill almost perfectly. The movie though dispelled the myth in my mind that all popular south Indian movies have heros thrashing evil looking but helpless villains in different locations, wearing different dresses (though all equally silly looking) and displaying different martial art styles. The movie had a rating of 8.3 on IMDb (and my vote did not make any discernible difference). I will finish my post here as I have to wonder about who would rate a movie on more than 8.",good entertainment,i am self admitted cinema buff i watch two movies day when i am busy other days figure gets inflated by factor two yesterday i watched first telugu movie my life it was movie called happy days about life at engineering college director is himself engineering grad so movie must have been inspired by his experiences there was little mention hostel life movie probably because either director himself was day scholar or his college had no hostels which was let down given fact many like me believe real spice engineering days is life i watched with subtitles they were major disappointment intensity laughter my linguistically less disabled friends whom i also call gulti s always drowned my infrequent half hearted laughs as such less i talk about screenplay better it would be movie was good entertainment even tough 1 songs seemed start all sudden making me feel director had already paid songs wanted insert them somewhere 2 some plot twists looked pretty impossible happen 3 acting left lot be desired 4 editing could have been tighter 5 cinematography special effects were amateurish many times indian film makers are happy selling escapist movies indian audience is happy gulping prescribed sweet dose medicine fully knowing dosage wont really help except probably increasing already high blood sugar levels one could find enough evidence malaise film however i liked characters who looked real sets which movie had been shot real life college suited bill almost perfectly movie though dispelled myth my mind that all popular south indian movies have heros thrashing evil looking but helpless villains different locations wearing different dresses though all equally silly looking displaying different martial art styles movie had rating 8 3 imdb my vote did not make any discernible difference i will finish my post here as i have wonder about who would rate movie more than 8,0.5210213940648725,0.11969634230503798,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
