1.0,"The god-awful, the bad, and the ugly","So this movie has been on my radar for quite a while. I was smooth talked by Justin Mark's assurance that his treatment of the movie was respectful and to be prepared for a new era of gaming films. I was pumped and on board, and then... I saw the film. THE GOD-AWFUL The script from this movie was a joke. When Bison utters something about milk and expiry dates, I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, but it was laughter. This movie makes no sense to me at all. The pitch was it was a Chun Li story about looking beyond revenge. In the end, she gets her revenge and the moral is? Revenge is the answer. THE BAD The costumes in this movie can also suck it. I felt terrible for Kristin in the night club scene, wearing a ridiculous dress and using her feminine wiles ( primo top dollar dancing to the unaware) to lure Cantana, a lesbian associate of Bison, into a bathroom. The pacing of this movie was dreadful, and we are hand-held for every scene, if Chun Li is walking on the screen she will undoubtedly inform us ""I was walking.."" ... REALLY? Really. THE UGLY The truth is this movie insults movie goers, gamers, and people, in general. Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li, even though she had a privileged life, and a loving mother? How is she a victim of circumstance? Am I supposed to feel Vega's threatening persona through five minutes of him getting the crap kicked out of him? Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter? I think this movie was seriously edited so terribly, whatever good there was to salvage was lost on the cutting room floor. Whoever edited this needs to be bird kicked in the throat. It just makes no sense to me how the editor could do his job, watch the movie and allow this to enter the theaters. The best parts of the movie involved subtitles, and a sunset. That is it. So there you go, street fighter 2? Most assuredly, not.",god awful bad ugly,so this movie has been my radar quite while i was smooth talked by justin marks assurance that his treatment movie was respectful be prepared new era gaming films i was pumped board then i saw film god awful script this movie was joke when bison utters something about milk expiry dates i laughed it was nervous laugh but it was laughter this movie makes no sense me at all pitch was it was chun li story about looking beyond revenge end she gets her revenge moral is revenge is answer bad costumes this movie can also suck it i felt terrible kristin night club scene wearing ridiculous dress using her feminine wiles primo top dollar dancing unaware lure cantana lesbian associate bison into bathroom pacing this movie was dreadful we are hand held every scene if chun li is walking screen she will undoubtedly inform us i was walking really really ugly truth is this movie insults movie goers gamers people general am i supposed feel chun li even though she had privileged life loving mother how is she victim circumstance am i supposed feel vegas threatening persona through five minutes him getting crap kicked out him am i supposed believe bison is all evil when he continues nurture his daughter i think this movie was seriously edited so terribly whatever good there was salvage was lost cutting room floor whoever edited this needs be bird kicked throat it just makes no sense me how editor could do his job watch movie allow this enter theaters best parts movie involved subtitles sunset that is it so there you go street fighter 2 most assuredly not,0.6715909090909091,-0.1984036796536796,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"
6.0,What i saw is not the worst movie ever.,"There are people saying that this is the worst movie ever, obviously they have not seen the recent spoof movies and some movies made by Uwe Boll. Street fighter: the legend of Chun-Li is actually entertaining, it has actually some great music to follow the story and from my point, it makes the movie more entertaining. Acting is not that good especially Chris Klein's. The fighting scenes are not that bad, though they do have some confusing and sloppy stunts. It is based on the popular fighting game.The story: Chun-Li's father was kidnapped by some bad guys who are Bison and Barog. Few years later, she sets out a journey to find her father. The cops led by Charlie Nash and Maya. Blah, the story is typical. Fight scenes are slotted in between the action-packed journey. Charlie Nash(Chris Klein) makes the acting unintentionally funny. Even the way he walks. One word I can describe his acting: Lame. It seems that he is bored plus he is over-acting. I got to admit that some of his looks are priceless. He makes the story less serious. But whatever it is, I was entertained.Overall: It is not that bad as what other people commented on it. If you want an enjoyable movie, leave your brain at home. Don't take this movie seriously. If you do that, you will be groaning all the way plus it may seem to you that you are sitting on the sofa for more than 2 hours. This is the first video-game adaptation for the year. Be prepared for more are coming.",what i saw is not worst movie ever,there are people saying that this is worst movie ever obviously they have not seen recent spoof movies some movies made by uwe boll street fighter legend chun li is actually entertaining it has actually some great music follow story my point it makes movie more entertaining acting is not that good especially chris kleins fighting scenes are not that bad though they do have some confusing sloppy stunts it is based popular fighting game story chun lis father was kidnapped by some bad guys who are bison barog few years later she sets out journey find her father cops led by charlie nash maya blah story is typical fight scenes are slotted between action packed journey charlie nash chris klein makes acting unintentionally funny even way he walks one word i can describe his acting lame it seems that he is bored plus he is over acting i got admit that some his looks are priceless he makes story less serious but whatever it is i was entertained overall it is not that bad as what other people commented it if you want enjoyable movie leave your brain at home dont take this movie seriously if you do that you will be groaning all way plus it may seem you that you are sitting sofa more than 2 hours this is first video game adaptation year be prepared more are coming,0.49532520325203255,0.003861788617886206,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.53, 'Fear': 0.15}"
3.0,Ridden of it's goodness,"If you think my heading is cheesy and stupid you're absolutely right and I heartily agree...unfortunately that vary statement is the crux of the latest Street Fighter attempt's plot.Ignoring the 1994 Van Damme version of the franchise this film starts anew, focusing on the character of Chun Li, a young Asian woman highly skilled in both piano and martial arts. Her dad gets taken away from her at a young age by M. Bison who uses him in his criminal plot to overthrow Bangkok. Unfortunately for Bison Chun Li grows up, meets a mystic who teaches her some freaky stuff and sets out to kick his ass. While the Van Damme version was far from spectacular it had a sense of humor about itself and wasn't afraid to have fun with the material, which was at the very least entertaining for a lazy hour and a half. The Legend of Chun Li tries to be a dark brooding action thriller with something like Batman Begins as its model...but the material just doesn't support it. The plot goes back and forth between clich√©s and just plan dumb hokey sci-fi stuff. Yes, being ""rid of your goodness"" is actually a plot point. The script is loaded with cheesy dialog and flat characters which doesn't make the actors' jobs any easier and they really don't live up to the challenge. Chris Klein is particularly bad in his attempt to be the bad ass.You would think the action would at least make it worth the time but even that is nothing to brag about. The fights are far too staged and obviously fake. They throw in some signature moves from the video games that are beyond reality. If they'd been shot differently they would've been cool, but here they just look ridiculous. These are things that would fit at home in a more cartoony film like its predecessor...but sorry, no go.",ridden its goodness,if you think my heading is cheesy stupid youre absolutely right i heartily agree unfortunately that vary statement is crux latest street fighter attempts plot ignoring 1994 van damme version franchise this film starts anew focusing character chun li young asian woman highly skilled both piano martial arts her dad gets taken away her at young age by m bison who uses him his criminal plot overthrow bangkok unfortunately bison chun li grows up meets mystic who teaches her some freaky stuff sets out kick his ass while van damme version was far spectacular it had sense humor about itself wasnt afraid have fun with material which was at very least entertaining lazy hour half legend chun li tries be dark brooding action thriller with something like batman begins as its model but material just doesnt support it plot goes back forth between clich s just plan dumb hokey sci fi stuff yes being rid your goodness is actually plot point script is loaded with cheesy dialog flat characters which doesnt make actors jobs any easier they really dont live up challenge chris klein is particularly bad his attempt be bad ass you would think action would at least make it worth time but even that is nothing brag about fights are far too staged obviously fake they throw some signature moves video games that are beyond reality if theyd been shot differently they wouldve been cool but here they just look ridiculous these are things that would fit at home more cartoony film like its predecessor but sorry no go,0.560016611295681,-0.0725098157656297,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.38}"
2.0,very disappointing,"When i first saw the trailers of this movie, i thought that it was gonna be great and entertaining. I remember playing the video games of street fighter while growing up and remembering the characters so i got excited for this. But this was a big disappointment. I can honestly say that the script was just plain awful. Since the script was crap i cant blame the actors for there performances. Except for Nash (Chris Klein) he was truly terrible, how the hell is he able to be an actor and who is the idiot that decided to pay him for it. they should of really ran through the script and made sure it all made sense. The first fight scene was actually good so i thought it was going to be a good movie, all though i did not like the intro to the movie since it dragged on. I hate movies where the characters tell their story and when their telling it from their prospective. That was how it started for street fighter. Vega was over too quick and not great, the club scene was all right until Chun-Li did her upside down kick it was way poorly done. And the ending was really weird. While Chun-Li and Gem are talking, Gem mentions Ryu's name..it must be a hint that there will be a sequel. Hopefully if there is one, it will be better than this.The movie was very confusing to watch and I just didn't understand what exactly was the point. I just got cheesed off at a point. They ruined another video game movie...way to go. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, seriously bad",very disappointing,when i first saw trailers this movie i thought that it was gonna be great entertaining i remember playing video games street fighter while growing up remembering characters so i got excited this but this was big disappointment i can honestly say that script was just plain awful since script was crap i cant blame actors there performances except nash chris klein he was truly terrible how hell is he able be actor who is idiot that decided pay him it they should really ran through script made sure it all made sense first fight scene was actually good so i thought it was going be good movie all though i did not like intro movie since it dragged i hate movies where characters tell their story when their telling it their prospective that was how it started street fighter vega was over too quick not great club scene was all right until chun li did her upside down kick it was way poorly done ending was really weird while chun li gem are talking gem mentions ryus name it must be hint that there will be sequel hopefully if there is one it will be better than this movie was very confusing watch i just didnt understand what exactly was point i just got cheesed off at point they ruined another video game movie way go i would not recommend this movie anyone seriously bad,0.6115796210957501,-0.0708320532514081,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.26}"
3.0,Not worth the time,"This movie was terrible to put it simply. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. It seemed that they took a really bad, wannabe Kung-Fu movie added some Street Fighter names and thought that would good enough to pass it off as a Street Fighter movie. Horrible, almost nonexistent plot, bad acting, and terrible fight scenes make this movie not worth the time it takes to watch it. At times it was funny though, but not intentionally. When certain characters try to be serious or they throw out some line they think would be good catch phrase you can't help but laugh at how poor the acting was.",not worth time,this movie was terrible put it simply i wasnt expecting it be great but i wasnt expecting it be as bad as it was it seemed that they took really bad wannabe kung fu movie added some street fighter names thought that would good enough pass it off as street fighter movie horrible almost nonexistent plot bad acting terrible fight scenes make this movie not worth time it takes watch it at times it was funny though but not intentionally when certain characters try be serious or they throw out some line they think would be good catch phrase you cant help but laugh at how poor acting was,0.5472619047619047,-0.15845238095238096,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.29}"
7.0,surprisingly enjoyable,"(This is for all the people who wrote 'worst movie ever' comments.) First of all: You obviously have yet to see really bad movie. (try the fantastic movie, or hell ride, that should give you some perspective.) Second: What were you expecting? Some Oscar-winning masterpiece, based on a game like street fighter? Please! In what reality do you live in? Anyway. Now about the movie. I'm a huge (and often disappointed) fan of martial arts movies. Having of course seen the 1994-van damme-version, my expectations were low. But i actually liked it! The movie is somewhat mediocre, thank the Hollywood goods for that! OK, so some characters (vega, the two detectives) were underdeveloped and didn't quite fit in. The acting didn't have 'batman begins' quality and the fight scenes weren't all fearless-y (jet li), but so what?!! Kristine Kreuk looked great in those fight scenes. The fights were original, acrobatic and fun. Better wire work as in romeo must die! It (almost) never looked fake. But what I liked most was that there were no unnecessary special effects. (remember 1994? OMG)In other words: The film worked for me, because it was not trying too hard. Not too much action, drama and special effects. Its not a great film, but decent. Try not to expect too much and you will not be disappointed. (If you don't agree with me, you should go rent movies like the mummy 3 and have a blast with all the terrible CGI)",surprisingly enjoyable,this is all people who wrote worst movie ever comments first all you obviously have yet see really bad movie try fantastic movie or hell ride that should give you some perspective second what were you expecting some oscar winning masterpiece based game like street fighter please what reality do you live anyway now about movie im huge often disappointed fan martial arts movies having course seen 1994 van damme version my expectations were low but i actually liked it movie is somewhat mediocre thank hollywood goods that ok so some characters vega two detectives were underdeveloped didnt quite fit acting didnt have batman begins quality fight scenes werent all fearless y jet li but so what kristine kreuk looked great those fight scenes fights were original acrobatic fun better wire work as romeo must die it almost never looked fake but what i liked most was that there were no unnecessary special effects remember 1994 omg other words film worked me because it was not trying too hard not too much action drama special effects its not great film but decent try not expect too much you will not be disappointed if you dont agree with me you should go rent movies like mummy 3 have blast with all terrible cgi,0.5736808236808238,0.04663917163917166,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.19}"
7.0,Not absolutely terrible... as some users would say.,"Look, before you go in to this movie, what were some of these reviewers looking for? An Oscar performance? Academy award graphics? Come on now, its a video game made to movie, by Capcom, whose never made a good adaptation of a video game movie.Some of the reviewers comments were legit. For instance, Chun Li was clearly Chinese when she was 10 years old. But when she grew up, she was half Chinese and half Caucasian.A lot of the people here complained about the storyline and the lack of special effects. Too much nick picking...The storyline wasn't too bad, it didn't stay 100% to the video game storyline, but somewhat similar. And to me, was the storyline good enough? yes it was, I wasn't expecting much in the first place so i could only go up from there.There wasn't too much special effects in this movie. Which I enjoyed more actually. The movie would look too unrealistic if fireballs were thrown everywhere.Acting was OK, not great and convincing, but for this type of movie, its good enough.Honestly, this movie isn't as bad as people claim, I've seen much worst movies made by the way-an brothers. And the notion that even the first street fighter movie was better than this one is totally ludicrous. The first one had the worst acting, color, special effects ever, not even close compared to this one.",not absolutely terrible as some users would say,look before you go this movie what were some these reviewers looking oscar performance academy award graphics come now its video game made movie by capcom whose never made good adaptation video game movie some reviewers comments were legit instance chun li was clearly chinese when she was 10 years old but when she grew up she was half chinese half caucasian lot people here complained about storyline lack special effects too much nick picking storyline wasnt too bad it didnt stay 100 video game storyline but somewhat similar me was storyline good enough yes it was i wasnt expecting much first place so i could only go up there there wasnt too much special effects this movie which i enjoyed more actually movie would look too unrealistic if fireballs were thrown everywhere acting was ok not great convincing but this type movie its good enough honestly this movie isnt as bad as people claim ive seen much worst movies made by way brothers notion that even first street fighter movie was better than this one is totally ludicrous first one had worst acting color special effects ever not even close compared this one,0.5020238095238094,0.04220238095238097,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.16}"
1.0,.....,"How can a movie that runs for a hour and a half feel so long? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009) is a horrible, unimaginative, cheesy and just plain stupid movie.

The acting is agonizing along with the script that makes very little sense if any, even the action is dull.The whole movie is just one big pile of rotten cheesy clich√©s sewn together without any idea of what is being made.

7.0,Legend of Chun-Li manages to stay out of the gutter,"I had never heard of Chun Li until I first saw the announcement that Kristin Kreuk would get the lead. What I eventually learned about The Street Fighter, I liked. A female lead in an action role which could compare somewhat to Batman sounded enticing. I guess another comparison that crossed my mind was Lara Croft.Kristin Kreuk won a great part when she got the role of Chun Li. Being a fair-weather fan of Smallville, I had long hoped she would find a fitting character in the movies. Her time has come. I like her ability to show intensity and weakness. Emotion is her best partner in acting.As far as the movie itself goes, I felt somewhat cheated. I was intrigued by the introduction which was narrated nicely by Kristin. Some of the narration that continued was OK, but it soon became an awkward and overbearing distraction. The director obviously did not recognize that crossing the line by over-narration in an action movie could be a definite drawback. He also did not seem to know that, while this is a movie about a fictitious crime/street fighter, you don't have to litter this kind of movie with weak and poorly played characters like Charlie Nash and Detective Maya Sunee. They both seemed to be square pegs being forced into round holes. Chris Klein overplayed his part as though he thought playing an immature detective meant acting like a 12 year old one moment and 17 otherwise. I am sure the 12 and 17 year-olds who played this game were just as disappointed as I was with his portrayal. Meanwhile, Moon Bloodgood seemed to be just as unsure what she was doing with her character. If there is a sequel, these two characters will have to be re-hashed - hopefully by two different actors. And at this point, I have to say, a new director should be considered as well. Andrzej Bartkowiak seemed too loosely connected to the true potential of this movie. Forget about accentuating bumbling law enforcement, focus more on action, mystery and oriental intrigue. Comic relief is good but outright stupidity is unforgivable.I found the fight scenes fun to watch and special effects were enjoyable although minimal. The story was good ; better than the story tellers.Michael Clarke Duncan and Neal McDonough both were great. The deadly threat they both portrayed helped to keep the story together by giving the good guys more evil to fight off than they seemed to be able to handle. And Robin Shou was a great trainer and partner for Kistin Kreuk. If Kristin and Robin come back for a sequel, then the sequel stands a chance of being better than the original, even though, I still give Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li a 7/10",legend chun li manages stay out gutter,i had never heard chun li until i first saw announcement that kristin kreuk would get lead what i eventually learned about street fighter i liked female lead action role which could compare somewhat batman sounded enticing i guess another comparison that crossed my mind was lara croft kristin kreuk won great part when she got role chun li being fair weather fan smallville i had long hoped she would find fitting character movies her time has come i like her ability show intensity weakness emotion is her best partner acting as far as movie itself goes i felt somewhat cheated i was intrigued by introduction which was narrated nicely by kristin some narration that continued was ok but it soon became awkward overbearing distraction director obviously did not recognize that crossing line by over narration action movie could be definite drawback he also did not seem know that while this is movie about fictitious crime street fighter you dont have litter this kind movie with weak poorly played characters like charlie nash detective maya sunee they both seemed be square pegs being forced into round holes chris klein overplayed his part as though he thought playing immature detective meant acting like 12 year old one moment 17 otherwise i am sure 12 17 year olds who played this game were just as disappointed as i was with his portrayal meanwhile moon bloodgood seemed be just as unsure what she was doing with her character if there is sequel these two characters will have be re hashed hopefully by two different actors at this point i have say new director should be considered as well andrzej bartkowiak seemed too loosely connected true potential this movie forget about accentuating bumbling law enforcement focus more action mystery oriental intrigue comic relief is good but outright stupidity is unforgivable i found fight scenes fun watch special effects were enjoyable although minimal story was good better than story tellers michael clarke duncan neal mcdonough both were great deadly threat they both portrayed helped keep story together by giving good guys more evil fight off than they seemed be able handle robin shou was great trainer partner kistin kreuk if kristin robin come back sequel then sequel stands chance being better than original even though i still give street fighter legend chun li 7 10,0.5364923336621451,0.18804874370912103,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
6.0,"Some thrills for fans, but sadly uneven...","Having enjoyed the game as I a kid, I was excited to see Chun Li in a new feature adaptation. The cast showed signs of ""mixing it up,"" with its choices and I was willing for the ride.While the overall origin story is strong (the piano playing a very nice touch for depth) unfortunately many scenes come off as campy. On a scale, the strongest scenes are easily those between Kristin Kreuk and Robin Shou as Chun Li and Gen, and sadly the weakest being Michael Clark Duncan and Chris Klein's characters of Balrog and Nash.That was the central problem for me here, there is an exciting action piece at work but is jumbled with various other plot lines and set pieces that really feel out of place. The feeling of the film comes off as uneven as was also the case with Director Andrzej Bartkowiak's previous works in CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE and DOOM.

Let's talk about the characters....I realize the movie is suppose to be about Chun-Li, but that does not mean exclude every other character in the game. The ONLY characters are Chun-Li, Balrog, Bison, and Vega. None of the characters have the same power or skill that they display in the game. There are also a lot of over played scenes by useless characters such as Chris Klein's Interpol character and the other Asian chick that also has no purpose.

There are hundreds of highly skilled Asian actors that could have been casted in a better fashion. Bison/Balrog (lol confusing) kept reminding me of the Green Mile, the death sentenced good guy with a heart of gold. Now he is some buffed punchbag, mmm.

1.0,-or- How to Make the Worst Movie Ever,"WOW. Where do we begin? It's been ages since I have seen a film of such poor quality, so much so that the many parts of the whole have come together to form a movie so insipid, so completely devoid of merit that only a team of evil geniuses, locked away in an isolated mountain fortress, driven mad by loneliness, despair, and bad TV sitcoms could have ever created such an atrocity.So, the film opens with a a lengthy, completely unnecessary monologue by Chun-Li that is supposed to set the story and give neophytes into the Street Fighter saga some background into her life. Great. This part proceeds with the pacing and depth of a newbie film student's freshman project, and is completely unremarkable. WHat is TRULY terrible, however, is that she NEVER SHUTS UP! Usually a narration is present to help you discern elements of a story that you might otherwise miss, such as a character's thoughts and feelings...but when she goes on and on talking about everything that you the viewer are already seeing on screen, well...someone was definitely trying to pad their script.Oh yeah, the script...let's talk about that for a little bit, shall we? Right from the get-go, you are amazed at the flat, base dialog that would only impress those who had just discovered the joys of reading - the speech is flat, stilted, and poorly acted by all in the cast. M. Bison's entry into the early set was particularly painful to listen to, and Balrog's cheesy entrance into the scene was so god-awful that I was actually pining for the time when he held a video camera as Chun-Li's cameraman back in 94! Oh, and let's talk about one plot point that just angered me off from the get-go: M. Bison's origin. So, supposedly, in order to drive out his ""conscience,"" (which is supposed to make him more powerful? Heh...okay...) he must rip his unborn daughter from her mother's womb in a spooky cave where evil spirits dwell.Huh. Riiiight.Now, it's bad enough that they made up such a stupid plot point to begin with, but can someone please explain something to me: just how is it that M. Bison could have actually even HAD a conscience in the first place if he was willing to go through with killing his wife and ripping out his daughter from her womb? Further, HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL?! ............yeah. It's a lot of this ""I stole these plot ideas from my ten year old son"" crap throughout the whole film.Oh, and if anyone EVER defends Chris Klein as an actor after this film, they lose all credibility...not just as a film critic, but as a human being with ANY opinion whatsoever.

5.0,Round.... One....... FIGHT!,"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li wasn't the worst movie I've seen based on a video game. Uwe Boll is still accredited for creating a bunch of them. Movies based on video games are generally at a disadvantage for not being liked. The strengths in this movie are the fights scenes, and that's about it. The formless projectiles don't really make sense. (Ryu and Ken's Hadouken's?) None the less, the fights were the only reason why I didn't really hate this movie. I also liked the background settings of Bangkok, seeing the characters weave around and chase each other through the market places, the back alleys and the housing was actually memorable.The writers at least tried to make a good story but fell flat on the concept of implementing Vega, M. Bison and Balrog into the story line. The acting was sub par, all the characters were practically mismatched. Michael Clarke Duncan looked like he was about to cry every time he spoke. I mean this is the guy who is known for his cheery/weepy emotional attitude in the Green Mile and Armageddon, and hearing his voice was annoying as a villain. (BTW-I don't recall him ever boxing here). Neal McDonough didn't fit the M. Bison role at all. At least Raul Julia looked like him in the uber crappy predecessor, and Vega was supposed to be Spanish. The Cantana character was somewhat intriguing with her lesbian tendencies, but she didn't have enough screen time that really mattered. Chris Kline was mismatched in that he acted too perverse to be an Interpol agent, maybe if he turned out to be an evil Interpol agent, it would have made the movie interesting; however, he and Moon Bloodgood do nothing but ponder upon M. Bisons would-be conspiracies and hog up too much screen time. When in-fact these two useless characters DON'T DO ANYTHING but theorize! (okay there WAS an exception at the end.) Gen reminded me of a generic character of the cheesy Englished dubbed kung fu movie. Saying things like ""Impress me with your training"" or ""You will know when you are ready to face him"" to Chun Li. It was laughable. Kristin Kreuk, was okay as an actress, she was more effective in her choreography than in words. She looked too much like the girl next door rather than a serious fighter.The story obviously doesn't fit with the story of the game. The title should have been called: The Girl-Next-Door Takes On THE MAN instead of Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.Overall, I can't be serious on recommending this movie. There are much better martial arts films, and even movies based on video games. But it could have been much worse, but its flaws are rather noticeable.",round one fight,street fighter legend chun li wasnt worst movie ive seen based video game uwe boll is still accredited creating bunch them movies based video games are generally at disadvantage not being liked strengths this movie are fights scenes thats about it formless projectiles dont really make sense ryu kens hadoukens none less fights were only reason why i didnt really hate this movie i also liked background settings bangkok seeing characters weave around chase each other through market places back alleys housing was actually memorable writers at least tried make good story but fell flat concept implementing vega m bison balrog into story line acting was sub par all characters were practically mismatched michael clarke duncan looked like he was about cry every time he spoke i mean this is guy who is known his cheery weepy emotional attitude green mile armageddon hearing his voice was annoying as villain btw i dont recall him ever boxing here neal mcdonough didnt fit m bison role at all at least raul julia looked like him uber crappy predecessor vega was supposed be spanish cantana character was somewhat intriguing with her lesbian tendencies but she didnt have enough screen time that really mattered chris kline was mismatched that he acted too perverse be interpol agent maybe if he turned out be evil interpol agent it would have made movie interesting however he moon bloodgood do nothing but ponder upon m bisons would be conspiracies hog up too much screen time when fact these two useless characters dont do anything but theorize okay there was exception at end gen reminded me generic character cheesy englished dubbed kung fu movie saying things like impress me with your training or you will know when you are ready face him chun li it was laughable kristin kreuk was okay as actress she was more effective her choreography than words she looked too much like girl next door rather than serious fighter story obviously doesnt fit with story game title should have been called girl next door takes man instead street fighter legend chun li overall i cant be serious recommending this movie there are much better martial arts films even movies based video games but it could have been much worse but its flaws are rather noticeable,0.47379807692307696,-0.004727564102564108,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Bad Movie. Big Disappointment.,"This movie is very terrible in many ways.First off, the choice of characters is the worst possible ever for a game movie. Chun Li is meant to be Chinese yet you've chosen an actress who has problem speaking the language in the movie (when for example she asks for help which she asked in a terrible accent).Game movies are not really easy to be pulled off along with good reviews, not many are out there. The reason is shown very clear in this movie. The director ALWAYS misses the point of what the movie should be about; I mean fair enough you don't want a movie about Ryu fighting Ken or Bison, and want a Legend of Chun Li, But you could've put a better story in it, or give the movie better actors (I can't believe the acting in this movie). Take Marvel for example, their world interacts a lot of different marvel characters, but when it comes to their own movie/cartoon, they actually make the story relevant to the characters life(e.g just because Bison was the boss, it doesn't mean that Chun Li's life has to be revolved around killing him (which is what Ryu does)).The choice of camera shots used to try and show the story was also done badly. For example when Bison was trying to show the camera that he had a picture of his wife and daughter, which were dear to him; First off, would Bison do this? Secondly, this is very very corny.This movie had made me dislike street fighter. I would highly recommend better actors and directors AND story writers if another street fighter movie comes out.P.S Didn't finish the movie, it was that bad.",bad movie big disappointment,this movie is very terrible many ways first off choice characters is worst possible ever game movie chun li is meant be chinese yet youve chosen actress who has problem speaking language movie when example she asks help which she asked terrible accent game movies are not really easy be pulled off along with good reviews not many are out there reason is shown very clear this movie director always misses point what movie should be about i mean fair enough you dont want movie about ryu fighting ken or bison want legend chun li but you couldve put better story it or give movie better actors i cant believe acting this movie take marvel example their world interacts lot different marvel characters but when it comes their own movie cartoon they actually make story relevant characters life e g just because bison was boss it doesnt mean that chun lis life has be revolved around killing him which is what ryu does choice camera shots used try show story was also done badly example when bison was trying show camera that he had picture his wife daughter which were dear him first off would bison do this secondly this is very very corny this movie had made me dislike street fighter i would highly recommend better actors directors story writers if another street fighter movie comes out p s didnt finish movie it was that bad,0.5500980392156862,-0.06299019607843134,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,what went wrong?,"This movie is obviously going for a ""re-imaging"" of Street Fighter. Take a storyline and make it realistically believable. A number of movies adapted from comic books, cartoons and games have succeeded in that aspect; choosing to disregard the more far fetched and fantastical concepts and replacing them with aspects that are more rooted in contemporary reality.I respect such a decision and who is to dispute it? Previous game adaptations that stuck with its more ""unrealistic"" concepts(Dead or Alive, Street Fighter 1994) never did as well as those that underwent a realistic re-imaging; like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. In fact, it would be a breath of fresh air to have a Street Fighter story firmly grounded in reality and without all the campy goofiness that made its predecessor such an embarrassment.So what went wrong? The story was simple enough to follow. The main character was well developed, as was she good eye candy. The acting was adequate with Neal McDonough giving one fine performance as a screen villain. Intense action and well choreographed fight scenes coupled with all the right camera angles made each battle a treat to watch. if its one thing that director Andrzej Bartkowiak can do, that is stage a fight and work a camera to bring out the best in that fight scene.(and not surprising since he was originally a cinematographer-turned-director). Each kick and punch is shown with such vivid impact, yet wire stunts and what not are played out with restraint so as to not take away from the realism of the show. Whats more, the director is in familiar territory. With crime syndicate/revenge/martial arts movies like Cradle 2 the Grave and Romeo Must Die in his resume, Legend of Chun Li is right up his alley.So what went wrong? Indecision. Either it was indecisiveness or a case of ""too many cooks spoil the soup"".I bet the producers were split 50/50 on whether to make a) Make this movie a complete realistic re-imaging or b) Stick to the far fetched concepts of special powers and ""dark qi"" and evil organizations bent on world conquestIn the end, they took what could have been one of the MOST grounded-in-reality story for any video game adaptation, and threw in some of the most unbelievable, far out elements from the game. THe movie was going strong until 30 minutes into the film when you see a character tossing a ""special power fire-ball"" around. Yes i know the game characters tossed special power balls around like pies among clowns but against such a realistic setting and backdrop, such a concept would be ludicrous. Fine, they changed Bison from a power hungry, ""psycho power"" wielding dictator in charge of his own terrorist nation, into a more realistic underworld crime lord who works through blackmail and subterfuge. Then they had to go and throw in ""ancient dark arts to rid a person of his conscience by transferring it into a baby"". One of the silliest things i've ever heard; it sounds like something out of a bad 70s cartoon.Unable to decide if it was going to be a straight out adaptation or a re-imagine, this movie failed to define its target audience and instead delivered a half baked product that was all over the place but not where movie goers want it to be. Overall, it is an entertaining but slightly clich√©d cop/criminal organisation/martial arts/revenge story. This movie could have been so much more, but alas, it was not to be. Watch this one just for the fight scenes, and the ever attractive Kristin Kreuk.

2.0,You'd Think Capcom Would Make It MORE Accurate,"So one would think that this movie would be more accurate to the video games and Anime movies since Capcom had direct hands in this. Nope! This is even worse than the 1994 film. But unlike that one, this one isn't fun. This one isn'y laughably bad. It's just bad. I'll basically go through it, so spoilers if you actually wanted to be surprised.I went into it expecting crap based on the trailers. But at first, I'm pleasantly surprised! Duncan is Balrog and portrays him very well. Big black boxer, working for Bison, enjoys killing people. Spot on characterization and acting. The opening fight with Chun Li's dad against Balrog and his henchmen was good fun all the way through. I was having a great time! Then M. Bison comes in. Who appears to be the nicest British man in the world. I don't think he's actually British, but that's how he feels. He is not fueled by Psycho Power, he is not the be all end all badass. He's a guy in a suit. Now at first I thought this is how he would start, then later in the movie he would get his Psycho Powers. This never happens.Chun-Li's actress isn't a bad actress. She plays the role very well. But there's a big major problem, she looks nothing like Chun-Li. This is a glaring issue if for no other reason than it being so distracting to a fan of the games. She's barely Asian, more meek than the most powerful woman in the world, and her legs are NOT super duper awesome. Speaking of which, Chun Li never does her kick attack in this movie. Her trademark move is nowhere to be seen. She does something similar to a Spinning Bird Kick and a Kikoken. In fact, the focus of making Chun Li so awesome in this movie is her learning and performing the Kikoken. Nevermind that this move has never been the focus of Chun Li's character ever, it's her lightning fast kicks. But I'm glad there was a fireball in this movie, that was the main down note of the original live action Street Fighter movie. Also she's not a cop. At all.Robin Shou finally pops back up into movies playing Gen. Of course, the character is portrayed completely wrong. He's not an old assassin, he's a middle aged former criminal. He also teaches Chun Li the Kikoken. But since Gen hasn't been such a staple character like say most of the SF2 characters, it isn't as obvious. It's nice to see Robin again, as well.Charlie Nash appears in this as well. The name is pretty much all you get though. He doesn't fight, doesn't Sonic Boom, and doesn't really look like Charlie.Vega is a waste of Vega. He's dressed in all black and has long black hair, making him look like a ninja as opposed to a Spaniard fighter. Sure, he's the ""Spanish Ninja"", but his costume is ridiculous. The mask looks like a really cheap prop, especially even compared to the 1994 film. The actor, as well, is a horrible cast for Vega. Vega is beautiful. The Vega in this movie is a tough guy and sounds more like a black man than Michael Clark Duncan. Plus his appearance is horribly short both times, which is worse the second time around. You expect Chun Li vs. Vega to be the first really big fight and it's actually the shortest.The movie itself has serious pacing issues. Chun Li starts fighting about 15 minutes too late. A large chunk of the first act is based on Chun Li ""living amongst the people of Bangkok"". Something which could have been wrapped up in a few minutes, we would have gotten the point. Instead we're treated to what feels like a half an hour of boring narration and Chun Li walking around streets.Most of the time when Chun Li is kicking ass, it's entertaining. The problem is how little it happens. And how boring the rest of the movie is. Whenever we cut to Nash, we just don't care about that storyline. When Chun Li dances, it's un-needed, as is the borderline lesbian scene. The movie just crawls along trying to make its way to an ending you probably don't care about anymore.When we finally get to the end, Bison starts kicking ass. He is able to punch Gen across a room with little effort, but never does anything you would expect M. Bison to do. He fairs more poorly against Chun Li, while in a very nice suit, but keeps the upper hand until Chun Li performs her epic Kikoken technique, which hurts him way more than it should. And after it's been drilled into our heads that Bison put his soul into his daughter and that's his ONLY weakness, Chun Li kills him by snapping his neck 180 degrees. Thus adding another weakness Bison has, having his neck snapped 180 degrees.So both Balrog and Bison are killed in this movie, before the tournament even occurs.The film ends with Gen meeting Chun Li with an ad for the ""Street Fighter"" tournament, hinting that Bison is behind it even though he was (seemingly?) killed. He mentions that there's a great fighter in Japan they must recruit, ""His name is Ryu...something."" And the film ends.So instead of properly making a Street Fighter movie, the filmmakers behind this opted to make a prequel to what the audience would care about. A poor prequel at that, which nobody will like, so we may never get a real/good Street Fighter movie (with Ryu as the main character). I would avoid this in theaters, or giving it money at all. The only reason to give it money would be so there's hope of a sequel about the tournament.",youd think capcom would make it more accurate,so one would think that this movie would be more accurate video games anime movies since capcom had direct hands this nope this is even worse than 1994 film but unlike that one this one isnt fun this one isny laughably bad its just bad ill basically go through it so spoilers if you actually wanted be surprised i went into it expecting crap based trailers but at first im pleasantly surprised duncan is balrog portrays him very well big black boxer working bison enjoys killing people spot characterization acting opening fight with chun lis dad against balrog his henchmen was good fun all way through i was having great time then m bison comes who appears be nicest british man world i dont think hes actually british but thats how he feels he is not fueled by psycho power he is not be all end all badass hes guy suit now at first i thought this is how he would start then later movie he would get his psycho powers this never happens chun lis actress isnt bad actress she plays role very well but theres big major problem she looks nothing like chun li this is glaring issue if no other reason than it being so distracting fan games shes barely asian more meek than most powerful woman world her legs are not super duper awesome speaking which chun li never does her kick attack this movie her trademark move is nowhere be seen she does something similar spinning bird kick kikoken fact focus making chun li so awesome this movie is her learning performing kikoken nevermind that this move has never been focus chun lis character ever its her lightning fast kicks but im glad there was fireball this movie that was main down note original live action street fighter movie also shes not cop at all robin shou finally pops back up into movies playing gen course character is portrayed completely wrong hes not old assassin hes middle aged former criminal he also teaches chun li kikoken but since gen hasnt been such staple character like say most sf2 characters it isnt as obvious its nice see robin again as well charlie nash appears this as well name is pretty much all you get though he doesnt fight doesnt sonic boom doesnt really look like charlie vega is waste vega hes dressed all black has long black hair making him look like ninja as opposed spaniard fighter sure hes spanish ninja but his costume is ridiculous mask looks like really cheap prop especially even compared 1994 film actor as well is horrible cast vega vega is beautiful vega this movie is tough guy sounds more like black man than michael clark duncan plus his appearance is horribly short both times which is worse second time around you expect chun li vs vega be first really big fight its actually shortest movie itself has serious pacing issues chun li starts fighting about 15 minutes too late large chunk first act is based chun li living amongst people bangkok something which could have been wrapped up few minutes we would have gotten point instead were treated what feels like half hour boring narration chun li walking around streets most time when chun li is kicking ass its entertaining problem is how little it happens how boring rest movie is whenever we cut nash we just dont care about that storyline when chun li dances its un needed as is borderline lesbian scene movie just crawls along trying make its way ending you probably dont care about anymore when we finally get end bison starts kicking ass he is able punch gen across room with little effort but never does anything you would expect m bison do he fairs more poorly against chun li while very nice suit but keeps upper hand until chun li performs her epic kikoken technique which hurts him way more than it should after its been drilled into our heads that bison put his soul into his daughter thats his only weakness chun li kills him by snapping his neck 180 degrees thus adding another weakness bison has having his neck snapped 180 degrees so both balrog bison are killed this movie before tournament even occurs film ends with gen meeting chun li with ad street fighter tournament hinting that bison is behind it even though he was seemingly killed he mentions that theres great fighter japan they must recruit his name is ryu something film ends so instead properly making street fighter movie filmmakers behind this opted make prequel what audience would care about poor prequel at that which nobody will like so we may never get real good street fighter movie with ryu as main character i would avoid this theaters or giving it money at all only reason give it money would be so theres hope sequel about tournament,0.5030328798185942,0.05783813904349617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"

7.0,Not so bad,"This movie obviously angered a bunch of ""Street Fighter The Game"" fans who all gave the movie a knee-jerk rating of 1. I won't speak to any of the SF mythology but as a stand alone movie ""Chun-Li"" is okay.Is it awesome? No. But it's no where near a ""1"" just on production quality alone. The story is basic, but that's not why you watch this kind of movie. The stunts and fighting are pretty good. I like the Kristin Kreuk seemed to do most of her own stunts. If she didn't then that's another kudos to the film makers. The music is good, as are the set and costumes.I also like to see Neal McDonough in pretty much anything he does. Moon Bloodgood was also nice to watch.

,Just as bad the second time around,"The same video store clerk who warned me about the remake of ""The Wicker Man"" (you can read my user comment on it) warned me about ""Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li"" when I brought it up to the counter. So why did I rent it, when you also add the fact that I thought the first ""Street Fighter"" movie was terrible. Well, I had heard that this movie was so bad it was good, and I'm usually in the mood for laughable ineptness.This movie isn't so bad it's good. It's so bad it's BAD. Let me count the ways. The screenplay has a number of holes in it (Why was there no investigation for the kidnapping of Chun-Li's father? Why did Bison let his daughter get out of his grasp?) The screenplay also has a number of clich√©d scenes - you'll be saying, ""I've seen this before!"" a number of times while watching the movie. The biggest sin the movie makes is that it's pretty dull. There's less martial arts action than you may think, and the martial arts scenes that are there are ineptly choreographed - a surprise, since there was some Asian control on this movie.I admit there was one thing I found amusing, and that was that the main villain strongly resembles Neil Patrick Harris. But other than that, I seriously regret renting this movie. Next time I'll listen to that video store clerk.",just as bad second time around,same video store clerk who warned me about remake wicker man you can read my user comment it warned me about street fighter legend chun li when i brought it up counter so why did i rent it when you also add fact that i thought first street fighter movie was terrible well i had heard that this movie was so bad it was good im usually mood laughable ineptness this movie isnt so bad its good its so bad its bad let me count ways screenplay has number holes it why was there no investigation kidnapping chun lis father why did bison let his daughter get out his grasp screenplay also has number clich d scenes youll be saying ive seen this before number times while watching movie biggest sin movie makes is that its pretty dull theres less martial arts action than you may think martial arts scenes that are there are ineptly choreographed surprise since there was some asian control this movie i admit there was one thing i found amusing that was that main villain strongly resembles neil patrick harris but other than that i seriously regret renting this movie next time ill listen that video store clerk,0.48209876543209873,-0.12839506172839502,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Street fighter,"Im giving it a 10 just to try and balance out all of the awful reviews.Costumes are not the same as in the game??? (well that worked for the x-men films, wolverine, yellow spandex anyone,and didn't work in the slightestfor the Van Damme version of street fighter, yeah the costumes were true to the game but in real life they are so very wrong) The costumes in the game are slightly ridiculous so to make any attempt of making this a serious film they had to change that.Bison is wearing a suit, and has a beard (yes cos most druglords wear military outfit despite not actually being in the military, I see why people would care about that???) Some bad wire work, but lets be honest no worse than in a lot of Chinese films and how else were they gonna recreate moves from the game which are ridiculously over the top in the first place. I thought it was a good effort at bringing those into the film. As for the rest of the action their were some pretty damn good strikes and locks as well really impressive flips, rolls and break falling especially when you consider the main character is from smallville, I was really surprised.Im surprised at how seriously people criticised this film as well as overacting, I have seen so much worse and at least someone is making street fighter movies. Oh and Chris Klein was in American Pie, so what, also shocked at how many people said this was trash compared with the Van Damme film, I don't think their is one decent martial arts technique in that film, Van Damme did none of the good stuff you see in his older films,the costumes were camp, most of the cast were rubbish in their roles, nothing about that film was good...",street fighter,im giving it 10 just try balance out all awful reviews costumes are not same as game well that worked x men films wolverine yellow spandex anyone didnt work slightestfor van damme version street fighter yeah costumes were true game but real life they are so very wrong costumes game are slightly ridiculous so make any attempt making this serious film they had change that bison is wearing suit has beard yes cos most druglords wear military outfit despite not actually being military i see why people would care about that some bad wire work but lets be honest no worse than lot chinese films how else were they gonna recreate moves game which are ridiculously over top first place i thought it was good effort at bringing those into film as rest action their were some pretty damn good strikes locks as well really impressive flips rolls break falling especially when you consider main character is smallville i was really surprised im surprised at how seriously people criticised this film as well as overacting i have seen so much worse at least someone is making street fighter movies oh chris klein was american pie so what also shocked at how many people said this was trash compared with van damme film i dont think their is one decent martial arts technique that film van damme did none good stuff you see his older films costumes were camp most cast were rubbish their roles nothing about that film was good,0.5282196969696971,0.035606060606060606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.25}"
6.0,Somewhat misses the mark,"We now have Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li, a story about the First Lady of Fighting Games herself. Yes, Chun Li was featured in the previous movie (played less than adequately by Ming Na), but she was only a supporting character in that flick, and aside from knocking a few heads and spewing some lame dialogue, she didn't have much to do. So it's nice to see her finally in the spotlight, portrayed by an actress who actually bothers to put some effort into her performance: Kristin Kreuk.The previous Street Fighter film pretty much failed to give its characters any good development or reason to show any real emotions, making it rather hard to connect with them. This new film at least tries, and even succeeds in some places; when Chun Li sheds tears in this movie, we know precisely why, and we understand her sorrow. She is endeared far more to us this time around. It would not be spoiling anything to say this movie is much better than its predecessor. But is it really a good movie? Well...Now, obviously director Andrzej Bartkowiak and screenwriter Justin Marks had a daunting task before them. They not only had to please Street Fighter and Chun Li fans around the world, but somehow try to make a good movie in the process. And, of course, you can't tell a story about street fighters without the proper pacing. Pacing, in fact, is where the movie's first failure falls into our laps, as it's tragically rushed in all the wrong places. Events that should be treated delicately and given sufficient screen time to allow us to appreciate their significance are whizzed right by us, drastically reducing their impact. Instead of thoughtful remarks, we're given more passing comments on things that are supposed to tell us more about the characters we're watching. And, aside from Chun Li, Bison and, to a lesser degree, Chun Li's father and Gen, none of the characters receives much by the way of development, thus causing this film to fail in the same general area the previous one did. And Interpol Officer Charile Nash (yes, the same Charlie Nash whom Guile was so eager to avenge in the games) is on the scene as well; he's determined to bring Bison down. If only we learned why. Actor Chris Klein and actress Moon Bloodgood (who plays his partner Maya) aren't given much to do, and what they are given to do isn't very engaging or exciting. Much of their contributions to the story are tossed out as quickly as they're flung in, leaving us very little time to appreciate any of it. And Nash's one-liners, which are, of course, meant to be witty, are not really that witty. Or all that funny.On the whole, the movie doesn't quite work. It has some good ideas and an interesting story, but it really doesn't handle them properly. For every strong moment the film has, there is a weak one to bring things down again, and of course there's an open ending, though if they actually make a sequel to this I'll be amazed. I likely won't be the first in line to see it, though. I probably won't see the movie again, either... well, not in the theater, anyway. I may buy the soundtrack, however; the music wasn't half bad. If you like solid electronic dances tunes, the soundtrack may be worth your while. The movie, on the other hand, won't really entertain general audiences, and I imagine fans of the games will be pretty divided on it.Oh, and they mispronounced Ryu's name. AGAIN.Final score: 6/10. Nice try, but try harder next time, guys.",somewhat misses mark,we now have street fighter legend chun li story about first lady fighting games herself yes chun li was featured previous movie played less than adequately by ming na but she was only supporting character that flick aside knocking few heads spewing some lame dialogue she didnt have much do so its nice see her finally spotlight portrayed by actress who actually bothers put some effort into her performance kristin kreuk previous street fighter film pretty much failed give its characters any good development or reason show any real emotions making it rather hard connect with them this new film at least tries even succeeds some places when chun li sheds tears this movie we know precisely why we understand her sorrow she is endeared far more us this time around it would not be spoiling anything say this movie is much better than its predecessor but is it really good movie well now obviously director andrzej bartkowiak screenwriter justin marks had daunting task before them they not only had please street fighter chun li fans around world but somehow try make good movie process course you cant tell story about street fighters without proper pacing pacing fact is where movies first failure falls into our laps as its tragically rushed all wrong places events that should be treated delicately given sufficient screen time allow us appreciate their significance are whizzed right by us drastically reducing their impact instead thoughtful remarks were given more passing comments things that are supposed tell us more about characters were watching aside chun li bison lesser degree chun lis father gen none characters receives much by way development thus causing this film fail same general area previous one did interpol officer charile nash yes same charlie nash whom guile was so eager avenge games is scene as well hes determined bring bison down if only we learned why actor chris klein actress moon bloodgood who plays his partner maya arent given much do what they are given do isnt very engaging or exciting much their contributions story are tossed out as quickly as theyre flung leaving us very little time appreciate any it nashs one liners which are course meant be witty are not really that witty or all that funny whole movie doesnt quite work it has some good ideas interesting story but it really doesnt handle them properly every strong moment film has there is weak one bring things down again course theres open ending though if they actually make sequel this ill be amazed i likely wont be first line see it though i probably wont see movie again either well not theater anyway i may buy soundtrack however music wasnt half bad if you like solid electronic dances tunes soundtrack may be worth your while movie other hand wont really entertain general audiences i imagine fans games will be pretty divided it oh they mispronounced ryus name again final score 6 10 nice try but try harder next time guys,0.49140205845025137,0.10115120655783308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.32}"
5.0,Sometimes you have to stand up when standing isn't easy.,"Let's go through this again for the benefit of those who are thick- headed. Books, video games, and movies are separate art forms. Comparing them is an exercise in futility.Given that, you can expect that will be a review of the movie. I do not care what relation it has to a video game. I am strictly looking at the story presented, and the actors involved.First, I like that Neal McDonough is the bad guy. he is a very bad guy, to say the least. I didn't like his character in Walking Tall, and am glad to see him get more of the treatment he deserves here.I didn't like Michael Clarke Duncan at his side. He played such a good character in The Green Mile, that it is difficult seeing him playing a baddie. He did a great job nonetheless.Kristin Kreuk is new to me as I never watched the WB. She did a fair job, and kept me interested so much that I hung in there way past my bedtime. I wasn't familiar with Moon Bloodgood either, but she was definitely hot, and worth seeking out in other films. The Surrogate sounds like a good one to watch.",sometimes you have stand up when standing isnt easy,lets go through this again benefit those who are thick headed books video games movies are separate art forms comparing them is exercise futility given that you can expect that will be review movie i do not care what relation it has video game i am strictly looking at story presented actors involved first i like that neal mcdonough is bad guy he is very bad guy say least i didnt like his character walking tall am glad see him get more treatment he deserves here i didnt like michael clarke duncan at his side he played such good character green mile that it is difficult seeing him playing baddie he did great job nonetheless kristin kreuk is new me as i never watched wb she did fair job kept me interested so much that i hung there way past my bedtime i wasnt familiar with moon bloodgood either but she was definitely hot worth seeking out other films surrogate sounds like good one watch,0.5564393939393939,0.10040404040404043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
