9,What a satisfyingly great piece of filmmaking.,"M A S A A N What a satisfyingly great piece of filmmaking. Super amazing performances by Shweta Tripathi​, Sanjay Mishra, Richa Chadda​ and the newcomer Vicky Kaushal. Neeraj Ghaywan seems to be a very sorted-in-mind kind of a person to be able to make such a sublime film. The cinematography is spotlessly inspiring and to be put simply 'PERFECT'.It is difficult to believe that we have such fimmakers making such films in India with such good performances by such good actors!Shweta Tripathi​ is adorably cute and you just to keep looking at her. Vicky Kaushal has the 'boy-next-door' believability and he portrayed his character full of romance initially and angst later with such subtly and smoothness that from the first time you see him, you believe him. He needed some one like Shweta to complement his performance. Actually both of them have complimented each other so perfectly in the film that now I can't imagine any other actors doing their roles.Richa Chadda plays 'Devi' and her character is so interesting to watch from the very first scene. Her's is a character which cannot be described easily. She lives in a small town, belonging to a rather seemingly conservative family where there is only her father played awesome-awesome-awesome Sanjay Mishra who is a priest-scholar. Devi is an educated young woman who is exploring her sexuality when she gets caught. Rest of the film is about the way she deals this matter with her father, everyone else and herself. Their is a guilt of sorts in her mind that she needs to deal with. She loves her father but their is something in their past that bothers her perhaps. Hers is a very pragmatic character who probably feels bogged down by the small town mentality and sensibilities of the small town that she lives in. Don't want to divulge much, you have to watch the film to try to understand her character.Sanjay Mishra ji is simply put awesome. He 'acts' so effortlessly that I can't even call him an actor. Cos he just doesn't seem to be acting. He just becomes the character here. And he a delight to watch. I need to congratulate the casting director of the film for a perfect magical cast. Even actors casted for Deepak's family are perfect and each actor was realistically believable.Cinematography by Avinash Arun is just awesome. I loved the way he has lit the film. There is no extra, unnecessary lighting which gives the film a realistic look. I loved the shots which would be perhaps termed as under-lit in conventional mindsets. Cinematography was just what it was supposed to be. A great tool to visualize the director's thoughts and it did it wonderfully.Editing by Nitin Baid was spot on. There is not a single moment in film where the film lags. Its cut crisply yet there is 'thairaav' where required.Music was like cherries on the cake. Totally sweet! Totally delicious!'Masaan' is a film that should, would inspire Indian filmmakers to do- away with all the extra glam-sham quotients of the typical Bollywood films. Films are all about story telling and this film does it perfectly. It is based in a very small town where there is nothing over-the-top in any manner. Real locations have been used and they look superb. The film is full of metaphors and it makes you think. But maybe there isn't much to think, It can be a bit of an abstract film which also works if it doesn't bore you. This film doesn't bore you! It really engages you!Definitely worth a watch!My rating: 8.5/10",what satisfyingly great piece filmmaking,m s n what satisfyingly great piece filmmaking super amazing performances by shweta tripathi sanjay mishra richa chadda newcomer vicky kaushal neeraj ghaywan seems be very sorted mind kind person be able make such sublime film cinematography is spotlessly inspiring be put simply perfect it is difficult believe that we have such fimmakers making such films india with such good performances by such good actors shweta tripathi is adorably cute you just keep looking at her vicky kaushal has boy next door believability he portrayed his character full romance initially angst later with such subtly smoothness that first time you see him you believe him he needed some one like shweta complement his performance actually both them have complimented each other so perfectly film that now i cant imagine any other actors doing their roles richa chadda plays devi her character is so interesting watch very first scene hers is character which cannot be described easily she lives small town belonging rather seemingly conservative family where there is only her father played awesome awesome awesome sanjay mishra who is priest scholar devi is educated young woman who is exploring her sexuality when she gets caught rest film is about way she deals this matter with her father everyone else herself their is guilt sorts her mind that she needs deal with she loves her father but their is something their past that bothers her perhaps hers is very pragmatic character who probably feels bogged down by small town mentality sensibilities small town that she lives dont want divulge much you have watch film try understand her character sanjay mishra ji is simply put awesome he acts so effortlessly that i cant even call him actor cos he just doesnt seem be acting he just becomes character here he delight watch i need congratulate casting director film perfect magical cast even actors casted deepaks family are perfect each actor was realistically believable cinematography by avinash arun is just awesome i loved way he has lit film there is no extra unnecessary lighting which gives film realistic look i loved shots which would be perhaps termed as under lit conventional mindsets cinematography was just what it was supposed be great tool visualize directors thoughts it did it wonderfully editing by nitin baid was spot there is not single moment film where film lags its cut crisply yet there is thairaav where required music was like cherries cake totally sweet totally delicious masaan is film that should would inspire indian filmmakers do away with all extra glam sham quotients typical bollywood films films are all about story telling this film does it perfectly it is based very small town where there is nothing over top any manner real locations have been used they look superb film is full metaphors it makes you think but maybe there isnt much think it can be bit abstract film which also works if it doesnt bore you this film doesnt bore you it really engages you definitely worth watch my rating 8 5 10,0.5620665842094412,0.3074108431251289,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8,Staggering,"Masaan was felicitated at the Cannes Film Festival with standing ovation from the audiences. True to its hype, Masaan lives up to the reputation and gives you hard-hitting drama with realistic views on life.Masaan, means ""crematorium"", tells two parallel story in the holy city of Varanasi. From the writer Varun Grover( lyricist to some good films like Gangs Of Wasseypur, Ankhon Dekhi, Dumb Laga Ke Haisha) and direction by Neeraj Ghaywan ( 2nd Unit director to Gangs Of Wasseypur and Ugly), Masaan tells you the ugly side of life – The cremation scenes at the ghat of Ganges, the coin-collecting game and police extortion deep- dives into simple life and thinking of Varanasi people, caste system and police pressure. The hitting drama is hair-raising and it will be difficult to gulp down few scenes. Kudos to Neeraj Ghaywan for daring to be different. It takes nerve of steel to tell the not-so- happy ending stories. Art direction is brilliant. Cinematography is astounding with eye-catching scenes of beautiful banks of Varanasi. Dialogues are witty. Background score by Indian Ocean is tuneful. I was expecting the climax to be engaging but was slightly disappointed. Coming to the performances, Masaan has four protagonist and each of them gets into the character. Richa Chadha is brilliant and gives a staggering performance. She is undoubtedly gem of a actor playing various characters ( Nagma Khatoon in Gangs Of Wasseypur, Bholi Punjabin in Fukrey) with ease. Sanjay Mishra just gets better with each role. He is electrifying as usual. Newbie actors Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi shines and are promising.Masaan is gritty and realistic cinema which should be lauded for its sheer effort.

8,A Heartbreaking Chronicle of Harsh Lives. ♦ 76%,"Now we know how long it took for Bollywood to come up with 2015's first best film: 7 months.One should be prepared to give multiple chills to their spine as he/she goes on about watching and completing this compelling drama consisting of two parallel stories talking about life, love, and death. A young careless daughter (Chadda) of an aging professor (Mishra) from the highly conservative city of Varanasi finds herself committing a mistake while bridging the gap between love and lust, after having fallen for one of her coaching class students, which pushes the father-daughter duo into a horrible mess involving a corrupt policeman and his greedy, two-holed belly. The first five minutes of this story is enough to entice a normal person, and if you are a film fanatic, you'll throw away the popcorn for you want to concentrate.The second tale, about adolescent love, is as charming as its two main characters. The most valid setting for an interior village in the holy city is perhaps what best describes one of the protagonists here: an Engineering student (Kaushal) who is the hope of a family whose generation-old work background has everything to do with the celebrated, open crematorium (translating to masaan in Hindi) that happens in the banks of the Ganges river in Varanasi. His transition from a sincere student into a bereaving mass of wreck is triggered when a girl (Tripathi) innocently enters his life. They fall in love, and watching this love unfold is a real treat. Sweet pleasure treat.And if one feels unfinished with these stories, then there is great doses of poignancy to it. It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch the fate of these characters as they embrace dynamic equilibrium in their hopeless lives, just to move forward. The stories as a single entity reek of realism to the fact that such things still happen in this modern world where on one side of the globe people are talking about shifting to Moon or Mars. The whole idea is haunting and let us not go down the anachronism road, not that it is prevalent in the film.Cast performance is brilliant. The way they act out the well-written characters shows how the makers have paid attention to details and have done good homework about the theme. Mishra, as original as ever in his typecast character, rules the frame whenever he appears. The newcomers also add panache (wrong word, I know) to the screen, especially Tripathi. Music and lyrics are supportive, too.BOTTOM LINE: With a fantastic conclusion, Masaan is a heart- wrenching tale of people trapped in a conundrum we all call life.VERDICT: 8 stars out of 10. Highly recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

8,Masaan film review – A Story that touches your soul,"Masaan is a story set in real Benaras which is better known as Kashi. Why did I mention real Benaras? This film makes you meet the other side of Kashi which is more active in the night than the day, the cremation Ghats where the dead bodies are burnt as per Hindu rituals. The cremation Ghats of Kashi has been mostly portrayed in films and serials as a mystic place but here the director, a débutant Neeraj Ghyawan and co-writer Varun Grover portrays the cremation Ghats as a usual business place where the bodies are burnt after dying. But, the film has a hidden treasure beyond the burning of the bodies in the cremation ghats. It's the burning of people griefs and the courage to let go their guilt to celebrate a new life.The urge of arriving in life is portrayed by each central character of the film – Richa Chadha as Devi, Sanjay Mishra as Devi's father and Vicky Kaushal as Deepak. While Devi wants to get out of the narrow mindedness of the city and attain more liberty in the form of experiencing love and pleasure, the other character Deepak wants to break his shackles of being a pyre burning lower caste youth of becoming a civil engineer and dreams of marrying his upper caster girlfriend.Sanjay Mishra runs a small shop at the cremation ghat and is trying to rejuvenate the cold relationship with his daughter and in order to protect her from a scandal; he breaches his own moral principles when he forces a child who works in his shop to take part in the dangerous game of collecting coins from the Ganges. The story brings twist in the each character's lives when they are forced to do a soul searching. Their soul searching brings dark moments in the film when you feel sad about their lives. But wait, there is light after the dawn and no grief is permanent. The films at the end leaves you with a message that Masaan is not only about burning the physical bodies but also about letting go your grief and making your soul guilt free.The film is beautifully written with a strong message and a good débutant director attempt towards the serious sensible storytelling cinema. The music by Indian Ocean gels with the characters lives and the city's backdrop. The lyrics and music of the songs 'Tu Kisi Rail si gujarti hai' based on Dushyant Kumar's poetry and Man Kasturi re' are simply magical and has lifetime music value. All credits to the Director Neeraj Ghyawan who has been trained under Anurag Kashyap and the co-writer Varun Grover for such a beautiful story. Both the seasoned and the débutant actors have worked hard on their characters and that is evident from their acting. I want to end this review for Masaan with these few lines in Hindi..

9,Bollywood - your time is up. Welcome to real Indian cinema...,"Gone are the days when people used to flock to cinemas on hearing about a ""Salman Khan will remove his shirt"" scene. Gone are the days where you have a 100 people pop out of nowhere and join the actors in an impromptu dance. Gone are the days when a shower of petals across the screen would imply that people are making out. Well, at least, they should be gone.2015 is turning out to be a breathtaking year for Hindi Cinema. First we had ""Margarita, with a Straw"", which, simply put, broke all stereotypes. And now we have Masaan, which makes Margarita look small. We have had a few amazingly touching and intense films in regional Indian cinema, with the likes of Ray, Kasaravalli, et al, but this is a whole new territory in Hindi Cinema.Masaan is devastatingly beautiful. Where do I even start? In the small North Indian town of Varanasi, the lives of a few ordinary people intertwine in two tales of love and loss. Right from the opening scene, we are thrown right into the tragic lives of these people, with an intensity hitherto unseen in Indian cinema, almost Scorsese like. It is so intense, that an air of discomfort fills the theater just 5 minutes from the opening. And that of unjust. Unjust, as we are forced to see the catastrophic consequences of corruption, greed, caste-ism, and people's attitudes towards sexuality. This is no pretty film. There are no scenes of comic relief. It gets into your head real quick, and you are all but mute spectators to their spiraling lives. You feel chained to your seats as you're unable to do anything for them. Now that's the power of good cinema.The acting is almost perfect. Richa Chadda, as Devi, the bold woman caught up in sexual crime and corruption, is the star of the show. She pulls off the small town girl next door role with elegance and beauty, which only increases with her fearlessness as the film progresses. All the other actors, though not as good, are extremely believable in their respective casts. The direction is impeccable, with every small shot, be it romance or crime, captured with equal ferocity. But where the film truly stands out is in its cinematography. Avinash Arun Dhaware does in incredible job in capturing the holy city of Benaras in both its highs and lows. He sure is an expert in glorifying tragedy. The shots of the cremation at the ghats, the boat rides at night, and the train on the bridge are so hauntingly beautiful that they would remain etched on to my memory for quite some time.Masaan is a film that exposes you to the kinds of lives people elsewhere live, and gives you an opportunity to evaluate yours. It makes you ponder over issues, though a tad exaggerated, that people in certain parts of our country surely still face. It might also teach you a thing or two on love, loss and moving on. Although I haven't seen a lot of Hindi cinema, this might just about be the best that I have.Unfortunately, most people would still prefer a topless Salman Khan than a gem like this.",bollywood your time is up welcome real indian cinema,gone are days when people used flock cinemas hearing about salman khan will remove his shirt scene gone are days where you have 100 people pop out nowhere join actors impromptu dance gone are days when shower petals across screen would imply that people are making out well at least they should be gone 2015 is turning out be breathtaking year hindi cinema first we had margarita with straw which simply put broke all stereotypes now we have masaan which makes margarita look small we have had few amazingly touching intense films regional indian cinema with likes ray kasaravalli et al but this is whole new territory hindi cinema masaan is devastatingly beautiful where do i even start small north indian town varanasi lives few ordinary people intertwine two tales love loss right opening scene we are thrown right into tragic lives these people with intensity hitherto unseen indian cinema almost scorsese like it is so intense that air discomfort fills theater just 5 minutes opening that unjust unjust as we are forced see catastrophic consequences corruption greed caste ism peoples attitudes towards sexuality this is no pretty film there are no scenes comic relief it gets into your head real quick you are all but mute spectators their spiraling lives you feel chained your seats as youre unable do anything them now thats power good cinema acting is almost perfect richa chadda as devi bold woman caught up sexual crime corruption is star show she pulls off small town girl next door role with elegance beauty which only increases with her fearlessness as film progresses all other actors though not as good are extremely believable their respective casts direction is impeccable with every small shot be it romance or crime captured with equal ferocity but where film truly stands out is its cinematography avinash arun dhaware does incredible job capturing holy city benaras both its highs lows he sure is expert glorifying tragedy shots cremation at ghats boat rides at night train bridge are so hauntingly beautiful that they would remain etched my memory quite some time masaan is film that exposes you kinds lives people elsewhere live gives you opportunity evaluate yours it makes you ponder over issues though tad exaggerated that people certain parts our country surely still face it might also teach you thing or two love loss moving although i havent seen lot hindi cinema this might just about be best that i have unfortunately most people would still prefer topless salman khan than gem like this,0.5713854228560112,0.2253289194465665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8,Astounding achievement!,"FIPRESCI, Un Certain Regard and standing ovation at Cannes, standing ovation in Ahmadabad and now a standing ovation in Bangalore, Neeraj Ghaywan's Masaan is a film that deserves high accolades for its exceptionally well written screenplay and execution. This year has been good for Indian cinema with some of the best films like ""Court"", ""Killa"" and ""Kaaka Mottai"" hitting the screens. Masaan joins this list of elite films. These films do not have big stars, big investments but the honesty in film-making and the content that they carry is something that Indian cinema has not attempted before, even attempted not this subtle. ""More subtle, more the impact"" seems to be the mantra of these films. From larger than life narratives these films bring in the shift to depict stories of ordinary people in mundane situations and their reactions. There is a kind of honesty and faith in the film which one can easily get engaged to. This not only brings the freshness breaking the stereotypical norms also gives out thoughts through the different layers the narrative has. The stories that narrate the connect of human emotions need to be explored more. ""Masaan"" deals with the connects of relationship in a very mature and subtle way. It keeps away from the usual melodrama. It thrives of modernism though tied with traditional values. ""Its a bold film with values rather than bold visuals"".. Each one of the characters has a story with real life turmoils. Some of the scenes are brilliant. Thanks to the film-making brilliance. Such experiments have an overwhelming and everlasting impact on the audience. You realize how cinema can be used as a powerful medium. You train yourself to care about good cinema watching films like ""Masaan""and i think this is something such kind of films do beyond what they are normally expected to. The joy of having watched a satisfactory film is one of the best feelings any film-lover will want to have. It has become a rare phenomenon in Indian cinema. Commercial cinema has really cared about reaching the 100 Crore mark rather than providing satisfactory cinema. On one end we have the high grosser films and the other we have films like ""Masaan"" which mainly get tagged as ""festival"" films and in between films like ""Piku"" which is good cinema with a commercial appeal. I feel its time to get these festival films a commercial space. Its wrong for a good film to be bound only by festivals, it needs support from the theaters and mainly from the audience to thrive commercially. This would definitely help bring in a change of sense of cinema and help Indian Cinema grow.",astounding achievement,fipresci un certain regard standing ovation at cannes standing ovation ahmadabad now standing ovation bangalore neeraj ghaywans masaan is film that deserves high accolades its exceptionally well written screenplay execution this year has been good indian cinema with some best films like court killa kaaka mottai hitting screens masaan joins this list elite films these films do not have big stars big investments but honesty film making content that they carry is something that indian cinema has not attempted before even attempted not this subtle more subtle more impact seems be mantra these films larger than life narratives these films bring shift depict stories ordinary people mundane situations their reactions there is kind honesty faith film which one can easily get engaged this not only brings freshness breaking stereotypical norms also gives out thoughts through different layers narrative has stories that narrate connect human emotions need be explored more masaan deals with connects relationship very mature subtle way it keeps away usual melodrama it thrives modernism though tied with traditional values its bold film with values rather than bold visuals each one characters has story with real life turmoils some scenes are brilliant thanks film making brilliance such experiments have overwhelming everlasting impact audience you realize how cinema can be used as powerful medium you train yourself care about good cinema watching films like masaan i think this is something such kind films do beyond what they are normally expected joy having watched satisfactory film is one best feelings any film lover will want have it has become rare phenomenon indian cinema commercial cinema has really cared about reaching 100 crore mark rather than providing satisfactory cinema one end we have high grosser films other we have films like masaan which mainly get tagged as festival films between films like piku which is good cinema with commercial appeal i feel its time get these festival films commercial space its wrong good film be bound only by festivals it needs support theaters mainly audience thrive commercially this would definitely help bring change sense cinema help indian cinema grow,0.5117219387755101,0.1977253401360544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.43}"

Its a dark, complex, hard hitting movie, which is set across the enchanting Banaras and the majestic Ganges; revolving around the life of simple human beings.'Man kastoori re' by Indian Ocean, can be the sole reason for a music lover to buy a movie ticket. At Cannes, this movie by debut director Neeraj Ghaywan won 2 awards; and it is said that very few Asian movies have received 5 minutes of standing ovation during its screening. The movie has flaws (the absence of that scent of regional tone in the dialogues was the most disappointing part), but the mindblowing performance by Sanjay Mishra & the strong, heavyweight performance from Richa Chadda will make it up.If you support such good cinema, and want more 'daring' film-makers, then don't miss it.",story death desperation bravery masaan will haunt you,masaan means place where dead bodies are cremated if you can stand sight actual dead bodies being burnt right after cute scene excited 21 year old guy whose facebook friend request has been accepted by his crush then yes definitely watch this one its dark complex hard hitting movie which is set across enchanting banaras majestic ganges revolving around life simple human beings man kastoori re by indian ocean can be sole reason music lover buy movie ticket at cannes this movie by debut director neeraj ghaywan won 2 awards it is said that very few asian movies have received 5 minutes standing ovation during its screening movie has flaws absence that scent regional tone dialogues was most disappointing part but mindblowing performance by sanjay mishra strong heavyweight performance richa chadda will make it up if you support such good cinema want more daring film makers then dont miss it,0.4172981366459627,0.05999482401656314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7,Good movie,"It is a well done movie all around. The acting is superb and away from your typical Bollywood singing stuff. The cinematography is also good and the colors realistic.I have to say I am surprise at the whole movie, especially the actors. I think they did a wonderful job and shows that India does have good actors away from the, again, typically singing, drama, funny types. It is hard to explain, it's different from Slumdog and Marigold Hotel. If anything I would say it's because of the directing.It is a shame that the culture and traditions are what they are. It is always an interesting mix when you see modern technology mixed in with the still arcane way of life. It is the same with our people as well.

10,"Thought provoking Cinema, at it's very best!","Masaan means crematorium. This movie is centred around the banks of river ganga where funerals are conducted. The story takes 2 tracks, one is richa chadda's track - an educated smart girl, trapped in a society that doesn't want to match her pace, instead wants to just pull her down by trying to shove sexist prejudices down her throat. The second track is around Vicky Kaushal - a boy whose ancestral tree has been in the funeral work, but he is smart and completing a good education, falls head over heels in love, young, innocent college love and then loses that love in the most shattering way. Both tracks take us through a series of emotions that the main characters experience. First love, desire.. then regret, pain .. then longing for closure.. all around the banks of Ganga where the ultimate closure is done. I might run out of words to describe this film. It has so many layers. It is so very moving and thought inducing. It is just brilliant in all possible departments - acting, writing, film setting, screenplay. Just superb.

9,Emotions of real life couldn't be depicted so beautifully,"Thanks to Bollywood for making such kind of movie. An abstract, artistic and full of emotions which portrays real life of Banaras. Film touches delicate issues of life and depicts how expression of those emotions could be dangerous especially in a small town in India. Story revolves around two youths when their life gets changed by death of someone close. But at the end, they understand the cycle of life and death and just tries to move on their life (which I suppose happened, because there's no proper ending of this movie and it was intentional!)

6,"A Well-Acted, Yet Flawed Film!","Neeraj Ghaywan's 'Masaan' is packed with strong performances, but as a tale, its flawed & not as gut wrenching as it believes to be. This Two-Story based narrative is certainly not without some merit, but it could've been so much more.'Masaan' Synopsis: Four lives intersect along the Ganges: a low caste boy hopelessly in love, a daughter ridden with guilt of a sexual encounter ending in a tragedy, a hapless father with fading morality, and a spirited child yearning for a family, long to escape the moral constructs of a small-town.'Masaan' aces in its first story, which is genuinely tragic. The father-daughter angle is powerfully handled, offering moments so real, they literally hit you like ton of bricks. My problem was with the second story. I couldn't care less for the low-caste boy who falls for a girl, who turns out to be his opposite, in terms of caste.Ghaywan & Varun Grover's Screenplay solidly builds one story, but fails in the another one. I wasn't repulsed by the goings-on, although the Writing aims to disturb you. The Writing needed to be sharper. Ghaywan's Direction is good. Cinematography & Editing are perfectly done.Performance-Wise: Richa Chadda & Sanjay Mishra lead 'Masaan', with heartbreaking performances.

8,Bedrocks Boondocks and Arising from Ashes...,"Banaras doesn't really stand a chance when it comes the nation's top film-makers , does it? From Ray's 'Aparajito' to Mehta's 'Water', this holy cradle of Hinduism has been imbrued with a decidedly unholy miasma. Employing two tracks , one a story of police corruption and victims' cowardice, and another of a young funeral- pyre attendant aspiring to be a civil engineer, Masaan will not inspire you, either, to instantly book a train to this sacred town but holy cow! it does chart a riveting story of loss and hope that mirrors the rebirthing ethos of those stony steps and waters. It neatly slices open its own layers of social milieu to reveal that while the larger whole still seems hopeless, its young rebels calmly persevere to buck the trend. Produced by Manish Mundra and the Phantom Films triumvirate of Bahl, Motwane and Kashyap, 'Masaan' marks the auspicious directorial debut of Neeraj Ghaywan. Most of India will not hear of this film, despite its international accoldes and inherent caliber, but the picture will stand as an emblematic triumph of cinema neatly filtering the modern reality of an ancient epicenter. One of the pic's strongest assets is the airy light that pleasantly suffuses its wide canvas - I appreciated this better on a 60 inch screen than on a laptop. Cinematographer Avinash Arun Dhaware frames Banaras in clean composed frames that dignify its actual shabby sprawl. There's a superb night-time shot of a boat motoring through dark waters while yellow light silhouettes hives of activity along the town's shores - what's more the on-board narrative continues with similar understated beauty. A terrific medium-length static capture stands tall later in the story when a person enters a house and an uproar ensues inside but the shot maintains the visual hygiene of remaining unmoved outside the gate , gazing at the house exterior. And there's a completely soothing canvas of a boat nearing the survivors of this tale, as it traverses a beautifully sepia mirror-like surface of the Ganga. In the first story-track, a young couple caught in the act of secret sex are blackmailed by a malignant police inspector , while the other thread revolves around a youngster from a small-town underprivileged background aiming to make it big and the arc of his dalliance with his sweetheart. The undeclared just-below-the -surface script here narrates how the new gen calmly fights the sclerotic demeaning mores which have robbed the spirit and happiness of their ancestors. Attending to and tidying up funeral pyres his whole life only affords Deepak a meager salary and a depressing hellish job day after day year after year, and his supposedly low-caste birth and position means that he can't carry out the the luxury of courting just about any pretty girl he sees but this does not stop Deepak. On the other track, the traumatized girl Devi Pathak is initially shell-shocked as any girl would be , but steadily we see her true spine (in response to a savage blaming her in public, she retorts ""Whatever we did, we BOTH did it!""). Her father persuades her to accept a measly Rs.5000 per month ($100) job from an employer who was his student ,but when she stares at him in cold anger at the recruitment table, the father says in defence - 'But look how much respect he gives us!' (obviously his daughter has moved on from the peanuts gleaned from such token respect).The film's several producers notwithstanding , I find Anurag Kashyap to be the true moral guardian of this film. Debutante director Neeraj Ghaywan shows an European aesthetic and reserve in depicting his canvas , and a fine temperament is telling a tough story without melodrama. With a producer-director team like this, it is no surprise that 'Masaan', steeped in boondocks bedrocks opaque waters malignant lawkeepers failed fathers ruptured lovers and eternally burning hells , emerges beautifully from the ashes.More analysis @ Upnworld",bedrocks boondocks arising ashes,banaras doesnt really stand chance when it comes nations top film makers does it rays aparajito mehtas water this holy cradle hinduism has been imbrued with decidedly unholy miasma employing two tracks one story police corruption victims cowardice another young funeral pyre attendant aspiring be civil engineer masaan will not inspire you either instantly book train this sacred town but holy cow it does chart riveting story loss hope that mirrors rebirthing ethos those stony steps waters it neatly slices open its own layers social milieu reveal that while larger whole still seems hopeless its young rebels calmly persevere buck trend produced by manish mundra phantom films triumvirate bahl motwane kashyap masaan marks auspicious directorial debut neeraj ghaywan most india will not hear this film despite its international accoldes inherent caliber but picture will stand as emblematic triumph cinema neatly filtering modern reality ancient epicenter one pics strongest assets is airy light that pleasantly suffuses its wide canvas i appreciated this better 60 inch screen than laptop cinematographer avinash arun dhaware frames banaras clean composed frames that dignify its actual shabby sprawl theres superb night time shot boat motoring through dark waters while yellow light silhouettes hives activity along towns shores whats more board narrative continues with similar understated beauty terrific medium length static capture stands tall later story when person enters house uproar ensues inside but shot maintains visual hygiene remaining unmoved outside gate gazing at house exterior theres completely soothing canvas boat nearing survivors this tale as it traverses beautifully sepia mirror like surface ganga first story track young couple caught act secret sex are blackmailed by malignant police inspector while other thread revolves around youngster small town underprivileged background aiming make it big arc his dalliance with his sweetheart undeclared just below surface script here narrates how new gen calmly fights sclerotic demeaning mores which have robbed spirit happiness their ancestors attending tidying up funeral pyres his whole life only affords deepak meager salary depressing hellish job day after day year after year his supposedly low caste birth position means that he cant carry out luxury courting just about any pretty girl he sees but this does not stop deepak other track traumatized girl devi pathak is initially shell shocked as any girl would be but steadily we see her true spine response savage blaming her public she retorts whatever we did we both did it her father persuades her accept measly rs 5000 per month 100 job employer who was his student but when she stares at him cold anger at recruitment table father says defence but look how much respect he gives us obviously his daughter has moved peanuts gleaned such token respect films several producers notwithstanding i find anurag kashyap be true moral guardian this film debutante director neeraj ghaywan shows european aesthetic reserve depicting his canvas fine temperament is telling tough story without melodrama with producer director team like this it is no surprise that masaan steeped boondocks bedrocks opaque waters malignant lawkeepers failed fathers ruptured lovers eternally burning hells emerges beautifully ashes more analysis upnworld,0.4833947583947582,0.10154245154245153,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8,Interesting,"Richa Chadda stars as Devi, a beautiful young lady who meets a coworker at a motel for a sexual encounter which is rudely interrupted by the local police. It goes downhill rather quickly as Devi's father is forced to pay hush money to the cop in charge of the investigation. Devi helps with money from a couple of low paying jobs. A second story concerns a college student named Deepak who works burning bodies for burial in the Ganges river. He is of the lowest caste in India and falls in love with Shaalu, who is of the upper caste, which makes the relationship forbidden. Tragedy follows and a somewhat predictable ending which any viewer will see coming. Even with this small criticism, I recommend Masaan for its excellent cast and breathtaking cinematography.",interesting,richa chadda stars as devi beautiful young lady who meets coworker at motel sexual encounter which is rudely interrupted by local police it goes downhill rather quickly as devis father is forced pay hush money cop charge investigation devi helps with money couple low paying jobs second story concerns college student named deepak who works burning bodies burial ganges river he is lowest caste india falls love with shaalu who is upper caste which makes relationship forbidden tragedy follows somewhat predictable ending which any viewer will see coming even with this small criticism i recommend masaan its excellent cast breathtaking cinematography,0.4895833333333333,0.23333333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"

6,Realistic approach with full of emotions,"Director Mr. Neeraj Ghayman work is impressive. He never goes overboard from film premise and characters. Even, shot designed by him is perfect. Writer Neeraj Grover, story is hard core realistic, screenplay is fresh and dialogues are brief but support well to reveal the character. He used some good metaphor in screenplay, like in the scene, where girl says about her ring that her uncle had inserted it to her finger in her childhood but now its so tight that without being willing full she is carrying it. Clearly, shows about the girl's character that how she is stuck with her traditional family. There are many shots, which enhances the scene and film without speaking much. Cinematography is very impressive. Even, it is not in full cinemascope format but you never miss the shorten length of frame. All visuals are like a big scale film. Even, difficult to find the guerilla shot scenes. Credit goes to its amazing cinematographer Avinash Arun Dhaware. I was sure that I am going to give this film at least 7 after watching the first half but then makers deliberately drag this movie into a parallel cinema. First half is so innocent and cute. Especially the love scenes are just amazing, full of rawness and innocence. I was so engrossed with them that I was expecting such scenes in second half also but then I have to face the truth. My beautiful dream ride got brutally broken by the slap of realism. I was not happy with that and even irritated a bit. Actually first half and second half are literally on two notes. Performance wise Vicky Kaushal as Deepak is mesmerizing. You have to believe that he is indeed Deepak. He emotes so well in the scene, when he cries. Shweta Tripathi as Shaalu is mind blowing. I just loved her expression in all scenes, especially in love ones. Richa Chadda as Devi, is a fine performer, she is brilliant. Sanjay Mishra as her father is very good. Pankaj Tripathi as railway booking clerk, is very natural. The child, Nikhil Sahni as Jhonta is adorable. Bhagwan Tiwari as Inspector Mishra is so good that you just hate him. Vineet Kumar as Deepak's father is very good. Actually, this film is full of good actors and performances. Credit goes to casting director Mukhesh Chhabra too.

8,Soul-Shatteringly Beautiful,"Masaan is a gem, maybe an unpolished diamond is a better description. Watching Neeraj Ghaywan's debut reminded me of another amazing debut, Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox. Masaan is not as beautifully constructed but one can already feel it's heartbreaking eloquence and like Batra, Ghaywan is an old soul.There are two main stories dovetailing hand in hand in the final act, but the themes running through both stories are so powerfully portrayed that I never felt like I was watching two separate narrative threads. Both stories are downright heartbreaking and offer up facets of life in India I have never seen before. In an amateur's hands, only one possible type of movie will be made, but not here. The tone is even, with no gloss, and no preachiness. The protagonists are characters caught in a social cage. They want to break out but every direction they turn shuts them back in. The sadness is so palpable that it seeps under your skin and will refuse to let you go. These are characters portrayed so remarkably well that they feel like real people in front of you. How everything is done with zilch emotional manipulation is pure masterclass. The themes of breaking out encompasses the movie seamlessly.This is the type of movie you can't believe came out of the Bollywood studio system - no pretense, no glossy sheen, yet full of intensity, heart and it never cheapens the human condition just to squeeze tears out of you. This is one of the Hindi gems of 2015 that flies so under the radar with no mid to heavyweight actors that you wouldn't even bother. However, if you have seen it, you will be utterly grateful for such a unique vision. Right up until the final frame it never betrays its initial tone but yet is able to instill so much hope.

7,Love becomes a Funeral Pyre,"Varanasi (Benares) has held a strange fascination for an unlikely plethora of travelers and denizens, from ash clad Aghori Sadhus and weed smoking hippies to hapless widows and trigger happy photojournalists. For me the defining image of Varanasi is of the never ending pyres on the banks of the Ganga, death in all its naked glory. It is this image that Director Neeraj Ghaywan & writer Varun Grover (Gangs of Wasseypur) take as a central theme of the film to showcase a series of interwoven stories set in this haunting, mythical city. The film explores the lives of the families of a preparer and tender of funeral pyres and a Sanskrit scholar, ubiquitous professions that define Varanasi. A previous attempt by Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta to showcase the lives of the widows of Varanasi in Water (2005) was largely shot in Sri Lanka as its take on misogyny and social ostracism fell foul of the right wing. Incidentally the screenplay of Water was written by Anurag Kashyap who's Gangs of Wasseypur seems to be a finishing school of sorts for India's cinematic talent. Consider this: the writer, director and lead actress of Masaan are a paean to Anurag's unerring instinct forte as a talent scoutThe film's protagonists, newcomer Deepak Chaudhary, as the pyre tender's son & Richa Chaddha as the scholar's daughter provide finely nuanced yet restrained performances that serve as a backdrop for Sanjay Mishra's electrifying performance as the beleaguered father who is a respected scholar coming to terms with a sex scandal that his educated, daughter is embroiled in. This is truly his magnum opus, his portrayal of Vidyadhar Pathak,a man in the last legs of his life and career on having to bravely deal with something that could jeopardize the only thing he has left: his reputation in a city where its the greatest currency. While Deepak has definitely made an impression this film is not a patch on Richa Chaddha's performance in Gangs of Wasseypur. It was never meant to be and that is what makes Richa one of the most watchable actresses of our times.Masaan has a subtle underlying message of human aspirations and how death, near death and loss of dignity cannot curb our desires to fly. When all hope and companionship is lost we are not averse to 'flying solo'. In a cruel irony Vicky (Deepak) is tending to the pyre of an anonymous woman who he discovers to be his beloved. This was one of the finest scenes of Masaan, where Deepak's soundless pain is felt by the audience. Devi (Richa) has to cope simultaneously with the loss of a loved one, the loss of her employment, a blackmailing inspector Mishra (Bhagwan Tiwari) and her own father's humiliation. Young Jhonta (Nikhil Sahni) nearly loses his life diving for coins in the Ganga as part of a betting game that his employer Vidyadhar Pathak sees as a means to accumulate the bounty demanded by the blackmailing inspector. Yet, they all bounce back. It's not an easy process as we see Devi deal with indecent propositions and suitors and Vicky struggling to master his grief to bag a job, his only ticket out of the burning ghats of Varanasi, where his family has slaved for generations at the bottom of the caste pyramid.The Cinematography by Avinash Arun does justice to Varanasi in all its dark splendor but restrain in the use of sepia would have saved the viewer some monochrome fatigue. The misty images of Ganga as seen from a boat during a day provide a perfect contrast to the countless scenes of blazing funeral pyres on the banks.'Love becomes a Funeral Pyre' is the latest biography of The Doors by Mick Wall released in October 2014. The name is borrowed from the lyrics of a popular song by the band titled 'Light my fire' released in 1967 in their self-titled debut album and spent three weeks at top of the Billboard top 100 chart. The theme of the song is 'love cannot wait' something Devi and Vicky epitomize in Masaan.",love becomes funeral pyre,varanasi benares has held strange fascination unlikely plethora travelers denizens ash clad aghori sadhus weed smoking hippies hapless widows trigger happy photojournalists me defining image varanasi is never ending pyres banks ganga death all its naked glory it is this image that director neeraj ghaywan writer varun grover gangs wasseypur take as central theme film showcase series interwoven stories set this haunting mythical city film explores lives families preparer tender funeral pyres sanskrit scholar ubiquitous professions that define varanasi previous attempt by indo canadian filmmaker deepa mehta showcase lives widows varanasi water 2005 was largely shot sri lanka as its take misogyny social ostracism fell foul right wing incidentally screenplay water was written by anurag kashyap whos gangs wasseypur seems be finishing school sorts indias cinematic talent consider this writer director lead actress masaan are paean anurags unerring instinct forte as talent scoutthe films protagonists newcomer deepak chaudhary as pyre tenders son richa chaddha as scholars daughter provide finely nuanced yet restrained performances that serve as backdrop sanjay mishras electrifying performance as beleaguered father who is respected scholar coming terms with sex scandal that his educated daughter is embroiled this is truly his magnum opus his portrayal vidyadhar pathak man last legs his life career having bravely deal with something that could jeopardize only thing he has left his reputation city where its greatest currency while deepak has definitely made impression this film is not patch richa chaddhas performance gangs wasseypur it was never meant be that is what makes richa one most watchable actresses our times masaan has subtle underlying message human aspirations how death near death loss dignity cannot curb our desires fly when all hope companionship is lost we are not averse flying solo cruel irony vicky deepak is tending pyre anonymous woman who he discovers be his beloved this was one finest scenes masaan where deepaks soundless pain is felt by audience devi richa has cope simultaneously with loss loved one loss her employment blackmailing inspector mishra bhagwan tiwari her own fathers humiliation young jhonta nikhil sahni nearly loses his life diving coins ganga as part betting game that his employer vidyadhar pathak sees as means accumulate bounty demanded by blackmailing inspector yet they all bounce back its not easy process as we see devi deal with indecent propositions suitors vicky struggling master his grief bag job his only ticket out burning ghats varanasi where his family has slaved generations at bottom caste pyramid cinematography by avinash arun does justice varanasi all its dark splendor but restrain use sepia would have saved viewer some monochrome fatigue misty images ganga as seen boat during day provide perfect contrast countless scenes blazing funeral pyres banks love becomes funeral pyre is latest biography doors by mick wall released october 2014 name is borrowed lyrics popular song by band titled light my fire released 1967 their self titled debut album spent three weeks at top billboard top 100 chart theme song is love cannot wait something devi vicky epitomize masaan,0.5477743271221531,0.16159420289855073,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.39}"

7,Kashi Varanasi Banaras,"It is a nice simple movie which tugs at your heart. A girl follows her heart and goes with her lover for pre marital romp in a seedy hotel of Varanasi. Police raid and boy suicide. Blackmail of her father by ruthless corrupt cop.On other hand a SC boy of Chandal family falls in love with an upper caste (so called) girl. He is pursuing Civil Engineering degree. The girl dies and he goes in to depression. Chandals does the work of last rites of dead bodies on Manikarnika Ghat of Varanasi. It is said that if you are creamted at Varanasi you go to Heaven and if in Maghar then you go to hell. Kabir mocked this belief and insisted that his last rites to be done at Maghar. Thus Chalndals are at the lowest of the most unjust system of world. This film mocks the inhumanity of caste system. Symbolism of Kashi is too good to be missed.This is a story of triumph of human spirit. How both refuse to bow down to small mentality of a backward small town and society. They don't give up and come out triumphant.Music by Indian Ocean is another high point. They have set to tune a poem of famous poet Dyushyant Kumar (Tu kisi rail si gujarti hai; Main kisi pull se thar tharata hu).Acting of Richa Chadha and Sudhir Mishra is superb. New comers and others are also good.Must watch for the fans of realistic, intelligent movie which has strong story line and touches your heart.But it will be mocked by low IQ, rigid, holier than thou and prudish mentality persons and they should better stay away.",kashi varanasi banaras,it is nice simple movie which tugs at your heart girl follows her heart goes with her lover pre marital romp seedy hotel varanasi police raid boy suicide blackmail her father by ruthless corrupt cop other hand sc boy chandal family falls love with upper caste so called girl he is pursuing civil engineering degree girl dies he goes depression chandals does work last rites dead bodies manikarnika ghat varanasi it is said that if you are creamted at varanasi you go heaven if maghar then you go hell kabir mocked this belief insisted that his last rites be done at maghar thus chalndals are at lowest most unjust system world this film mocks inhumanity caste system symbolism kashi is too good be missed this is story triumph human spirit how both refuse bow down small mentality backward small town society they dont give up come out triumphant music by indian ocean is another high point they have set tune poem famous poet dyushyant kumar tu kisi rail si gujarti hai main kisi pull se thar tharata hu acting richa chadha sudhir mishra is superb new comers others are also good must watch fans realistic intelligent movie which has strong story line touches your heart but it will be mocked by low iq rigid holier than thou prudish mentality persons they should better stay away,0.494603947639662,0.15651695526695525,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7,"A smorgasbord of love, redemption, destruction, hope and transformation set in the backdrops of Varanasi's crematoriums","Neeraj Ghaywan's debut movie Masaan evokes a whole gamut of emotions ranging from fear, redemption, hope, love to transformation. The movie's themes of entropy, destruction and resurrection are signalled by the title, which means crematorium, and the location. Masaan looks for love, meaning, redemption and transformation which it victoriously portrays through its lead characters, characters which swirl in their own eddies but forging ahead with determination.Set in the backdrops of rustic yet idyllic Ganga ghats of Varanasi, the movie showcases two parallel stories.Two journeys are twinned, one beginning in despair and the other in hope. One is of Devi, whose sexual rendezvous with a recently acquired boyfriend goes horribly wrong, putting Devi and her father at the mercy of a corrupt police officer. The other is of the star-crossed romance between Shalu and Deepak, she from an upper caste and he a member of the Dalit Dom community that cremates bodies at the Varanasi ghats. The scenes between Deepak and Shaalu offer innocence and charm and offset the sadness that overtakes Devi and Pathak, neither of whom is equipped to deal with their changed circumstances.Ghaywan's periodic drama also digs and lucidly put forwards the brutal truths of Indian society- sexual repression, the caste divide, financial hardship, limited mobility – through individual philosophical journeys. We are stifled by our growth and age-cultural traditions that have led to relative morality. The whole patriarchal system allows us to take the moral high ground – how a small city girl cannot have sex before marriage, for instance. Though brutal but these traditional truths encapsulate the inherent Indian-ness and allows the viewers to be more attached the displayed theme. Ghaywan's narrative is fluid and rich with confidence and sensitivity and the Indian-ness in his writing and shooting does allow its protagonists savor the characterization. Masaan perfectly captures the journey of two tragedy-struck souls from decay to renewal. It all comes to the beautiful concluding scene, which suggests that sometimes, redemption can begin at a point that is not too far away.",smorgasbord love redemption destruction hope transformation set backdrops varanasis crematoriums,neeraj ghaywans debut movie masaan evokes whole gamut emotions ranging fear redemption hope love transformation movies themes entropy destruction resurrection are signalled by title which means crematorium location masaan looks love meaning redemption transformation which it victoriously portrays through its lead characters characters which swirl their own eddies but forging ahead with determination set backdrops rustic yet idyllic ganga ghats varanasi movie showcases two parallel stories two journeys are twinned one beginning despair other hope one is devi whose sexual rendezvous with recently acquired boyfriend goes horribly wrong putting devi her father at mercy corrupt police officer other is star crossed romance between shalu deepak she upper caste he member dalit dom community that cremates bodies at varanasi ghats scenes between deepak shaalu offer innocence charm offset sadness that overtakes devi pathak neither whom is equipped deal with their changed circumstances ghaywans periodic drama also digs lucidly put forwards brutal truths indian society sexual repression caste divide financial hardship limited mobility through individual philosophical journeys we are stifled by our growth age cultural traditions that have led relative morality whole patriarchal system allows us take moral high ground how small city girl cannot have sex before marriage instance though brutal but these traditional truths encapsulate inherent indian ness allows viewers be more attached displayed theme ghaywans narrative is fluid rich with confidence sensitivity indian ness his writing shooting does allow its protagonists savor characterization masaan perfectly captures journey two tragedy struck souls decay renewal it all comes beautiful concluding scene which suggests that sometimes redemption can begin at point that is not too far away,0.5181673881673882,0.0988961038961039,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
