,a work of art,"The wonderful Iranian film ""Children of Heaven"" and its companion piece, ""The White Balloon"", remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960's (""The Shop on Main Street,"" ""Loves of a Blonde,"" etc.) in that they achieve their artistry by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life. They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of over-plotted special effects-laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet - this is when art is achieved.""Children of Heaven"" has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier ""The White Balloon"" but the original Italian classic, ""The Bicycle Thief."" In this film, young Ali accidentally loses his sister's recently mended shoes; out of this tale of utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes: the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy, its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.The actors, children and adults alike, underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.""Children of Heaven"" brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don't miss ""Children of Heaven""!

10.0,"This Film So Overwhelmed Me With Joy, I Feel Obligated to Share My Emotion With All Who Would Listen!","............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL It's easy to understand why there are over 100 reviews of ""Children of Heaven"". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I'm sure others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all who would listen! After watching ""Children"", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn't like. This film celebrates the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to American films that make an effort along similar lines, regrettably, seem rather empty, almost laughable in comparison. The fierce sibling rivalry so familiar in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review such as this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks. I feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed, more often than not, as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. To make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate. Some have commented that ""Children"" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is just reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.10*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com",this film so overwhelmed me with joy i feel obligated share my emotion with all who would listen,pasto colombia via l ca cali colombia orlando fl its easy understand why there are over 100 reviews children heaven normally that simple fact would have dissuaded me adding review my own but as im sure others have felt this film so overwhelmed me with joy i feel obligated share my feelings with all who would listen after watching children it occurred me that i have perhaps never seen iranian film i didnt like this film celebrates essence innocence youth with unencumbered intensity with such unpretentious panache that any comparison american films that make effort along similar lines regrettably seem rather empty almost laughable comparison fierce sibling rivalry so familiar majority american movies is replaced here by warm caring fraternal relationship based love consideration self sacrifice mutual respect these little muslim children demonstrate most exemplary true christian behavior both word deed i hope that here america this opinion can be stated clearly review such as this one without fear provoking mindless outpouring reactionary negative clicks i feel more than tinge remorse even embarrassment when i think millions iranians who see far too many american films where children are portrayed more often than not as selfish wise cracking foul mouthed bullying disrespectful totally inconsiderate little brats make matters worse this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic or worse even exemplary something that kids today often strive imitate some have commented that children seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging mid air all i can say them is just reflect carefully moment value systems kids movie maybe then you will be able feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience 10 enjoy disfrutela any comments questions or observations english or espa ol are most welcome kissenglishpasto com,0.5351603835978836,0.1756944444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,"Simple, passionate and beautiful","Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour. This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!Reviewed by Ollie",simple passionate beautiful,bacheha ye aseman children heaven it was with some trepidation that i popped this dvd into player it was after all my first venture into iranian cinema so i was little unsure what expect i am used most part enjoy foreign films they open up incredible world cinema that one would otherwise miss after five minutes it was fairly evident that this film was something bit special story is simple while at market shopping ali loses his sisters school shoes after desperately trying vain find them he decides that he his sister will share his sneakers meeting her after school each day recover them her order get school himself that is pretty much synopsis entire movie it doesnt end there however this film is played with such beauty innocence it is true pleasure watch mohammad amir naji plays ali with such incredible depth passion one is completely drawn into his plight start film we see relationship between brother sister played with equal warmth by bahare seddiqi strained as he explains how he lost her shoes sorrow alis face zahras tears at news are truly heartbreaking watch expressions faces children are so genuine it is clear that spending cinematic hour half will be pleasure albeit not easy one we see ali his father looking work as gardeners outset it is clear that alis father is strict but it is also evident he loves his son dearly simple exchange smiles as they find their first job is heart warming totally believable cycling through city it is very striking that there is clear division between rich poor we are watching boy afraid tell his father loss pair shoes riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones into rural areas where houses with swimming pools ornate architecture luxury are rife there is so much western civilisation that we take granted what us are simple daily belongings others is pure decadence aside anything else this film is window into world so many us do not understand simple things bring ali pleasure blowing bubbles swinging swings with his new found friend smiles laughter children is absorbing later film we see ali enter race order win pair brand new sneakers his sister win them he must come third again we see division wealth as ali races through streets thoughts images his sister swirling his head screen while at same time parents other children film race camcorders all time ali running fighting shoes he needs so desperately film is directed perfectly credit this goes majid majidi whose films have won acclaim worldwide there are no special effects no luxurious settings there are times when film feels like documentary direction that works its favour this film would make excellent introduction into world foreign cinema throughout movie expressions emotions displayed by children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could film is not dialogue intensive one could easily watch film understand story even without aid subtitles this film was nominated academy award it not difficult see why ignoring moment subtitles language barriers since they are not overly crucial film this is story true innocence tugs hard at heartstrings sometimes breaking point portrayal children is gentle warm absolutely believable one cannot help but be drawn into this tale as it gently unwinds it is sometimes tough watch emotions played out but ultimately worth every second missing this film particularly if simply put off by fact it is foreign language would sad deprivation senses heart it is not just film it is experience one that is completely passionate totally unforgettable i truly cannot recommend this highly enough it is widely available dvd or vhs rent it borrow it or buy it you will be glad that you did reviewed by ollie,0.5171060866843997,0.1472593838557694,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Wholesome 100% natural cinematic staple -- well-leavened and savory!,"This translates to MUST-SEE! It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.I hope ""Children of Heaven"" will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of the Italian 1978's ""The Tree of the Wooden Clogs"" by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there's 1989's ""Bashu, The Little Stranger"", by writer-director Bahram Beizai. Both are movies to be appreciated.",wholesome 100 natural cinematic staple well leavened savory,this translates must see its credulous incredible storytelling young brother sister tehran adventurous saga around one very important pair sneakers two young actors are amazing they play their guileless na ve sensitivity with such earnestness central character ali 9 year old brother is mir farrokh hashemian who really carried film with his legwork younger sister zahra is bahareh seddiqui who contributed her restrained share screen presence pair is so natural those furrowed faces anxious knitted brows range sad faces two came up with bond between brother sister is so warm joyful spite misfortunes storyline is seemingly simple such story weaving knack writer director majid majidi has he can make chasing along streaming gutter into intense dramatic episode story has texture likened thomas hardy novel poverty setting episode after episode turn events yet such relishingly simple delivery he doesnt have tell it all screen little nuances observations suffice its heartening see young children who are polite respectful their elders responsible caring dealing with their everyday problems not give up such quiet fortitude spite disappointments such tolerance their circumstance yet still able find joy little things we catch smile here there e g when they enjoy impromptu soap bubbles or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens this is absolute gem family value film childrens emotions untapped yet adults are not left out touches grown up connections parents elderly couple next door shop owners all made this world very real camerawork well designed use sound mixed with accompanying music different tonal quality instruments were applied complemented this cinematic experience poetic ending theres serenity about it all i hope children heaven will win this years 71st academy award best foreign film oscar it will receive its due exposure more people will experience this gem along lines poverty shoes i thought italian 1978s tree wooden clogs by writer director ermanno olmi story with substance good acting by iranian young boy theres 1989s bashu little stranger by writer director bahram beizai both are movies be appreciated,0.4441830870279146,0.15360632183908043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,Very Talented Filmmaking!,"Children of Heaven, which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film, it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed, especially by movie-lovers.Majid Majidi's film is about a young boy named Ali who accidentally lost his sister Zahra's shoes. But their family can ill afford to buy new shoes, Ali decides to share his shoes with his sister until he can get new ones for her and so he can avoid punishment.The acting is pretty good, and pretty heartfelt. There is no questioning the chemistry between Amir Farrokh Hashemian as Ali and Bahare Seddiqi as Zahra. Reza Naji who plays as their father is also good as the man who is trying to do all he can to provide food for his family.Overall, Children of Heaven is a simple film but it displays a strong message about the bond of family. There are some talented films from the Middle East and this is one of them. It's a strong film about courage and about doing what's right. My favorite scene is where the father and the son leave their poor slums as they head uptown to the rich neighborhoods. This film shows how American kids are vastly different than kids from these parts of the world.....and not exactly in a good way. This film is a little too simple for me, but there is no denying how powerful this film is.

10.0,ENCHANTING & UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE,"What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to a culture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister's newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis.

9.0,Oh those golden childhood days...,"Majid Majidi's Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a fascinating and deeply moving piece. It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults, and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days, back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul, and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra, two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young golden-hearted creatures. They are smart, intelligent, innocent, respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors, what moral values they have, and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything, it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood, the school where the kids study, and their own home, is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt, the script is the film's main winner, but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles - charming, convincing, heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists, and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience, which must not be missed by anyone.

10.0,A Nutshell Review: Children of Heaven,"Finally I've gotten my hands on a copy of Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven (not illegally of course, but from the library's collection), and have set aside some time to viewing this much talked about masterpiece. And I couldn't agree more that the film is of great quality. I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired, and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it, given that he found some similarities in plot, but I must say, any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.There are so many things I like about Children of Heaven, and basically, the children Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) and Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) who play the siblings, will definitely tug at your heartstrings with their innocence. The story goes that Ali happened to lose his sister's shoes during an errand run, and coming from a poor family, that spells disaster. Not wanting to be punished for it, given that both understand the predicament they're in, and not wanting to trouble their parents with yet another expenditure, they devise an ingenious, somewhat mad hat plan, to share their shoes - Zahra goes to school in Ali's, before running back to exchange them so that Ali could attend his classes. And this leads to many comical moments and accidental scenes that will surely make you go ""awww"", culminating in an exhilarating foot race which will put you on the edge of your seat.But the skill here that Majid Majidi possess, is not to sledgehammer these emotions down your throat. Children of Heaven doesn't need to, but has in itself this magic that comes forth through its simple yet meaningful story, and through the strength of both children's acting. I was pretty amazed that both Amir and Bahare have this very charming and natural charisma in fleshing out their characters, their banter being excellent, and at times, without a need for words. Truly, they are the stars of this film, and their abilities will put some established big name actors to shame too. Majid Majidi has created characters that endear, but yet not out- of-reach fictional, as they are easily identifiable given that hey, these are the kind of sibling love, or blood being thicker than water, that almost everyone would have experience, or heard about.Being my first Majid Majidi movie, I'm definitely piqued to want to watch a whole lot more of his films. The movie has superb production values, and like any other foreign movie, opened my eyes to the cultural and physical landscapes of countries that I've yet to visit. What I liked about it also is its showcase of the family, how both Ali and Zahra show this strength in maturity with their helping around the house, and being sensible, well-liked kids. It justifies the number of awards that it has won in festivals everywhere, and if you haven't watch this, please do.

,Extraordinary Movie-making,"Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven is such an extraordinary work of movie-making that it is in a realm of movies that are able to connect with anyone who remembers (or is amidst) their childhood, regardless of what country they come from. (Note: Films that have a universal appeal aren't necessarily better than films that only appeal to people from one or two countries, but making a film with a universal appeal is no easy task.) A boy named Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his sister Zahra's ((Bahare Seddiqi) running shoes; Zahra threatens to tell their father (Mohammad Amir Naji). Petrified at his father's temper, Ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible. In the meantime, the two work out a tight shoe-switching schedule. The plot is inventive and provides some decent chuckles-good writing and comic timing. Hashemian is likable and relatable though he milks the babyish whimpering to an annoying extent. Naji is able to give us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screen than any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last ten minutes of the film, however, that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwind of emotion, jolting from despair to joy to suspense (though not in that order) and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives us homage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie is somewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's; both movies contain the feeling of extreme desperation, but Ali has a goal in his life while Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is boldly going nowhere. Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity, leaving us wondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphant or pathetic; Majidi does something quite similar (less ambitiously) in a way I would not dream of revealing.",extraordinary movie making,majid majidis children heaven is such extraordinary work movie making that it is realm movies that are able connect with anyone who remembers or is amidst their childhood regardless what country they come note films that have universal appeal arent necessarily better than films that only appeal people one or two countries but making film with universal appeal is no easy task boy named ali amir farrokh hashemian loses his sister zahras bahare seddiqi running shoes zahra threatens tell their father mohammad amir naji petrified at his fathers temper ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible meantime two work out tight shoe switching schedule plot is inventive provides some decent chuckles good writing comic timing hashemian is likable relatable though he milks babyish whimpering annoying extent naji is able give us stronger feeling that we are watching real person screen than any other actors film it is not until last ten minutes film however that we are swept up crazy whirlwind emotion jolting despair joy suspense though not that order last ten minutes can make movie great majidi gives us homage four hundred blows ending majidis movie is somewhat similar that francois truffauts both movies contain feeling extreme desperation but ali has goal his life while antoine doinel jean pierre l aud is boldly going nowhere truffauts film concludes with brilliant ambiguity leaving us wondering whether doinels last five minutes screen were triumphant or pathetic majidi does something quite similar less ambitiously way i would not dream revealing,0.5289103440419228,0.11029277739804058,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,A piece of neo-realism as moving as The Bicycle Thief,"Neo-realism was the school of cinema developed by the Italians just after World War II. From 1945 to approximately 1954, directors like De Sica, Rossellini and Zampa delivered masterpieces like Open City, Paisan, To Live in Peace, Shoe Shine, The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D and Miracle in Milan. But the Italian (not the World) audiences got tired of seeing poverty and everyday problems and demanded something more sophisticated. Federico Fellini added imagination to the down-to-earth themes of Neo-realism and gave the world a new concept of cinema. Neo-realism, it was said, was proper to poor, not to wealthy cinematic industries. It this was son, Iranian Director Majid Majidi accepted the challenge, and has made Children of Heaven, the most moving and perfect piece of neo-realism that has been filmed outside of Italy. The story is much like that of The Bicycle Thieves: it's a pair of shoes that are stolen. But Majidi has provided us with the most wonderful performances from children that the screen has ever seen. A great story, magnificent color and camera work,perfect actors both children and adult, and a firm direction that never misses an opportunity to engage and captivate the audience.

This movie works because we're drawn into the world of Ali, his life and his surrounding. Kudos to Majidi's craftsmanship. Ali's plight, though simple (if not trivial to most of us), becomes his obsession because of his love and respect for his sister and his family. We would do well to be so moved!

9.0,Made me smile from start to finish,"Until a fortnight ago I'd never seen an Iranian film and assumed any film from their would just be religious or political propaganda... perhaps there are films like that but having just watched this film and ""Offside"" it is clear that they also make fantastic character based films that are a delight to watch.On the face of it a film about a poor boy losing his sister's only pair of shoes doesn't sound the basis for a film that is both interesting and a joy to watch but it works. With his mother too ill to work and his father in a low paid job young Ali promises his sister Zahra that he will get her shoes back if she doesn't tell their parents about the loss. When he fails to find them he offers to share his own footwear; an old pair of trainers. This means that as soon as her school is over Zahra must run through the narrow back streets to get the shoes to Ali so he can go to his school, even though he runs he is slightly late each day and is getting in trouble. Director Majid Majidi did a great job getting such natural performances from his two stars, both of whom were young children. It is surprising that the children didn't go on to star in further films as they were both a joy to watch and made the viewer really care for their plight. The film might sound a bit boring and depressing but it isn't, there are a few sad scenes but for the most part it is a film that had me smiling from start to finish, I'll have to look out for more films from Iran.",made me smile start finish,until fortnight ago id never seen iranian film assumed any film their would just be religious or political propaganda perhaps there are films like that but having just watched this film offside it is clear that they also make fantastic character based films that are delight watch face it film about poor boy losing his sisters only pair shoes doesnt sound basis film that is both interesting joy watch but it works with his mother too ill work his father low paid job young ali promises his sister zahra that he will get her shoes back if she doesnt tell their parents about loss when he fails find them he offers share his own footwear old pair trainers this means that as soon as her school is over zahra must run through narrow back streets get shoes ali so he can go his school even though he runs he is slightly late each day is getting trouble director majid majidi did great job getting such natural performances his two stars both whom were young children it is surprising that children didnt go star further films as they were both joy watch made viewer really care their plight film might sound bit boring depressing but it isnt there are few sad scenes but most part it is film that had me smiling start finish ill have look out more films iran,0.4559829059829059,0.06410256410256411,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,Heaven Can Wait.,"When reading up about the Iran New Wave (INW) one of the first titles I found out about was Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven. Intrigued by the details,I was disappointed in being unable to track a good print of the movie down. Checking on what films were about to go from Netflix UK,I was thrilled to find an INW film,that I hoped would be heavenly viewing.The plot:Going to get shopping for his family,Ali puts the new shoes his dad ordered for his sister Zahra on the side for a minute.Coming back with a shopping bag,Ali finds that the shoes have been taken. Thinking of the money issues facing the family,Ali tries to keep things hidden. Secretly talking to Zahra,the siblings make a deal of each taking it in turns to wear Ali's old sneakers between classes. Believing that this is the new path they must walk,Ali is thrilled to learn of a contest that might let him make things up to Zahra.View on the film:Keeping the camera at Ali and Zahra's level,writer/director Majid Majidi & cinematographer Parviz Malekzaade masterfully cut rustic INW Neo-Realism with the dramatic heft of the Sports Drama. Keeping costs as low as possible by shooting on location, Majidi gives the side streets of Tehran an earthy atmosphere brushed with lingering shots breathing in the daily life of the family and small tracking shots getting beneath the busy streets of the town. Stepping into the ""sports movie"" Majidi balances the earthy setting with elegant slow motion that brings out the loud gasps from Ali in his desire to make up for his mistake.Lacing a bond between brother and sister,the screenplay by Majidi gives an extraordinary richness in the daily lives of the family,as Majidi brings to light the smallest moments between the family,from Zahra and Ali writing less than secret notes to each other,to Ali having to run out in the rain to put his torn sneakers in the family shoe area. Joining Ali in putting running shoes on, Majidi wonderfully skips over Sport movie clichés by keeping Ali's contest firmly linked to the family troubles that give the film a touchingly poetic final note. Criss-crossing school runs under the noses of their mum and dad, Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi give magnificent performances as Ali and Zahra,thanks to Seddiqi giving Zahra a taut sharpness, whilst Seddiqi gives Ali a nose to the grindstone determination to find some heavenly footwear.",heaven can wait,when reading up about iran new wave inw one first titles i found out about was majid majidis children heaven intrigued by details i was disappointed being unable track good print movie down checking what films were about go netflix uk i was thrilled find inw film that i hoped would be heavenly viewing plot going get shopping his family ali puts new shoes his dad ordered his sister zahra side minute coming back with shopping bag ali finds that shoes have been taken thinking money issues facing family ali tries keep things hidden secretly talking zahra siblings make deal each taking it turns wear alis old sneakers between classes believing that this is new path they must walk ali is thrilled learn contest that might let him make things up zahra view film keeping camera at ali zahras level writer director majid majidi cinematographer parviz malekzaade masterfully cut rustic inw neo realism with dramatic heft sports drama keeping costs as low as possible by shooting location majidi gives side streets tehran earthy atmosphere brushed with lingering shots breathing daily life family small tracking shots getting beneath busy streets town stepping into sports movie majidi balances earthy setting with elegant slow motion that brings out loud gasps ali his desire make up his mistake lacing bond between brother sister screenplay by majidi gives extraordinary richness daily lives family as majidi brings light smallest moments between family zahra ali writing less than secret notes each other ali having run out rain put his torn sneakers family shoe area joining ali putting running shoes majidi wonderfully skips over sport movie clich s by keeping alis contest firmly linked family troubles that give film touchingly poetic final note criss crossing school runs under noses their mum dad amir farrokh hashemian bahare seddiqi give magnificent performances as ali zahra thanks seddiqi giving zahra taut sharpness whilst seddiqi gives ali nose grindstone determination find some heavenly footwear,0.5252857522594364,0.09790005316321106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"

So, HOW does this merit a 9? Well, actually it came pretty close to a 10 (for that see the follow-up film The Color of Paradise)--it was that good.

9.0,Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films,"Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films. Foreign films are usually thought to appeal to only a sophisticated and cultured audience, but Children of Heaven is best suited for all audiences. Forget that this film is set in a foreign land with an unfamiliar culture. Forget that the script is written in a language that you can't understand. These elements are only a small part of the story that will whisk you away and get you lost in the simplicity of the plot. Children of Heaven follows the story of Ali and Zahra and their conquest to find a lost pair of shoes. In an attempt to hide the lost shoes from their parents, the brother and sister duo decide to share one beat up pair of sneakers. This films gives an inside view of the life of a poor Iranian family and the innocence of young children. Children of Heaven opens your eyes to culture different from your own. A culture very much stereotyped because of its common appearance in American newsstands. Children of Heaven tells a story never broadcasted in the media. It can help to show the similarities and differences between American and Iranian culture. Our similarities are more than your local news lets on. We both share a class system which separates the rich from the poor. We both share the importance of family relationships and religion. We often forget that people all over the world endure our same trials and triumphs. Children of Heaven forces its audience to examine their own lives. As Americans we wonder how children with so little can be content? We wonder what it means to live simply. This film reminds us to be thankful and not value our material possessions. It also reminds us the importance of strong family relationships. Next time you contemplate viewing a foreign film think of all the benefits. Viewing foreign films exposes you to new and different cultures, languages, music and landscapes. It can contradict stereotypes and biases conjured up by news reports. You will become more respectful to those with values and morals that differ from your own. Foreign films encourage you to explore new places and create appreciations for the benefits that your own culture has to offer you. WARNING: Children of Heaven may cause a new outlook on life. You will leave this film a little happier and more appreciative.

,Excellent!,"I got the chance to watch this movie on a DVD for the first time 2 days ago. Children of Heaven is a very good movie. And coming from Iran, I was impressed. The storyline may be simple, and you may think that you may not have anything to cheer about or feel angry about, believe me when I say this movie will make you feel a variety of emotions, from shocked to sad to happiness, to disappointment. I credit all that to the simple, yet extremely powerful story, the excellent direction and the magnificent charisma of the two young leads. They shone and they will draw you into the story. My most favorite scene for this movie is the marathon scene. The fact that Ali had to beg and cried to get a place in the running team was heart wrenching, and when the camera focused on Ali running, we will cheer and cheer him on when he fell back. There was total silence except for his sister's voice of blaming him for losing her shoes and as he ran, he kept seeing his little sister, carrying her schoolbag running and running to rush him his pair of shoes so that he can go to school was sad. And he ran and ran and realized he was going to get first place and I screamed, ""Don't! 3rd place Ali!"" and Ali ran a little slower and counted, ""one, two"" and he was third until one young man passed him and he was fourth and he ran harder and harder without thinking. In the end he won 1st place and got a free trip and his coach was overjoyed. But the tired Ali was silent and he was crying before the cameras. And when he went home, he couldn't say a word and his sister knew there was no shoes and she walked away disappointed and Ali sat by the fountain, with the goldfish in the pond nibbling at his blistered feet and he felt he had let his beloved sister down. That was the ending, but we all knew it will be a happy ending when his father comes home with the new pair of shoes, for both of them. And this was the success of this movie; you felt like you were Ali or Zahra and you will feel deeply for these characters. 10/10.

10.0,Every scene is breath-taking; a masterpiece in cinema,"This movie is amazing. Every character is fully dimensional, which is a rarity and it's a smart trick to keep the audience fully involved throughout. Majidi does this with our young protagonist and his sister, and he does this, amazingly, with those with smaller roles. His technique for making the kids speak volumes (tho they are obviously not ""trained & accomplished"" actors) is the use of their facial expressions, Parviz Malekzaade's attractive cinematography, and the musical score. What captivated me most about the film was that the story was told so well. It's hard to find a good story teller, and it seems that we can trust Majidi with this. The story is of a boy and his sister struggling with diffrent problems, but they become each others saviors. I can't think of ONE person who would dislike this wonderful gem.",every scene is breath taking masterpiece cinema,this movie is amazing every character is fully dimensional which is rarity its smart trick keep audience fully involved throughout majidi does this with our young protagonist his sister he does this amazingly with those with smaller roles his technique making kids speak volumes tho they are obviously not trained accomplished actors is use their facial expressions parviz malekzaades attractive cinematography musical score what captivated me most about film was that story was told so well its hard find good story teller it seems that we can trust majidi with this story is boy his sister struggling with diffrent problems but they become each others saviors i cant think one person who would dislike this wonderful gem,0.5703231292517008,0.3159013605442177,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,The Gem of a Film which put Majid Majidi on the World Cinema map; Brilliance Radiates!,"This film, which put Director Majid Majidi on the World Cinema map, is a piece of gem. The story revolves around a pair of shoes, or rather its absence; never did I imagine that a pair of shoes can sustain my interest for 90 minutes. Writer/Director Majidi tackles issues like poverty, necessity, selflessness, purity of childhood, sibling-love, perseverance and determination with such aesthetic and charm, without being melodramatic.After five minutes into the movie, the kid Ali confesses to her sister Zahra that he lost her shoes and he couldn't find them; the innocence and sadness portrayed in this scene draws you into their lives immediately. The two kids are the heart and soul of the movie, and carry the movie forward with their range of genuine and varied emotions; the director draws out such powerful and sublime performances out of them. Even the supporting performances of Ali's father and the-small-girl-in-school are quite commendable.Losing something you're entrusted to, getting into trouble at home/school, asking your sibling/friend to cover up for you, sharing responsibilities when someone you care is sick, determination to win something with a larger goal in mind - these themes are so universal that a kid or adult from any place could easily relate to. The story might seem too linear and optimistic to some, but it portrays a world of love and selflessness. People, especially kids, with lesser means are often more selfless and helpful than their fellow beings with more riches; they appreciate and understand the value of even the simplest and smallest of things.The incidents, the adventures, and the whole running around due to the missing pair of shoes teaches them a lot of things. All the running around eventually pays off when Ali gets selected into the school race team; we never really realize how we acquire certain talents.Other than the brilliant acting, the artistically shot scenes and the remarkable background score add to the beauty and feel of the movie. The seven-minute kids' race sequence towards the and is quite craftily shot and directed. There are so many scenes which are memorable, and stay etched in your mind for a long time.",gem film which put majid majidi world cinema map brilliance radiates,this film which put director majid majidi world cinema map is piece gem story revolves around pair shoes or rather its absence never did i imagine that pair shoes can sustain my interest 90 minutes writer director majidi tackles issues like poverty necessity selflessness purity childhood sibling love perseverance determination with such aesthetic charm without being melodramatic after five minutes into movie kid ali confesses her sister zahra that he lost her shoes he couldnt find them innocence sadness portrayed this scene draws you into their lives immediately two kids are heart soul movie carry movie forward with their range genuine varied emotions director draws out such powerful sublime performances out them even supporting performances alis father small girl school are quite commendable losing something youre entrusted getting into trouble at home school asking your sibling friend cover up you sharing responsibilities when someone you care is sick determination win something with larger goal mind these themes are so universal that kid or adult any place could easily relate story might seem too linear optimistic some but it portrays world love selflessness people especially kids with lesser means are often more selfless helpful than their fellow beings with more riches they appreciate understand value even simplest smallest things incidents adventures whole running around due missing pair shoes teaches them lot things all running around eventually pays off when ali gets selected into school race team we never really realize how we acquire certain talents other than brilliant acting artistically shot scenes remarkable background score add beauty feel movie seven minute kids race sequence towards is quite craftily shot directed there are so many scenes which are memorable stay etched your mind long time,0.49884559884559887,0.18093434343434345,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
