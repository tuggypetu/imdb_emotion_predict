10.0,One of the most important films of all time,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town. It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman. This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times. The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'. I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again. Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons. Among them, the date that the film was released: 1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's. It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters. But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero. At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character. (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered  mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible. The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength. Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind. To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education. If you have not read it, do so. If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others. It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists. --Shelly",one most important films all time,kill mockingbird is movie based harper lee novel same name about scout jem their father atticus finch who is attorney small southern town it is both coming age story about children as well as hard hitting drama as atticus defends black man who is trial rape white woman this review is not easy one write despite fact that i have seen this film at least 10 times reason it does not come easily is that this is one most personally important films i have ever seen is my personal top five all time im certain there is nothing that can be said about film that has not already been repeated multitude times so i guess best thing do is explain why film is so important me i first saw this film several years ago was so profoundly affected by it that i immediately watched it again course defense man wrongly accused crime is common story line but kill mockingbird stands out as exceptional example several reasons among them date that film was released 1962 cusp civil rights movement america fact that it takes place south 1930s it is also far first film explore experiences children their own personal growth but kill mockingbird stands out because its sheer honesty natural performances by child actors portraying these rich characters but most all this film is special because gregory pecks portrayal atticus finch true hero at risk sounding histrionic my heart aches when i watch him screen because he is such incredible man is so inherently good no matter how many times i have seen this film i smile when i see his interaction with his children i well with tears when i see his incredible strength character no easy feat break through armor this cynical film geek who if given chance would remake at least few dozen films with tragic endings i was sitting my car listening national public radio recently day gregory peck died im not ashamed admit that i sat cried hearing retrospective they offered mainly because man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone but also because peck lived his life with same conviction as his best known role fact that makes atticus finch all more tangible american film institute recently named atticus finch number one hero all time choice i consider both brave insightful age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength atticus finch fights evil as well but with his strong moral fiber his mind kill mockingbird is generally required reading during course ones education if you have not read it do so if you have not seen film do so share it with others it is exceptional film that stands test time will remain important addition film history as long as genre exists shelly,0.5279330572808834,0.1614216701173223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,"Not just film, but film history","The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater. I was probably about ten or eleven at the time. Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to. Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would. I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film. That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material. It shows up on screen in every single frame. Each performance in this film is beyond reproach. Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch. As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom. Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system. When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task. So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film. For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna. Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before. Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen. Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings. It paid off in every way imaginable. None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand. Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted. It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin. Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated. She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing. Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her. To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her. In his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors. He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant. They are the childhood he had never really known. Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous, but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written. Then again, maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is. It will be forever remembered, long after you and I have departed from this world. It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here, simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird.",not just film but film history,first time i saw kill mockingbird was

10.0,Amazing film,"After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10",amazing film,after hearing nothing but critical acclaim this film book it was based i finally got see it i am quite amazed at how well done this film is how timeless theme is i havent read book but im considering it just see if there are any details that were left out story is amazing exceptionally told as far as i know film is as close book as it could possibly be some call it most accurate book film conversion ever plot is very good it takes timeless problem presents it us through innocent eyes naive child pace is very good apart godfather first one one or two other exceptions this is only drama where there was truly not one single moment that i found dull boring or unimportant nothing seemed trivial film perspective that is forced upon us is that young child naive innocent this is brilliant idea as eyes child is without doubt one most impressionable things world film handles this perfectly what really makes film apart brilliant possibly unique perspective is fact that children are likable credible charming you couldnt help but like them believe me normally i really dislike children i find them annoying loud egotistical but with this film i couldnt one second muster up any tiny amount aggression or even annoyance they come off as so likable charming most importantly real almost every kid any hollywood movie is either completely ridiculous stereotype clich brat who does nothing but destroy things around him or exact opposite little angel everyone knows that no child is latter all time even i will admit that there probably doesnt exist too many children who are first either this film children are completely real they are naive innocent they disobey what their father tells them but ultimately they obviously love respect their father they never do anything anything at all with intent hurt or harm someone or something that is what child is innocent they do what they do because they do not know better this film provides perfect view into their world or rather their perspective it acting is excellent child actors exceed all expectations i was amazed at how professional convincing they were other actors all give great performances as well cinematography is excellent once again it gives perfect perspective what your surroundings look like when youre child characters are well written credible well casted dialog was well written script was excellent very memorable beautiful film should be viewed by almost anyone i recommend this anyone who likes dramas just about anyone who one reason or another might enjoy this dont be scared off by it being over forty years old or it being black white its excellent film just about anyone would enjoy it dont miss this perfect film 10 10,0.6436874236874238,0.2975778388278387,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.2}"
9.0,Wonderful Social Classic That Echoes Issues of Its Day...,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, ""6 and a half feet big"" legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused ""negro"" on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10",wonderful social classic that echoes issues its day,kill mockingbird is presented like play three acts it is also childrens perspective through kids we find that racism is learned attitude or feeling we also see delightful coming age drama as young kids realize that there is no boogeyman down street their father is capable doing lot more than they think great gregory peck plays atticus finch pillar nobility social conscience rare 1930s americana single parent peck is such strong presence you believe everything about him it is something you can compare americas trust tv anchorman walter cronkite we always took his word it act one puts atticus background allows kids flourish director robert mulligan was able get such realistic performances non professional kids they are amusing fun watch big mystery lies house down street this small georgia town who is monstrous 6 half feet big legend living end house some light suspense ensues while buildup stirring act two is happening atticus must defend african american man alleged rape white woman after threats galore unshaken peck takes courtroom jungle without doubt one top 5 court scenes motion picture history brock peters lends film its best moments as accused negro trial this man has face chiseled with suffering deep deep sorrow we know atticus is good man decent human being with soul he sees this his client as well closing argument that must have roused civil rights movement implores jury vote justice all male all white jury 1930s were tough listeners peters breakdown stand is one most realistic emotionally saddening moments youll ever see especially hollywood films 1960s scene when peck leaves courtroom is now legendary as well act three produces tragic death unlikely hero bringing together family filmmakers have such passion material they seem handle it with gentleness racism is hard boiled subject it is depicted dealt with through grace patience kill mockingbird poses injustice race relations 1930s as front events happening 1960s film came out during turbulent times was also adaption literary classic i am one judge film solely by film only book is separate art form should not be compared film art form itself it is important it is enlightening it has not aged watch it rating 9 10,0.4406320861678004,0.15512329931972785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,It does the book justice.,"After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10",it does book justice,after studying outstanding book kill mockingbird at school i viewed this film was whole very impressed scout jem are portrayed brilliantly considering ages children who played them they as with everything else production are true books spirit gregory peck is perfect as unflappable atticus finch deserved his oscar music is worthy praise especially climatic scene raw emotion feeling book is amply conveyed all cast are well cast its interesting ponder how much this film at time wouldve shocked that book explores racism outsiders southern town through eyes child is genius works very nicely here only problems are minor much books counter balancing humour was left out certain characters are omitted dolphus raymond aunt alexandra some books early characterisation is missed aside these gripes this is magical film must see as companion piece classic novel 9 10,0.6056651681651681,0.2710689310689311,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Our Greatest Film Hero,"When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain, but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer, raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grown-up Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman. It's a thankless task and Finch knows it, because he knows the attitudes of the people there, those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending, James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating, and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film, Captain Newman, MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style. No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test.",our greatest film hero,when american film institute polled its members they selected gregory peck as atticus finch as greatest hero film ever selection was met with very few dissenters im sure not going argue merits choice but i do have theory as why gregory peck most part played decent honorable thinking men his films few films like duel sun boys brazil have him as villain but public never accepted him really those parts few us our lives can be horatio hornblower or spike guns navarone or command submarine as beach but atticus finch kill mockingbird is well within our grasp hes small town lawyer raising his children as single parent most all trying lead them by example performances mary badham philip alford show kids have learned it very well as does uncredited narration kim stanley as grown up scout atticus finch is very attainable ideal it is i believe secret popularity both book film kill mockingbird is story atticus finch his family during thirties rural alabama action takes place over several months given year most important part film deals with finch defending black man allegedly raping white woman its thankless task finch knows it because he knows attitudes people there those who would make up all white jury still he proceeds with courage determination his summation jury is film classic pecks innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by william windoms prosecutor who smirks through out trial knowing he just has play race card win other outstanding performances are brock peters as man peck is defending james anderson as father girl hes accused violating frank overton as county sheriff this film was debut robert duvall part boo radley who plays autistic neighbor finches no dialog at all duvall who conveys great pained emotion with series expressions that are unforgettable duvall played similar role another peck film captain newman md gregory peck got best actor award 1962 he was up against some very stiff competition that year peck beat out jack lemmon days wine roses burt lancaster birdman alcatraz peter otoole lawrence arabia marcello mastroianni divorce italian style no doubt sentiment did play part final award lemmon lancaster had already gotten oscars otoole mastroianni were relative newcomers but i sure think academy selection that year has stood test time this film has sure stood same test,0.43680194805194805,0.21776515151515152,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,An Unforgettable Drama,"Hoo boy, am I a sucker for courtroom dramas. The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing ""Ponette,"" a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in ""Mockingbird"" received my best child performance ever awards. ""Ponette"" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn't diminish the achievement here.

10.0,This is a deeply moving and powerful film about right and wrong seen through the eyes of children.,"I first saw this in the early 90s.Revisited it on a dvd which I own in 2009 with my kids. My 6 year old boy n 5 year old daughter was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children.Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery.My daughter kinda got scared of the character Boo.I remember she asked me to buy for her bib overalls/dungarees aft enjoying this movie.Revisited again few days back n now my kids are 13 n 12 respectively.Felt like writing a review now inspite of knowing that everything has already been said about this wonderful movie.This is one of the greatest movies of all time, indeed n one of my personal fav.The character Atticus Finch is indeed the greatest screen hero of the 20th century.The child actors are excellent and the young Mary Badham as Scout is remarkable.Mulligan's direction is flawless. Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert are brilliant. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties.Excellent cinematography by Russel Harlan. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly and one of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein.Gregory Peck's best performance in my opinion.(Edited n inserted this line aft re watching it again in Nov 2021 n now my kids are 17 n 18 respectively).This movie n the story is indeed timeless classic.",this is deeply moving powerful film about right wrong seen through eyes children,i first saw this early 90s revisited it dvd which i own 2009 with my kids my 6 year old boy n 5 year old daughter was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through eyes children perhaps also it was fact that part story that dealt with boo radley held kind mystery my daughter kinda got scared character boo i remember she asked me buy her bib overalls dungarees aft enjoying this movie revisited again few days back n now my kids are 13 n 12 respectively felt like writing review now inspite knowing that everything has already been said about this wonderful movie this is one greatest movies all time indeed n one my personal fav character atticus finch is indeed greatest screen hero 20th century child actors are excellent young mary badham as scout is remarkable mulligans direction is flawless art direction by henry bumstead set decoration by oliver emert are brilliant they indeed bring life what small southern town would have been like early thirties excellent cinematography by russel harlan use black white cinematography conveys mood depression era small town america perfectly one best things is music by elmer bernstein gregory pecks best performance my opinion edited n inserted this line aft re watching it again nov 2021 n now my kids are 17 n 18 respectively this movie n story is indeed timeless classic,0.5074646074646075,0.33745173745173745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Every bit as good as they say (B&W). Still POWERFUL. 10/10. Spoilers.,"Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay is so good, it really supplants the 1960 Harper Lee book. I've recently re-read the novel, and it seemed weighed down and paced with backwoods vernacular and situations right out of the 1930s, that are shockingly removed from the 21st century. My goodness. I hope it doesn't strike others so, because the book is a gem too. It's just in need of ...updating perhaps, which is what the 1962 movie excels at; it translates the Depression Era for us. The characters (played, eg by Gregory Peck and Brock Peters in their signature roles) seem so much better-depicted on screen than merely in my own imagination from having read the book! Only Arthur/'Boo' Radley (a peroxided Robert Duvall) seems at first a jarring casting choice to me; but in the end all seem terrific.Now THESE child actors, Mary Badham ('Scout'), Philip Alford ('Jem'), and John Megna (as 'Dill'), should've won Oscars. I'm sure they're all better than Haley Joel Osment, who strikes me as 'studied'. These kids are just natural, completely oblivious of the camera. Unbelievable. Actually, I wonder what genius DID do the casting, because the film gives no casting credit. I guess in 1962 the CSA didn't exist yet... That casting director deserves an Oscar too.This is what great filmmaking is all about; when several areas of perfection are jointly present a film that reaches into your heart and yanks you up and down. Those were real acting jobs, not the cretinous drivel passing for 'work' these days. The reason we don't see too many better movies than Das Experiment is because post-modernism has long encamped in Hollywood (it set up a Starbuck's years ago).The first scene instantly captures Scout's world. She's learning fast at the shoulder of her loving widower lawyer father that she shouldn't embarrass people who are even poorer than they are; and Jem is tantrumming up a tree because he can't brag about his dad's non-existent cool to his friends. Jem demands Atticus play football(!) for the Mets, or more uproariously as Scout tells it, for `the Methodists', hahahaha. (Can we picture Methodists in a sackrace? How many Methodists does it take to change a lightbulb?)The Boo Radley story arc is much better paced in the movie than the book; but because I want to focus on the race-relations arc, I will only make passing comment on Boo: he is gently painted in both the book and movie as another previously dismissed but highly virtuous person, who deserves to be analogized with the fragile, hopeful beauty of the mockingbird. The harrowing exploration of entrenched injustice through various acts of racist violence are adult themes that really couldn't be explored well in a book constrained by the first person narrative of a 7-yr-old little girl. The movie is able to show the Tom Robinson court case much more objectively. Robert Mulligan's direction quickly telegraphs Bob Ewell's shifty creepiness with the scene of his slovenly leering at Atticus' children in the car. Collin Wilcox is also heartrending as Mayella, the ignorant, uneducated and abused daughter of Bob Ewell. Inexplicably, Gregory Peck's cross-examination scene is not quite as sensitive as Atticus is in the book; Peck never reveals that flash of pain at having to destroy Mayella's false testimony. Little Scout's key scene, where she embarrasses the lynch mob (collectively no better than Tom Ewell alone) just with her amiable child's chatter, is EVERY BIT as powerful and stressful as in the book. Probably more, because body language is a much better form of expression for a scene like this.Brock Peters' Tom Robinson is the archetypal decent black man who, YES, felt sorry for a brutalized white woman, as we all ought to. Don't bother debating `what if he was guilty', because TKAM is not a whodunnit; it's an expose of what used to happen WHEN a black man was innocent. The heartbreaking destruction of Tom Robinson's proverbial mockingbird is our collective shame, even now, because similar dismissive laziness still happens. It's every person's character that matters, not whether they're `Methodists'.We do construct our identities as part of various groups. But no group membership, or belief about it, makes any person categorically virtuous. That still hinges on a person's strengths, and crucially, their weaknesses. A person's bad character will overwhelm whatever beliefs they hold; their good character will enhance them. We are all free to act better, or worse, than our beliefs; we're NOT powerless over them, so no-one should ever die over a belief. Cooler thinking than mere violence must rule, or else objective justice will never materialize. And it's only justice if the judgement is accurate; but accuracy requires the abolition of the sort of intellectual/societal laziness that regularly befalls the weakest subgroups of society. Well, we all saw the intellectual rigour of that lynch mob. Would you trust them to tell the time? You might not feel happy trusting even the sheriff (Frank Overton), testifying in court but no better than a hick himself: `Oh, I guess that would make it her LEFT'. Those powerful imbeciles stood in judgement over some societally fragile people, like Tom, and yes, like Mayella.It's still powerful how Tom's hammering as sarcastic legal argument by the prosecutor (William Windom) served to bring home Tom's societal fragility; and we're humbled at the quiet dignity of the entire black population who soberingly stood in the rafters to honor Atticus' failed attempt. The movie was made in 1961, some 7 years before the martyrdom of Martin Luther King Jr, yet in the light of recent gang-related violence, it's clear there are still many who think their group belonging excuses/masks their brutality as people. It does not. And the brutality came first.This movie needs to be seen by the young, to open their hearts to humanity, and their standards for their own personal character, for the rest of their lives.

10.0,American Classic,"Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Scout (Mary Badham) is a 6 year old girl living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. It's a tired old town life with his lawyer father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his little brother Jem. Then Atticus takes a case to defend a black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white teen girl Mayella Ewell. It sends the town into a frenzy which only Atticus and the innocence of Scout are able to withstand.It's an American classic. Gregory Peck exudes stature, compassion and dignity. It takes an important book and honors it with an impressive film. The trick of the movie is to look at the issue of race through the eyes of Scout. It also features Robert Duvall as the iconic Boo Radley. There is one point in the movie after the trial is over that always gets me.

7.0,'Do you know what a compromise is?',"To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, ""Do you know what a compromise is?"" with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Peck's clipped pronunciation of ""Scout""; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.Unfortunately, there's nothing more American than racism, and in this adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels, lawyer Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Since it's the South, you can only imagine the backlash he and his family receive from the community when he steps up to give Tom Robinson his right to a fair trial. As in the novel, the story is told from the point of view of Scout, Atticus's young daughter. Mary Badham plays Scout, and she's not only adorable, but completely earned her Oscar nomination. She was only ten years old, and the youngest actress to be nominated at that time! To Kill a Mockingbird marks Gregory Peck's most famous role, and while everyone knows the famous ""In the name of God"" powerful courtroom speech, his performance isn't just a ""Gregory Peck role"". He's a caring, concerned father, and the scenes between Greg and Mary are beautiful. Greg won an Oscar for his performance, and the film also picked up statues for Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. Elmer Bernstein's lovely theme was nominated, but it was hard to compete against Laurence of Arabia, which took the music, director, and picture awards away from To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a real American classic, so if you're that one person in the country who hasn't yet seen it, rent it so you can join in the conversation with all your family and friends. Even if you're particularly attached to the novel and don't generally like film adaptations, give it a chance. Harper Lee herself loved the movie and thought Gregory Peck's performance was so wonderful, she gave him her father's (the real Atticus Finch) pocket watch. Peck's grandson is named Harper, which is really sweet, and it shows just how much this role and film meant to him and his family.",do you know what compromise is,kill mockingbird is pretty famous my household my mom loved gregory pecks portrayal integrity filled honest caring patient father so much that she named my brother atticus it was running quotation when i was growing up say do you know what compromise is with little southern drawl i know my family is one millions who have tried emulate gregory pecks clipped pronunciation scout that one word is another one our famous long running movie quotations unfortunately theres nothing more american than racism this adaptation one most iconic american novels lawyer atticus finch defends black man falsely accused raping white woman since its south you can only imagine backlash he his family receive community when he steps up give tom robinson his right fair trial as novel story is told point view scout atticuss young daughter mary badham plays scout shes not only adorable but completely earned her oscar nomination she was only ten years old youngest actress be nominated at that time kill mockingbird marks gregory pecks most famous role while everyone knows famous name god powerful courtroom speech his performance isnt just gregory peck role hes caring concerned father scenes between greg mary are beautiful greg won oscar his performance film also picked up statues adapted screenplay art direction elmer bernsteins lovely theme was nominated but it was hard compete against laurence arabia which took music director picture awards away kill mockingbird this is real american classic so if youre that one person country who hasnt yet seen it rent it so you can join conversation with all your family friends even if youre particularly attached novel dont generally like film adaptations give it chance harper lee herself loved movie thought gregory pecks performance was so wonderful she gave him her fathers real atticus finch pocket watch pecks grandson is named harper which is really sweet it shows just how much this role film meant him his family,0.5869047619047619,0.24051587301587293,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.24}"
6.0,This bird don't sing,"This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting.

7.0,Recommended,"​'TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD' - 1962Directed by Robert MulliganStarring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Phillip AlfordPlot Overview: ​Scout Finch (Mary Badham), 6,and her older brother, Jem (Phillip Alford), live in sleepy Maycomb, Ala., spending much of their time with their friend Dill (John Megna) and spying on their reclusive and mysterious neighbour, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall). When Atticus (Gregory Peck), their widowed father and a respected lawyer, defends a black man named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against fabricated rape charges, the trial and tangent events expose the children to evils of racism and stereotyping.This might be a movie that I am just not understanding in the slightest. It may genuinely be a testament of cinematic perfection. But, as it stands, I was immensely disappointed by this movie. Is it a poor movie? No. Not at all. In fact, there is a portion of this movie that could stand as one of the greatest 'Acts' in Film history. But the meat surrounding this Act was very lacklustre and poor for me. I am very sad to say that 'To Kill A Mockingbird' disappointed me.But what do I actually like about it? The portion between the first half and last 20 minutes was cinematic perfection. I am serious. I won't specifically say what happens but I will say that it is literally perfect. As for the film surrounding that part, that is a different story for me, but that does not detract from the masterful film making shown my the actors and Mulligan during that sweet, sweet 40 or so minutes.I also loved Gregory Peck in this film. He delivers a heartfelt, slow and meaningful performance as Articus. You can really see a passion and intelligence lurking beneath his calm, steady and articulate demeanour. Peck well and truly deserved his Oscar for this outstanding performance.Brock Peters was also incredible in his, unfortunately, minute role as Tom Robinson. Peters and the writers do excellent jobs in creating sympathy for this character and truly showing the injustice of the situation he finds himself in. I was very disappointed that he did not at least receive an Oscar nomination for this role; it was truly excellent. Phillip Aldford was good as Jem. The character wasn't exactly likable or interesting but I do admire their attempt at giving him an arc. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Mary Badham's Scout for me. It baffles me as to how she earned an Oscar Nomination because I found her performance to be bland and very poor. And Scout as a character was also very disappointing. I mean, she wasn't likable, interesting and I fail to see a true arc for her. Another flaw that I have with this film is the very mediocre beginning and end. The middle is, as stated prior, true cinematic gold. The remainder of the film is a dull, bland, uninteresting, monotonous mess. I fail to see the brilliance in it and, while the message of the film is strong and prosperous, the execution of it was not. Then there is the very annoying ending. Maybe I am an idiot but I did not understand what was happening in the ending of this film. It was very confusing. I understand WHAT happened but I cannot fathom as to why. Perhaps my attention merely lapsed for those precious couple of seconds for the grand reveal but that doesn't change my distaste for it. That, and that man was absurdly creepy.In conclusion, I was unfortunately disappointed by 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. It's not a bad movie by any means, and when it gets it right, it gets it right. But the overall package did not live up to the expectations I had. It was a little over average and the middle on its own would achieve an easy 10/10. Despite that claim, the middle was the middle, and it had the beginning and end bogging it down. Do see this film, though. The message is very important and it features an impeccable middle and performance from Gregory Peck. Aside from that though, it was not that great. I'll rate 'To Kill A Mockingbird' 7 'Creepy Men in the Corner' out of 10.",recommended,kill mockingbird 1962directed by robert mulliganstarring gregory peck mary badham phillip alfordplot overview scout finch mary badham 6 her older brother jem phillip alford live sleepy maycomb ala spending much their time with their friend dill john megna spying their reclusive mysterious neighbour boo radley robert duvall when atticus gregory peck their widowed father respected lawyer defends black man named tom robinson brock peters against fabricated rape charges trial tangent events expose children evils racism stereotyping this might be movie that i am just not understanding slightest it may genuinely be testament cinematic perfection but as it stands i was immensely disappointed by this movie is it poor movie no not at all fact there is portion this movie that could stand as one greatest acts film history but meat surrounding this act was very lacklustre poor me i am very sad say that kill mockingbird disappointed me but what do i actually like about it portion between first half last 20 minutes was cinematic perfection i am serious i wont specifically say what happens but i will say that it is literally perfect as film surrounding that part that is different story me but that does not detract masterful film making shown my actors mulligan during that sweet sweet 40 or so minutes i also loved gregory peck this film he delivers heartfelt slow meaningful performance as articus you can really see passion intelligence lurking beneath his calm steady articulate demeanour peck well truly deserved his oscar this outstanding performance brock peters was also incredible his unfortunately minute role as tom robinson peters writers do excellent jobs creating sympathy this character truly showing injustice situation he finds himself i was very disappointed that he did not at least receive oscar nomination this role it was truly excellent phillip aldford was good as jem character wasnt exactly likable or interesting but i do admire their attempt at giving him arc unfortunately same cannot be said about mary badhams scout me it baffles me as how she earned oscar nomination because i found her performance be bland very poor scout as character was also very disappointing i mean she wasnt likable interesting i fail see true arc her another flaw that i have with this film is very mediocre beginning end middle is as stated prior true cinematic gold remainder film is dull bland uninteresting monotonous mess i fail see brilliance it while message film is strong prosperous execution it was not then there is very annoying ending maybe i am idiot but i did not understand what was happening ending this film it was very confusing i understand what happened but i cannot fathom as why perhaps my attention merely lapsed those precious couple seconds grand reveal but that doesnt change my distaste it that that man was absurdly creepy conclusion i was unfortunately disappointed by kill mockingbird its not bad movie by any means when it gets it right it gets it right but overall package did not live up expectations i had it was little over average middle its own would achieve easy 10 10 despite that claim middle was middle it had beginning end bogging it down do see this film though message is very important it features impeccable middle performance gregory peck aside that though it was not that great ill rate kill mockingbird 7 creepy men corner out 10,0.5871664883181736,0.0440717771616648,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,The Best,"Generally, I prefer to review movies I dislike, because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones, but ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen. I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen. I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family. The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch. He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs. He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots. Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind. Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.

,Good story but not that well told,"Told in hindsight by Scout this is the story of how she and her brother remember one summer in the Deep South when their father, Atticus Finch defends a black man (Robinson) who has been accused of forcing himself on a white girl and then beating her. Atticus finds himself in a battle for the truth in the face of racism and intolerance and also defending his children from the impact of the same on them.I first read the book in school and have re-read it several times as it has really stuck with me. Since then I have seen the film a couple of times but have never felt that it really reaches the same height as the book does. The telling of the story is at it's strongest in the courtroom as it takes on the principles of a courtroom thriller however outside of this central piece it is almost a Southern cliché  with the kids, the community etc. It still works but it feels like a postcard compared to the reality of the South in the intolerance of the courtroom.The film doesn't totally bring through the themes of the books  instead focusing on the specifics. This is necessary to make it all fit into the 130min running time but it is to the subject matter's detriment as it loses much of it's significance. That's not to say it is not impacting, because it still is. I do have a problem with the first half and the end of the film where the focus is entirely on the children before sudden jumps into the main plot. In the book it is all part of the same thing, here it does feel like it is a different chapter.Peck is good in his usual moral indignation role and he is well supported by the two child actors who both seem natural  Badham (sister of the director) and Alford. A very young looking Robert Duvall is in the film briefly and adds a bit of interest to the generally good supporting cast. It is to the film's credit (considering the period and the setting) that the black characters are not just limited to `yessir' stereotypes although at times they come close.Overall I enjoyed this film and the courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going. The narration of the grown up Scout is a little weak and some of the film appears to be wandering to no effect but it is still a good film. I, however, would still rather re-read the book.",good story but not that well told,told hindsight by scout this is story how she her brother remember one summer deep south when their father atticus finch defends black man robinson who has been accused forcing himself white girl then beating her atticus finds himself battle truth face racism intolerance also defending his children impact same them i first read book school have re read it several times as it has really stuck with me since then i have seen film couple times but have never felt that it really reaches same height as book does telling story is at its strongest courtroom as it takes principles courtroom thriller however outside this central piece it is almost southern clich with kids community etc it still works but it feels like postcard compared reality south intolerance courtroom film doesnt totally bring through themes books instead focusing specifics this is necessary make it all fit into 130min running time but it is subject matters detriment as it loses much its significance thats not say it is not impacting because it still is i do have problem with first half end film where focus is entirely children before sudden jumps into main plot book it is all part same thing here it does feel like it is different chapter peck is good his usual moral indignation role he is well supported by two child actors who both seem natural badham sister director alford very young looking robert duvall is film briefly adds bit interest generally good supporting cast it is films credit considering period setting that black characters are not just limited yessir stereotypes although at times they come close overall i enjoyed this film courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going narration grown up scout is little weak some film appears be wandering no effect but it is still good film i however would still rather re read book,0.369485049833887,0.08169158361018825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"

7.0,The Old Gray Bird Ain't What She Used To Be,"One hates to be the skunk at the garden party but this movie simply isn't as good as its reputation might suggest. It is extremely dated and calculated in ways that are now obvious but probably worked back in 1962. The dialogue has a tendency to go on for too long in almost every scene, as points are hammered home continuously, didactically, but aside from the scenes that belong only to the children the film is dramatically leaden and top heavy in what were at the time 'dangerous' and 'radical' ideas about racism and injustice (though they were fashionable in Hollywood), and frequently the movie feels like a sermon, and a self-congratulatory one at that.As the story of children growing up in the Deep South during the Depression the film works fairly well. It is beautiful visually and the photography by the underrated Russell Harlan is flawless. The performances of the actors who play the children are superb. Had the movie stuck to being their story it might have been a masterpiece. The part about the elusive, ghostly Boo Radley struck a chord, and I suspect that most of us can remember a spooky neighbor or two and the stories we used to make up about them. So far, so good. But when the black man accused of rape entered the picture a different movie emerged: preachy, obvious, self-consciously genteel about bigotry being the preserve of poor, ignorant rural folks, and above all obvious. This is when it becomes a star vehicle for Gregory Peck, who delivers an extraordinarily self-righteous summation to the jury complete with ""for the love God!"", and I stopped believing what I was watching and I began thinking about some of the shabbier Rod Serling Twilight Zones of long ago, with their 'messages' about 'little people' at the end. The film shifts into high gear in the last act, with the attack on the children, which I still find frightening, but the damage had been done, and even with Boo (blessedly) back in the story the poetic mood of the earlier parts of the movie was recaptured only fitfully, and I had a feeling of having been set-up. Some of the problem with the film is obviously the Harper Lee novel it was adapted from. Miss Lee wrote a good book but as a writer was a far cry from Faulkner or even Eudora Welty, and having reread large portions of it a few years ago I must say that it dates as badly as the movie. She was trying to do too much with her wistful story, and got her politics and poetics mixed up, and the result is an unsatisfactory stab at greatness, though I must say it's a good try. But alas she missed the mark, and so does the film. There's a good deal of sponantaneous feeling in the stuff about the kids, but when it shifts to grown-ups neither Miss Lee, director Robert Mulligan or screenwriter Horton Foote seems to know how to make things work. Suddenly the story turns moral with a vengeance. It's not easy to treat the issue of a man falsely accused of rape any other way, for sure, but it ruins the magical tone so meticulously built up in the earlier scenes. Yes, the world of childhood has as much to do with imagination as reality, and especially with imagination applied to reality as a means of interpretation, which in adults seems the preserve of artists and no one else. The move from childhood to adulthood is often tragic, as life's unpleasantries become unavoidable. Art at its best provides a respite from this as well as another way of seeing life, of feeling things differently and of thinking deeper thoughts. In art we have the opportunity to recapture at least some of the affect of childhood, but to do so with wisdom and understanding.In To Kill a Mockingbird we see a liberal take on childhood, as imagination is tranformed, in the course of the narrative, into a sense of civic responsibility. Children, mockingbirds and black folks are metamorphosed into a kind of helpless class. Only they, it seems, are truly in touch with nature, truth and the meaning of life. The adult whites are either good or bad, interesting only inasmuch as they have all the power and often use it badly. The trick, as the film implies, is to get these blinkered white grownups to appreciate the pure world of freedom and ease that the children, mockingbirds and blacks enjoy, and all will be well, or at least a whole lot better. But alas the reason the white grownups are so dull and moralistic, in good and bad ways, come from their sense of responsibility, which comes with power, and which children, mockingbirds and blacks don't have. When they do get power (viz. Lord Of the Flies) they prove as capable as adults of doing foul, nasty things. I think that Lee, Mulligan and Foote are aware of this contradiction, if only subconsciously, which is why the prevailing mood of the story is one of sadness.",old gray bird aint what she used be,one hates be skunk at garden party but this movie simply isnt as good as its reputation might suggest it is extremely dated calculated ways that are now obvious but probably worked back 1962 dialogue has tendency go too long almost every scene as points are hammered home continuously didactically but aside scenes that belong only children film is dramatically leaden top heavy what were at time dangerous radical ideas about racism injustice though they were fashionable hollywood frequently movie feels like sermon self congratulatory one at that as story children growing up deep south during depression film works fairly well it is beautiful visually photography by underrated russell harlan is flawless performances actors who play children are superb had movie stuck being their story it might have been masterpiece part about elusive ghostly boo radley struck chord i suspect that most us can remember spooky neighbor or two stories we used make up about them so far so good but when black man accused rape entered picture different movie emerged preachy obvious self consciously genteel about bigotry being preserve poor ignorant rural folks above all obvious this is when it becomes star vehicle gregory peck who delivers extraordinarily self righteous summation jury complete with love god i stopped believing what i was watching i began thinking about some shabbier rod serling twilight zones long ago with their messages about little people at end film shifts into high gear last act with attack children which i still find frightening but damage had been done even with boo blessedly back story poetic mood earlier parts movie was recaptured only fitfully i had feeling having been set up some problem with film is obviously harper lee novel it was adapted miss lee wrote good book but as writer was far cry faulkner or even eudora welty having reread large portions it few years ago i must say that it dates as badly as movie she was trying do too much with her wistful story got her politics poetics mixed up result is unsatisfactory stab at greatness though i must say its good try but alas she missed mark so does film theres good deal sponantaneous feeling stuff about kids but when it shifts grown ups neither miss lee director robert mulligan or screenwriter horton foote seems know how make things work suddenly story turns moral with vengeance its not easy treat issue man falsely accused rape any other way sure but it ruins magical tone so meticulously built up earlier scenes yes world childhood has as much do with imagination as reality especially with imagination applied reality as means interpretation which adults seems preserve artists no one else move childhood adulthood is often tragic as lifes unpleasantries become unavoidable art at its best provides respite this as well as another way seeing life feeling things differently thinking deeper thoughts art we have opportunity recapture at least some affect childhood but do so with wisdom understanding kill mockingbird we see liberal take childhood as imagination is tranformed course narrative into sense civic responsibility children mockingbirds black folks are metamorphosed into kind helpless class only they it seems are truly touch with nature truth meaning life adult whites are either good or bad interesting only inasmuch as they have all power often use it badly trick as film implies is get these blinkered white grownups appreciate pure world freedom ease that children mockingbirds blacks enjoy all will be well or at least whole lot better but alas reason white grownups are so dull moralistic good bad ways come their sense responsibility which comes with power which children mockingbirds blacks dont have when they do get power viz lord flies they prove as capable as adults doing foul nasty things i think that lee mulligan foote are aware this contradiction if only subconsciously which is why prevailing mood story is one sadness,0.5493642439431912,0.06939724310776939,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,When a Book and a Movie Knock It Out of the Park,"There is something so sensitive yet intense in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is a man of great honor and true humanity. He takes it all inside, dealing with the realities of what he is facing. He ignore the threats and sees a man for a man. However, he is doomed but represents an action out of time. I was especially impressed with the children in this movie. They are not scene stealers but rather show the future if allowed to grow up. As the trial moves along, it is obvious that there is little that can be said to counteract the hate that is there. But like most of us, Atticus and look in the mirror at the end of the day and say he did what was right. Gregory Peck was a top ten actor and wandered smoothly from movies such as ""Moby Dick"" to ""The Omen."" He was masterful in psychological thrillers such as ""Spellbound.""

9.0,Superb Performance By Gregory Peck; Superb Directing By Robert Mulligan,"In my experience, this may be the best adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced, the story having been taken from the novel of the same name by Harper Lee. It's a story about racism in the Depression-era South. It's a coming of age story for young Scout and Jem, who watch their father Atticus doggedly defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young white woman. It features magnificent performances from pretty much the entire cast. Young Mary Badham was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Scout - but then, perhaps surprisingly, she went on to do very little acting. And what can one say about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. This may well have been his best performance; when I think of Gregory Peck it's certainly Atticus Finch who comes into my mind. There's an incredible mix of well known names in the supporting cast: Brock Peters, William Windom, Paul Fix and even a very young Robert Duvall. And there really isn't a weak performance among them. Most of the attention around ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is usually focused on the performances, and especially Peck, but I want to pay special tribute to the directing.Director Robert Mulligan did a superb job as well, and while he went on to direct a number of other movies, this surely was his finest job. There's a very good pace to this movie. It starts out slowly, painting an almost idyllic picture of life in this small town in the South, focusing on Scout and Jem and their friend Dill. It's summer, school is out and they're just kids having fun. It's a casual and carefree existence, they spend most of their time outside, sometimes getting into mischief, sometimes investigating some of the town's mysteries - one of which revolves around the story of Boo, a local boy supposedly kept chained in his basement by his father. You get the feeling that if there was anyplace you wanted to grow up as a child, it was right here in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's - Depression or not. Until Mayella is attacked, and Tom Robinson (a black man) is accused, and Atticus is assigned to defend him. Then the story becomes dark, the racism starts to be seen; the gulf between black and white must be a shock to Scout and Jem, whose exposure to black people to this point has been to friendly Calpurnia, who kept house for their widowed father and looked after them and was more or less part of the family. Mulligan picks up the pace of the movie once the trial starts. The trial proceeds at a frenetic pace - seemingly it all takes place in a single day, which perhaps makes the point that even with Atticus doing his best and making clear the truth of what had actually happened, there was going to be no long consideration of the facts - just a rush to a pre-ordained judgement, followed by a tragedy. Then there's the suspense of what happened to Scout and Jem on their ""longest journey"" - as the adult Scout (who serves as kind of the narrator) calls it in a voice over. But once that finishes, Mulligan changes the pace again, and the story slows down as the mystery of Boo from the beginning of the movie is revealed, and the film concludes on a very gentle and moving note. Just superb pacing from Mulligan. He was nominated for the Oscar as Best Director in 1963, but lost to David Lean's turn directing ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Both were fine movies, but I'd have given the nod to Mulligan.You could criticize the movie for downplaying to an extent the reality of racism. It really doesn't give us any glimpse into what it was like to be black in Maycomb - it gives far more of a white perspective on the issue of racism. But that's exactly what the novel was of course - a depiction of life in small town Alabama using Harper Lee's own upbringing as a model. I also thought that the combination of the depiction of small town life (and especially the focus at the beginning and the end on Boo) was perhaps a bit awkwardly combined with the rape trial and the reflection on racism, although Boo himself becomes an example of yet another misunderstood figure in the town. Atticus comes across as almost too good to be true. But, really, there's very little to criticize about this movie, which deserves to be thought of as a classic.
