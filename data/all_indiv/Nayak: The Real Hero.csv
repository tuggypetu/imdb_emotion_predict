9.0,"Well addressed thriller, on being an ideal social servant!","Tone, Script & Story: The movie is how a press reporter is challenged to be a C.M for one day and continues to be in the long run as well. The tone of corrupt by many official's as well as being an ideal social servant by other few official's is portrayed well. The script is tight and it keeps you in your seat till end.It is sad how on thebasis of factors like caste, category and formed groups, formulate such violence. People belonging to such faction possess low I.Q and thus formulate violence even without knowing whole truth. It's a shame, that they can't act wisely.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction of S. Shankar is good. Screenplay and cinematography is good as well, except for the part where I dint like animated serpents. Music: Music is good too. Acting: Acting from all leads is good as well.Final Verdict: Well addressed thriller on being a true social servant.

,Very nice movie,"What impressed me most about the movie is the tightness of the script. Events unfold one after the other. Neither too fast, nor too slow. Keeps you gripped. The events are coherent. Something you rarely see in Indian movies is people referring to events that have happened in the beginning of the movie. More often than not, the scripts are improvised on the sets and to maintain continuity the dialogues are abstract in nature so that the different parts gel in. To make a movie with cross references to subtle events needs you to have a script very firmly in place.Second good thing about the movie was the experimentation with Visuals. Though at some points I felt that they have just indulged into special effects without the need for it (they should use effects only where needed), but honestly I was very impressed by the efforts taken to meet quality standards.What has put off many people about the movie is the songs and dance and the unrealistic fights and some silly extremisms. Well the songs really don't have much bearing on the movie. And they have experimented with a very rustic style of entertainment which won't get wasted on everyone. As far as the fights and 'silly extremisms' go, I feel they tried to retain the HERO flavour which would really appeal to a large aspect of the masses.The movie has very innovative ideas and also dares to be different - thougt most of that part should be attributed to its South Indian Counterpart.I would say please go and see the movie. Its a nice experience. Appreciate it for its professionalism and technical expertise. Appreciate it for amazing dialogues and great performances by Paresh Rawal and Anil Kapoor both. It is a thought provoking film - something I feel the movie really set out to be. So its purpose is served.",very nice movie,what impressed me most about movie is tightness script events unfold one after other neither too fast nor too slow keeps you gripped events are coherent something you rarely see indian movies is people referring events that have happened beginning movie more often than not scripts are improvised sets maintain continuity dialogues are abstract nature so that different parts gel make movie with cross references subtle events needs you have script very firmly place second good thing about movie was experimentation with visuals though at some points i felt that they have just indulged into special effects without need it they should use effects only where needed but honestly i was very impressed by efforts taken meet quality standards what has put off many people about movie is songs dance unrealistic fights some silly extremisms well songs really dont have much bearing movie they have experimented with very rustic style entertainment which wont get wasted everyone as far as fights silly extremisms go i feel they tried retain hero flavour which would really appeal large aspect masses movie has very innovative ideas also dares be different thougt most that part should be attributed its south indian counterpart i would say please go see movie its nice experience appreciate it its professionalism technical expertise appreciate it amazing dialogues great performances by paresh rawal anil kapoor both it is thought provoking film something i feel movie really set out be so its purpose is served,0.5867105263157895,0.22850250626566418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Excellent,"This is a remake of Shankar's own south film Madhalvan in Hindi. The south Whizz kid director has made an awesome spectacle of a film with Nayak.It is a definite must see. Rahman's music is superb, 'shaka laka baby!' to say the least. This film contains superior special effects and CGI for it's time, unlike others who have no sense of using CGI effectively and non garishly, Shankar has created beautiful sequences for the songs. The cinematography is breathtaking, a joy to the eye. The South influence is very imminent, that is what makes this film so good along with a bravura performance from Anil Kapoor and the sensuous Rani Mukerjee although underused only adds to the films beauty.",excellent,this is remake shankars own south film madhalvan hindi south whizz kid director has made awesome spectacle film with nayak it is definite must see rahmans music is superb shaka laka baby say least this film contains superior special effects cgi its time unlike others who have no sense using cgi effectively non garishly shankar has created beautiful sequences songs cinematography is breathtaking joy eye south influence is very imminent that is what makes this film so good along with bravura performance anil kapoor sensuous rani mukerjee although underused only adds films beauty,0.7514285714285713,0.5671428571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.41, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.06}"
9.0,Nayak Review: This one is a Mahanayak!,"Movie: Nayak Rating: 4.5/5Very rarely it happens that you come across a film which is brave in terms of content. If you haven't seen one yet, Shankar's Nayak is one of them. Although I haven't seen the original film Mudhalvan yet, I can still say that Director Shankar's film has managed to hit the right notes, and that too at the right time.Right from the beginning, you realize that a heavily intense drama would follow you till the end. It's true. The best thing is that the producers have left no stone unturned to make this film look at par with mega budget movies. The action scenes are perhaps the best ones ever seen in an Anil Kapoor film. Happy to see good special effects and excellent cinematography.Coming to the story, there's no doubt that it's the real 'Nayak' of the film. The story doesn't give you even a chance to blink, and whatever happens is true to life. Not even a single scene gives you the feel as if you are watching a wrong Movie. Anil Kapoor is in his original form. Rest others have done their respective parts well.However, the only thing that one may not like at all would be the excess number of songs, and that too placed at the time when the film gets serious. But, since they are pleasant, one wouldn't mind watching the songs as well.On the whole, if you are a true Cinema lover, who can watch the film without thinking how much better it could have been, go for Nayak. You will surely love it.

8.0,Inspirational,"The director has done a good job with this movie. It is thought-provoking and inspirational. The plot is along the lines of ""What if I were the President or the Prime Minister of the country for a day"" essays that we have all written in our school days. Not only does it expose corruption in various aspects of life (which is not really new) but it also offers genuine solutions in tackling those problems. There are enough twists in the plot to keep you glued to your seat. I was disappointed with Rani Mukherjee's role which is insignificant and restricted to singing songs with the ""Hero"". Unfortunately, the songs aren't great. If I could edit the movie to delete the songs and the long fights, I would. But overall, if it inspires even one good soul to enter politics, that would be great. Three cheers to the director!",inspirational,director has done good job with this movie it is thought provoking inspirational plot is along lines what if i were president or prime minister country day essays that we have all written our school days not only does it expose corruption various aspects life which is not really new but it also offers genuine solutions tackling those problems there are enough twists plot keep you glued your seat i was disappointed with rani mukherjees role which is insignificant restricted singing songs with hero unfortunately songs arent great if i could edit movie delete songs long fights i would but overall if it inspires even one good soul enter politics that would be great three cheers director,0.6127840909090909,0.19573863636363636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A dream for the future of India,"Nayak is a movie about India's current condition and a way out. Anil Kapoor is superb as the reporter who through his good heart and job gets dragged into politics. In one day he is able to clean Maharashtra through his hard work, dedication, and determination. Yet Baldev Chauhan played by the always excellent Amrish Puri, is not willing to let this go, especially as Rao's work leads to a vote of no confidence. In attacking Rao as well as the popular outpouring of support for Rao as CM Rao is forced to take the position of CM. The additional foil is a love story. Rao is in love with Manjari (played by Rani Mukherji) a village belle whose father does not want her to marry a politician. The movie is an excellent commentary on politics and the power of one man. The powerful idealism is wonderful, yet for some it detracts from the movie. The love story is touching as well. Rani Mukherjee, Paresh Rawal, and Anil Kapoor excell in their roles and add a great deal of emotion.",dream future india,nayak is movie about indias current condition way out anil kapoor is superb as reporter who through his good heart job gets dragged into politics one day he is able clean maharashtra through his hard work dedication determination yet baldev chauhan played by always excellent amrish puri is not willing let this go especially as raos work leads vote no confidence attacking rao as well as popular outpouring support rao as cm rao is forced take position cm additional foil is love story rao is love with manjari played by rani mukherji village belle whose father does not want her marry politician movie is excellent commentary politics power one man powerful idealism is wonderful yet some it detracts movie love story is touching as well rani mukherjee paresh rawal anil kapoor excell their roles add great deal emotion,0.6945833333333333,0.42750000000000005,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.03, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,One day CM is still politically relevant.,"After achieving fair amount of success dubbing his Tamil blockbusters - Kadhalan (1994) and Indian (1996) - in Hindi (as Humse Hai Muqabla and Hindustani respectively), noted Tamil director S. Shankar decided to make his first Hindi film which would be an official remake of his Tamil hit called Mudhalvan (1999).Anil Kapoor played the honest diligent TV reporter who gets to interview the corrupt chief minister (CM) Amrish Puri and attempts to expose his indifference which lead to State riots. In a knee jerk response, the CM offers his chair to the reporter for a day and Anil Kapoor ends up becoming the 'Ek Din Ka CM'.The interview sequence is the films highlight and both, Anil Kapoor and Amrish Puri, are brilliant here. The economic as well as political measures Anil Kapoor takes on becoming the CM also makes for an interesting watch.On the flipside, Rani Mukerjee's romantic track with Kapoor acts as a speed breaker to the narrative and even AR Rahman's score is not up to the mark.Corruption has been Shankar's recurring theme right from Gentleman (1993) to Anniyan (2005). Nayak also deals with his pet topic and offers food for thought that we need to elect well educated and well intention candidates to power.Despite being a box office failure, Nayak earned its due later on satellite television to emerge a cult classic. I had seen the film at Chitra cinema, Dadar on its first Sunday and still catch it whenever it comes on tv.

It's a thoughtful and a gripping story with exhilarating performances. Rahman's music is excellent. His typical Western Classical beats mixed with traditional Indian music with some Marathi influence. Picturization is brilliant especially in the song, Saiyaan.

6.0,Don't grumble over the credibility in the storyline or else different cinema would not come in our way,"Firstly don't grumble over the credibility in the storyline or else different cinema would not come in our way. Moreover director Shankar has much conviction in his direction to make the overall product fairly digestible.So we have a journalist Mr. Shivaji Rao (Anil Kapoor) who in an interview with the CM (Amrish Puri), is challenged to work as a CM for 24 hours. Accepting the challenge he does everything in those 24 hours from clearing JHOPDI'S to suspending corrupt KHOPDI'S. In the second half, by public demand he is elected as the permanent CM , but ironically in this half he spends more time romancing with a village girl (Rani Mukherjee).A well written script and a fast pace screenplay, successfully grab's the audiences attention. Rehman's music is not much hot this time but the song picturizations do have an artistic visual appeal. Lacks of bucks spent on those huge sunflowers , tall bhuttas, fat pumpkins and a thousand matkas ( though do not make much sense, but) are surely different than those usual running around trees or dancing in foreign locations.Some scenes have been very well presented, like the conflict between the bus driver and the students, the interview with the CM and the assassination of the CM at the end. But the MUDDY MATRIX oriented fight sequence was overdone and could have been avoided. In terms of performance, Anil Kapoor is extremely convincing and adds life to the portrayal of his character. Rani is charming. Amrish returns to a sensible negative role. Paresh Rawal lends excellent support.Finally if you think hundreds of movies have been made on corrupt system theme, then this one is no new but a good example of old wine in the latest bottle.",dont grumble over credibility storyline or else different cinema would not come our way,firstly dont grumble over credibility storyline or else different cinema would not come our way moreover director shankar has much conviction his direction make overall product fairly digestible so we have journalist mr shivaji rao anil kapoor who interview with cm amrish puri is challenged work as cm 24 hours accepting challenge he does everything those 24 hours clearing jhopdis suspending corrupt khopdis second half by public demand he is elected as permanent cm but ironically this half he spends more time romancing with village girl rani mukherjee well written script fast pace screenplay successfully grabs audiences attention rehmans music is not much hot this time but song picturizations do have artistic visual appeal lacks bucks spent those huge sunflowers tall bhuttas fat pumpkins thousand matkas though do not make much sense but are surely different than those usual running around trees or dancing foreign locations some scenes have been very well presented like conflict between bus driver students interview with cm assassination cm at end but muddy matrix oriented fight sequence was overdone could have been avoided terms performance anil kapoor is extremely convincing adds life portrayal his character rani is charming amrish returns sensible negative role paresh rawal lends excellent support finally if you think hundreds movies have been made corrupt system theme then this one is no new but good example old wine latest bottle,0.5283199643493761,0.14505347593582887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.37}"

He is assisted by the cunning assistant Bansal played by Paresh Rawal.After taking over, he suspends more than thousands of babus on charges of corruption. He tours the city, the surrounding areas to find out the various problems. He closes his day with arrest of 12 ministers and the Chief Minister himself. This makes him the target of those peoples once in power. Once his day as the Chief Minister is over, Shivaji tries to get back to his normal life but he won't be allowed to. He finds that being the Chief Minister for one day has changed his life altogether. Suddenly he is being expected by any and everyone to do something. He is being expected by various political parties to represent them for elections. Now he has got two choices. Either he leaves for some distant land where no one would recognize him and he can lead a normal life OR he would jump to the bandwagon that is called Politics and rise to become a honest politician.Anil Kapoor as Shivaji has played a exceptional role in the movie.

Despite its weaknesses one must commend Shankar for trying to bring this concept to the Hindi-speaking audience although the political situation in north Indian cities is'nt as bad as the situation as the southern ones which Mudhalvan originally portrayed realistically.The north Indian audience may thus have trouble digesting some of the events in this movie which south Indians in contrast, will find as common evils within their city and society. Anil Kapoor doesn't act as well as Arjun did, nor do the other actors such Paresh rawal touch or even approach Manivannan's or Vadivelu's hilarity and performances. Even the great Amrish Puri is no where as good as Raguvaran. Although any non tamil speaker will not be able to fully appreciate the mudhalvan story, Nayak does make a genuine attempt to get them to understand it.The music has been downgraded as well. The songs are nothing like the original Mudhalvan and mostly sound bad. Nayak is a decent remake but no way as good as the original. The comedy in particular, is quite botched up and there's no ""Poda Panni!""",mudhalvan downgraded,even though nayak is no where near as good original tamil version ie mudhalvan this movie is still good because most it is frame by frame remake mudhalvan despite its weaknesses one must commend shankar trying bring this concept hindi speaking audience although political situation north indian cities isnt as bad as situation as southern ones which mudhalvan originally portrayed realistically north indian audience may thus have trouble digesting some events this movie which south indians contrast will find as common evils within their city society anil kapoor doesnt act as well as arjun did nor do other actors such paresh rawal touch or even approach manivannans or vadivelus hilarity performances even great amrish puri is no where as good as raguvaran although any non tamil speaker will not be able fully appreciate mudhalvan story nayak does make genuine attempt get them understand it music has been downgraded as well songs are nothing like original mudhalvan mostly sound bad nayak is decent remake but no way as good as original comedy particular is quite botched up theres no poda panni,0.5243055555555556,0.22118055555555563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.04, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,Nayak The Real Hero,"Nayak The Real Hero is the One of the most likely movie.in this movie Anil kapoor acting is so Great fully. And movie Story is Also Great h. In this movie One day CM will tack action to the old CM and Suspended The all corrupt officers. Shorty in this movie Full story is fight between Corrupt and Non Corrupt people. I honestly really enjoyed the movie. Spectacular acting by everyone. Great concept and message for the younger generation to take a step forward and for the experienced generation to look at thing from a newer angle. Opens your mind to a wider aspect. Leaves a great message for the 'common people' of India-to act, and not just judge. Its definitely a must watch. Its got thriller, action, crime, drama, romance. Though not completely realistic in some of the smaller parts which did disappoint me a bit but very realistic on the bigger front. So, look forward to keep yourself glued. Happy watching!",nayak real hero,nayak real hero is one most likely movie this movie anil kapoor acting is so great fully movie story is also great h this movie one day cm will tack action old cm suspended all corrupt officers shorty this movie full story is fight between corrupt non corrupt people i honestly really enjoyed movie spectacular acting by everyone great concept message younger generation take step forward experienced generation look at thing newer angle opens your mind wider aspect leaves great message common people india act not just judge its definitely must watch its got thriller action crime drama romance though not completely realistic some smaller parts which did disappoint me bit but very realistic bigger front so look forward keep yourself glued happy watching,0.5470238095238096,0.20654761904761904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
