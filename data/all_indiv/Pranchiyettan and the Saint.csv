10.0,Rejuvenating and Vibrant!,"Of late I have been fascinated by the transformation of Ranjith as film- maker of real stuff. Kayoppu, Thirakatha, Kerala Care, Palerimanikyam...the transformation was drastic and beaming for a man who created narasimham and prajapathi. Palerimanikyam was simply arrogant, arrogantly excellent! He took untrodden path to create a an offbeat masterpiece. An now comes Pranchiyettan and the Saint. And with this fantastic movie Ranjith has proved a harbinger of good times, of fresh films in Malayalam film industry. This is something truly refreshing to malayalam cinema. The treatment is refreshing novel. The energy that pervades throughout the film is positive and vibrant. A well-crafted satire, heartwarming characterization, splendid dialogues and master acting especially by Mammootty, ably backed by Innocent, Priyamani etc. make this movie an unforgettable experience. The film stands for goodness with a message to tell to all. By the end of the film, the viewer is lifted up to sublime experience of warmth. I was reminded of reading Dickens' Christmas Carol. Good feeling flooding! Jessy Fox is magnificent with his saintly aura dipped in hilarious humanness! Special congrats to Ranjith for that awesome casting! Mammootty has been exceptional in recent times portraying diverse characters with exceptional finesse. Pranchiyettan is totally fresh, and so this is very very special. The film and the role will remain in the hearts of all for a long long time.",rejuvenating vibrant,late i have been fascinated by transformation ranjith as film maker real stuff kayoppu thirakatha kerala care palerimanikyam transformation was drastic beaming man who created narasimham prajapathi palerimanikyam was simply arrogant arrogantly excellent he took untrodden path create offbeat masterpiece now comes pranchiyettan saint with this fantastic movie ranjith has proved harbinger good times fresh films malayalam film industry this is something truly refreshing malayalam cinema treatment is refreshing novel energy that pervades throughout film is positive vibrant well crafted satire heartwarming characterization splendid dialogues master acting especially by mammootty ably backed by innocent priyamani etc make this movie unforgettable experience film stands goodness with message tell all by end film viewer is lifted up sublime experience warmth i was reminded reading dickens christmas carol good feeling flooding jessy fox is magnificent with his saintly aura dipped hilarious humanness special congrats ranjith that awesome casting mammootty has been exceptional recent times portraying diverse characters with exceptional finesse pranchiyettan is totally fresh so this is very very special film role will remain hearts all long long time,0.6696306381790251,0.3725387515710096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,"Satirical, thought provoking & a fun film to watch.","Pranchiyetten and the Saint is a satirical, surreal, thought provoking and a character driven movie that manages to draw us into its story, enjoy and cherish, the comical and eccentric adventures of Pranchiyettan in pursuit of fame. The whole story is narrated by Pranchi to the Saint as reply to his question ""What is it that worries you?"" Eenashu Cherammal Francis or Pranchiyettan or ""Ari Pranchi"" (Mamooty) is a wealthy businessman, who is quite unhappy with the way people call him ""Ari Pranchi"" referring to the business of his ancestors (rice vendors), without respect. He wants to earn respect of the people and his efforts to do so is so hilarious. Later in the film, he comes to the point of literally 'buying' respect. He is not well educated and therefore, obviously, suffers from an inferiority complex. He, in his pursuit for fame, is also used by others for their own profits. He never gets mentioned for anything he does (His company sponsored a ceremony for congratulating the achievements of the Oscar winning Malayali ""Gaffur Chekutty"". He was, quite politely, thrown out of the stage and thus losing his chance to become a well known person). He has a rival, who was his schoolmate (Siddique), to whom he lost his girlfriend (Kushboo) while at school, which leads to another complex he has. He is extremely bothered by certain failures in his personal life. Both the rival and his wife are 'well known' doctors in the city (which really bothers Pranchi a lot).Ranjith(writer & director) is among the few film-makers in Malayalam film industry, who tries to do something unconventional. He has such films like Nandanam, Thirakatha, Paleri Mankiyam to his credit. Ranjith has created such a brilliant tale and narrated it almost flawlessly and quite stylishly that makes the film, a far cry from the usual, mediocre and clichéd stuffs that has been ruling the roost at the box office lately (a few exceptions of course). The humor here is simple and brilliant. Mamooty has breathed life in to Pranchiyettan. He literally lived as Pranchiyettan in every frame. Mamooty has been getting quite a few experimental roles lately (Kuttyshrank, Paleri Manikyam and this film). This is, in my opinion, one of those movies where his excellent acting skills have been really put to use. He has handled comedy so naturally rather than overdoing it like in Thuruppugulan. A few friends of mine, complained about the way he handled 'Thrissur' accent. But I've no such complaints as I was too busy enjoying the film. Priyamani makes a brief entrance as 'Padmasree' an artist, in the story who is another love interest of Pranchi. This part in the movie could've been a tad longer in my opinion, as the exit of the Padmasree from the story, lacked the intended punch (on me. I don't know about others). Master Ganapathy plays Pauli, a rebellious but intelligent kid whom Pranchi meets in the later parts of the film. (I am not going to reveal much about the role). The Saint is played by an Australian theater artist and I liked him. He was much better than the other foreign artists that show up in most other Malayalam films. Innocent plays Menon a close friend of Pranchi who gives the ideas to Pranchi to get famous. Everybody has done a nice job in the film.The movie explores or at least touches superficially on a lot of things, which I noticed and which I don't think I am matured to enough to say. I am talking about humans & human relationships. This is so far the best film I've seen this year. In my opinion it will be future classic.",satirical thought provoking fun film watch,pranchiyetten saint is satirical surreal thought provoking character driven movie that manages draw us into its story enjoy cherish comical eccentric adventures pranchiyettan pursuit fame whole story is narrated by pranchi saint as reply his question what is it that worries you eenashu cherammal francis or pranchiyettan or ari pranchi mamooty is wealthy businessman who is quite unhappy with way people call him ari pranchi referring business his ancestors rice vendors without respect he wants earn respect people his efforts do so is so hilarious later film he comes point literally buying respect he is not well educated therefore obviously suffers inferiority complex he his pursuit fame is also used by others their own profits he never gets mentioned anything he does his company sponsored ceremony congratulating achievements oscar winning malayali gaffur chekutty he was quite politely thrown out stage thus losing his chance become well known person he has rival who was his schoolmate siddique whom he lost his girlfriend kushboo while at school which leads another complex he has he is extremely bothered by certain failures his personal life both rival his wife are well known doctors city which really bothers pranchi lot ranjith writer director is among few film makers malayalam film industry who tries do something unconventional he has such films like nandanam thirakatha paleri mankiyam his credit ranjith has created such brilliant tale narrated it almost flawlessly quite stylishly that makes film far cry usual mediocre clich d stuffs that has been ruling roost at box office lately few exceptions course humor here is simple brilliant mamooty has breathed life pranchiyettan he literally lived as pranchiyettan every frame mamooty has been getting quite few experimental roles lately kuttyshrank paleri manikyam this film this is my opinion one those movies where his excellent acting skills have been really put use he has handled comedy so naturally rather than overdoing it like thuruppugulan few friends mine complained about way he handled thrissur accent but ive no such complaints as i was too busy enjoying film priyamani makes brief entrance as padmasree artist story who is another love interest pranchi this part movie couldve been tad longer my opinion as exit padmasree story lacked intended punch me i dont know about others master ganapathy plays pauli rebellious but intelligent kid whom pranchi meets later parts film i am not going reveal much about role saint is played by australian theater artist i liked him he was much better than other foreign artists that show up most other malayalam films innocent plays menon close friend pranchi who gives ideas pranchi get famous everybody has done nice job film movie explores or at least touches superficially lot things which i noticed which i dont think i am matured enough say i am talking about humans human relationships this is so far best film ive seen this year my opinion it will be future classic,0.5153518123667377,0.16240227434257282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Moving and Refreshing,"Viewers generally go out for the movies to be entertained. Thats exactly what Renjith has managed to do with this wonderful movie. The movie starts off with Mammootty being introduced by some ghosts. That initially made me feel that it would be something like Shyamalan's movies. But I was totally mistaken and taken aback by what followed.The story telling is some thing that one would find remarkable in the movie. The feats of the so called Mammootty character 'Pranji Yettan' is depicted very skillfully and meticulously. He thrives for the respect and recognition that he always wanted. He tries to become a better man but still no one seems to take his seriously. The manages to become a helper of the needy in spite of being a wealthy person. How his friends try to become a well know personality is the crux of the story. The Thrissur slang has been used very cleverly in the movie and manages to chuckle the audience. Though not used very dramatically it stands out as the best feature of the film. Innocent, Tiny Tom, Siddique, Jagathy and Khusboo play their roles to the at most of perfection not to mention how great Mammootty was. I would give it a 8 out of 10 for entertainment.",moving refreshing,viewers generally go out movies be entertained thats exactly what renjith has managed do with this wonderful movie movie starts off with mammootty being introduced by some ghosts that initially made me feel that it would be something like shyamalans movies but i was totally mistaken taken aback by what followed story telling is some thing that one would find remarkable movie feats so called mammootty character pranji yettan is depicted very skillfully meticulously he thrives respect recognition that he always wanted he tries become better man but still no one seems take his seriously manages become helper needy spite being wealthy person how his friends try become well know personality is crux story thrissur slang has been used very cleverly movie manages chuckle audience though not used very dramatically it stands out as best feature film innocent tiny tom siddique jagathy khusboo play their roles at most perfection not mention how great mammootty was i would give it 8 out 10 entertainment,0.5877192982456141,0.34385964912280703,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,A very Impressive movie,"Once in a while along comes a movie that makes your spirits soar and helps you forget the mediocrity that this medium often serves. That is does it without seeking recourse to any manipulative tools, that we are all too familiar with, makes is even more remarkable. It solely depends on unalloyed storytelling skills.Director Ranjith's latest offering Pranchiyettan and the Saint, starring Mammootty, is one such effort where the viewer is drawn into the story to experience the sheer joy of it. This film just tells the story of a rich but uncouth simpleton, C. Francis -- popularly known as Pranchiyettan. As his family has been into rice business, he is also known by a nickname Aripranchi, and this pains him.So, he makes serious efforts to get rid of the nickname -- and his efforts include diversifying into other businesses and supporting worthy charitable causes. But, as fate would have it, the nickname that has troubled him since school days, never leaves him.What works for the narrative of this film is the simple humor, which is continued till the fag end of the film.The film depends heavily on Mammootty's histrionic skills to be convincing and it works. It is this effortless and natural performance that gives Pranchiyettan the lifeblood.Mammootty as an actor has resorted to slapstick comedy to prove his credentials too, but in this film it is quite different -- the middle aged character that he plays here possesses a natural sense of humor and does not require any help in the form of slapstick situations.On the whole, the success of Pranchiyettan and the Saint rests on the shoulders of Mammootty and Ranjith.",very impressive movie,once while along comes movie that makes your spirits soar helps you forget mediocrity that this medium often serves that is does it without seeking recourse any manipulative tools that we are all too familiar with makes is even more remarkable it solely depends unalloyed storytelling skills director ranjiths latest offering pranchiyettan saint starring mammootty is one such effort where viewer is drawn into story experience sheer joy it this film just tells story rich but uncouth simpleton c francis popularly known as pranchiyettan as his family has been into rice business he is also known by nickname aripranchi this pains him so he makes serious efforts get rid nickname his efforts include diversifying into other businesses supporting worthy charitable causes but as fate would have it nickname that has troubled him since school days never leaves him what works narrative this film is simple humor which is continued till fag end film film depends heavily mammoottys histrionic skills be convincing it works it is this effortless natural performance that gives pranchiyettan lifeblood mammootty as actor has resorted slapstick comedy prove his credentials too but this film it is quite different middle aged character that he plays here possesses natural sense humor does not require any help form slapstick situations whole success pranchiyettan saint rests shoulders mammootty ranjith,0.559215167548501,0.21574074074074068,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.49}"

10.0,Pranchiyettan and the saint is a unique mix of satire and comedy,"This is not a film that tells an earth shattering story as such. Rather it's built around several small incidents that make a rich man's miserable life. Pranchiyettan (Mammootty) as he is affectionately referred to by his aides and contemporaries has everything going for him in his life, but lives every moment of it in utter discontentment.Mammootty as Pranchiyettan realizes that the Thrissur dialect (which he delivers to perfection) is not the only thing that would make this character a real challenge for the artist in him. The actor plays Pranchiyettan as if he were born to do it, and the personal details that he adds to his marvelous performance makes it one of the most profound ones in his illustrious career.Ranjith manages a unique mix of satire and comedy in 'Pranchiyettan and the Saint' and it's a tight rope walk indeed for the director to juggle between fantasy and reality. In doing so he brings down heaven as close to earth and opens up a new universe before us where God and man beautifully blend into one. This is a must-watch folks.

7.0,Mammootty mania grabs a meaningful subject to teach us a lot about humanity and goodwill.,"Pranchiyettan And The Saint (2010) : Brief Review -Mammootty mania grabs a meaningful subject to teach us a lot about humanity and goodwill. We always say, 'In the search of Gold, we lost Diamond', or sometimes it's other way around, 'In the seach of gold, we got Diamond'. I don't know i am making the exact sense I want to make or whether i am unable to elaborate the point, so, let's just simplify it. What i mean is, 'In the seach of forceful and undeserving reputation, he (our protagonist) got organic respect and deserving love.' That's it, i can't explain more. Our protagonist Pranchiyettan is a successful businessman who often has talks with an imaginary St. Francis of Assisi. The story deals with how he goes about changing his embarrassing image to making a name for himself using wealth and contacts. Mammootty plays the role like he was into it. Despite the fact that the character is not heavy or intense, it is very light hearted and happy-go-lucky character, he gets into the character without any strong efforts. It just comes naturally and i loved the simplicity of it. Priyamani, Khushbu Sundar, child artist Ganapathi and other supporting cast all are perfect in their roles despite little space available. The film holds a strong parallel line of religious belief and on the other side it keeps teasing you with the two opposite of the protagonist, Positive and Negative. He's damn reckless sometimes, he is little dumb and hesitates to find compatibility but the same man has a kind heart, generous nature and he's always there to help the needed ones. With that Saint part in the climax the film feels moving and heart touching because of the natural use of goodwill and humanity. It doesn't create big drama for it and that's what makes it even better. Ranjith's direction is superb, the humour and comedy he used is simple and effective. Overall, a very good humam drama with lots of fun moments.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",mammootty mania grabs meaningful subject teach us lot about humanity goodwill,pranchiyettan saint 2010 brief review mammootty mania grabs meaningful subject teach us lot about humanity goodwill we always say search gold we lost diamond or sometimes its other way around seach gold we got diamond i dont know i am making exact sense i want make or whether i am unable elaborate point so lets just simplify it what i mean is seach forceful undeserving reputation he our protagonist got organic respect deserving love thats it i cant explain more our protagonist pranchiyettan is successful businessman who often has talks with imaginary st francis assisi story deals with how he goes about changing his embarrassing image making name himself using wealth contacts mammootty plays role like he was into it despite fact that character is not heavy or intense it is very light hearted happy go lucky character he gets into character without any strong efforts it just comes naturally i loved simplicity it priyamani khushbu sundar child artist ganapathi other supporting cast all are perfect their roles despite little space available film holds strong parallel line religious belief other side it keeps teasing you with two opposite protagonist positive negative hes damn reckless sometimes he is little dumb hesitates find compatibility but same man has kind heart generous nature hes always there help needed ones with that saint part climax film feels moving heart touching because natural use goodwill humanity it doesnt create big drama it thats what makes it even better ranjiths direction is superb humour comedy he used is simple effective overall very good humam drama with lots fun moments rating 7 5 10 by,0.5304276043105831,0.24332849774339138,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,Kudos to director Renjith and Mammootty,"This movie is well taken with a excellent message of "" Don't go behind laurels, if you deserve them they will come looking for you"". Every 10 minutes in the movie there is some kind of message to the viewers. Mammootty was so involved in his role and performed exceptionally well, I think this will remain as one of his best movies for the next decade or so. Again there is no words to explain how well Renjith has directed this movie, he has spent time and effort and gave importance to every crew in this ship. If you see the movie you all will understand how each actor and actress is well placed to make this a magnificent movie. Ranjith also has studied Thrissur very well and has taken so much care in portraying exactly how Thrissur natives will behave in their daily life. I wish every director gets to take these kind of movies there by raising our standards.
