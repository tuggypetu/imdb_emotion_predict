1.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, here it is, Adam Sandler's worst movie!","I like comedy when it is funny. I have to admit though, apart from Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore I have never liked Adam Sandler. I often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them.As much as I didn't think much of Little Nicky, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Funny People and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry(generally Anger Management, The Longest Yard, Click and The Waterboy I had mixed feelings on) neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. The trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad.So why did I see Jack and Jill in the first place if I didn't like Sandler? One reason really. Al Pacino. I consider this man a great actor, and this is not just The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman and Carlito's Way as I consider his performance in Godfather Part II one of the all-time great male performances.When I saw the movie on Tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but Pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as I was hearing. This is not just Adam Sandler's worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst I've seen recently.Jack and Jill is a cheap-looking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. Of Sandler's movies, Jack and Jill is perhaps the worst-directed, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. The soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesn't seem dynamic with what's going on on screen.The acting is awful. Adam Sandler is a big part of the film's problem. None of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout. Not only that, Jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of build-ups, and Sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry I had to say.I was hoping that Al Pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of Gigli, another example of a bad film. Alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am I doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. The cameos don't engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. Nicky Swardson fares best, surprising seeing as I don't regard him very highly either.Worse are the script, characters and story. In regards to the script and the humour, Jack and Jill fails utterly. The dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. I get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused.Story-wise, Jack and Jill lacks any kind of structure, it all feels very broken and rushed. As for the characters, they are either annoying, shallow or both, I finished the film not only not caring for them but also forgetting them.All in all, Sandler's worst movie and one of the worst(I think only Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star, a movie I saw out of curiosity with little else to do, was worse) of a very hit-and-miss year. 0/10 Bethany Cox",ladies gentlemen here it is adam sandlers worst movie,i like comedy when it is funny i have admit though apart punch drunk love reign over me spanglish wedding singer 50 first dates happy gilmore i have never liked adam sandler i often find his acting style irritating his characters unlikeable apart five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point them as much as i didnt think much little nicky you dont mess with zohan funny people i now pronounce you chuck larry generally anger management longest yard click waterboy i had mixed feelings neither them are as painful watch as this one trailer was enough make me wish ground had swallowed me up film managed be every bit as bad so why did i see jack jill first place if i didnt like sandler one reason really al pacino i consider this man great actor this is not just godfather dog day afternoon scent woman carlitos way as i consider his performance godfather part ii one all time great male performances when i saw movie tinyurl having inkling it would be bad but pacino would be at least decent my opinion this is as awful as i was hearing this is not just adam sandlers worst film but also one worst year one worst ive seen recently jack jill is cheap looking movie with not much attention slick editing or continuity lighting also manages be dull sandlers movies jack jill is perhaps worst directed because director throughout seemed be rushing through it soundtrack at best is forgettable doesnt seem dynamic with whats going screen acting is awful adam sandler is big part films problem none his characters are likable instead they are very annoying sandlers performance is samey irritating throughout not only that jill is introduced too quickly with severe lack build ups sandler as woman all honesty is not pretty sorry i had say i was hoping that al pacino would elevate just little bit as he was only redeeming quality gigli another example bad film alas he spends entire movie looking bored almost as if what am i doing here performance reads very much him playing himself cameos dont engage either they are not funny fact pretty much nobody seems have sense comic timing just come go nicky swardson fares best surprising seeing as i dont regard him very highly either worse are script characters story regards script humour jack jill fails utterly dialogue is atrocious very immature hackneyed while physical visual humour just left bad taste mouth i get that it was meant be funny not be exactly subtle but poop jokes example got really embarrassing left me more disgusted than amused story wise jack jill lacks any kind structure it all feels very broken rushed as characters they are either annoying shallow or both i finished film not only not caring them but also forgetting them all all sandlers worst movie one worst i think only bucky larson born be star movie i saw out curiosity with little else do was worse very hit miss year 0 10 bethany cox,0.6082421915002559,-0.13331003584229392,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,Sandler's House of Stupid,"Is it me, or are Adam Sandler movies getting stupider with each passing one? Oh sure, Sandler's sense of humor has been pretty dumb from the beginning, sometimes in an enjoyable way. But lately, his movies seem to be reaching for a lower form of humor than I even knew existed. I'm guessing it won't take long until we get a movie comprised of nothing but Sandler sitting on the toilet and belching for 90 minutes straight.But, I'm here to talk about Jack and Jill, a stupefyingly dumb comedy that places Sandler in a dual role as both an uptight ad executive and family man, as well as his loud, obnoxious sister. The movie was a miscalculation from the start. Seeing Sandler dressed in drag and talking in a whiny voice probably would have been pushing it in a three minute sketch back in his Saturday Night Live days. In a 90 minute movie, the performance is excruciating. Was there no one around to stop him and tell him the performance, and the character in general, was just a bad idea? No one to say that it just wasn't funny? Seeing a movie like this makes you want to sit Sandler down, and make him watch his performances in Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish, Funny People, and Reign Over Me to remind him that he is so much better than this.The plot (such as it is) concerns Jill (the sister) coming to visit her brother Jack and his family for Thanksgiving. She's only supposed to be there for a few days, but she extends her vacation time, and winds up staying almost to New Years. During that time, we get a lot of toilet humor (much more than a PG-rated comedy aimed at kids needs), a ton of product placements (How much did Dunkin' Donuts pay to get their brand worked into the plot of the movie? And would it have been better for business if they had just stayed out of the movie all together?), and a lot of celebrity cameos that include Sandler's friends, as well as some big names cashing a paycheck. The cameos in this film include David Spade (in drag, no less), Dana Carvey, Johnny Depp, Regis Philbin, John McEnroe, Shaquille O'Neal, Drew Carey, Christie Brinkley, and Bruce Jenner. Oh, and then there's Al Pacino.Yes, I said Al Pacino. Only he's not making a cameo, he's a main supporting character. He plays a caricature of himself as a raving oddball who speaks gibberish in order to fool people he can speak other languages, and becomes inexplicably attracted to Jill when he happens to meet her at a basketball game. Jill has no interest in Pacino, but Jack's ad agency wants to hire the actor for a Dunkin' Donut campaign, so he tries to bring the two together. When Jill further resists, Jack is forced to dress up as his sister and be seduced by Pacino. But never mind. The important thing is Pacino gets the film's only laughs, because he tackles the material head-on and with full passion. He obviously knows this material is stupid, but he gives such an energetic performance, you sometimes find yourself laughing, even if what he says isn't that funny. Say what you will about his decision to appear in this movie, but he earns every cent of that paycheck when he appears in trash like this.Outside of Pacino's off the wall performance, I can't say I laughed very much at Jack and Jill. The movie's just not that funny. Don't tell that to the guy who was sitting two rows behind me at my screening, though. Every tired pratfall, every loud fart that blasted on the soundtrack, and every knock to the head caused him to erupt in extremely loud fits of laughter, stomping of feet, and slapping his knees. I wanted to ask him what he found so funny about the movie. Most of all, I wanted to be enjoying myself as much as he was. That's obviously the intention of the movie. It wants to make us laugh and forget our problems for 90 minutes or so. That's admirable. But it fails on both counts. My guess as to the reaction of the man sitting behind me? He's been locked away somewhere for a very long time, and has never seen a movie in his life.I won't go so far as to say that Jack and Jill is the worst comedy of the year, as there's much worse out there. But, it's certainly one of the most annoying. This is the kind of movie where the filmmakers started with the idea of Sandler playing brother and sister, and then stopped there, not developing the screenplay, characters, or the jokes. Considering that the initial idea wasn't that hot to start with, maybe they shouldn't have even gone as far as they did.",sandlers house stupid,is it me or are adam sandler movies getting stupider with each passing one oh sure sandlers sense humor has been pretty dumb beginning sometimes enjoyable way but lately his movies seem be reaching lower form humor than i even knew existed im guessing it wont take long until we get movie comprised nothing but sandler sitting toilet belching 90 minutes straight but im here talk about jack jill stupefyingly dumb comedy that places sandler dual role as both uptight ad executive family man as well as his loud obnoxious sister movie was miscalculation start seeing sandler dressed drag talking whiny voice probably would have been pushing it three minute sketch back his saturday night live days 90 minute movie performance is excruciating was there no one around stop him tell him performance character general was just bad idea no one say that it just wasnt funny seeing movie like this makes you want sit sandler down make him watch his performances punch drunk love spanglish funny people reign over me remind him that he is so much better than this plot such as it is concerns jill sister coming visit her brother jack his family thanksgiving shes only supposed be there few days but she extends her vacation time winds up staying almost new years during that time we get lot toilet humor much more than pg rated comedy aimed at kids needs ton product placements how much did dunkin donuts pay get their brand worked into plot movie would it have been better business if they had just stayed out movie all together lot celebrity cameos that include sandlers friends as well as some big names cashing paycheck cameos this film include david spade drag no less dana carvey johnny depp regis philbin john mcenroe shaquille oneal drew carey christie brinkley bruce jenner oh then theres al pacino yes i said al pacino only hes not making cameo hes main supporting character he plays caricature himself as raving oddball who speaks gibberish order fool people he can speak other languages becomes inexplicably attracted jill when he happens meet her at basketball game jill has no interest pacino but jacks ad agency wants hire actor dunkin donut campaign so he tries bring two together when jill further resists jack is forced dress up as his sister be seduced by pacino but never mind important thing is pacino gets films only laughs because he tackles material head with full passion he obviously knows this material is stupid but he gives such energetic performance you sometimes find yourself laughing even if what he says isnt that funny say what you will about his decision appear this movie but he earns every cent that paycheck when he appears trash like this outside pacinos off wall performance i cant say i laughed very much at jack jill movies just not that funny dont tell that guy who was sitting two rows behind me at my screening though every tired pratfall every loud fart that blasted soundtrack every knock head caused him erupt extremely loud fits laughter stomping feet slapping his knees i wanted ask him what he found so funny about movie most all i wanted be enjoying myself as much as he was thats obviously intention movie it wants make us laugh forget our problems 90 minutes or so thats admirable but it fails both counts my guess as reaction man sitting behind me hes been locked away somewhere very long time has never seen movie his life i wont go so far as say that jack jill is worst comedy year as theres much worse out there but its certainly one most annoying this is kind movie where filmmakers started with idea sandler playing brother sister then stopped there not developing screenplay characters or jokes considering that initial idea wasnt that hot start with maybe they shouldnt have even gone as far as they did,0.5508385642135643,0.016059884559884573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,"Sandler put the ""F U"" in 'Failure""","Jack is a highly successful director of television commercials. For Thanksgiving his outlandish twin sister Jill (Sandler, again) comes to visit. Despite efforts to get her to leave, matters get complicated when Jill catches the eye of famed actor Al Pacino, whom Jack needs to convince to star in a commercial I guess. What Jack and Jill is really all about is Sandler's effort to exact revenge against moviegoers.Drag is not a good look for Sandler, and it should be no surprise that he is unfunny as a woman. The jokes featured in Jack and Jill have the range of an infant golfer. Committing to a viewing of Jack and Jill is almost a misogynist effort. All manners of humiliation beset Jill. She takes damage to the head, gets groped, has her skirt looked up, and if the sound is telling she may even have her bowels destroyed. Pure class, that Adam Sandler.So not only is Jack and Jill an offensive PG comedy, it's structurally broken. Jill appears on the scene way too fast, in under five minutes. No build up to her arrival, no clever use of music from The Cars —from what I can gather Sandler's favorite band—for her reveal. Jill also has a tendency to run off into the woods, which at first is random. Lastly for what is billed as a holiday movie, Chanukah is glossed over through a montage and I'm not even sure how Thanksgiving lasted as long as a dinner scene.It's obvious that Pacino has no business being in this film, but what's really at stake are the remains of Sandler's reputation. If Sandler ever wonders why he can't get an Oscar nomination, all he has to do is look back at the selfish decisions he has made. Jack and Jill is not a script, or even a concept, that deserves a read. It's like a fake movie found within Funny People that was replaced with the more imaginative ""Merman"". Yet, Sandler turned it into a movie that will surely pay him upfront over $20 million. The awesome mess that is Jack and Jill is so wrought with issues that this reviewer can only stand to offer some bullet points for the lesser offenders. Katie Holmes is in this movie. David Spade is a better woman than Sandler. Jack has an adopted son whose entire bit is taping found objects onto his body. The character of Al Pacino has a line that inadvertently summarizes Jack and Jill. After watching his cheesy song and dance number in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial, Pacino turns to Jack and says, ""This needs to be burned.""",sandler put f u failure,jack is highly successful director television commercials thanksgiving his outlandish twin sister jill sandler again comes visit despite efforts get her leave matters get complicated when jill catches eye famed actor al pacino whom jack needs convince star commercial i guess what jack jill is really all about is sandlers effort exact revenge against moviegoers drag is not good look sandler it should be no surprise that he is unfunny as woman jokes featured jack jill have range infant golfer committing viewing jack jill is almost misogynist effort all manners humiliation beset jill she takes damage head gets groped has her skirt looked up if sound is telling she may even have her bowels destroyed pure class that adam sandler so not only is jack jill offensive pg comedy its structurally broken jill appears scene way too fast under five minutes no build up her arrival no clever use music cars what i can gather sandlers favorite band her reveal jill also has tendency run off into woods which at first is random lastly what is billed as holiday movie chanukah is glossed over through montage im not even sure how thanksgiving lasted as long as dinner scene its obvious that pacino has no business being this film but whats really at stake are remains sandlers reputation if sandler ever wonders why he cant get oscar nomination all he has do is look back at selfish decisions he has made jack jill is not script or even concept that deserves read its like fake movie found within funny people that was replaced with more imaginative merman yet sandler turned it into movie that will surely pay him upfront over 20 million awesome mess that is jack jill is so wrought with issues that this reviewer can only stand offer some bullet points lesser offenders katie holmes is this movie david spade is better woman than sandler jack has adopted son whose entire bit is taping found objects onto his body character al pacino has line that inadvertently summarizes jack jill after watching his cheesy song dance number dunkin donuts commercial pacino turns jack says this needs be burned,0.5643768768768769,0.07673745173745174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,Terrible. The trailer is the highlights.,"The standard that Adam Sandler movies has set is pretty low, but even with such low expectations going to the movie, the movie still felt terrible. The gag is twins and ignoring that healthy identical twins with different genders is impossible, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman. And, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman a lot, ridiculously lot and so much so, that Jack Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are just supporting actors to the almighty squawking of Jill Adam Sandler.We could say this is just Adam Sandler up to his usual antics but Jill Adam Sandler hogs up the screen time and nothing about her really makes any sort of logical sense. There is Al Pacino as himself who falls for Jill, a possibility that the writers explain away as madness or nervous breakdown of Al Pacino. Then, there is Jill who is loved by the kids and Jack's wife Erin (played by Katie Holmes) for reasons that Jill doesn't portray on screen and we are never shown, all we are shown is the mean and manipulative Jill. The Jill that Adam Sandler portrays is his own immature rendition of a woman, filled with toilet humor and displays of uncharacteristic skills and strength as positive attributes. Jill is portrayed uninteresting and vacuous though written differently, and that being the center of the movie makes the movie uninteresting and tiresome.The movie would have been an acceptable Sandler movie if Jill had been played by a woman who could actually portray a big heart. The previous Sandler movies were enjoyable movies, but Jack and Jill is a real stinker, barely watchable. The only thing I found interesting was the background opulence of everyone around, thrown around so casually that it really feels like the big guys involved in the movie have severely lost touch with their audience and given way to sloth where they think anything they do is magical. Avoid the movie.",terrible trailer is highlights,standard that adam sandler movies has set is pretty low but even with such low expectations going movie movie still felt terrible gag is twins ignoring that healthy identical twins with different genders is impossible we get see adam sandler dress up as woman we get see adam sandler dress up as woman lot ridiculously lot so much so that jack adam sandler rest cast are just supporting actors almighty squawking jill adam sandler we could say this is just adam sandler up his usual antics but jill adam sandler hogs up screen time nothing about her really makes any sort logical sense there is al pacino as himself who falls jill possibility that writers explain away as madness or nervous breakdown al pacino then there is jill who is loved by kids jacks wife erin played by katie holmes reasons that jill doesnt portray screen we are never shown all we are shown is mean manipulative jill jill that adam sandler portrays is his own immature rendition woman filled with toilet humor displays uncharacteristic skills strength as positive attributes jill is portrayed uninteresting vacuous though written differently that being center movie makes movie uninteresting tiresome movie would have been acceptable sandler movie if jill had been played by woman who could actually portray big heart previous sandler movies were enjoyable movies but jack jill is real stinker barely watchable only thing i found interesting was background opulence everyone around thrown around so casually that it really feels like big guys involved movie have severely lost touch with their audience given way sloth where they think anything they do is magical avoid movie,0.5301699426699426,-0.007708845208845207,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,Deserves to be Erased from Film History,"I will start by saying that I have enjoyed many Adam Sandler movies and have found him to be a generally funny guy when I've seen him interviewed and when he was on Saturday Night Live.I laughed gleefully through Anger Management, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison, 50 First Dates, and Happy Gilmore. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! I was brought to tears in Sandler's emotional portrayal in Reign Over Me.I have great respect for the man as a comedian and actor. But Jack and Jill is abysmal. The ""jokes"" are not only bizarrely misplaced - THEY ARE NOT FUNNY. I did not hear a single laugh, not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. In fact, almost 1/3 of them walked out before it was over. Those who stayed, openly derided the flick as we all exited the theater in utter disgust and sadness.I don't know why Al Pacino was in this movie, his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie. Nick Swardson and Tim Meadows are way too funny to be in such a disaster. Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It.This movie is not a flop, its not an ""oops"", its not a mistake - it's a career ending pile of trash. A career ender that started with Sandler's god awful ""Grown Ups"" and climaxes with this revolting hunk of garbage.Sorry Adam, it's over.",deserves be erased film history,i will start by saying that i have enjoyed many adam sandler movies have found him be generally funny guy when ive seen him interviewed when he was saturday night live i laughed gleefully through anger management mr deeds billy madison 50 first dates happy gilmore funny people just go with it were awesome movies i was brought tears sandlers emotional portrayal reign over me i have great respect man as comedian actor but jack jill is abysmal jokes are not only bizarrely misplaced they are not funny i did not hear single laugh not even slight giggle any audience member theater fact almost 1 3 them walked out before it was over those who stayed openly derided flick as we all exited theater utter disgust sadness i dont know why al pacino was this movie his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point do this movie nick swardson tim meadows are way too funny be such disaster especially given swardsons stellar performance just go with it this movie is not flop its not oops its not mistake its career ending pile trash career ender that started with sandlers god awful grown ups climaxes with this revolting hunk garbage sorry adam its over,0.6058673469387754,0.10440244279529994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.18}"
,Officially the worst film of the year.,"What in god's name has made the great Al Pacino THIS desperate? Now, no one on this planet would ever go into an Adam Sandler film expecting something brilliant, but generally, at worst, his films are stupidly entertaining. However, his latest film, ""Jack and Jill"" is so astoundingly horrible, I am not even sure how to articulate how truly bad it is in a way I will capture the remorse one will feel for having spent money to see it.I went to the premiere, so all it cost me was (a thankfully short) ninety-three minutes.This time around, Adam Sandler plays a commercial producer whose twin sister, also played by Sandler, comes to visit and...and... You know, I am not even going to waste time describing the plot of this film as it's not ever important enough to bother mention, but it involves cameos by all sorts of (evidently desperate) people from Sandler's impressive rolodex...including Al Pacino.Yep, Sandler's rolodex is the only impressive thing to note about this film.If you have seen the trailer, you have seen any and all even remotely noteworthy moments from this otherwise act of tedium. It is not funny, it is not clever, it is not even so bad, it's tolerable. Every single thing about this film is beyond grating.Seriously. Up until now, the year's worst film was ""Red Riding Hood."" This film makes that one seem like an artistic stroke of genius. I was uncomfortable just watching it as I wondered what every single why every single person on screen did in their lives to agree to be a part of this...train wreck.

1.0,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","I saw a pre-screening of this film the night before it opened to wide release. I knew going in that it was not going to be an excellent film. But, I thought, there would be a few laughs and some funny moments in it. I was terribly mistaken. Adam Sandler was terrible as 'Jill'. We were supposed to believe that the character was actually a woman. All I saw was Adam Sandler in a dress with a stupid voice.The character of Jack is unlikeable and mean, almost to the point where you wonder how he has any family or friends.Katie Holmes, which I usually enjoy watching in films, was a non entity in it. Her character was one dimensional and boring. She might as well have not been there at all.Al Pacino, why did you do this movie? He is an amazing actor with amazing credits to his name. But this? Really?The jokes were pointless and not funny. I'm really tired of 'fart' jokes. Been there, done that. Not funny. The only funny part of the film was Jack's son, he had a couple of funny lines.

2.0,How Exactly Does Sandler's Mind Work?,"How exactly does Adam Sandler's mind work? Has he deluded himself into believing his ideas are actually funny? I'm forced to ask these questions given the disastrous results of most of his recent creative projects. These would include ""The House Bunny,"" ""Grown Ups,"" ""Just Go with It,"" ""Zookeeper,"" ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,"" and now ""Jack and Jill,"" in which Sandler is not only the co-writer and co-producer but also does double duty as the title characters, who are fraternal twins. Imagine the work that must go into making this; Sandler had to be put into makeup for the female role, do all scenes with that character, then do all of the scenes with the male character, and then both versions of himself had to be digitally composited into the shots. In both instances, he had to react to a person who wasn't actually there.But what does all this effort count for in something this unendurably bad? If you can visualize the experience of listening to fingernails on a chalkboard, that's pretty much what watching this movie is like. It's a grating, strained, hopelessly unfunny comedy. It's being geared towards families, and yet every scene shows no indication that it was geared for any potential audience – with the possible exception of die-hard Sandler fans, who are truly devoted if they think seeing this will be worth the time and money. Its basically sound premise is ruined by the decision to have Sandler play both lead roles; as a woman, he could not be less convincing even if he had a neon sign over his head rhythmically blinking, ""I'm really a man!"" His proportions are all wrong. He looks grotesque.The Jill character is shrill, offensive, and annoying. This is exactly why Jack, a successfully Los Angeles commercial producer, dreads having her visit every year for Thanksgiving. She typically stays for just one weekend, which Jack has learned to grin and bear. But this year is different; since their mother died, Jill has no family left in the Bronx, and she now wants to stay with her brother and his family all the way through Hanukah, perhaps even through New Years. Jack is, of course, vehemently opposed to this idea. The same cannot be said of his wife, a perpetual go-between named Erin (Katie Holmes), and their children, Gary and Sofia (Rohan Chand and Elodie Tougne). They like Jill so much, you can't help but wonder if all three of them are either in denial or insane. Perhaps it's a little bit of both. Take Gary, the adopted Indian boy; he has a strange compulsion to tape things to his body, including salt shakers, cooked lobsters, and living birds.In a jaw-dropping subplot, Jack seeks out Al Pacino in the hope that he will endorse a new line of Dunkin' Donuts coffee products. Yes, he finds the Oscar-winning actor, who plays a caricature of himself, but that isn't the joke; Pacino falls head-over-heels in love with Jill, and spends the rest of the film trying to woo her. All eventually leads to him performing a rap solo and dance number. Let me reiterate that this movie features Al Pacino. You know, the ""Godfather"" trilogy? ""Dog Day Afternoon""? ""Scarface""? ""Scent of a Woman""? ""Serpico""? ""...And Justice for All""? ""Author, Author""? The astounding reality that he accepted the offer to be in this movie is second only to the considerable work he puts into his role. My God, he actually took this seriously.Apart from Pacino, we're treated to a host of other cameo appearances. Some are understandable, like Dana Carvey, Norm MacDonald, The Sham-Wow Guy, and David Spade (who, incidentally, also appears in drag). Others are just as unbelievable as Pacino. These would include Regis Philbin, Shaquille O'Neal, and Drew Carrey. Topping the list is Johnny Depp. Yes, Johnny Depp appears in this movie, too. At this point, he no longer has to be ashamed by his years on ""21 Jump Street."" Even though his screen time adds up to less than two minutes, this will be a hard one to live down.The film is bookended by testimonials given by real life identical twins, who bounce biting remarks off each other before professing their love for one another. Did the filmmakers conveniently forget that the main characters are not identical twins, but fraternal, since one is male and the other is female? Never mind. It's more than amazing to me that movies like ""Jack and Jill"" get made. It's actually kind of disturbing. Movies like this are comedic dead zones that play to the lowest common denominator in a desperate attempt for laughs. In the course of this movie, Jill will do all manner of broad slapstick routines, including crushing a horse, getting into a barroom brawl with a rival woman (played by a man), and repeatedly whack an elderly Mexican woman (again, played by a man) in the head. And yes, she will inevitably go to the bathroom with the runs, and we will have to listen as the sounds of explosive diarrhea fill the theater.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",how exactly does sandlers mind work,how exactly does adam sandlers mind work has he deluded himself into believing his ideas are actually funny im forced ask these questions given disastrous results most his recent creative projects these would include house bunny grown ups just go with it zookeeper bucky larson born be star now jack jill which sandler is not only co writer co producer but also does double duty as title characters who are fraternal twins imagine work that must go into making this sandler had be put into makeup female role do all scenes with that character then do all scenes with male character then both versions himself had be digitally composited into shots both instances he had react person who wasnt actually there but what does all this effort count something this unendurably bad if you can visualize experience listening fingernails chalkboard thats pretty much what watching this movie is like its grating strained hopelessly unfunny comedy its being geared towards families yet every scene shows no indication that it was geared any potential audience with possible exception die hard sandler fans who are truly devoted if they think seeing this will be worth time money its basically sound premise is ruined by decision have sandler play both lead roles as woman he could not be less convincing even if he had neon sign over his head rhythmically blinking im really man his proportions are all wrong he looks grotesque jill character is shrill offensive annoying this is exactly why jack successfully los angeles commercial producer dreads having her visit every year thanksgiving she typically stays just one weekend which jack has learned grin bear but this year is different since their mother died jill has no family left bronx she now wants stay with her brother his family all way through hanukah perhaps even through new years jack is course vehemently opposed this idea same cannot be said his wife perpetual go between named erin katie holmes their children gary sofia rohan chand elodie tougne they like jill so much you cant help but wonder if all three them are either denial or insane perhaps its little bit both take gary adopted indian boy he has strange compulsion tape things his body including salt shakers cooked lobsters living birds jaw dropping subplot jack seeks out al pacino hope that he will endorse new line dunkin donuts coffee products yes he finds oscar winning actor who plays caricature himself but that isnt joke pacino falls head over heels love with jill spends rest film trying woo her all eventually leads him performing rap solo dance number let me reiterate that this movie features al pacino you know godfather trilogy dog day afternoon scarface scent woman serpico justice all author author astounding reality that he accepted offer be this movie is second only considerable work he puts into his role my god he actually took this seriously apart pacino were treated host other cameo appearances some are understandable like dana carvey norm macdonald sham wow guy david spade who incidentally also appears drag others are just as unbelievable as pacino these would include regis philbin shaquille oneal drew carrey topping list is johnny depp yes johnny depp appears this movie too at this point he no longer has be ashamed by his years 21 jump street even though his screen time adds up less than two minutes this will be hard one live down film is bookended by testimonials given by real life identical twins who bounce biting remarks off each other before professing their love one another did filmmakers conveniently forget that main characters are not identical twins but fraternal since one is male other is female never mind its more than amazing me that movies like jack jill get made its actually kind disturbing movies like this are comedic dead zones that play lowest common denominator desperate attempt laughs course this movie jill will do all manner broad slapstick routines including crushing horse getting into barroom brawl with rival woman played by man repeatedly whack elderly mexican woman again played by man head yes she will inevitably go bathroom with runs we will have listen as sounds explosive diarrhea fill theater chris pandolfi www atatheaternearyou net,0.48921493415164297,0.012070067766270306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"

1.0,Talk About A Drag!,"Inevitably, most popular comedians at some point in their careers cross-dress for a laugh. Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Tyler Perry, and Martin Lawrence have donned women's apparel and kept audiences in stitches with their audacious antics. ""Little Nicky"" star Adam Sandler has finally followed their footsteps, but his antics in a dress, wig, hose, and heels are nothing but a drag. In his latest and lackluster comedy, ""Big Daddy"" director Dennis Dugan's ""Jack and Jill,"" Sandler plays identical Jewish brother and sister Jack Sadelstein and Jill Sadelstein. Jack is a married, well-to-do advertising executive who produces television commercials, while Jill is his passive-aggressive spinster sister who still lives alone in the Bronx. She embarks on her annual Thanksgiving visit to Los Angeles, and Jack counts the hours down to her departure. Predictably, before his obnoxious sister leaves, Jill turns Jack's life head-over-heels. Sadly, Dugan and Emmy nominated scribe Steve Koren, with Sandler contributing, have contrived the least offensive but also the least hilarious Sandler comedy. This lowest-common-denominator farce boasts the usual bowel humor. The adolescent counterparts of our hero and heroine blow bubbles in the bathtub. No, those bubbles have nothing to do with soapy Mr. Bubble. So skeletal is the plot in ""Jack and Jill"" that this farce yields few laughs.You might even say Sandler is suffering from a humor tumor. Indeed, the best things about ""Jack and Jill"" have nothing to do with Sandler's cross-dressing exploits. The funniest parts are the pre-credit and post-credit scenes of actual twins talking about themselves. These scenes are nothing short of brilliant. Vaguely, this recalls a similar story strategy in the Rob Reiner movie ""When Harry Met Sally."" Aside from these scenes which have no narrative linkage to the plot, the only other notable thing about ""Jack and Jill"" is Al Pacino. Clearly, Pacino must have wanted to get his funny bone on because he has a field day not only playing himself as a cantankerous actor but also stealing the show from Sandler. As usual, all of Sandler's ""Saturday Night Live"" collaborators--David Spade and Nick Swardson--as well as friends turn up in bit parts, even ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" superstar Johnny Depp puts in a cameo. Unfortunately, ""Jack and Jill"" never conjures up the frantic hilarity of earlier Sandler sagas such as ""Big Daddy,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" and ""The Waterboy."" The predicament Jack contends with in ""Jack and Jill"" isn't so much his sister's annual visit but his most prosperous client's outrageous demand. Dunkin' Donuts has singled out a specific celebrity for their next commercial. Nothing about the product placement in ""Jack and Jill"" is remotely subtle. The company wants ""Godfather"" actor Al Pacino to pitch their latest coffee flavor, the 'Dunkaccino.' If you aren't rolling your eyes up in agony at this plot, ""Jack and Jill"" may be your kind of movie. If he cannot land Pacino, Jack stands to lose the Dunkin' account. No sooner has Jill arrived than Pacino sets out to court her. He spots her at a Lakers' basketball game that Johnny Depp attends. He sends her a hot dog with his name and number on it. Initially, Jill isn't too sure about Pacino, but they date. Most of the humor in ""Jack and Jill"" is the mild, amusing stuff that might have alienated audiences back in the 1950s. Remember, this is a kiddie friendly PG-rated Sandler epic so nothing really obnoxious happens and the happily-ever-after ending is nothing short of schmaltzy. Meantime, Dugan and company throw in a subplot about a lovable Hispanic gardener (Mexican comic Eugenio Derbez) who is always kidding everybody, including Jill. He has his eyes on Jill, too. An infatuated Pacino doesn't throw in the towel easily. The biggest surprise is when Jack decides to masquerade as Jill to land Pacino. This is about the time that our hero realizes that his heart is in his wallet and he changes course.Al Pacino skewers himself with glee. During a Broadway performance of Shakespeare, Pacino hears a cell phone ringing and suffers a meltdown. Later, during another performance, he discovers that the cell phone ringing is his own! While he is dating Jill, Pacino talks about an opportunity to play Don Quixote. The pay-off scene has Pacino dressed as Quixote tilting with a ceiling fan. Pacino is genuinely funny because he isn't trying to be funny. The same cannot be said for Sandler. His farcical female impersonation act falls flat. He plays Jill as if he were in an amateur talent act. It doesn't help matters that both twins are rather colorless as characters. Meanwhile, Pacino isn't the only celebrity in sight. Indeed, John McEnroe, David Spade, Shaquille O'Neal, Drew Carey, Christie Brinkley, Michael Irvin, Regis Philbin, Dana Carvey, and even ""Subway Sandwich"" pitchman Jared Fogle participate in this pabulum. None of these stars can salvage this silly, shallow, second-rate slapstick that relies on hopeless stereotypes and obvious pratfalls. The ending with Pacino and Jack watching the ""Godfather"" Dunkin' commercial is the best thing about ""Jack and Jill."" After Pacino watches the commercial, he tells Jack that nobody can see it. Pacino might well have been talking about ""Jack and Jill.""

1.0,"Loud, stupid and flatulent.","It seems that Adam Sandler thinks he is Ben Stiller, having enough money and ego to put any kind of crap on film and call it a movie. And somewhere there is a thinking that dressing over-the-top in drag is funny. Jack Sadelstein(Sandler)is a successful advertising man that is trying to wrangle Al Pacino into doing a Dunkin Donuts commercial. It would seem that a lot of this movie's budget came from the over-kill of placement and mention of products. The mild mannered Jack is about to have his world turned upside down when his twin sister Jill(Sandler)arrives for the Thanksgiving holiday. Jack and Jill of course are as different as night and day personality wise; but the physical resemblance can't be ignored. The girl from the Bronx just doesn't feel happy in sunny California, so Jack's attractive wife(Katie Holmes)recommends dating. The landscaper Felipe(Eugenio Derbez)finds chemistry with Jill. But somehow Jill ends up being used as bait to lure actor Al Pacino into doing Jack's commercial. Hard to believe, Pacino actually wants Jill...and wants her to the point of obsession. This movie is full of crude humor that doesn't seem to come across funny. Joke after joke falling flat.

1.0,"Jill is, perhaps, one of the easiest characters to hate that I've ever seen in a film.","Before I get to the review, I want to talk a bit about twins. While the film is about fraternal twins (all boy/girl twins are fraternal), so many of the jokes are about identical twins and how they think and act and look alike. Fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than any brother and sister....so a lot of the act alike, think alike, feel alike jokes in the film are wrong and the only way this COULD work was if either Jack or Jill underwent sexual reassigment surgery and both were born the same gender. So, for this film, it SHOULD have been about twin boys...identical ones.Adam Sandler plays both Jack and his fraternal twin, Jill. Jill comes for a visit and is about as welcome and pleasant as Ebola. To say she is incredibly annoying is right on the mark! And, not surprisingly, Jack is annoyed by her and can't wait until this visit is complete. The audience feels pretty much the same about Jill! All the scatological jokes involving this character didn't help any! So does this film work? Good grief, no! The film is currently #38 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and the film has set a record for most Razzie awards. This is because Adam Sandler was able to do something unprecidented...he won for Worst Actor AND Worst Actress!! In addition, it took home Razzies for Worst Picture and took home a total of 9 of these trophies!I think the reason it got so many Razzies and is rated so low is due to two things. First, the annoyance factor...Jill is so annoying and easy to hate that it's really hard to watch the film. Second, in recent years, Sandler has been in career freefall due to some very bad choices and it's become fashionable to hate his films. But is it among the worst movies I've ever seen? Not even close. An Ed Wood, Al Adamson or Willaim Grefe film would be much worse. But in the case of these filmmakers, they spent almost nothing to make a crap film...and Columbia spent a staggering $79,000,000 to make this crap! That's enough money to make an entire list of bad films!! So, while I hardly think it's among the worst films I've seen, it is, dollar for dollar, the worst...and it's a film that is completely brainless and annoying from start to finish.By the way, a couple things saddened me about this film. I find it hard to believe that Al Pacino would appear in such an awful mess and playing a man who is infatuated with Jill AND I was annoyed to hear one of my favorite songs in the movie.

1.0,Jill comes to stay for the holidays. Hilarity doesn't ensue.,"In Jack And Jill, a successful advertising executive (Played by Adam Sandler) is annoyed because his obnoxious twin sister (Also played by Adam Sandler) is coming to stay for the holidays and a lot of trouble happens when she arrives. In terms of plot, that's pretty much it. This film did something very striking at the Golden Raspberry Awards. Despite 2011 being a truly awful year for movies, none of those other stinkers got anything. This film won every single award and it really deserves it. Clearly having learned nothing from Grown Ups, Adam Sandler plays the twins giving: The Worst performance I have Ever seen from Any actor in Any movie Ever and produces and co-writes Jack And Jill, a disturbing, excruciatingly unfunny, stratospherically inept and utterly horrifying comedy catastrophe that's more painful to watch than funny. The fact that this was even made and that anyone involved still finds work makes me question my faith in humanity. I'm not even going to talk about the positives since there are absolutely none.This is one of those thankfully rare films which has nothing going for it whatsoever. There are no funny moments. I don't mean that I chuckled once or twice, I mean there isn't one solitary funny moment. The acting, especially from the inexplicably popular Adam Sandler playing a boring, unlikable guy and a Bella Swan/Jar Jar Binks hybrid, is abysmal. The direction is rushed and unimaginative. The script uses every single dire joke in the fire joke book and is not only horrifically unfunny and to be perfectly honest, deeply boring since nothing much happens but it's also mean spirited and depressing. What's most outrageous of all is that they actually dare to drag Al Pacino into it. He plays himself and falls in love with Jill. It's worse than it sounds. There are no genuine defenses. There are no rays of sunshine. There are no positives. This is not a comedy. As for one achievement, it is impressive that everyone involved went ahead without realizing that they were making a surreal, harrowing, hideous cinematic nightmare which would make David Lynch green with envy and thinking what they were making was actually a comedy. And it has the worst trailer ever too.0/10",jill comes stay holidays hilarity doesnt ensue,jack jill successful advertising executive played by adam sandler is annoyed because his obnoxious twin sister also played by adam sandler is coming stay holidays lot trouble happens when she arrives terms plot thats pretty much it this film did something very striking at golden raspberry awards despite 2011 being truly awful year movies none those other stinkers got anything this film won every single award it really deserves it clearly having learned nothing grown ups adam sandler plays twins giving worst performance i have ever seen any actor any movie ever produces co writes jack jill disturbing excruciatingly unfunny stratospherically inept utterly horrifying comedy catastrophe thats more painful watch than funny fact that this was even made that anyone involved still finds work makes me question my faith humanity im not even going talk about positives since there are absolutely none this is one those thankfully rare films which has nothing going it whatsoever there are no funny moments i dont mean that i chuckled once or twice i mean there isnt one solitary funny moment acting especially inexplicably popular adam sandler playing boring unlikable guy bella swan jar jar binks hybrid is abysmal direction is rushed unimaginative script uses every single dire joke fire joke book is not only horrifically unfunny be perfectly honest deeply boring since nothing much happens but its also mean spirited depressing whats most outrageous all is that they actually dare drag al pacino into it he plays himself falls love with jill its worse than it sounds there are no genuine defenses there are no rays sunshine there are no positives this is not comedy as one achievement it is impressive that everyone involved went ahead without realizing that they were making surreal harrowing hideous cinematic nightmare which would make david lynch green with envy thinking what they were making was actually comedy it has worst trailer ever too 0 10,0.6585762876579204,-0.07204810495626823,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,"A Robot's Analysis of ""Jack & Jill""","Hello, I am Bloop the robot, and today I will be reviewing Adam Sandler's latest raping of comedy called ""Jack & Jill."" Made by Happy Madison productions, which would be much more accurate if called . . .Un-happy Madison productions.So the movie starts off with lots of video clips of twins. Twins making fun of one another. Then we are introduced to Adam Sandler and Adam Sandler playing a woman who looks nothing like Adam Sandler, but looks more like Adam Sandler in drag.The Adam Sandler in drag was referred to as Jill in the movie, and the Adam Sandler playing a man was named Jack. Just like the children's books. Isn't that funny? But Jack and Jill never go up the hill to fetch a pale of water. Therefore it is an inaccurate portrayal of Jack and Jill.Instead, the movie goes downhill from this point. Much like the careers of everyone involved in this movie. Including Al Pacino, but I will get to that later. That was a teaser.So Jill comes to visit Jack for Thanksgiving. But Jack is very angry because he doesn't like Jill, and neither does the audience.Even though Jill is only supposed to visit for 4 days, she overstays her welcome much like the movie overstays its welcome after the first minute. It is terrible.Then, one day Jack goes into the office and he is told he has to make a commercial for Dunkin Donuts. And he has to cast Al Pacino. And the commercial is specifically about Dunk-a-cinos, which rhymes with Al Pacino's last name. Very funny.Because Jill admits to not knowing how to use technology, like robots, Jack creates a human dating Website profile for his horribly disgusting and strangely manly sister. Logically, because she is undesirable in every way, she is not contacted by a single man. But then Jack comes and feels bad and creates a profile on Craigslist in which he is misleading because he calls Jill a hot, crazy, masseuse with knock out looks because she knocked herself out with the wheel on the Price Is Right, but not the old Price is Right hosted by Bob Barker who was in Happy Gilmore, but the Price is Right hosted by Drew Carey, but not the fat and funny Drew Carey because this is the insanely skinny and sickly Drew Carey.So then a lot of guys contact Jill because they think she is hot and based off of this fake description, even though it is linked back to her dating profile featuring a real picture of her eating some kind of sandwich. And through a careful human female selection process, she chooses to go on a date with a guy named Funbucket, who is neither Fun, nor a bucket.Then Jill comes home crying from her date with Funbucket, and Jack is guilt tripped into feeling bad for her, and realizes that she has feelings. Stupid worthless human feelings. At this point, Jack's boss tells him to go to a Laker's Game because Al Pacino will be there. How did he know that? It is a comedy so that is irrelevant.At the Laker's human basketball game, Al Pacino sits next to Johnny Depp who apparently was bored that day and Adam Sandler said, ""Hey Johnny Depp, are you doing anything? And if not, please be in my stupid movie."" Then Jack talked to Al Pacino, but Al Pacino likes Jill instead, even though we've already established that Adam Sandler is playing both of the main characters. Very funny.This is where the complex romance comes into the picture, where Al Pacino stalks Jill, but Jill does not like Al Pacino eve though he is rich . . . and Al Pacino. She is stupid. Just like this movie.Sadly, I am only 30 minutes into this movie, so I will summarize the movie in short sentences: Overt racism of Jews, Mexicans, Black People, and 10 year old Indian children.Jokes about poop, farts, diarrhea, and eating bad Mexican food.Cameo appearances by Norm MacDonald, Dana Carvey, Shaquille O'Neil, and the Shamwow guy.We definitely weren't """"Wowed,"" but this movie definitely was a sham. That is a pun.In conclusion, ""Jack and Jill"" is not a comedy but rather a tragedy. It was not even funny and did not have enough robots. It was terrible.*This review is taken from the YouTube Channel called RantingRobots*",robots analysis jack jill,hello i am bloop robot today i will be reviewing adam sandlers latest raping comedy called jack jill made by happy madison productions which would be much more accurate if called un happy madison productions so movie starts off with lots video clips twins twins making fun one another then we are introduced adam sandler adam sandler playing woman who looks nothing like adam sandler but looks more like adam sandler drag adam sandler drag was referred as jill movie adam sandler playing man was named jack just like childrens books isnt that funny but jack jill never go up hill fetch pale water therefore it is inaccurate portrayal jack jill instead movie goes downhill this point much like careers everyone involved this movie including al pacino but i will get that later that was teaser so jill comes visit jack thanksgiving but jack is very angry because he doesnt like jill neither does audience even though jill is only supposed visit 4 days she overstays her welcome much like movie overstays its welcome after first minute it is terrible then one day jack goes into office he is told he has make commercial dunkin donuts he has cast al pacino commercial is specifically about dunk cinos which rhymes with al pacinos last name very funny because jill admits not knowing how use technology like robots jack creates human dating website profile his horribly disgusting strangely manly sister logically because she is undesirable every way she is not contacted by single man but then jack comes feels bad creates profile craigslist which he is misleading because he calls jill hot crazy masseuse with knock out looks because she knocked herself out with wheel price is right but not old price is right hosted by bob barker who was happy gilmore but price is right hosted by drew carey but not fat funny drew carey because this is insanely skinny sickly drew carey so then lot guys contact jill because they think she is hot based off this fake description even though it is linked back her dating profile featuring real picture her eating some kind sandwich through careful human female selection process she chooses go date with guy named funbucket who is neither fun nor bucket then jill comes home crying her date with funbucket jack is guilt tripped into feeling bad her realizes that she has feelings stupid worthless human feelings at this point jacks boss tells him go lakers game because al pacino will be there how did he know that it is comedy so that is irrelevant at lakers human basketball game al pacino sits next johnny depp who apparently was bored that day adam sandler said hey johnny depp are you doing anything if not please be my stupid movie then jack talked al pacino but al pacino likes jill instead even though weve already established that adam sandler is playing both main characters very funny this is where complex romance comes into picture where al pacino stalks jill but jill does not like al pacino eve though he is rich al pacino she is stupid just like this movie sadly i am only 30 minutes into this movie so i will summarize movie short sentences overt racism jews mexicans black people 10 year old indian children jokes about poop farts diarrhea eating bad mexican food cameo appearances by norm macdonald dana carvey shaquille oneil shamwow guy we definitely werent wowed but this movie definitely was sham that is pun conclusion jack jill is not comedy but rather tragedy it was not even funny did not have enough robots it was terrible this review is taken youtube channel called rantingrobots,0.5616063893911994,-0.04384267631103073,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.31}"

There was no plot to this movie at all, and i hope the terrible director Dennis Dugan doesn't make anymore sequels to this god awful mess. Then later in the movie you have Al Pacino acting like a goofball, and Katie Holmes acts too unlike the way she acts in her other movies. And this one of the worst movies of 2011, i never ever want to see this crappy god awful piece of crap ever again.

1.0,"God, Adam Sandler is so in love with himself! Why not just call the film Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler and Adam Sandler dresses and acts like an obnoxious troll?","Think back to the 90's with Adam Sandler, he was a writer/performer on SNL and had several hit movies. Back in the day, his baby sounds and squished faces were not only cute but hilarious. Now, like all humans, he gets older, but mentally is stuck in the 90's where people found his movies very funny. Now, the strange thing is, Adam Sandler has proved a couple of times that he could be a good dramatic actor. I'm not sure why he hasn't moved on probably because his best friends are desperate for money and he's got to keep his dumb movie company ""Happy Madison"" going, so naturally he writes a bad story with predictable jokes and for some reason he thinks he's so funny, so naturally the movie somehow gets green lighted and that leads us to Jack and Jill. I was warned several times that this movie was awful, but one of my friends wanted to see this movie and rented it. She begged me to watch it with her and told me that I should keep an open mindfair enough, right? I was thinking I was too close minded and I should let go and just have a good laugh. So during the movie, my expression did not change, I just couldn't laugh at anythingI look over and my friend is laughing hysterically. Why am I not having the same reaction? I don't know, but I guess I'm one of the rare people that are seeing the down fall of society with Sandler's movies.Jack, a successful advertising executive in Los Angeles with a beautiful wife and two kids, Sofie and Gary. Jack is incredibly irritated about the Thanksgiving visit of his ""identical"" twin sister Jill. Following a series of problems from the airport to the house, Jack's patience is soon stretched increasingly thin. Jill's neediness and passive-aggressiveness is maddening to Jack, turning his normally tranquil life upside down. Jill says she has a list of things she wants to do before she leaves; she wants to be on a game show, go horseback riding, and do a studio tour. Meanwhile, Jack's client wants him to get Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Jill tries online dating, but doesn't get much of a response until Jack alters her profile, leading her to get over 100 responses. Jack feels bad so he takes her to the Lakers game where Al Pacino is supposed to be. He is there and he develops a crush on Jill as he gives her his phone number. Now the commercial is dependent on her taking a liking to Al Pacino.One thing that I wonder: what the heck did Adam Sandler do to these celebrities who make a cameo in the film? Johnny Depp, one of the greatest actors of our generation makes a cameo. Shaqwell, I withdraw my question on that one. But Al Pacino, did Adam Sandler take a picture of the guy luring children into his gingerbread house or something? But given credit where it's due, Al seems to be the only one putting any effort into this movie. Adam Sandler's character of Jill is very close in the running for most obnoxious characters in cinema history. What I don't get is how in this universe that anyone can stand her? She's loud, racist, crude, ugly and just plain annoying, yet somehow people defend her and somehow 2 guys get a crush on her?! Plus I love how in every Sandler movie now that he writes, his character is: successful, ""good-looking"", has a gorgeous wife, smart, witty and everyone just admires him of course. This movie in itself is a big joke and I really tried to enjoy myself, but just have to go with the negative reviews on this film, it really is that bad. As for people like other users and my friend who found it funny, try watching other movies. I promise, there's a whole world of comedy out there that is much better than this.1/10",god adam sandler is so love with himself why not just call film adam sandler adam sandler adam sandler adam sandler dresses acts like obnoxious troll,think back 90s with adam sandler he was writer performer snl had several hit movies back day his baby sounds squished faces were not only cute but hilarious now like all humans he gets older but mentally is stuck 90s where people found his movies very funny now strange thing is adam sandler has proved couple times that he could be good dramatic actor im not sure why he hasnt moved probably because his best friends are desperate money hes got keep his dumb movie company happy madison going so naturally he writes bad story with predictable jokes some reason he thinks hes so funny so naturally movie somehow gets green lighted that leads us jack jill i was warned several times that this movie was awful but one my friends wanted see this movie rented it she begged me watch it with her told me that i should keep open mind fair enough right i was thinking i was too close minded i should let go just have good laugh so during movie my expression did not change i just couldnt laugh at anything i look over my friend is laughing hysterically why am i not having same reaction i dont know but i guess im one rare people that are seeing down fall society with sandlers movies jack successful advertising executive los angeles with beautiful wife two kids sofie gary jack is incredibly irritated about thanksgiving visit his identical twin sister jill following series problems airport house jacks patience is soon stretched increasingly thin jills neediness passive aggressiveness is maddening jack turning his normally tranquil life upside down jill says she has list things she wants do before she leaves she wants be game show go horseback riding do studio tour meanwhile jacks client wants him get al pacino appear dunkin donuts commercial jill tries online dating but doesnt get much response until jack alters her profile leading her get over 100 responses jack feels bad so he takes her lakers game where al pacino is supposed be he is there he develops crush jill as he gives her his phone number now commercial is dependent her taking liking al pacino one thing that i wonder what heck did adam sandler do these celebrities who make cameo film johnny depp one greatest actors our generation makes cameo shaq well i withdraw my question that one but al pacino did adam sandler take picture guy luring children into his gingerbread house or something but given credit where its due al seems be only one putting any effort into this movie adam sandlers character jill is very close running most obnoxious characters cinema history what i dont get is how this universe that anyone can stand her shes loud racist crude ugly just plain annoying yet somehow people defend her somehow 2 guys get crush her plus i love how every sandler movie now that he writes his character is successful good looking has gorgeous wife smart witty everyone just admires him course this movie itself is big joke i really tried enjoy myself but just have go with negative reviews this film it really is that bad as people like other users my friend who found it funny try watching other movies i promise theres whole world comedy out there that is much better than this 1 10,0.5333623693379792,0.08332849399922573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.27}"

1.0,Jack and Jill,"I saw trailers, and I heard that it broke the record for most wins at the Razzies, the original record being held by I Know Who Killed Me starring Lindsay Lohan with eight wins, this got ten - the total amount of categories, so I had to see if it was really that bad, from Razzie winning director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, Grown Ups). Basically ""identitcal"" twins Jack and Jill Sadelstein grew up together as children, but as time went by it was clear that Jack was the more gifted and Jill trying to gain attention in the wrong ways, and now grown up, they hardly see each other. Jack (Razzie winning Adam Sandler) has become successful advertising executive in Los Angeles, married to beautiful Erin (Razzie nominated Katie Holmes) with two children, Sofia (Elodie Tougne) and Gary Sadelstein (Rohan Chand), and they are spending Thanksgiving together, and twin sister Jill (Razzie winning – for actress – Sandler) is visiting. Jill is needy and a passive-aggressive personality, and her irritating habits and overall presence is turning a normally calm Jack's world upside down, and she cannot help but ruin things for most people around her, because her rude comments and loud speaking. She has a list of things she wants to do before she goes back home, including an appearance on a game show, so she goes on The Price is Right, she also goes horse riding and goes on a studio tour, and as her plane ticket is open-ended she can stay as long as she wants, so she decides she will return at the end of Hanukkah. Jack is in charge with helping his client get a big name for a Dunkin' Donuts advertisement, and he is hoping to get actor Al Pacino (winning a Razzie, for playing himself), but with Jill around he is forced to have to listen to her problems too, especially while she is trying online dating. Hoping to get rid of his sister Jack decides to spruce up Jill's online dating profile, and sure enough she gets up to one hundred responses from men interested, she even goes out with a man calling himself Funbucket (Norm MacDonald), but of course he is scared off by her when they do go out. Feeling guilty, Jack decides Jill needs cheering up, and hoping that Al Pacino will be there too, he takes her to a Lakers game, and he does get to talk to Pacino, and the actor meanwhile spots and develops a crush on his sister. Jack was hoping that Jill would leave by New Year's Eve, since he and his wife and kids and planning a cruise, and his work colleagues find out that he has a twin sister, so they extend the birthday party they were throwing for him so that she is part of the celebration too, and later Pacino takes her to his place to pick her own birthday cake. The next day Jill is planning to go home, but Jack's gardener Felipe (Eugenio Derbez) takes her for some fun in the park, and Jack wants to invite her on the cruise so she is not alone on New Year's, but she doesn't want to go. Also Pacino will only agree to do the donuts commercial if he gets a date with Jill, and he was told that she will be on the cruise with the family, so Jack sees no choice but to use his identical twin status, and disguise himself as his sister to do on the date. On the date Pacino really expresses that he really cares for the real Jill, and Jack realises he does care about his sister, but he finds out that he disguised himself as her, and has gone back home to the Bronx. Jill goes into a restaurant feeling sorry for herself, and there a group of old high school classmates are there, including Monica (Razzie winning – for supporting actress – David Spade) who teases and taunts her, but Jack and family show up to support her, Jack does fight with Monica, but they all return home. Back at Jill's house they all make up, and Felipe has decorated the place to declare his love for her, she is overjoyed as someone loves her, and they embrace, and soon after Pacino shows up, in his performance swashbuckling costume to show his love too. In the end Pacino stepped down seeing that Jill is in love with someone else, but he still did do a commercial, where he is advertising and promoting Dunkaccino coffee with a rap song, but he hates it and tells Jack to destroy it and all copies. Also starring Derbez as Felipe's Grandma, Razzie nominated Nick Swardson as Todd, Tim Meadows as Ted, Allen Covert as Otto, Dana Carvey as Scrapply Puppeteer, Johnny Depp, Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal, Regis Philbin, Drew Carey, Michael Irvin, Jared Fogle, Dennis Dugan as Al Pacino's Standby and Rob Schneider as Alan. There are some people who like Sandler and his films, and there are some who don't, I'm sort of in-between, because I really liked Big Daddy, but some of his films are silly, and some are just bad, this is easily very bad, and he deserved his two Razzies. The acting is pretty terrible, Sandler is worst as his female character, Pacino tries to mock his serious actor image but just makes himself look like his career is dwindling, and Spade is awful also dressed as a woman, this is probably the lowest of the low for cross-dressing comedies, none of it made me laugh, none of it is original, and Jill is easily one of the most loathsome creatures on screen, don't bother with this piece of garbage, a stupid comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Ensemble for the entire cast, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Sandler & EITHER Holmes, Pacino, OR Sandler and Worst Screenplay.
