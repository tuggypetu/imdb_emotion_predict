8,A unique story that can easily reach the Indian's heart,"While watching Badhaai Ho I was remembering a dialogue - ""Family is above everything"" from the film 'Coco'. Badhai Ho is definitely a film that makes you love of your family sometimes more.Nakul's (Ayushmaan Kuranna) family resembles a perfect happy Punjabi family until the tragedy happens when Nakul's mother (Neena Gupta) get pregnant on her late 50s. For sure Nakul, his brother and his his grandma everyone started blaming her and his husband (Gajraj Rao) for being careless. And this story spread like flame and they all started feeling exhausting on the society.Now It's reflect a story that's really unique and anyone will want to know what's gonna happen next. The next situations are quite realistic and perfectly organised. Every scene is so funny and hilarious that makes you sit through the film. And the film has a kind of humor that can makes anyone laugh.Amit Sharma comes with this amazing story and he is successful to reach India's heart, anyone can fall in love with his work. When talking about the acting Gajraj Rao did a great a job and everyone else in this film is amazing, Ayushman Khurrana getting to an unique place on Bollywood day by day. The screenplay written by Jyoti Kapoor and several others is great. The background score sometimes makes the film melodramatic but that's not a question at all because the drama never gets too much because of the beautiful cinematography(Best of 2018 after 'October) by Sanu Varghese.Overall it's a 2nd amusement in 1 month by one and only Ayushmaan Khurrana that is completely watchable and anyone can say ""Let's make this kind of films more""",unique story that can easily reach indians heart,while watching badhaai ho i was remembering dialogue family is above everything film coco badhai ho is definitely film that makes you love your family sometimes more nakuls ayushmaan kuranna family resembles perfect happy punjabi family until tragedy happens when nakuls mother neena gupta get pregnant her late 50s sure nakul his brother his his grandma everyone started blaming her his husband gajraj rao being careless this story spread like flame they all started feeling exhausting society now its reflect story thats really unique anyone will want know whats gonna happen next next situations are quite realistic perfectly organised every scene is so funny hilarious that makes you sit through film film has kind humor that can makes anyone laugh amit sharma comes with this amazing story he is successful reach indias heart anyone can fall love with his work when talking about acting gajraj rao did great job everyone else this film is amazing ayushman khurrana getting unique place bollywood day by day screenplay written by jyoti kapoor several others is great background score sometimes makes film melodramatic but thats not question at all because drama never gets too much because beautiful cinematography best 2018 after october by sanu varghese overall its 2nd amusement 1 month by one only ayushmaan khurrana that is completely watchable anyone can say lets make this kind films more,0.6101388888888889,0.3527083333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.19}"

10,An Indian middle class laugh riot,"The movie is the proof of the current encouraging trend in Indian cinema which is coming up with lots of original concepts. Indian movies have started regaining their old charm by keeping the stories and characters real and relatable. This movie is one of them. Some of the points which makes the movie special are.....One - Conceiving a child in middle age, considered a taboo in indian middle class and the writer, director duo depicted this in a satirical way with lot of lmao moments. Two - Gajraj Rao and Surekha Sikri were exceptional and over shadowed Neena Gupta and Ayushman. I watched the movie yesterday and still laughing out loud by remembering the dialogues of Surekha Sikri. It's proven that Ayushman is best suited for boy next door characters and he has managed the emotions with humour so well. It's really nice to see Neena Gupta after long and she has a done remarkable job with controlled emotions. Gajraj Rao has always been a good actor but recent directors are getting best out of him by showing more faith and giving more screen space. Lastly Sanya Malhotra has justified her role and she looked stunning. Last but least, it's definitely a laugh riot.",indian middle class laugh riot,movie is proof current encouraging trend indian cinema which is coming up with lots original concepts indian movies have started regaining their old charm by keeping stories characters real relatable this movie is one them some points which makes movie special are one conceiving child middle age considered taboo indian middle class writer director duo depicted this satirical way with lot lmao moments two gajraj rao surekha sikri were exceptional over shadowed neena gupta ayushman i watched movie yesterday still laughing out loud by remembering dialogues surekha sikri its proven that ayushman is best suited boy next door characters he has managed emotions with humour so well its really nice see neena gupta after long she has done remarkable job with controlled emotions gajraj rao has always been good actor but recent directors are getting best out him by showing more faith giving more screen space lastly sanya malhotra has justified her role she looked stunning last but least its definitely laugh riot,0.43767006802721087,0.3071003401360545,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

7,Long Review: Badhaai Ho (7 Stars),"If I said that Bollywood has played it right for most of the part in 2018 then you wouldn't disagree with me. There are at least a dozen examples in recent times where Bollywood has shed its usual formula of masala and cheesy romance and turned to narrative storytelling about social issues. All of which has reignited my faith in Bollywood, and thanks to director Amit Sharma, Badhaai Ho can be added to that list of films which helped in that feat. It is a perfect example of an entertaining family drama with one major conflict that is as novel as the storytelling itself.The masterful Gajraj Rao and the queen of nuances Neena Gupta are the heads of a Delhiite family - the Kaushiks - who bear the embarrassment of being preggers at an the age when others prefer (or rather give in to the society-accepted job) to play with their grandchildren (which Surekha Sikri tries to do in the film as the paternal grandmother). How cultural stigmatization of being pregnant well over the age of fifty when you have two boys themselves active enough to bear child acts as a source of ridicule and contempt is shown in a visibly light but loud manner in Badhaai Ho. Gupta's character struggles from start to end, even receiving a ""do you really want to?"" from her own husband, which prepares you for the ulterior question of pro-choice that is in the mind of others who put tradition and cultural indifference on the top. Ayushmann Khurrana plays one of her sons - an adult working-class man - who finds himself in a situation that usually demands happiness but which instead has created some distance between him and her, especially from the eyes of his girlfriend (Sanya Malhotra) and her mother (Sheeba Chaddha). Badhaai Ho is not a celebration of a birth but instead a narration of how the world perceives a product of love when it shifts from the routine or expected.The almost pedantic attention to details in Badhaai Ho appeals to my OCD and it also tells me that director Sharma does not believe in cinematic liberty. The entire film has been carved with honesty and by giving due reverence to reality. Why else would a character make a silly act of pointing out the missing apostrophe in the word ""Kaushiks"" that has been inscribed on the backside of their red Wagon R with a typeface that will make a designer quit his field? It may not be a big deal for the casual cinema-goer but it does show where the makers are coming from. This type of attention to tiny details - whether it is in the selection of the soundtrack or the usage of the score as a cue to the audience to rejoice in laughter - is what makes Badhaai Ho an even better family entertainer. However, what sets the film apart from other recent family comedies is that every character is idiosyncratic - from their family doctor who reminds you of that overweight physician your family used to consult in the 1990s to the kin characters who also remind you of people you know in real life. They all have their own flavorful characteristics which not only makes the film a fun to watch but also makes you wanting more from director Sharma. Despite his last one being the noisy thriller, Tevar (2015), with Arjun Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha.As I have noted above, Badhaai Ho has an excellent suggestive score (Abhishek Arora and Tanishk Bagchi) that acts as a cue for you to take note of the particular scene. And such cues come and go every five minutes. The titular song is catchy and funny, which although is too loud for me, reminds me that I am watching a Bollywood movie. Special appreciation to editor Dev Rao Jadhav who concocts a complex carving so that the viewing becomes interesting. I am amazed at the sound mixing as well, which made me sit back and marvel at the amount of efforts put in the film in the editing room. The anti-climactic narrative may put some of you off, but it is what makes Badhaai Ho enjoyable and different.Sanya Malhotra is the only cast member who seemed out of place in the whole film. Others blend in like actual members of a Delhi housing colony, with a special visible connection between the actors who play the family. Malhotra is good-looking and adds brightness to the scene she is in, but her facial expressions make me want to direct her to a film school. Gupta and Rao are the highlight performances of the film, and maybe even the year. You cannot find anyone else to play the kind of a miser and innocent father that Rao plays in Badhaai Ho that you want to go and hug him if you ever meet him in person. Helping him put up a show is Gupta, who is phenomenal in her star character. (I even wonder what prevented casting directors from hiring her all these years when she was out looking for a job.) Together, their performances overshadow that of the rest of the cast, including Khurrana's, who I think has reached the typecast saturation. There is even this discussion that happens on Reddit where people claim that Khurrana plays the same character - ordinary young man from Delhi or UP - in all the films. I tend to agree, after watching Badhaai Ho and Andhadhun almost within two weeks.If you thought Sharat Katariya was the only master household storyteller (who directed Sui Dhaaga this year) then think again. In Badhaai Ho, director Sharma crafts comedy out of thin air; out of routine familial conversations, which is so sweet to watch that it melts in your mouth like the caramel popcorn you prefer while watching such comedy dramas. There is no shortage of such palpable moments in this honest drama that you will complete watching it with a big smile on your face. But, when you go in to watch Badhaai Ho this week, don't go in to be outsmarted by a relevant story, but instead go in to get your mind blown with a crispy drama that will make you laugh and cry - in a way that Bollywood hasn't been able to in a lot of years.

9,Indian Entertainment!,"What a year is 2018 for Bollywood! The content based films are recognized and appreciated by larger mumber of audience. This year is wonderful for Ayushmann Khurrana, as his two films (Both released in October itself) are getting great reviews and B.O. collection. Though, Andhadhun came on 5th October, it is unusual that these two Ayushamann starrer films are competing each other, as no other film is as good as these two.Badhaai Ho is the film whose trailer raised the bar and everyone was expecting it to be a Hit. Film shows exactly what its trailer offers. Though, audience is very happy with this comedy drama. Story is fantastic and very unique. Ayushmann (Nakul)'s mother got pregnant (played by Neena Gupta), and this is not the normal thing. Neither for Ayush and his brother, nor for his grandmother, nor for his girlfriend and her mother, & nor for the society! Film deals with this issue in an organic way possible, and gives out best example that whatever happens, you need your family and family needs your support.Sanya Malhotra looks so pretty! It's her 3rd film after Dangal and Patakha, and I love her in every film. Gajraj Rao plays the father of Nakul with such an ease. This film will get him the recognition he deserves. Neena Gupta plays her part brilliantly. The pair looks so perfect with each other. Best one is Daadi-Sa, Surekha Sikri. She is too good. Her dialogues in the second half will make you cry. I heard many saying they cried in the second half. And I guess it's because of her. Sheeba Chaddha is also good as Sanya's mother.Film delivers the perfect humour which this kind of film requires. Some scenes are beautifully taken without any dialogues, but just with expressions. There are many moments when you will laugh out loud. Although, the love-story portion in the second half could have been more filmy and entertaining. It is there as a simple and good-going story. Though, it definitely is not boring from any point of time. For this, writers deserve applause, which are Akshat Ghildial, Jyoti Kapoor and Shantanu Srivastava.Amit Sharma is the director of this film. It is his debut film. He looks promising. It will surely going to be a hit. And hence, hoping for more good work from him in his upcoming works.This film is having the best suitable background score which a comedy film is supposed to have. There are not much songs. The title track is funny. 'Maari thi Missed call, lekin ho gaya Answer hi!' There is one super romantic track as well. And how can I forget the lullaby in the climax, where the film ends with the sweetest way possible!Go and watch this film with your family. It is not a taboo topic which can't be seen with your parents. Try out and be modern like an educated man/woman should have to. And, oh, yes, I forget to mention about Ayushmann's performance... Well, I think since his first film he is doing his job great! So, Bollywood ko Ayushmann ki Badhaai Ho.",indian entertainment,what year is 2018 bollywood content based films are recognized appreciated by larger mumber audience this year is wonderful ayushmann khurrana as his two films both released october itself are getting great reviews b o collection though andhadhun came 5th october it is unusual that these two ayushamann starrer films are competing each other as no other film is as good as these two badhaai ho is film whose trailer raised bar everyone was expecting it be hit film shows exactly what its trailer offers though audience is very happy with this comedy drama story is fantastic very unique ayushmann nakul s mother got pregnant played by neena gupta this is not normal thing neither ayush his brother nor his grandmother nor his girlfriend her mother nor society film deals with this issue organic way possible gives out best example that whatever happens you need your family family needs your support sanya malhotra looks so pretty its her 3rd film after dangal patakha i love her every film gajraj rao plays father nakul with such ease this film will get him recognition he deserves neena gupta plays her part brilliantly pair looks so perfect with each other best one is daadi sa surekha sikri she is too good her dialogues second half will make you cry i heard many saying they cried second half i guess its because her sheeba chaddha is also good as sanyas mother film delivers perfect humour which this kind film requires some scenes are beautifully taken without any dialogues but just with expressions there are many moments when you will laugh out loud although love story portion second half could have been more filmy entertaining it is there as simple good going story though it definitely is not boring any point time this writers deserve applause which are akshat ghildial jyoti kapoor shantanu srivastava amit sharma is director this film it is his debut film he looks promising it will surely going be hit hence hoping more good work him his upcoming works this film is having best suitable background score which comedy film is supposed have there are not much songs title track is funny maari thi missed call lekin ho gaya answer hi there is one super romantic track as well how can i forget lullaby climax where film ends with sweetest way possible go watch this film with your family it is not taboo topic which cant be seen with your parents try out be modern like educated man woman should have oh yes i forget mention about ayushmanns performance well i think since his first film he is doing his job great so bollywood ko ayushmann ki badhaai ho,0.5603505291005292,0.37486111111111103,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8,"Surekha Sikri, Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta steals the show in this Ayushmann Khurrana film !!! Don't miss it","For every person, parents are like god to them. We idolize them, worship them and respect them. However, situation comes when you realize that they have committed something which brings embarrassment to the society, especially if you are surrounded by relatives and friends in the social circle. How will you deal with it ? Will you stand by them or just leave them ?Badhaai Ho talks about the situation when Nakul (Ayushmann Khurrana) suffers the calamity fallen upon him when he finds out that his mother (Neena Gupta) is pregnant.From the director of Tevar, Amit Ravindernath Sharma brings a bold subject to the Indian cinema for the first time. It is a very sensitive subject which if not treated well might fire back. Amit Ravindernath Sharma does well in handling the subject with maturity infusing the comedy scene in the first half which will make you laugh-aloud with emotions in the second half and comes out well as a winner. There is a scene when Surekha Sikri realizes about her daughter-in-law's pregnancy and the way she speaks and curses her will bring down the down the house. She is absolutely wonderful in her non-stop verbal spat that she keeps on talking to herself even after Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta leaves the house. There are so many instances like this that will make you feel good without creating boredom through out this 2 hours 4 minutes journey. Kudos to the Amit Ravindernath Sharma and the writers of Badhaai Ho for doing a fabulous job.On the flip side, Badhaai Ho do loses the focus slightly in the second half when it shifts the story to Nakul and Renee (Sanya Malhotra) but is too little to worry about. Music is just about okay. Cinematography and art direction is simple but the background is smooth. Dialogues are outstanding especially the ones spoken by Surekha Sikri. Performance wise, it is the senior actors who have stolen the thunder. Badhaai Ho belongs to the trio - Surekha Sikri, Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta. Even though, the film has Ayushmann Khurrana as the lead but the combination of these actors is a treat to watch. They get engrossed into their characters with so much ease that they will make you believe that they are actual characters in real life. Ayushmann Khurrana does well but will remind of same role played by him in Vicky Donor. Sanya Malhotra brings charm to her role as Renee.Overall, Badhaai Ho is a unqiue piece of art that should not be missed.

10,Another brilliant satire on the Indian society,"Name anything - Story, Acting, Funny Dialogues or Direction, this film has all of it with the word ""Amazing"" added to all the aforementioned words. For those people who think the Khans are ones who can make movies hits, they should watch out for Ayushmann Khurrana. The guy is very natural in his performance. But despite him being the protagonist of this movie, I feel the story is mainly about Neena Gupta's character. It is her character that faces a tough situation in life and decides to go through it anyway. Ayushmann Khurrana and the other characters are people who react on that situation. Hence I feel they are more like supporting characters.The film shows how the society reacts to yet another taboo situation that is very unusual: parents having a baby again. The characters of Ayushmann Khurrana and Gajraj Rao are symbolic of the typical Middle Class people who are against it. The character of Sheeba Chadda (Renee's mother) is symbolic of the society itself that judges any person it wants to.On the Writing & Direction part, I can't believe these are the same people who made Tevar. Tevar was a movie copied from the South while this feels more like an Original Story. Guess they have realised that proper observation and imagination can give really good stories.On an ending note, I'm beginning to really like each and every movie that Ayushmann Khurrana is coming up with. All of his movies are getting a rating of more than 7 or 8 in this website and I hope this continues.",another brilliant satire indian society,name anything story acting funny dialogues or direction this film has all it with word amazing added all aforementioned words those people who think khans are ones who can make movies hits they should watch out ayushmann khurrana guy is very natural his performance but despite him being protagonist this movie i feel story is mainly about neena guptas character it is her character that faces tough situation life decides go through it anyway ayushmann khurrana other characters are people who react that situation hence i feel they are more like supporting characters film shows how society reacts yet another taboo situation that is very unusual parents having baby again characters ayushmann khurrana gajraj rao are symbolic typical middle class people who are against it character sheeba chadda renees mother is symbolic society itself that judges any person it wants writing direction part i cant believe these are same people who made tevar tevar was movie copied south while this feels more like original story guess they have realised that proper observation imagination can give really good stories ending note im beginning really like each every movie that ayushmann khurrana is coming up with all his movies are getting rating more than 7 or 8 this website i hope this continues,0.45848484848484844,0.2205050505050505,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.49}"

6,First half for the win! [+61%],"Badhaai Ho has sitcom recipe written all over it. It has some finely constructed humor, moments of emotional outburst, and not to forget, a 'happy' ending. The film is about a Delhi-based middle-class family with its set of isms. The concept that it tackles (of 'late pregnancy') is one that hasn't been explored in Indian cinema quite a lot. I really enjoyed the director's eye for the little details like the sticker (in an atrocious font) on the back of their car that says 'Kaushiks' (with an apostrophe missing), the house in which they stay (the grandmom's bed is bang opposite the television), and more along those lines.The humor is simple, situational, and mostly relatable in the first half. The mom of the house (who is nearing her 60s) is unexpectedly expecting and the whole family somehow has to accustom themselves to this fact. What makes this unusual scenario work on screen are the terrific performances of the older couple (played by Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao), the grandmother (Surekha Sikri), and to an extent the sons (Ayushman Khurrana and Shardul Rana).The warm, affectionate relationship shared between the dad and mom of the house is what makes the first half of Badhaai Ho an engaging affair. Khurrana's scenes are pretty fine too (the romance track between him and Sanya Malhotra thankfully isn't a cheesefest), but the comic timing of the seniors often outdo the rest. The dialogues have been written well and ensure sufficient laugh-out-loud moments.However, the second half isn't without its share of flaws. The film, all of a sudden, turns into a collection of moments: the sons choosing not to accompany their parents to a family wedding, the younger son getting into an altercation at school and the older one coming to his rescue, the ugly spat between boyfriend and girlfriend and the eventual reconciliation, and the grandmom coming to the aid of the pregnant daughter-in-law while she gets shamed, and plenty more. The film loses its focus a wee bit here and tries to rely too much on cinematics. The songs do not help in making the proceedings appear less dramatic either.'Badhaai Ho' needs to be applauded for placing a fair bit of emphasis on the characters of Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao (who can easily have a whole movie to themselves) in the initial half even though their issues sort of recede into the background in the latter half. The angle between Nakul (Khurrana) and Renee's mother also seemed rather pointless. Would I recommend the movie to a friend/peer? Yes, for the fantastic performances of the senior Kaushiks.",first half win,badhaai ho has sitcom recipe written all over it it has some finely constructed humor moments emotional outburst not forget happy ending film is about delhi based middle class family with its set isms concept that it tackles late pregnancy is one that hasnt been explored indian cinema quite lot i really enjoyed directors eye little details like sticker atrocious font back their car that says kaushiks with apostrophe missing house which they stay grandmoms bed is bang opposite television more along those lines humor is simple situational mostly relatable first half mom house who is nearing her 60s is unexpectedly expecting whole family somehow has accustom themselves this fact what makes this unusual scenario work screen are terrific performances older couple played by neena gupta gajraj rao grandmother surekha sikri extent sons ayushman khurrana shardul rana warm affectionate relationship shared between dad mom house is what makes first half badhaai ho engaging affair khurranas scenes are pretty fine too romance track between him sanya malhotra thankfully isnt cheesefest but comic timing seniors often outdo rest dialogues have been written well ensure sufficient laugh out loud moments however second half isnt without its share flaws film all sudden turns into collection moments sons choosing not accompany their parents family wedding younger son getting into altercation at school older one coming his rescue ugly spat between boyfriend girlfriend eventual reconciliation grandmom coming aid pregnant daughter law while she gets shamed plenty more film loses its focus wee bit here tries rely too much cinematics songs do not help making proceedings appear less dramatic either badhaai ho needs be applauded placing fair bit emphasis characters neena gupta gajraj rao who can easily have whole movie themselves initial half even though their issues sort recede into background latter half angle between nakul khurrana renees mother also seemed rather pointless would i recommend movie friend peer yes fantastic performances senior kaushiks,0.444069264069264,0.1062878787878788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8,Enjoyable Badhaai Ho,"Badhaai Ho', much like its subject, puts a fantastic new spin on the usual. The comedy and icing of emotions engage you thoroughly.Story revolves around the life of a typical middle-class family in Delhi where an old grandmother lives with her obedient son Gajraj Rao, dutiful daughter-in-law Neena Gupta and two grandsons, Ayushmann being the elder one. Their lives turn topsy-turvy when Neena Gupta becomes pregnant at a relatively old age bringing embarrassment and uncomfortable moments for other family members.Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao and Surekha Sikri steal the show. No word is enough for their scintillating act. Ayushman Khurana and Sanya Malhotra form a good pair.A Notable touching scene in movie is, how in the guise of geriatric behaviour, SurekhaSikri blurts out some home truths and defends her daughter-in-law, when in other circumstances she would be constantly bickering with her.Overall it's a simple story and at time simplicity works beautifully.",enjoyable badhaai ho,badhaai ho much like its subject puts fantastic new spin usual comedy icing emotions engage you thoroughly story revolves around life typical middle class family delhi where old grandmother lives with her obedient son gajraj rao dutiful daughter law neena gupta two grandsons ayushmann being elder one their lives turn topsy turvy when neena gupta becomes pregnant at relatively old age bringing embarrassment uncomfortable moments other family members neena gupta gajraj rao surekha sikri steal show no word is enough their scintillating act ayushman khurana sanya malhotra form good pair notable touching scene movie is how guise geriatric behaviour surekhasikri blurts out some home truths defends her daughter law when other circumstances she would be constantly bickering with her overall its simple story at time simplicity works beautifully,0.45992847731978176,0.14723320158102768,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10,Bone tickling funny and brutally honest,"The day the trailer for this movie landed I was so eagerly waiting to watch this on the big screen as the premise seemed so hilarious and original. And I wasn't disappointed a bit. The film has a very basic and simple plot. A couple in their 50's who have 2 children, get pregnant. The social stigma and embarrassment that comes from the society and their own family forms the crux of the story. The film is brutally honest and simple in it's approach and never goes overboard into preaching on what a society or family should be like. They don't lay down golden rules or have big speeches. The hero of the film is it's brilliant script, hat's off to the writers (Shantanu, Akshat, Jyoti). Amit who directs the film treats the film and subject with a meticulous approach. The depiction of a typical middle class 'Delhi' vali family is so on point without going into stereotyping. Running into just a shade over 120 minutes, the movie never bores you because comic situations continue to arrive in every scene. The movie is a laughter riot and the emotional scenes gave me goosebumps and teared me up a bit. While the script is the hero of the film, the heroine of the film has to be the excellent bunch of actors. Meet the KAUSHIKS( You have to ask the little brother why it's KAUSHIKS and not KAUSHIK'S). Jeetu(Gajraj Rao), Priyamvada (Neena Gupta) play the pregnant couple. Dadi( Surekha Sikri) plays Jeetu's old mother. Nakul (Ayushmann) and Gullar (Shardul) play the sons. Everyone is mind blowing throughout, their expressions are so on point. Gajraj, Neena and Surekha jee steal the show with their brilliant portrayals. They seemed to be living the characters. Ayushmann is on a role, back to back brilliant movies and acting.Badhaai ho is a brilliant comic caper that just cannot be missed. It's heavily entertaining and you will fall down laughing. The delicate issue of pregnancy in the late 50's and societal stigma that comes with it has been brilliantly handled and portrayed.",bone tickling funny brutally honest,day trailer this movie landed i was so eagerly waiting watch this big screen as premise seemed so hilarious original i wasnt disappointed bit film has very basic simple plot couple their 50s who have 2 children get pregnant social stigma embarrassment that comes society their own family forms crux story film is brutally honest simple its approach never goes overboard into preaching what society or family should be like they dont lay down golden rules or have big speeches hero film is its brilliant script hats off writers shantanu akshat jyoti amit who directs film treats film subject with meticulous approach depiction typical middle class delhi vali family is so point without going into stereotyping running into just shade over 120 minutes movie never bores you because comic situations continue arrive every scene movie is laughter riot emotional scenes gave me goosebumps teared me up bit while script is hero film heroine film has be excellent bunch actors meet kaushiks you have ask little brother why its kaushiks not kaushiks jeetu gajraj rao priyamvada neena gupta play pregnant couple dadi surekha sikri plays jeetus old mother nakul ayushmann gullar shardul play sons everyone is mind blowing throughout their expressions are so point gajraj neena surekha jee steal show with their brilliant portrayals they seemed be living characters ayushmann is role back back brilliant movies acting badhaai ho is brilliant comic caper that just cannot be missed its heavily entertaining you will fall down laughing delicate issue pregnancy late 50s societal stigma that comes with it has been brilliantly handled portrayed,0.5398606023606023,0.20751424501424504,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7,It's Never Too Late,"It's a middle-class family. Father works for the government.... well, he collects tickets on the railroad. The older son works in the telecommunications industry and is romantically involved with a co-worker. The younger son is still in school. Grandma lives in the apartment and belittles the mother every chance she gets. And the mother is a housewife who is not feeling too well. She goes to the medical clinic and discovers she is expecting, at an age when they were looking forward to saving some money and retiring, they have to consider abortion.... and she's refusing.It's not a new theme. There's a good movie version of the Broadway show NEVER TOO LATE and, indeed, the two movies share a lot of the same concerns and even the same jokes. That's hardly surprising, given that some aspects of human life haven't changed much in ten thousand years. Yet every place and age differs, so we are left with the question of whether this movie deals with anything new or in a new manner. Given current Indian governmental pushing towards smaller families, as well as the concurrence of 'the best people' (whoever they may be), yes it does.",its never too late,its middle class family father works government well he collects tickets railroad older son works telecommunications industry is romantically involved with co worker younger son is still school grandma lives apartment belittles mother every chance she gets mother is housewife who is not feeling too well she goes medical clinic discovers she is expecting at age when they were looking forward saving some money retiring they have consider abortion shes refusing its not new theme theres good movie version broadway show never too late indeed two movies share lot same concerns even same jokes thats hardly surprising given that some aspects human life havent changed much ten thousand years yet every place age differs so we are left with question whether this movie deals with anything new or new manner given current indian governmental pushing towards smaller families as well as concurrence best people whoever they may be yes it does,0.2919457735247209,0.114274322169059,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
