,It's all there,"I remember reading through Satyajit Ray's list of things that people from outside India would fail to get in ""Charulata""  of all his films (up to 1980, anyway) the one he thought was most ""superficially"" accessible to Westerners  and thinking to myself: ""But I DID get all this... at least, more or less.""In Bengal society (Ray writes) a woman's brother-in-law holds a privileged position; the two are EXPECTED to form a special friendship, and she is allowed to be more intimate with him than with anyone else to whom she's not related by blood (apart, of course, from her husband). Ray is right. Most Westerners don't know this. I certainly didn't. But we're able to infer as much of it as matters from the film itself: we can tell that Amal and Charulata expect, before they fall properly in love, a fair degree of freedom in negotiating their friendship; that this is okay by Bhupati; that this isn't considered odd by any of the participants; that it (probably) WOULD be considered odd were Amal an outsider... and we can tell a good deal more besides; this is, as everyone acknowledges, a film of exceedingly rich characterisations. What we CAN'T tell from the film alone is the extent to which the expectations and roles of the three central characters are duplicated in other marriages across India. But this doesn't matter. This is a chamber drama, not an allegory.Ray also lists some literary allusions which Westerners are almost certain to be blind to, but again, I think he's underestimated the extent to which he gets across, in the film alone, all he needs to get across. We can tell, from the way the characters react, what the allusions mean; just as an allusion to Achilles' heel, if properly used, will make sense to (and add depth for) an audience entirely unfamiliar with Greek legend. Even the film's makes sense to outsiders in a way Ray thinks it won't. It's a Scottish tune (I know this because I recognised it, but you can tell it's Scottish even if you don't) with Bengali lyrics; we can tell it's a Western song, from (more or less) the land which currently rules over India, which at least some Indians have adopted as their own, which is popular enough for Amal to expect others to be familiar with it, etc. (I have to admit, though, that something was being conveyed by the lyrics that wasn't being adequately conveyed by the subtitles.)It's a tribute to Ray's skill that even he doesn't realise just how much context he's managed to import into ""Charulata"". Of course, he's right in that nobody will get everything; Ray himself admits to not understanding the meaning of his own (hopeful? cautious? distancing?) final freeze frame (""I only knew that it was the right way to end the film""), and, I need hardly add, I don't either.Ray was wrong to think that the allusions fall flat on Western ears or that some of the necessary social context is impenetrable, but the film would still have something to offer even if he weren't: the characters would still be as alive and real, the respect with which they're treated would be just as apparent; the film would still, in short, be a beautiful one.",its all there,i remember reading through satyajit rays list things that people outside india would fail get charulata all his films up 1980 anyway one he thought was most superficially accessible westerners thinking myself but i did get all this at least more or less bengal society ray writes womans brother law holds privileged position two are expected form special friendship she is allowed be more intimate with him than with anyone else whom shes not related by blood apart course her husband ray is right most westerners dont know this i certainly didnt but were able infer as much it as matters film itself we can tell that amal charulata expect before they fall properly love fair degree freedom negotiating their friendship that this is okay by bhupati that this isnt considered odd by any participants that it probably would be considered odd were amal outsider we can tell good deal more besides this is as everyone acknowledges film exceedingly rich characterisations what we cant tell film alone is extent which expectations roles three central characters are duplicated other marriages across india but this doesnt matter this is chamber drama not allegory ray also lists some literary allusions which westerners are almost certain be blind but again i think hes underestimated extent which he gets across film alone all he needs get across we can tell way characters react what allusions mean just as allusion achilles heel if properly used will make sense add depth audience entirely unfamiliar with greek legend even films makes sense outsiders way ray thinks it wont its scottish tune i know this because i recognised it but you can tell its scottish even if you dont with bengali lyrics we can tell its western song more or less land which currently rules over india which at least some indians have adopted as their own which is popular enough amal expect others be familiar with it etc i have admit though that something was being conveyed by lyrics that wasnt being adequately conveyed by subtitles its tribute rays skill that even he doesnt realise just how much context hes managed import into charulata course hes right that nobody will get everything ray himself admits not understanding meaning his own hopeful cautious distancing final freeze frame i only knew that it was right way end film i need hardly add i dont either ray was wrong think that allusions fall flat western ears or that some necessary social context is impenetrable but film would still have something offer even if he werent characters would still be as alive real respect with which theyre treated would be just as apparent film would still short be beautiful one,0.452743675595238,0.1377139136904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,The Magic of Satyajit Ray,"This is the first film of Satyajit Ray that I have seen, and probably one of the first if not the first non-westernized Indian films. Most of my previous viewings like the wonderful Monsoon Wedding by Mira Nair were made by directors who live and created in Hollywood. This wonderful film made in 1964 is even more a revelation, as its director is a master, contemporary and at the same level as the best directors of his generation.The setting of the story is in Calcutta's high society of the end of the 19th century, in a period of social and national conflict that is all the time on the background but is not really the center of the story. Based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, almost all the conflict happens in the house of the wealthy journalist and newspaper owner Bupathi, which is filmed with refinement in all its details by the master camera of Subrata Mitra. My feeling after the first scenes was that I am watching a play by Ibsen or Chekhov transplanted in a different continent and this feeling was induced not only by the one set staging but also or especially by the strong character of the principal character, Bupathi's beautiful wife Charulata. We immediately feel her loneliness, her need to connect with people, her emotional capacity which he represses by watching the human landscape of the street. When Buphati will being his younger brother Amal in the house, the two will become involved, in a never consumed forbidden relationship that is intense and discreet. As proving or acting openly according to sentiments is not part of the culture the characters belong to, Charulata will prove her sentiments by demonstrating her creative and intellectual qualities, in a world and a time dominated by men. The ending may look like a melodrama, but it's perfectly plausible.Charulata is acted by Madhabi Mukherjee in a flawless and sensible performance that reminds Yasujiro Ozu's preferred actress Setsuko Hara. It is not however the only aspect that reminded me the Japanese master. The vibration of nature in 'Charulata' complements and amplifies the feelings of the heroes, same as in Ozu's movies. The reliance on actors to describe feelings to the most subtle of the nuances, the delicacy and dignity of the relations, the quite storytelling and the control of story time seem all to belong to the same school of cinema that puts actors and camera work in the center of the art of film making. Ray's cinema has more of a social and historical context though, at least in this film. There is also a key difference in the camera work approach. While both directors control the art of framing and build beautiful and memorable scenes, there is much more dynamics in Ray's camera movement, with daring shots that represent much more the characters view of the world than the director's view as at Ozu.'Charulata' was for me one of these revelations of a new world that happens once in a awhile in the life of a cinema lover. One more proof that good cinema transcends genres and film schools, and succeeds at best when it talks directly to the hearts of the viewers.",magic satyajit ray,this is first film satyajit ray that i have seen probably one first if not first non westernized indian films most my previous viewings like wonderful monsoon wedding by mira nair were made by directors who live created hollywood this wonderful film made 1964 is even more revelation as its director is master contemporary at same level as best directors his generation setting story is calcuttas high society end 19th century period social national conflict that is all time background but is not really center story based story by rabindranath tagore almost all conflict happens house wealthy journalist newspaper owner bupathi which is filmed with refinement all its details by master camera subrata mitra my feeling after first scenes was that i am watching play by ibsen or chekhov transplanted different continent this feeling was induced not only by one set staging but also or especially by strong character principal character bupathis beautiful wife charulata we immediately feel her loneliness her need connect with people her emotional capacity which he represses by watching human landscape street when buphati will being his younger brother amal house two will become involved never consumed forbidden relationship that is intense discreet as proving or acting openly according sentiments is not part culture characters belong charulata will prove her sentiments by demonstrating her creative intellectual qualities world time dominated by men ending may look like melodrama but its perfectly plausible charulata is acted by madhabi mukherjee flawless sensible performance that reminds yasujiro ozus preferred actress setsuko hara it is not however only aspect that reminded me japanese master vibration nature charulata complements amplifies feelings heroes same as ozus movies reliance actors describe feelings most subtle nuances delicacy dignity relations quite storytelling control story time seem all belong same school cinema that puts actors camera work center art film making rays cinema has more social historical context though at least this film there is also key difference camera work approach while both directors control art framing build beautiful memorable scenes there is much more dynamics rays camera movement with daring shots that represent much more characters view world than directors view as at ozu charulata was me one these revelations new world that happens once awhile life cinema lover one more proof that good cinema transcends genres film schools succeeds at best when it talks directly hearts viewers,0.48944628099173554,0.28559504132231395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,A Beautiful And Haunting Materpiece,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Lacking the formidable cultural legacy of his earlier Apu trilogy, CHARULATA (Ray's 11th film) lacks nothing else  if Ray's overall style was derived from neo-realism; CHARULATA proved that  in his own uncluttered way  he was also a master of style and subtle elegance.CHARULATA was perhaps Ray's most technically stunning work, featuring an elegant - if moody - story shot in a manner that finds Ray experimenting a bit. The story is set in an upper-class, intellectual household in 1890s India, and the period setting is rendered in great detail  giving the film a lush, living beauty that (thanks to the stunning cinematography of Subrata Mitra) never crosses over into stuffiness. In a handful of scenes, a French new wave influence can also be seen  primarily at the very end, and also in an earlier scene featuring the title character's recollections (in a quick-moving montage) of childhood memories. Based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, the film explores marital complacency, as Bhupati (a wealthy publisher and political idealist, devotes the majority of his time to his publishing business, and to political interests, and grows increasingly isolated from his wife, Charulata. Charulata  as an attractive upper-class wife, is essentially expected to manage the household, and not much else, and is increasingly both lonesome (Bhupati is a generally pleasant enough husband, though also a severe workaholic who is rarely around, and - in his sexual politics - he is a product of his time) and intellectually restless. In the midst of this, Bhupati's younger brother Amal arrives  Amal, a romantically inclined bohemian and recent college graduate who is searching for work while also pursuing literary ambitions, and has temporarily moved into the household. Amal and Charulata are instantly drawn to each other  first as intellectual companions, before an awareness of attraction is recognized. The two are plainly aware of the impossibility of the unrequited relationship, as Bhupati  after discovering than an employee has been embezzling form him  is then devastated to discover that his wife is turning away from him. To highlight the increasing distance between each of the three characters, CHARULATA is formalistic in it's look (with the handful of well-placed new-wave-inflected scenes adding textural complexity and emotionalism), with the classical touches of the cinematography underscoring the characters' ever-increasing distance from each other. Exploring sexual and class politics - with great depth and complexity - in a historical setting (while  in its' exploration of idealistic, nationalistic politics  making subtle connections to the present-day handling of the same issues in Bengali society), with flawless performances from all, CHARULATA is a beautiful and haunting masterpiece.",beautiful haunting materpiece,possible spoilers lacking formidable cultural legacy his earlier apu trilogy charulata rays 11th film lacks nothing else if rays overall style was derived neo realism charulata proved that his own uncluttered way he was also master style subtle elegance charulata was perhaps rays most technically stunning work featuring elegant if moody story shot manner that finds ray experimenting bit story is set upper class intellectual household 1890s india period setting is rendered great detail giving film lush living beauty that thanks stunning cinematography subrata mitra never crosses over into stuffiness handful scenes french new wave influence can also be seen primarily at very end also earlier scene featuring title characters recollections quick moving montage childhood memories based story by rabindranath tagore film explores marital complacency as bhupati wealthy publisher political idealist devotes majority his time his publishing business political interests grows increasingly isolated his wife charulata charulata as attractive upper class wife is essentially expected manage household not much else is increasingly both lonesome bhupati is generally pleasant enough husband though also severe workaholic who is rarely around his sexual politics he is product his time intellectually restless midst this bhupatis younger brother amal arrives amal romantically inclined bohemian recent college graduate who is searching work while also pursuing literary ambitions has temporarily moved into household amal charulata are instantly drawn each other first as intellectual companions before awareness attraction is recognized two are plainly aware impossibility unrequited relationship as bhupati after discovering than employee has been embezzling form him is then devastated discover that his wife is turning away him highlight increasing distance between each three characters charulata is formalistic its look with handful well placed new wave inflected scenes adding textural complexity emotionalism with classical touches cinematography underscoring characters ever increasing distance each other exploring sexual class politics with great depth complexity historical setting while its exploration idealistic nationalistic politics making subtle connections present day handling same issues bengali society with flawless performances all charulata is beautiful haunting masterpiece,0.47725815850815845,0.2273601398601399,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Absolute perfection,"As cinema appears to become ever more loud and brash, a work as delicate, subtle and understated as this may easily pass unnoticed, or mistaken as insipid. That is a great shame, since this is obviously a great masterpiece. Set in India in the last century, Charulata is trapped in a dull, stifling marriage. What starts off as innocent flirting with her brother-in-law soon sets off emotions that none of them, decent though they all are, can really control. There is no adultery as such - the betrayal is all in the mind - but the trust implicit in marriage is broken, and the future can only be faced with uncertainty.This is a film of great grace and elegance, and also of considerable wit. But underneath the surface charm is a great seriousness. As always, Ray depicts the development of the characters with great insight and sensitivity, and coaxes fine performances from his cast. Western critics, in discussing this film, often draw parallels with the works of Chekhov or of Henry James, but Ray's inspiration was actually the great Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore, on whose short novel this film was based. As a piece of film-making, it is absolute perfection - a real gem.",absolute perfection,as cinema appears become ever more loud brash work as delicate subtle understated as this may easily pass unnoticed or mistaken as insipid that is great shame since this is obviously great masterpiece set india last century charulata is trapped dull stifling marriage what starts off as innocent flirting with her brother law soon sets off emotions that none them decent though they all are can really control there is no adultery as such betrayal is all mind but trust implicit marriage is broken future can only be faced with uncertainty this is film great grace elegance also considerable wit but underneath surface charm is great seriousness as always ray depicts development characters with great insight sensitivity coaxes fine performances his cast western critics discussing this film often draw parallels with works chekhov or henry james but rays inspiration was actually great bengali writer rabindranath tagore whose short novel this film was based as piece film making it is absolute perfection real gem,0.5680555555555554,0.19638888888888892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,"A subtly rich period film from late 1800s, certainly worth relishing","Satyajit Ray is one of my very favorite film makers, and I especially love his ""Apu"" Trilogy and ""Home and the World"", all four of which I would probably rate 10/10 or possibly 9/10. I saw ""Charulata"" (""The Lonely Wife"") on videotape in the closing days of 1999.""Charulata"" clearly espouses S.Ray's distinctive style with very strong and realistic characters subtly developed, rich immersion into the period of the film (in this case around the time of the Indian Mutiny in the 1860s or 1870s, as I recall from history), having of a very few settings that are each portrayed in detail, and compelling and introspective camera shots. I am not surprised that some people are reminded, in viewing S. Ray's films, of Russian author Chekhov; I think of the paralysis of the characters in ""The Cherry Orchard"" and their juxtaposition against a lovely estate that they are in the process of losing.In this film there isn't the same faded glory, but the lovely home decor and liberating gardens do contrast starkly with the paralysis of the wife. Bright and with clear literary talent, she is stuck as but a home fixture for her well-intentioned but unseeing husband. The husband has laudable passion for his newspaper and the truth, but is sadly ignorant of the companionship and time that any relationship, particularly a marital one, demands.I would probably rate this film 8.5-9 out of 10. For me, it didn't have the strong emotion of any of the other films I mentioned above or the intricate story of ""Agantuk"" (""The Stranger"", in color and which I believe was his last film). But overall, ""Charulata"" is another masterpiece film by Satyajit Ray with a quiet and humble, yet powerful, presentation, rather uncommon in contemporary film.",subtly rich period film late 1800s certainly worth relishing,satyajit ray is one my very favorite film makers i especially love his apu trilogy home world all four which i would probably rate 10 10 or possibly 9 10 i saw charulata lonely wife videotape closing days 1999 charulata clearly espouses s rays distinctive style with very strong realistic characters subtly developed rich immersion into period film this case around time indian mutiny 1860s or 1870s as i recall history having very few settings that are each portrayed detail compelling introspective camera shots i am not surprised that some people are reminded viewing s rays films russian author chekhov i think paralysis characters cherry orchard their juxtaposition against lovely estate that they are process losing this film there isnt same faded glory but lovely home decor liberating gardens do contrast starkly with paralysis wife bright with clear literary talent she is stuck as but home fixture her well intentioned but unseeing husband husband has laudable passion his newspaper truth but is sadly ignorant companionship time that any relationship particularly marital one demands i would probably rate this film 8 5 9 out 10 me it didnt have strong emotion any other films i mentioned above or intricate story agantuk stranger color which i believe was his last film but overall charulata is another masterpiece film by satyajit ray with quiet humble yet powerful presentation rather uncommon contemporary film,0.529047619047619,0.1703333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Very good mostly because of its realism and simplicity.,"Recently, I received some very nice emails from someone who appreciated my reviews (there's at least one!) and they recommended I look into the films of Satyajit Ray--particularly ""The Big City"" and ""The Lonely Wife"". I am happy I listened, as I really liked both films--particularly ""The Big City"". The best thing about these films is their ordinariness--how they are about everyday folks and the films are not glamorized or Hollywoodized in the least. The unfortunate thing, however, is that both are pretty lousy prints with relatively poor captions--and both appear to be directly copied from a videotape.Now what I saw in the film and what the summary says are not exactly the same. Perhaps this is due to a mistranslation, or perhaps when the husband says 'brother' it's a diminutive term and the person he's saying it to is actually his cousin, but I sure was under the impression that Amal was Bhapati's brother.Charlu is a lonely lady back in India in 1879. Her husband is the publisher of a newspaper--so she lives in relative luxury but doesn't see enough of him, as he's very busy. So, Bhapati gets the idea to have his family come and live with them. The brother-in-law seems like a good choice to move in with them, as he says he wants to work on the paper and contribute. Amal, however, is a recent college graduate and is not at all interested in doing any work--just write. Quickly Amal and Charlu become friends, as both of them have a common interest--writing. However, this familiarity combined with Bhapati's absence spell disaster--as does trusting the brother-in-law with the paper's finances. There's more to the story than this, but it's best you see it yourself and see it unfold.The acting, writing and direction are very nice--mostly because it seems awfully real. And, if you like Neo-realist films or stories by Majid Majidi, then you should really like ""The Lonely Wife"". Not great but very, very good.",very good mostly because its realism simplicity,recently i received some very nice emails someone who appreciated my reviews theres at least one they recommended i look into films satyajit ray particularly big city lonely wife i am happy i listened as i really liked both films particularly big city best thing about these films is their ordinariness how they are about everyday folks films are not glamorized or hollywoodized least unfortunate thing however is that both are pretty lousy prints with relatively poor captions both appear be directly copied videotape now what i saw film what summary says are not exactly same perhaps this is due mistranslation or perhaps when husband says brother its diminutive term person hes saying it is actually his cousin but i sure was under impression that amal was bhapatis brother charlu is lonely lady back india 1879 her husband is publisher newspaper so she lives relative luxury but doesnt see enough him as hes very busy so bhapati gets idea have his family come live with them brother law seems like good choice move with them as he says he wants work paper contribute amal however is recent college graduate is not at all interested doing any work just write quickly amal charlu become friends as both them have common interest writing however this familiarity combined with bhapatis absence spell disaster as does trusting brother law with papers finances theres more story than this but its best you see it yourself see it unfold acting writing direction are very nice mostly because it seems awfully real if you like neo realist films or stories by majid majidi then you should really like lonely wife not great but very very good,0.4693236714975845,0.17700428194993414,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,Beautiful.,"The film is the masterpiece from Satyajit ray. Even he confessed that it was his best work. The film is obviously the slowest that I have ever seen but its beauty lies in the fact that it gradually develops the relationships and emotions which is very difficult to be filmed. The story revolves around a woman named Charulata who has an inherent talent of writing but is not able to make use of this. She finds it very difficult to pass her time. Brother of her husband comes to live with them and then she started to find solace in his company. How relationships gradually changed as the time passed is portrayed beautifully in this wonderful film from a master filmmaker.PROS: The best thing I found in the film was the acting by Charu. Her eyes said more than was required. Cinematography too was nice and noticeable. The development of affection between two people is the key strength here. The film is definitely slow paced but it certainly kept me interested every minute. The thing that I liked in the cinematography most was the very slow movement of the camera around the two people when they were talking.

10.0,The most perfect Ray movie,"Charulata is Satyajit Ray's masterpiece. No other movie is so brilliantly subtle, so timeless in quality. Indeed, Ray himself described Charulata as the only flawless movie he had directed.Like the Apu trilogy, and many other Ray movies, Charulata deals with universal themes. Unlike the Apu trilogy, Charulata is set in an urbane, intellectual setting. This might be a turn off for some foreign viewers. When it was released in India in 1964, it was deemed controversial because of its depiction of an extramarital relationship. Yet no movie Ray made, not even the celebrated Apu trilogy, treats the themes of love, growth and loyalty with as much insight and sensitivity as Charulata.Every scene in this movie is a gem, there are nuances in every movement, poetry in each look.

,A subtle feminist perspective on love and work,"Charulata displays a subtle story about the contradictions facing a cultivated and intelligent - yet idle - woman in a male-dominated society. Charulata's husband is a very rich man, a liberal intellectual and the editor of a journal ""The Sentinel"", dedicated to the ""propagation of the truth"". Unfortunately, the husband, though an honest man and an idealist, fails to give enough attention to his wife Charulata. The latter is interested in romantic Bengali literature, not politics. Her intellectual perspective thus clashes with that of her husband, who looks down on literature, and in particular on that literature which relates to love.Through a unique understated sentimental experience, which forms the core of the movie, Charulata reveals to herself and her husband a power to act on the world. After a series of difficulties that affect her husband's newspaper and her own sentimental self, Charulata finally takes a step forward and proposes to collaborate with her husband. However, the director makes us doubt that love and work can be reconciled by referring to the title of the Tagore literary work the movie is adapted from, the ""broken nest"".Contrary to what my comments above may suggest, this is NOT a movie with a heavy and obvious political message. The cinematographic style is thus often reminiscent of Jean Renoir's ""Une Partie de Campagne"", with, in particular, the use of a swing. The movie has little dialogue and uses the subtlety of symbols and the actors' facial expressions to convey what the characters go through. The characters are the center of the story as individuals, not archetypes, but it is because they are so credible and complex as individuals that they can make us think about universal questions.",subtle feminist perspective love work,charulata displays subtle story about contradictions facing cultivated intelligent yet idle woman male dominated society charulatas husband is very rich man liberal intellectual editor journal sentinel dedicated propagation truth unfortunately husband though honest man idealist fails give enough attention his wife charulata latter is interested romantic bengali literature not politics her intellectual perspective thus clashes with that her husband who looks down literature particular that literature which relates love through unique understated sentimental experience which forms core movie charulata reveals herself her husband power act world after series difficulties that affect her husbands newspaper her own sentimental self charulata finally takes step forward proposes collaborate with her husband however director makes us doubt that love work can be reconciled by referring title tagore literary work movie is adapted broken nest contrary what my comments above may suggest this is not movie with heavy obvious political message cinematographic style is thus often reminiscent jean renoirs une partie de campagne with particular use swing movie has little dialogue uses subtlety symbols actors facial expressions convey what characters go through characters are center story as individuals not archetypes but it is because they are so credible complex as individuals that they can make us think about universal questions,0.5034356725146198,0.06673976608187135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,Subtle Metaphors and Technical Sophistry within a Rigid Framework of Adaptation!,"Satyajit Ray's Charulata (1964) is considered to be a masterpiece and monument of timeless art and is also accepted as one of the best ever adaptations of a literary piece. The film is an adaptation of a short story named Nashtaneer by Rabindranath Tagore. This review contains Ray's subtle use of metaphors while handling the plot which deserves appreciation along with its other technical perfections.The metaphors used in this film are countable but very much catchy and pleasant if related properly with each other. Ray successfully employed the metaphors within the constraint of film techniques. The mentionable metaphors are Charu's opera-glass, caged birds, carpet-shoe and Sentinel newspaper etc. In the very poetic opening sequence of the film is not bereft of any intention by the director. The use of opera-glass vision or binocular-vision (which is masked-shot to be precise) is very grabbing. Charu sees the world through opera-glass. Even she sees her husband Bhupati with it once. The immediate and swift zoom-out after the gaze is praiseworthy. In the film, Charu sees the world through it but whoever she sees goes out of her limited vision. She cannot but forced to let them go out of her vision. By the end of the film, she once again takes refuge to her glasses. The focus of her glasses (a boat) moves on. The only person static in her opera-glass is Amal as seen in the garden sequence. But Amal sneaks off at last rendering Charu's opera-glass a constant metaphor of both escapism and a means of escape. Two times in the film, caged birds are seen within the frame of a shot's composition. That is a perfect metaphor for representing Charu and Amal to some extent as if they can fly but within a limited confinement where flying does not even mean anything fruitful. The carpet-shoe metaphor is a perfect example of Charu's growing weakness for Amal. Charu knitted the pair of shoe with meticulous attention for Bhupati. This was a sign of her loyalty to her husband. But she presents it to Amal and it was clear that she was presenting her affinity for Amal by doing this. When Amal leaves, she angrily collects the pair of shoe from Amal's room but there is no indication that she will give it to Bhupati either. The metaphoric indication is clear _ Charu can never present her love to anyone anymore. The Sentinel newspaper is last but not the least metaphor here. It shifts its representational position which makes it an interesting metaphor. At first it was a symbol of Bhupati's workaholic mind and was appreciable. Then it turns itself as an image of political consciousness of Bhupati and thus assumes a negative connotation to the viewer. It is because Bhupati's obsession with politics fruits a chasm in a social relationship between him and his wife Charu. Then the newspaper becomes a symbol of Bhupati's failure. At the last freeze shot, a copy of the newspaper is seen which connotes itself to be nothing more than a scrap and thus a metonymy of a broken house. Among other metaphors, betel and Bishwabondhu magazine are prominent ones.It is literally very tough to find flaws with editing of such a meticulously knitted film. In fact, there is none to be mentioned. The transition between scenes is smoothed by very charming fade-ins and fade-outs. There are cuts but torrent of the plot remains uninterrupted. It must be mentioned that superimposition used in order to ensure the transition between scenes were very successful. The most interesting was the last three freezes. It is at once appreciable and bears evidence of cinematic craftsmanship of Satyajit Ray. He was accused by a critic that Charulata has been a bad adaptation. But within the technical sophistication of a film; the necessity of deducing, adding and altering is technically and literally undeniable. Thus the subtlety of editing makes Charulata one of the most entertaining and pioneering films in Bengali of all times. The editing aids to condense the story within an accepted time frame. In a nutshell, the crafty editing makes Charulata even critics' favourite as well.",subtle metaphors technical sophistry within rigid framework adaptation,satyajit rays charulata 1964 is considered be masterpiece monument timeless art is also accepted as one best ever adaptations literary piece film is adaptation short story named nashtaneer by rabindranath tagore this review contains rays subtle use metaphors while handling plot which deserves appreciation along with its other technical perfections metaphors used this film are countable but very much catchy pleasant if related properly with each other ray successfully employed metaphors within constraint film techniques mentionable metaphors are charus opera glass caged birds carpet shoe sentinel newspaper etc very poetic opening sequence film is not bereft any intention by director use opera glass vision or binocular vision which is masked shot be precise is very grabbing charu sees world through opera glass even she sees her husband bhupati with it once immediate swift zoom out after gaze is praiseworthy film charu sees world through it but whoever she sees goes out her limited vision she cannot but forced let them go out her vision by end film she once again takes refuge her glasses focus her glasses boat moves only person static her opera glass is amal as seen garden sequence but amal sneaks off at last rendering charus opera glass constant metaphor both escapism means escape two times film caged birds are seen within frame shots composition that is perfect metaphor representing charu amal some extent as if they can fly but within limited confinement where flying does not even mean anything fruitful carpet shoe metaphor is perfect example charus growing weakness amal charu knitted pair shoe with meticulous attention bhupati this was sign her loyalty her husband but she presents it amal it was clear that she was presenting her affinity amal by doing this when amal leaves she angrily collects pair shoe amals room but there is no indication that she will give it bhupati either metaphoric indication is clear charu can never present her love anyone anymore sentinel newspaper is last but not least metaphor here it shifts its representational position which makes it interesting metaphor at first it was symbol bhupatis workaholic mind was appreciable then it turns itself as image political consciousness bhupati thus assumes negative connotation viewer it is because bhupatis obsession with politics fruits chasm social relationship between him his wife charu then newspaper becomes symbol bhupatis failure at last freeze shot copy newspaper is seen which connotes itself be nothing more than scrap thus metonymy broken house among other metaphors betel bishwabondhu magazine are prominent ones it is literally very tough find flaws with editing such meticulously knitted film fact there is none be mentioned transition between scenes is smoothed by very charming fade ins fade outs there are cuts but torrent plot remains uninterrupted it must be mentioned that superimposition used order ensure transition between scenes were very successful most interesting was last three freezes it is at once appreciable bears evidence cinematic craftsmanship satyajit ray he was accused by critic that charulata has been bad adaptation but within technical sophistication film necessity deducing adding altering is technically literally undeniable thus subtlety editing makes charulata one most entertaining pioneering films bengali all times editing aids condense story within accepted time frame nutshell crafty editing makes charulata even critics favourite as well,0.46529859484777514,0.15786755139214156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"

9.0,"Longing, Disappointment, Reconciliation","""Charulata"" (1964) was my first Ray, I think, some ten years ago. I haven't seen it since, but thanks to the Criterion Collection, it can now be viewed in beautiful high definition. They have, at this writing, released ""Jalsaghar"" (1958) and ""Mahanagar"" (1963) in addition to this (speaking of Blu-ray), and have thrown in ""Kapurush"" (1965) as an extra on the latter, and a DVD of later Ray. Not only this, but Artificial Eye, the European rights-holders, have already released some more not available on Criterion yet, ""Nayak"" (1966) and ""Mahapurush"" (1965).All I can remember from that magical first viewing is I fell in love. Not sure why, or how, but that the feeling was strong, and as if mutual. And true enough, Ray's cinema makes us learn about ourselves and others: music and song, writing and reading, seeing and not seeing. As if I had seen myself, not as I truly see myself but as I wish to have been seen, or even further than that, how I could have been seen.Ray frames many introductory shots through doorways. To lead us into her life? To observe the observer? To confine the confined? To hint at the escape? Ray has the one of a kind ability to make one feel present, like one's really there; nothing has to happen, and it's spellbinding. By the way, has the hypnotic first shot been taken by Jane Campion to her ""Bright Star"" (2009)?Books are introduced in the very beginning, as are the binoculars used by Charulata. Both motifs used in the sense of seeing afar, yet not seeing close. And when they finally do, they will discover themselves. The genius that he is, Ray is able to show inner turmoil in nature's violence (the wind), just as he did in ""Jalsaghar"". That moment of discovery is laden with great anxiety to bursts through so strongly one can feel it deep in the fibre one's being: the longing, the disappointment, the reconciliation.",longing disappointment reconciliation,charulata 1964 was my first ray i think some ten years ago i havent seen it since but thanks criterion collection it can now be viewed beautiful high definition they have at this writing released jalsaghar 1958 mahanagar 1963 addition this speaking blu ray have thrown kapurush 1965 as extra latter dvd later ray not only this but artificial eye european rights holders have already released some more not available criterion yet nayak 1966 mahapurush 1965 all i can remember that magical first viewing is i fell love not sure why or how but that feeling was strong as if mutual true enough rays cinema makes us learn about ourselves others music song writing reading seeing not seeing as if i had seen myself not as i truly see myself but as i wish have been seen or even further than that how i could have been seen ray frames many introductory shots through doorways lead us into her life observe observer confine confined hint at escape ray has one kind ability make one feel present like ones really there nothing has happen its spellbinding by way has hypnotic first shot been taken by jane campion her bright star 2009 books are introduced very beginning as are binoculars used by charulata both motifs used sense seeing afar yet not seeing close when they finally do they will discover themselves genius that he is ray is able show inner turmoil natures violence wind just as he did jalsaghar that moment discovery is laden with great anxiety bursts through so strongly one can feel it deep fibre ones being longing disappointment reconciliation,0.4940895061728394,0.16462962962962965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,A lullaby of a film,"Satyajit Ray is so good at staging his scenes from inside the minds of his characters, and I think it is why he was so successful at crossing over to foreign audiences - his empathy for the people behind his characters. He always reached to get beyond the simple exchange of dialog - watching a Ray film is watching him carefully invade the mind of his creations. Their flaws, their desires, their loves all seem so universal coming from his camera. The photography is one of the greatest joys of Charulata, as in most of his films - the camera feels so free, so unbound to any set formula or rule of how to operate it, the joy of the operator (Ray himself) so apparent. It glides throughout all of his films, playing the eyes of some omniscient presence the characters are sometimes semi aware of. We are jolted when they look into the camera and sing, but because we have been already lulled into his world it feels completely natural that they would sing to us. Charulata is slower, more obtuse than some of Ray's earlier films, and it feels longer. I was underwhelmed by the story, which I felt took too many left turns.

9.0,Brilliant film from Satyajit Ray,"This beautiful film from Director Satyajit Ray has a lot of things going for it, the story of repressed passion, of course, but also elements of philosophy and politics, as well as some absolutely sumptuous sets. Based on Tagore's novella 'Nastanirh', which itself was based on Tagore's own attraction to his brother's wife, 'Charulata' tells the tale of the growing attraction between a cousin (Amal, played by Soumitra Chatterjee) who visits a newspaper publisher (Shailen Mukherjee), and the publisher's wife, Charulata (Madhabi Mukherjee). The pair are encouraged to spend time together by the publisher, who loves his wife but is too busy with his job to spend time with her, and the feelings they begin to have are subtle and begin with discussions of writing. There are some nice moments with Amal singing to Charulata, as well as a fantastic scene with her swinging while he lays in the grass beside her. This is a subtle, deft, perfectly told story; the betrayal is contained to emotions, not physical acts, and is more powerful as a result. All of the actors turn in excellent performances, and Ray's direction is brilliant. The philosophical moments elevate the film ala Bergman, and here are a couple of quotes:""I was thinking all of life is like a rhythm. Birthdeath. Daynight. Happinesssorrow. Meetingparting. Like the waves on the ocean, now risingnow falling. One complements the other."" ""Even as Prince Abhimanyu, while still in the womb, learned only how to penetrate enemy formations, but not how to withdraw. So a river, emerging from the mountain's rocky womb, can only advance and knows not how to turn back. O river! O youth! O time! O world! You too can only march onward.

There is a humour and lightness of touch that is very refreshing. I particularly liked the contrast between the newspaper editor husband who clearly takes his work very seriously, and the lack of fulfilment or focus in other people's lives around him. Acting, cinematography, lighting, sound, locations, shot composition, all are done so well, and the story is accessible enough to make it enjoyable to any audience.

10.0,Women would probably better appreciate the realism in this movie.,"Apart from the sophisticated acting and cinematography, this film carries very deep social and moral messages which are not dumped on the viewer in a preachy manner. However, Charulata has been criticised often to be slow in its pace. As a Bengali, I have watched this movie multiple times while growing up and frankly I never understood the movie. In the age of Facebook and Twitter, I used to think that there is hardly a relevance of a story set in 19th century Bengal. On the contrary, I now find the movie highly thoughtful and deeply affecting. Certainly, I get the historical context better and I am an adult with my own experiences in love and betrayal but there's something else. Charulata is by no means slow paced. Rather, its pace aptly conveys the humdrum life of the title character - a lonely wife. I am not a woman but I believe that the refined feminist references in this film would be better interpreted by a woman critic. Whether or not you are aware of the impact of Bankim Chandra's literary works on Bangla society. Charulata is the interplay of inner feelings and insecurities that creep into our lives. Charulata is the realisation that no matter what our intentions may be, our relationships are as fragile as a bird's nest and a strong wind can take it down easily. Although we may not hear the sound of a relationship breaking, we know that things will never be the same. The original story on which this movie is based was by Rabindranath Tagore and conspicuously named 'Nashta-Nirh' (Broken Nest). I think Tagore wrote the story with a slight autobiographical connotation where he identified himself as a young struggling writer Amal in the shadow of Bankim Chandra who was an established writer when Tagore was still unknown. Tagore's personal attachment towards his elder brother's wife and the very important role of his elder brother in his life also seem to echo through this story.

8.0,Slow-paced Satyajit Ray Classic.,"My Rating : 8/10Satyajit Ray recreated life and atmosphere of late nineteenth-century, pre-independence India in this classic drama based upon the novella Nastanirh (""The Broken Nest"") by Rabindranath Tagore.'Charulata' is a delicately textured tale of a marriage in jeopardy and a woman taking the first steps toward establishing her own voice. Often rated the director's finest film-and the one that, when pressed, he would name as his own personal favorite: ""It's the one with the fewest flaws"" - It's widely believed that the story was inspired by Tagore's relationship with his sister-in-law, Kadambari Devi, who committed suicide in 1884 for reasons that have never been fully explained.The richness of characterization and that breathless grace and radiance Ray manages to draw from his actors is all alive here - A must-see gem for a patient intellectual viewer.",slow paced satyajit ray classic,my rating 8 10satyajit ray recreated life atmosphere late nineteenth century pre independence india this classic drama based upon novella nastanirh broken nest by rabindranath tagore charulata is delicately textured tale marriage jeopardy woman taking first steps toward establishing her own voice often rated directors finest film one that when pressed he would name as his own personal favorite its one with fewest flaws its widely believed that story was inspired by tagores relationship with his sister law kadambari devi who committed suicide 1884 reasons that have never been fully explained richness characterization that breathless grace radiance ray manages draw his actors is all alive here must see gem patient intellectual viewer,0.5333333333333334,0.09166666666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,Never again can this magic be recreated!,"Ray tagged Charulata as ""one of his favourite films"" and as an observer and a Ray-addict, I would call it his most perfect creation out of his 29 films-old filmography. Not a frame is out of place, all the subtle nuances are mesmerisingly captured and detailed almost like a Mughal portrait.The film follows the suppressed sexual emotions of Charulata, whose loneliness is seen through the carelessness of her husband for her and through brilliant metaphors like a bird's cage or the iron grills of a window. Emotional repressions lead to a tumultuous upheaval when Amal, her husband's cousin storms into her life. Ray sets his work in the late 19th century when patriarchal society did not allow a woman to vent out her feelings and adds a distinguished and unique dimension to Rabindranath's novella, ""Nashtanirh"". The film unfolds in a majestic pace, never too slow and never too fast, through intelligent dialogues and a masterstroke of a screenplay - scenes like the one where Charu uses her binocular to gaze at Amal and then at the mother carrying her child, almost throw the viewers off their feet. Ray's direction is aptly supported by a a viciously sublime performance by the protagonist. Madhabi Mukherjee makes Charulata her own, her spiralling gazes and the movement of those eyes give it the aura of a silent film. She makes Charu an embodiment of most women in that age and even in the future - the angst, the intensity and the pangs culminate in one of the best performances by an actress that the world has ever seen and without doubt, the best in the country. Soumitra Chatterjee amply supports her and brings a beautiful mix of innocence and masculinity to the role ; so does Sailen Mukherjee and the other actors. Tagore's songs set the mood for every emotion in this movie.All in all, its a movie for every hardcore enthusiast who loves cinema and a masterpiece from the master himself.
