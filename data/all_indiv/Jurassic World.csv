7,"Spielberg Magic, This Is Not. Still, a Visit to Jurassic World Is Worth the Price of Admission.","You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It's better than the original"". Don't believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg's own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn't hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood ""event"" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let's just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg's magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D'Onofrio's bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen Grady, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire Dearing, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. Both are really likable in doses, and the script doesn't subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. While Owen and Claire are cliched, and ultimately uninteresting, as characters, the charm and sheer star power of Pratt and Dallas-Howard are quite enough to bolster JW's brand of disposable summer adventuring.There's a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond's dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating. However, when the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, the scientists of Jurassic World are prompted to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that's a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, ""How does this stuff keep happening?"", but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter into a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I've seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn't have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.There is one aspect of the film that I love, and that is the design of the Jurassic World Resort. The care that went into perfecting the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and it is filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was ""intended"". The immersion lasts throughout, even as the prehistoric psycho-killer, and all the destruction that it brings, takes center stage. Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow's filmmaking starts to show its deficiencies. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it's all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it's foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and suspense. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from The Lost World. They were exhilarating because of their selective restraint. Without showing everything, Spielberg made scenes that were subtle and scary, and that exploded to life at just the right moments. Jurassic World's action scenes are big, loud, and entertaining, but it's all chaos, no technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up dozens of machine gun toting mercenaries, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight, and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It's the kind of Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment that can be loads of fun to watch while you're there but doesn't leave the lasting impact of truly great action.So it is with Jurassic World. The movie is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the exact same feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg's first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and entertaining, but let's be clear, when it's all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 74/100",spielberg magic this is not still visit jurassic world is worth price

A problem arises he not following instructions and eats another dinosaur .All hell breaks loose when he jumps the wall and terrorizes the customers the customer of the park making a nice meal out of some of the worker and security guards .The dinosaurs were so realistic and were digitally created . Earlier Jurissic Park had used some puppets .The movie is made in style of an amusement park .It seems that the character development is shorter for the sake of the action.In some out takes that was shown ,flat, indicated that may be some of the shots should have been kept of the character development.It was not even.Did you see the little old fashion camera that the smaller nephew was carrying?could indicate Hollywood dislike towards home digital cameras?Chis originally did a you tube joke about him getting a job in Spielberg's next Jurassic movie .I think it was you tube.His dreams came true. Another problem was that the characters and the whole atmosphere of the movies and sets were cold and stoic.Even the kissing scene was cold and the family reunion scene,which Claire's sisters husband was played by Andy Buckley, was also not warm..E.T ,Poltergeists and Star Wars was far more Warmer.What's the problem?I am afraid it's a real world currently problems in general.Hollywood has always pretentiously serve the establishment ,for profit,then claims they serve the masses.This movie reflects our phony liberal side of big business and the wealthy running our government and exploiting the animal rights and environmentalist ,who are desperate for a quick answer to protect animals and the environment as well a s fanatics and those who have a contempt against the human race ,due to constant warmongering ,for profit and political power.This reflects pitting animals and the environment against humans ,very subtle, in this film,but,this is an outer problem.In spite of this it is an excellence film,Gorgeous sets and realistic dinosaurs ,Bryce in her 1970's hair do,which has become popular again and handsome leading man Chris Pratt.I was certainly satisfied with this movie.Both 3D and flat were good. The sound was arousing and excellent .No out of synchronizing problems here,since both images are in a folder stabled .Great for Dino fans and 3D fans. 10/21/15",great 3d movie,this film combines stories taken king kong lost world 25 version bryce dallas howard plays bitchy corporate executive who cant get with her nephews christmas holidays played by ty simpkins nick robinson that her sister has sent them visit played by judy greer bryce works huge corporate amusement park that focuses dinosaurs bryce cant make time her nephews so they wonder their own she troubled working personal relationships with dinosaur trainer activist play by new movie star chris prat though owner designer park irrfan kahn who is more concerned about people having fun than how much profit has increased chris has problem working relationship with vincent vincent believes that dinosaurs should focus killing each other but chris believes they should be trained peace well there is one dinosaur that was create artificially new part park be open soon i call him t rex kong problem arises he not following instructions eats another dinosaur all hell breaks loose when he jumps wall terrorizes customers customer park making nice meal out some worker security guards dinosaurs were so realistic were digitally created earlier jurissic park had used some puppets movie is made style amusement park it seems that character development is shorter sake action some out takes that was shown flat indicated that may be some shots should have been kept character development it was not even did you see little old fashion camera that smaller nephew was carrying could indicate hollywood dislike towards home digital cameras chis originally did you tube joke about him getting job spielbergs next jurassic movie i think it was you tube his dreams came true another problem was that characters whole atmosphere movies sets were cold stoic even kissing scene was cold family reunion scene which claires sisters husband was played by andy buckley was also not warm e t poltergeists star wars was far more warmer whats problem i am afraid its real world currently problems general hollywood has always pretentiously serve establishment profit then claims they serve masses this movie reflects our phony liberal side big business wealthy running our government exploiting animal rights environmentalist who are desperate quick answer protect animals environment as well s fanatics those who have contempt against human race due constant warmongering profit political power this reflects pitting animals environment against humans very subtle this film but this is outer problem spite this it is excellence film gorgeous sets realistic dinosaurs bryce her 1970s hair do which has become popular again handsome leading man chris pratt i was certainly satisfied with this movie both 3d flat were good sound was arousing excellent no out synchronizing problems here since both images are folder stabled great dino fans 3d fans 10 21 15,0.5106495199715537,0.12740063608707677,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.54}"
7,"Not a patch on the original Jurassic Park, and is an uneven film, but by far the best of the sequels","The original Jurassic Park still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. The Lost World has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and Jurassic Park 3 was even more disappointing.Jurassic World is not a patch on the first Jurassic Park and I didn't quite find it the return to form that it has been touted as, but for all its faults and uneven parts it is a massive improvements on the previous two sequels and is an entertaining film in its own right that does more right than it does wrong.First things off, Jurassic World is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indominus Rex, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when she is stalking her prey it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for Jurassic Park, which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.The film's homages are most enjoyable and give the film a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good of thrills and scares to be had. The latter half is often very exciting, the film is efficiently directed, doing nicely in maintaining the tension, and the acting is good (though one does wish that the characters were written better). Chris Pratt has a likable and warm presence, as well as a nice wit, and Bryce Dallas Howard is similarly good even with the most problematically written character. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a real effort making his somewhat one-note and underused character more interesting than he deserves to be and does bring some intensity.However, Jurassic World does contain some large problems. Not all the acting works, Judy Greer for my tastes was annoying in places and the children's acting was often too forced and their back story goes nowhere. The script and story are uneven, with the script it has its moments but it can be a bit muddled, as a result of trying to do too much at times, some of the dialogue is very weak and can induce cringes and some of the reversals are really out of place. It also could have done a much better developing the characters, because they felt very underdeveloped and clichéd, especially Claire, and any character arcs come off clumsily or aren't explored enough, particularly for the children. Owen and Claire's romance can slow the film down and does contain some forced dialogue. The story is at least never really dull, and excites more than it limps, but at the same time it does lack the wonder, consistent suspense, smartness and originality that Jurassic Park had. It does feel like a too predictable rehash at times, does feel muddled tonally, the exposition in the first half hour does go on for far too long and doesn't really say anything interesting and the ending is too silly and anti-climactic for my tastes.All in all, uneven and not on the same level as the original Jurassic Park, but a very entertaining well made film and by far the best of the sequels. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",not patch original jurassic park is uneven film but by far best sequels,original jurassic park still is personal favourite it is enormously fun thrilling with some nail biting moments brilliantly made film with one john williams most memorable main themes scene stealing dinosaurs lost world has its admirers but me it was major step down one spielbergs weakest films jurassic park 3 was even more disappointing jurassic world is not patch first jurassic park i didnt quite find it return form that it has been touted as but all its faults uneven parts it is massive improvements previous two sequels is entertaining film its own right that does more right than it does wrong first things off jurassic world is incredibly well made film its beautifully shot with scenery thats both colourful atmospheric dinosaurs look wonderful dinosaurs also steal film not just their designs but also that theyre lots fun are scary their scenes are great watch there could have been even more than there were this is especially true with indominus rex who is chillingly bloodthirsty when she is stalking her prey its enough be glued ones seat then jump out it michael giacchinos music score is positively stirring even includes themes williams score jurassic park which was just lovely homage fits within rest scoring beautifully films homages are most enjoyable give film nostalgic quality some it is savvy funny while not as much as original theres still good thrills scares be had latter half is often very exciting film is efficiently directed doing nicely maintaining tension acting is good though one does wish that characters were written better chris pratt has likable warm presence as well as nice wit bryce dallas howard is similarly good even with most problematically written character vincent donofrio makes real effort making his somewhat one note underused character more interesting than he deserves be does bring some intensity however jurassic world does contain some large problems not all acting works judy greer my tastes was annoying places childrens acting was often too forced their back story goes nowhere script story are uneven with script it has its moments but it can be bit muddled as result trying do too much at times some dialogue is very weak can induce cringes some reversals are really out place it also could have done much better developing characters because they felt very underdeveloped clich d especially claire any character arcs come off clumsily or arent explored enough particularly children owen claires romance can slow film down does contain some forced dialogue story is at least never really dull excites more than it limps but at same time it does lack wonder consistent suspense smartness originality that jurassic park had it does feel like too predictable rehash at times does feel muddled tonally exposition first half hour does go far too long doesnt really say anything interesting ending is too silly anti climactic my tastes all all uneven not same level as original jurassic park but very entertaining well made film by far best sequels 6 5 10 bethany cox,0.5315584058405842,0.20491131255982736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,"Despite Clichés and Predicability, The Movie Still Rocked!","I knew right from the get-go that this would not be as good as the original 1993 masterpiece. The only thing I wondered was if it would be in the same league. Although not as good, it is inferior by little. Although not a masterpiece, I call it a ""near-masterpiece"" like The Outsiders and The Aviator.This is the first Jurassic movie where the theme park is actually open and tourists check it out. This does a great job in capturing what it would look like if there actually was a dinosaur park. Lex and Tim are not in it and the two brothers that plays the main kids are much inferior and stereotypes of modern kids. I couldn't help but laugh at them. They weren't dumb, but not good either. It was a flaw I liked and let fly by. Chris Pratt is a raptor-tamer who is also a stereotypical sensitive hero. He is no Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum, but I had a similar reaction to him as I did with Neill and Goldblum. Bryce Dallas Howard is the the most realistic and multilayer ed character as one of the park's heads. She is the boys' aunt and becomes Pratt's girl. The relationship between the two is a dead giveaway. So the characters are flawed, but still likable.The actual story is a bit worse than the characters. The scientists try to breed different dinosaurs together to make really cool new kinds. Why? To build up tourists. Dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and have been alive again for over 20 years in the movie. What kind of person would get bored seeing dinosaurs? It would take about 100 years for humans to get bored with dinosaurs. Even if it were true, look at renowned animal parks like Marine Land. They have regular animals but it's always wonderful to see. But the scientists wanting a new kind of dinosaur was cool. The new dinosaur they make is actually pretty cool, kinda like Godzilla. It escapes and everybody must evacuate. It becomes a regular monster movie from there, with every cliché in the book being thrown at you. At least the clichés were taken advantage of. There's lots of suspense built around and jump scares that were mastered. When the dinosaurs raise hell and battle each other, it feels like you're a kid watching a cartoon special. The movie pretty much is a cartoon special since most dinosaurs are noticeably computers.So despite the lack of wow and wide range of emotions that 1993's gave and having forgivable flaws, Jurassic World is one of the year's best.3.5/4",despite clich s predicability movie still rocked,i knew right get go that this would not be as good as original 1993 masterpiece only thing i wondered was if it would be same league although not as good it is inferior by little although not masterpiece i call it near masterpiece like outsiders aviator this is first jurassic movie where theme park is actually open tourists check it out this does great job capturing what it would look like if there actually was dinosaur park lex tim are not it two brothers that plays main kids are much inferior stereotypes modern kids i couldnt help but laugh at them they werent dumb but not good either it was flaw i liked let fly by chris pratt is raptor tamer who is also stereotypical sensitive hero he is no sam neill or jeff goldblum but i had similar reaction him as i did with neill goldblum bryce dallas howard is most realistic multilayer ed character as one parks heads she is boys aunt becomes pratts girl relationship between two is dead giveaway so characters are flawed but still likable actual story is bit worse than characters scientists try breed different dinosaurs together make really cool new kinds why build up tourists dinosaurs have been extinct 65 million years have been alive again over 20 years movie what kind person would get bored seeing dinosaurs it would take about 100 years humans get bored with dinosaurs even if it were true look at renowned animal parks like marine land they have regular animals but its always wonderful see but scientists wanting new kind dinosaur was cool new dinosaur they make is actually pretty cool kinda like godzilla it escapes everybody must evacuate it becomes regular monster movie there with every clich book being thrown at you at least clich s were taken advantage theres lots suspense built around jump scares that were mastered when dinosaurs raise hell battle each other it feels like youre kid watching cartoon special movie pretty much is cartoon special since most dinosaurs are noticeably computers so despite lack wow wide range emotions that 1993s gave having forgivable flaws jurassic world is one years best 3 5 4,0.5516561025181713,0.16258490073145243,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"

Garbage. The one redeeming feature is for about 5 seconds you get to see astoundingly beautiful nature. First time I've loathed Vincent D'Onofrio and I never thought I'd say that. The other actors could have been pulled straight out of Days of our Lives, complete with faces that did not move a muscle, even when in a state of supposed terror. Who willingly makes this kind of utter trash? I hope this is the last one. Leave the dino's where they belong, in the past!Totally forgettable and moronic waste of time.

6,Essentially unnecessary eye-candy...,"I only got around to watch the fourth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise about a year after it was released upon the world. Why? Well, after a steadily sloping series of movies, then I wasn't in any particular hurry to get around to watch the most recent of the movies, it being ""Jurassic World"".And now having seen it, I must admit that this was visually a beautiful movie. As was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie back in 1993 when it was first released. And it did offer some adequate entertainment, for sure. But everything here had essentially been presented to the audience throughout the course of the three previous movies. Sure there was the thing with the Indominus Rex creation that stood out. But wasn't it just a twist on the gene manipulation and reproduction that essentially sparked the first dinosaur in the first movie?The acting in the movie was good, although you should not expect any great thespian or Shakespearian moments throughout the course of the movie. People did adequate jobs with what they had to work with from a fairly limiting script and storyline.The CGI is what carried this movie, as it has been with the entire series since the first movie. And the dinosaurs are quite life-like and realistic to look at - taking into consideration that we only got fossils to compare appearances with.The movie does bear some sarcastic permeation of American consumerism, in terms of everything has to be bigger and better. And look how it turned out in the first, second and third movie. So it makes you wonder why they still haven't learned their lesson and continued on with a new dinosaur amusement park.While ""Jurassic World"" is certainly an entertaining movie and a visual treat for the eyes, then it is hardly a revolutionary movie, nor is it a movie that really were particularly necessary to the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise.",essentially unnecessary eye candy,i only got around watch fourth installment jurassic park franchise about year after it was released upon world why well after steadily sloping series movies then i wasnt any particular hurry get around watch most recent movies it being jurassic world now having seen it i must admit that this was visually beautiful movie as was first jurassic park movie back 1993 when it was first released it did offer some adequate entertainment sure but everything here had essentially been presented audience throughout course three previous movies sure there was thing with indominus rex creation that stood out but wasnt it just twist gene manipulation reproduction that essentially sparked first dinosaur first movie acting movie was good although you should not expect any great thespian or shakespearian moments throughout course movie people did adequate jobs with what they had work with fairly limiting script storyline cgi is what carried this movie as it has been with entire series since first movie dinosaurs are quite life like realistic look at taking into consideration that we only got fossils compare appearances with movie does bear some sarcastic permeation american consumerism terms everything has be bigger better look how it turned out first second third movie so it makes you wonder why they still havent learned their lesson continued with new dinosaur amusement park while jurassic world is certainly entertaining movie visual treat eyes then it is hardly revolutionary movie nor is it movie that really were particularly necessary jurassic park franchise,0.45363389997536346,0.19011456023651147,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,Another watchable instalment,"17 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jurassic World. Let's just say I'm a BIG fan of these movies, right from the minute we saw Sir Richard Attenborough clutching that cane with the amber head, I was hooked. I don't care that it's fiction and highly improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise. To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten. I watched it in 3D, and I'm selective about the films I watch in 3D these days, but I have to say I was pretty darn good.

3,"A 3 is generous. Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid","Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me.

10,"A great science fiction movie, a take off on the Frankenstein story. Total mayhem on the screen.","This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.",great science fiction movie take off frankenstein story total mayhem screen,this movie is about what happens when people dabble areas research that are best be left alone it is about what happens when military business interests conspire engage projects without any outside controls it is about what happens when people become smug complacent point recklessness it is about what happens when science is perverted sake profit it is about what happens when caution is tossed into wind it is about what happens when nature is violated it is about what happens when freaks nature are produced all worst reasons it is about what happens when scientist loses his moral compass it is about arrogance man it is about consequences unrestrained materialism this movie contains all elements great science fiction movie first it has excellent highly inventive story idea dinosaurs working with humans is engaging its rationale as explained movie is not beyond realm plausibility second special effects are spectacular movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species dinosaurs some friendly some lethal third dinosaurs are not demonized instead they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated fourth story includes good guys bad guys fifth action is nonstop principle characters are literally running throughout movie sixth script includes many clever corny lines that evoke laughter seventh movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed profit cast is excellent vincent donfrio is especially strong as head park security who is actually sell out profiteers but biggest star are special effects which this movie are entirely necessary no way gratuitous this movie succeed as drama it has be able depict total mayhem terror caused by irresponsible conduct those who sacrificed public good make quick buck one other point this movie succeeds drawing other great science fiction movies like predator frankenstein jurassic park produce original unique powerful dramatic story,0.539387031408308,0.23558763931104357,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,An instant classic that lives up to the original and improves upon it.,"Jurassic World is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park(1993). Jurassic World is a fully functioning dinosaur theme park & has fully realized John Hammond's dream all those years back, of creating such a spectacle(John Hammond appeared in Jurassic Park, played by the wonderful Richard Attenborough). Jurassic World has been in operation for about ten years. However, the theme park's visitors have been steadily losing interest in the dinosaurs, over the years. The scientists who have created these dinosaurs come up with a plan to reignite visitors' interest in the park. On the order of the chief executives who own Jurassic World, the scientists create a new & terrifying genetically modified dinosaur to up the 'scare & wow' factor of Jurassic World & bring the park to its former glory. Unfortunately, this new 'attraction' escapes. Now, it is up to a dinosaur handler named Owen(Chris Pratt) & Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard), one of the head employees at Jurassic World, with help from the technical team of Jurassic World to find & stop the dinosaur before all hell breaks loose at the park. Jurassic World is a fantastic movie! When I first saw the trailer of the film, I was intrigued. I thought, there's no way it can match up to Steven Spielberg's 1993 cult classic. However, I was pretty sure that it would be better than the slightly disappointing sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park(1997) & Jurassic Park III(2001). With a great cast & Spielberg executive producing, I knew this movie would come darn close to being as good as the original. Then, I watched it. This movie blew my mind & roared past my monstrous expectations! Not only does it capture the magic of the original film but also, modernizes the Jurassic Park movies for a new generation of viewers. The viewers will get excited when they see the huge gates of Jurassic World open & enter this incredible park. The 3D lets us see Isla Nublar(the island where Jurassic World is located) in all its magnificence. All the dinosaur set pieces look amazing in 3D. You actually feel like the dinosaurs are chasing you, roaring at you & creeping towards you. One of my favorite set pieces in the movie is the pterodactyl set piece. This is just one set piece out of many superb set pieces involving dinosaurs. I love the fact that the chaos involving dinosaurs doesn't take place immediately. This way, there's a growing feeling of dread during the early stages of the film. This adds to the overall thrill factor of the movie. The special effects are outstanding. The dinosaurs look even more realistic than they did in the previous Jurassic Park films. I liked Jurassic World better than Jurassic Park(1993). Director Colin Trevorrow ably takes the reins from Steven Spielberg & makes a movie that both fans & newcomers will love. Another reason the movie is so great is because, all the actors give us superb renditions of their characters. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen. After delivering three back-to-back hits with The Lego Movie(2014), Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) & Jurassic World, Pratt has clearly established himself as the latest Hollywood superstar. Bryce Dallas Howard is superb as Claire. Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Hoskins. Ty Simpkins is adorable as Gray. Irrfan Khan is charismatic as Simon Masrani. Nick Robinson is great as Zach. Jake Johnson is hysterical as Lowery. Omar Sy is effective as Barry. BD Wong is impressive as Dr. Henry Wu. Judy Greer is good as Karen. Jurassic World will satisfy fans of the original film & will gain millions of new fans.

God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla.

8,"Derivative, but fun","This film loses points for being essentially a rehash of the original, excessively CGI, and having a random divorce subplot that isn't expounded upon or resolved. However, it scores point for the new twists that it added to the original formula. In the original the park wasn't open yet and only a small tour group was in danger when the dinosaurs broke out. In this film it was cool to see the park open and flourishing. And then having the dinosaurs break out and threaten the park when it was full of thousands of tourists added to the stakes and intensity. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard had great chemistry. The film had ample humor. In the end it was an overly rehashed reboot, but loads of fun in the spirit and wonder of the original.",derivative but fun,this film loses points being essentially rehash original excessively cgi having random divorce subplot that isnt expounded upon or resolved however it scores point new twists that it added original formula original park wasnt open yet only small tour group was danger when dinosaurs broke out this film it was cool see park open flourishing then having dinosaurs break out threaten park when it was full thousands tourists added stakes intensity chris pratt bryce dallas howard had great chemistry film had ample humor end it was overly rehashed reboot but loads fun spirit wonder original,0.5446969696969697,0.13257575757575757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
3,Definitive Proof That This Is A One-Story Franchise,"""Jurassic World"" was guaranteed to turn a large profit no matter if it was ""good"" or ""bad"". The franchise is quite popular and it just has that ""summer blockbuster"" feel to it. Sadly, I wish that the film's creators would have attempted to make the plot of the film even decent, or create characters that aren't wooden caricatures.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic World"" sees the vision of Mr. Hammond finally complete...a fully-functional dinosaur amusement park. Of course, in today's ""bigger and better"" society, it isn't good enough just to reproduce classic dinosaurs. Now, new dinos (one bigger than T-Rex and another that can swallow a shark in a single gulp, among others) are being genetically spliced and created in a lab. The park is run by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a profit-driven corporate executive type who doesn't even have time for her two nephews (played by Nick Robinson & Ty Simpkins) when they visit the park. Dinosaur caretaker Owen (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is fully aware of what these dangerous animals can do if not reckoned with. A military sub-plot simmers in the background of the story. The new ""big boy"" dinosaur gets loose, and from there it is what one would expect from this type of film.This movie features an ethical debate about genetic manipulation, two annoying kids who are the definition of stupidity, a lot of rampaging dinosaurs, and and vision to build the most ill-advised theme park in human history. If this sounds at all familiar to you, it is probably because you've seen the original ""Jurassic Park"". I honestly don't know if I've ever seen a sequel (which does not market itself as a remake) that is so unabashedly similar to its predecessor(s).I think the problem with this franchise is simple: It had one great story to tell, and Steven Spielberg did just that in ""Jurassic Park"". All the sequels have failed to capture nearly a glimmer of that magic, because the novelty has worn off and there aren't good stories to tell. At least ""Lost World"" & ""III"" try to bring something original to the screen. ""World"" doesn't even go that far, instead settling for a few new dinosaurs and riding on the name of the franchise. The plots are incredible dumb/predictable and the characters are more of the same.The only reason I won't give this movie a ""bottom of the barrel"" 1-star review is because there are a few exciting scenes (the opening 20-30 minutes shows promise before quickly descending into predictability and repetition) and it is a ""slick"" experience from beginning to end. Even though you know that what you are watching isn't great, there is so much going on and so much action that you can never just mentally ""check out"". In that sense, this really is the textbook ""brainless summer blockbuster"".Even though I came into this viewing experience with mediocre expectations, I was disappointed that ""Jurassic World"" didn't even live up to that standard. If you've been hiding under a rock since 1993 and haven't seen any of the other ""Jurassic"" films, you will love this one! For those who like a little bit of plot and a few interesting characters with their whiz-bang dinosaur action, however, it will be clear to you that this franchise can no longer deliver either of those two things.",definitive proof that this is one story franchise,jurassic world was guaranteed turn large profit no matter if it was good or bad franchise is quite popular it just has that summer blockbuster feel it sadly i wish that films creators would have attempted make plot film even decent or create characters that arent wooden caricatures basic plot summary jurassic world sees vision mr hammond finally complete fully functional dinosaur amusement park course todays bigger better society it isnt good enough just reproduce classic dinosaurs now new dinos one bigger than t rex another that can swallow shark single gulp among others are being genetically spliced created lab park is run by claire bryce dallas howard profit driven corporate executive type who doesnt even have time her two nephews played by nick robinson ty simpkins when they visit park dinosaur caretaker owen chris pratt other hand is fully aware what these dangerous animals can do if not reckoned with military sub plot simmers background story new big boy dinosaur gets loose there it is what one would expect this type film this movie features ethical debate about genetic manipulation two annoying kids who are definition stupidity lot rampaging dinosaurs vision build most ill advised theme park human history if this sounds at all familiar you it is probably because youve seen original jurassic park i honestly dont know if ive ever seen sequel which does not market itself as remake that is so unabashedly similar its predecessor s i think problem with this franchise is simple it had one great story tell steven spielberg did just that jurassic park all sequels have failed capture nearly glimmer that magic because novelty has worn off there arent good stories tell at least lost world iii try bring something original screen world doesnt even go that far instead settling few new dinosaurs riding name franchise plots are incredible dumb predictable characters are more same only reason i wont give this movie bottom barrel 1 star review is because there are few exciting scenes opening 20 30 minutes shows promise before quickly descending into predictability repetition it is slick experience beginning end even though you know that what you are watching isnt great there is so much going so much action that you can never just mentally check out that sense this really is textbook brainless summer blockbuster even though i came into this viewing experience with mediocre expectations i was disappointed that jurassic world didnt even live up that standard if youve been hiding under rock since 1993 havent seen any other jurassic films you will love this one those who like little bit plot few interesting characters with their whiz bang dinosaur action however it will be clear you that this franchise can no longer deliver either those two things,0.4859888953638954,0.07139660108410106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.45}"
3,Another piece of modern trash.,"There is a young, handsome (I suspect), super skillful man, a charismatic guru. There is a young, pretty woman, a bit retarded and limited in her interests, often career-oriented. Monsters comes, people die, only a handsome superhero can save a day. A girl changes her shoes and/or shirt and becomes a superwoman in about 30 seconds, instantly gets expertise in gymnastics, combat, weapons handling, strategy and kills monsters together with a handsome guru (although the monsters had no problem with killing 1000 heavily armed troopers. Or maybe it is all that eating that made monsters slower?).The above is a screenplay for most of action/adventure/SF movies during the last 5-10 years. Doesn't matter if it is a new episode of Star Wars, or Jurassic Park, or Aliens, or some Passengers, or Interstellar - there are some superficial, cosmetic changes, but when I watch it all I can see no differences. It can be set in a jungle or in space, the clothes differ, the monsters can be humans, maybe there is a slight change in the roles played. But there is never any depth, no real personalities, no emotions, no basic logic. It is just colorful, fast, shimmering and loud. Am I getting older? Perhaps.

But people complain about the movie not being as deep and thought provoking as the original film. To those people I say, go back and watch the original movie. Think about it, if they remade this to mirror the original film then it would be boring. Sure, the film does match the original film but it is very much its own movie.

9,Highly entertaining and a true sequel to the original,"Greetings from Lithuania.After my next words i do believe i will be stricken by a lightning but still here it goes - ""Jurassic World"" (2015) is THE most entertaining ""Jurassic"" movie YET. Before you starting to throw rocks at me, here is the only reason why i think this movie is the best in the series (including the original) - simply because it is superbly entertaining.The first film had a groundbreaking special effects, and the first hour or so was amazing, but when the shix hit the fan, it wasn't so exciting anymore. I always believed the human characters were weak in the first movie, although actors and acting were very solid, somehow for me second part of the movie was simply boring. Yes. Second movie was the worst Steven Spielberg's movie yet, even Steven Spielberg have admit it. The third was OK, better then 2nd by a mile. That said, ""Jurassic World"" should have been the true sequel to the original. It is bigger, louder and more entertaining - everything that a good sequel must have. Special effects in here are truly special, i don't see any movie this year who could steal the best special effects Oscar from ""Jurassic World"" - they aren't groundbreaking, but they are truly spectacular. Acting was very cool, as well as cinematography and very solid directing. Now i kinda see why this guy will helm one of the new ""Star Wars"" movies, which about i was skeptical before seeing ""Jurassic World"". Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is a highly entertaining movie. Best of all is to see it with friends on the biggest screen possible, it is a helluva entrainment, not a perfect one, but the best from this franchise yet.",highly entertaining true sequel original,greetings lithuania after my next words i do believe i will be stricken by lightning but still here it goes jurassic world 2015 is most entertaining jurassic movie yet before you starting throw rocks at me here is only reason why i think this movie is best series including original simply because it is superbly entertaining first film had groundbreaking special effects first hour or so was amazing but when shix hit fan it wasnt so exciting anymore i always believed human characters were weak first movie although actors acting were very solid somehow me second part movie was simply boring yes second movie was worst steven spielbergs movie yet even steven spielberg have admit it third was ok better then 2nd by mile that said jurassic world should have been true sequel original it is bigger louder more entertaining everything that good sequel must have special effects here are truly special i dont see any movie this year who could steal best special effects oscar jurassic world they arent groundbreaking but they are truly spectacular acting was very cool as well as cinematography very solid directing now i kinda see why this guy will helm one new star wars movies which about i was skeptical before seeing jurassic world overall jurassic world is highly entertaining movie best all is see it with friends biggest screen possible it is helluva entrainment not perfect one but best this franchise yet,0.48995004995005,0.22922952047952047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.53, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.1}"
10,Loved It,"People really are too serious these days, Jurrasic World is a fun exciting thrilling film and a I really enjoyed it a I feel like I've waited almost all my life for another Jurrasic Park type film to be realised and I'm so happy they did! All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it.

4,The franchise has had a lobotomy,"Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.Jurassic World has them all.Naturally, I had to see it.The beginning holds much promise, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are some great action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.Unfortunately the final act unravels into outright farce.Chris Pratt is great as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got an easy going charisma that could easily carry an iconic character like Indiana Jones.Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the uptight park manager, who initially clashes with the laid back Owen. Of course you know where the tension goes.The film tries to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two nephews (someone and another kid), who do double duty as McGuffins.Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so obviously evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.The director, Colin Trevorrow, said in interviews that he wanted the dinosaurs to act like real animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprise! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged dinos (or near enough to dinos) go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Because cool action sequence!One poor soul is even treated to the most outlandishly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify anything, paid nothing back, offered no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a minor character. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.Which brings us to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing. The first one had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and characters so smart they run from T-Rex's in high heels.The franchise has had a lobotomy.",franchise has had lobotomy,dinosaurs amusement park tourists disaster jurassic world has them all naturally i had see it beginning holds much promise it gets your hopes up disaster come when it does there are some great action sequences especially ones with glass ball containing soft chewy child centre unfortunately final act unravels into outright farce chris pratt is great as affable yet bad ass raptor whisperer hes got easy going charisma that could easily carry iconic character like indiana jones bryce dallas howard plays claire dearing uptight park manager who initially clashes with laid back owen course you know where tension goes film tries flesh out claires character by throwing her two nephews someone another kid who do double duty as mcguffins vincent donofrio shows up as hoskins villainous representative military industrial complex angling weaponize velociraptors hes all sneers scenery chewing so obviously evil hes got goatee donofrio does it well but evil plan hes been saddled with by writers makes no sense at all director colin trevorrow said interviews that he wanted dinosaurs act like real animals not cartoon monsters quelle surprise i had no idea as he has well fed winged dinos or near enough dinos go crazed orgy violence against hapless tourists why because cool action sequence one poor soul is even treated most outlandishly elongated death sequence ive ever seen all no end it didnt justify anything paid nothing back offered no comeuppance it was just gleeful indulgence sadistic torture minor character it was itchy scratchy moment which brings us final act turn off your brain before it begins first movie proved you could have smart script dinosaurs same movie after that iq series dropped with each outing first one had chaos theory amber dna extraction cleverness up whazoo it was awesome what does this one have hackneyed evil plans clunky plot characters so smart they run t rexs high heels franchise has had lobotomy,0.5280662020905923,0.04768873403019743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10,Pratt+Blackwater+Dinosaurs= A Masterpiece,"OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it.

7,Jurassic World complete with equally ancient clichés!,"So, I liked this movie, but boy is it full of clichés and stereotypes. My partner and I found ourselves calling out every character, what they would end up doing within moments of being introduced to them.Seriously, there is an entire butcher's-worth of ham-fistedness in the approach to character intro's and scene building here. You'll know what will happen long in advance of it actually happening on screen.What this does is make the movie utterly predictable and, in essence, boring. At your first viewing, you will feel like you have seen it before.It also says something about a film featuring dinosaurs that it is at its best when they aren't on screen. I don't know how this came about, but, for the most part, the dino's are a little dull and uninteresting. They plod, they run, they roar, and all in glorious CGI. Yet they fail to evoke the same emotions that they did in JP1 or even 2.That's not to say the human actors are a lot better, but at least they have some thin characterisation applied to them, even if it is in the form of horrible stereotyping.I mean, military guy who is bent on weaponizing the dinos, distant aunt who has no skill with children (bet you can't guess where her story-arc evolves to?) What? Oh yeah, that's right... she does discover her nurturing instincts. Wow! You're better at this than the writers!Don't get me wrong. It is a solid popcorn flick. But the lazy writing does it tremendous harm. I swear they have some sort of software in Hollywood that churns this stuff out. There are no surprises here. None.Acting and Effects are capable. No one really stinks and there aren't that many obvious CGI moments (in so much as we know it is all CGI anyway, nothing shows itself about the perceptual parapet, as it were).It is a decent watch, but expecting the expected is no longer fun when taken to this extreme.SUMMARY: Formulaic and totally predictable.

2,"Pathetic Compared to Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" Entries","""Safety Not Guaranteed"" director Colin Trevorrow's summer blockbuster ""Jurassic World"" surpasses director Joe Johnston's lackluster ""Jurassic Park 3"" (2001). Comparatively, Steven Spielberg's infinitely superior ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) covered most of what transpires in Trevorrow's new the monster-run-amok-in-a-theme-park movie. Despite its attractive cast and scenic jungle locations, ""Jurassic World"" delivers considerably less suspense in its standard-issue shenanigans about juveniles in jeopardy. If you haven't seen the first and second entries in the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, this franchise reboot with its polished production values and robust 3-D might amaze you, especially if you're sixteen years old or younger. Size is the primary factor ""Jurassic World"" contends with, and Trevorrow shrewdly addresses this liability during the first half-hour. The female protagonist who manages the dinosaur park concedes, ""No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore. They need to be bigger, louder and with more teeth!"" Indeed, the new hybrid dinosaur that a fiendish scientist has concocted represents a leap forward. Nevertheless, this 50 feet long and 18 feet high monster doesn't really emerge as that monstrous. The Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" could serve as ""Godzilla's"" seeing-eye dog. Moreover, ""Jurassic World"" appears to have been designed to sell plastic toy dinosaurs. The dinos themselves display a clean-scrubbed, laminated look. When the franchise first rampaged across screens with ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and its sequel ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997), nothing looked either more realistic or intimidating than those truculent dinosaurs, especially the Raptors. Unfortunately, the time when ""Jurassic Park"" set new benchmarks for CGI is long past. The people who made ""Jurassic World"" must have ignored Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" (2005) as well as ""Godzilla"" (2014). In an arena with either of those, the welterweight Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" wouldn't last a minute. Meantime, scenarists Rick Jaffa &Amanda Silver, who did such a praiseworthy job with ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" along with writer Rick Connolly, and Trevorrow, have drummed-up a 'so-so sauraus' saga. The logistics of the plot don't hold up to scrutiny and the action is outlandish. Worse, the scripters have contrived one-dimensional characters who often behave idiotically in formulaic predicaments. For example, Bryce Dallas Howard, who was such a revelation as a villainess in ""The Help,"" spends her entire time charging around in high heels either in the jungle or on asphalt! Chris Pratt plays a former Navy troubleshooter who doesn't have a lick of sense. He totes around a modern .45-70 lever-action carbine reminiscent of Buffalo Bill, when he should be armed with something more substantial, like a Kalashnikov AK-101 assault rifle with 40mm GP-30 under-the-barrel grenade launcher. One Jurassic World security trooper wields a powerful M136 AT4, a Swedish-made single-shot 84mm unguided light anti-tank recoilless rocket launcher. He takes aim with this fearsome weapon at the genetically modified dinosaur. Naturally, like all myopic, action movie villains, none of these expendable troopers can hit the broad side of a barn, much less a gigantic, galloping dinosaur! Meantime, since the dinosaurs have neither slippery lawyers nor treacherous laboratory employees to gobble, the writers have substituted a different villain, a security specialist who dreams about adapting these carnivorous Raptors for real world combat against terrorists. Not surprisingly, everything about this lightweight, family-oriented, PG-13 rated epic is immaculate. Bloodshed is restricted to a drop or two of runny ketchup. Sure, you see the dinosaurs munch on many adults, but the two imperiled children suffer no broken legs, no sprained ankles, or lose any limbs. Specifically, anonymous bystanders are the only ones that are crunched, scratched, or traumatized. So forget about suspense and tension.Over twenty years ago, in the original ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, genial billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) fantasized about opening a dinosaur park on a remote island near Costa Rica. Initially, everything went fine, but then some predatory velociraptors and a cantankerous Tyrannosaurus rex ruined it for everybody. Now, twenty years later, Indian billionaire Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan of ""Life of Pi"") has taken over Jurassic Park as the new owner, and he has committed himself whole-heartedly to perpetuating Hammond's dream. He wants both the dinosaurs to enjoy quality of life while the visitors to have a blast. Conversely, Masrani's workaholic chief of operations, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of ""The Help""), struggles to maintain that profit margin. This means the Park must constantly add new attractions because new attractions spike attendance. When fiendish but taciturn scientist, Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong of ""Focus""), devises a new dinosaur, he refuses to share his secret formula with Masrani and Claire. Predictably, chaos ensues with disastrous results. The Indominus rex is smarter than the average dinosaur, and this creature fools everybody, including the impertinent but heroic Owen Grady (Chris Pratt of ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), who struggles to train a quartet of beady-eyed Velociraptors. Using prehistoric lizards like bloodhounds is preposterous but amusing, and the bond Grady develops with these overgrown kangaroo-like predators is unconvincing. Eventually, Grady pursues the Indominus with them, while the Indominus kills on other dinosaurs and crashes into the park's pterosaur aviary to free flocks of their airborne predators.Before he helmed ""Jurassic World,"" Colin Trevorrow directed some Internet shorts, a made-for-TV movie, and a superb little 2012 indie flick entitled ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" with Mark Duplass. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was an amiable character-driven comedy of errors. In ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" a couple of journalists investigated a crackpot who has published a newspaper ad soliciting partners to accompany him on a trip back in time. These time travel candidates are advised to bring their own weapons. Reportedly, movie mogul Steven Spielberg liked Trevorrow's film enough to sign him up to direct ""Jurassic World."" If you're a parent, ""Jurassic World"" serves not only as ideal entertainment for kids, but also a great way to interest them in dinosaur memorabilia. Otherwise, as far as adults are concerned, the pedestrian ""Jurassic World"" exemplifies a case of suspense not guaranteed.""",pathetic compared spielbergs jurassic park entries,safety not guaranteed

10,A Monster-sized adventure !,"The emergence of another 'Jurassic Park' sequel after the failure of 'Jurassic Park III' was bound to open the movie to criticism as exploring the world of dinosaurs seems to have been exhausted. However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going.

8,It Wasn't What I Hoped; Shallowly Entertaining,"The original JURASSIC PARK is and always will be one of my favorite movies. I even enjoyed THE LOST WORLD more than most people. I've read Michael Crichton's novels more times than I can remember. So yes, I am a fan. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of reopening the movie franchise more than a decade since the third film solidified my belief that the series had run out of steam. I was cautiously optimistic when I read that Colin Trevorrow, director of the fun SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, was brought on to helm the project and I was even more excited when Chris Pratt was cast in one of the lead roles. Trevorrow was loud and proud about his love for the original '93 film, so I began to believe he might do the series justice and somehow reinvigorate it. JURASSIC WORLD seems to ignore the previous two sequels, setting it in an operational and mega-successful park built on Isla Nublar. Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) is the operations manager, whom we meet when she's balancing a busy schedule of shuffling off her visiting nephews onto her disinterested assistant and presenting the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, to potential investors. Meanwhile, former Navy SEAL and Ingen contractor Owen (Pratt) takes a break from training a team of velociraptors to inspect the Indominus's pen for safety concerns; in what should come as a surprise to no one, the Indominus outsmarts Owen and the park crew and escapes from its pen, endangering the lives of thousands of park guests as it murders its way across the island.Trevorrow was not lying when he expounded on his love for the original film. In fact, JURASSIC WORLD is his love letter to it and it's probably the film's biggest flaw. You can't go more than a few minutes without some sort of reference to JURASSIC PARK. The visitors' center is featured in a sequence where we see the ""When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"" and skeletal remains from the climactic moment. We see a night vision headset (twice!), famous from the T-rex escape sequence. There's little nods scattered around in the background (visual and audio) and even a character in the Jurassic World control room (Lowery, played by Jake Johnson) who seems to encapsulate Trevorrow's own raging fandom. A few references would've been fine but, by the time the film was halfway over, it just made me wish I was watching the original film. I wanted JURASSIC WORLD to be its own film, reminding us why we loved the '93 film without constantly nudging us with its elbow, winking, and murmuring ""Remember that part? It was cool, wasn't it?"" Even the core plot is pretty much a slightly modified version of the original: dinosaurs get loose, rational man who knows what he's doing makes it his mission to bring two key children back to safety, big climactic moment to close it out. Except the characters in the original film always felt as if they were in constant danger. There was suspense. JURASSIC WORLD isn't all that suspenseful. Maybe it's because the dinosaurs are 99% CG now. Sure, they look pretty good but, no matter how many people the Indominus swallows whole, it's never as scary as the T-rex was in the first film. The lack of suspense could also be attributed to the hollow feeling behind the action. Most of the deaths are nameless extras, be they asset containment crew or park guests. The moment when I knew this would never live up to JURASSIC PARK: when a helicopter crashes in a fiery, gratuitous, unmotivated explosion just so it can happen with the Indominus roaring in the foreground for that perfect ""trailer shot"". It was almost offensive in how cheesy that moment felt.Speaking of cheesyhow about that final confrontation with the Indominus? I'm not going to lie. That whole sequence had me rolling my eyes. Especially at the end. Not going to spoil anything here, but you'll probably know what I'm referring to. I'm being sort of hard on JURASSIC WORLD but that's only because I wanted it to try harder. It's not a bad film. It's still pretty entertaining. It's got some great casting (Pratt, Johnson, Irrfan Khan as the park owner, Vincent D'Onofrio as a nefarious Ingen overseer) and I loved the concept of setting the film in an operational park. On the topic of D'Onofrio's character and the whole subplot of ""trained"" velociraptors: I was wary at first but I thought it was done well. If anything, I think it should've been the main plot the film or, at the very least, saved for a sequel. The sequence in the middle of the film where the raptors are given a field test (which is glimpsed in the trailer with Pratt running with the pack on a motorcycle) was probably the best part of the movie. Overall, I felt JURASSIC WORLD was a tad overrated and, while it was an entertaining couple of hours, teamed with AGE OF ULTRON to jumpstart the ""Summer of 'Meh'"" (a term I've come to use for the summer blockbuster season of 2015 where I was continuously underwhelmed). Based on the money this film raked in (all of it), a sequel was guaranteed and, just as I was for JURASSIC WORLD, I'm hopeful. This spent too much time pining over the franchise's glory days but there were some promising nuggets in there. For anyone who for some reason hasn't seen it already, it's worth a watch and you'll probably really enjoy it.
