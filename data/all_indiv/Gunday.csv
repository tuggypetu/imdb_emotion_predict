1.0,Waste of time and money,"The movie was probably aimed at being on of those a masala flicks with bromance, romance, song sequences, tragic background and what not. But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.The only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays.",waste time money,movie was probably aimed at being those masala flicks with bromance romance song sequences tragic background what not but half hour into movie it all went toss due very very weak script screen appearances actors was good but it wasnt really backed by any actual acting dialogues were over cheesy ludicrous all aspects probably priyanka chopra was only watchable element movie or may be i am being biased frankly hour into movie i really felt like leaving i dont know why i didnt trust me guys its one those movies which is meant be forgotten if you havent watched it are planning then forget time money that you are going waste this just save yourself agony that might scar you only way this movie could be watchable is with group friends who are making fun everything possible whilst movie plays,0.4627604166666667,-0.06432291666666667,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Wake Up Bollywood!!!! Plzzzzz,"The one area where Bollywood has achieved excellence and perfection is publicity / promotion. The art of pre release promotion has taught them how to sell their even average / substandard productions at good profits. The much awaited, hyped and promoted ""Gunday"" is finally out in the theaters and yet again, net result is ""Total Disappointment"". The movie from head to toe lacks attraction in any field (Story, Music, Direction & even Acting).The handsome combo of Ranvir and Kapoor proved insufficient. Irfan Khan selected a B Grade movie and disappointed his fans. PC is continuously on the way to destruction with another flop appearance. The charisma of YRF and embodied cast could not bring desired results. Although film may achieve a good business (May touch the magical Figure of 100 Crores Club)but it can not be termed a movie to watch. The idea of late 80s once again failed. It is a wake up call. I mean how long audience can be fooled by exaggerated promos and publicity. At last, it will fall.

1.0,This film has started disaster in Bangladesh,"I would like to introduce myself as one of the Bangladeshi movie lovers. Probably Gunday is getting great response in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Does the director understand that this project has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done this film.At the very beginning of your film,they are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think their script writer was plastered while writing the script. If their information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? India joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. India didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. Director can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in their film. It's tremendously humiliating for us (All Bangladeshis).3.According this story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!",this film has started disaster bangladesh,i would like introduce myself as one bangladeshi movie lovers probably gunday is getting great response india but this film has started disaster bangladesh does director understand that this project has humiliated bangladeshis hopefully mistakes were done unintentionally lets have look at mistakes done this film at very beginning your film they are telling viewers that it was india pakistan war happened 1971 i think their script writer was plastered while writing script if their information happens be correct what were our freedom fighters doing then india joined war 3rd december 1971 war started 25th march same year india didnt give birth bangladesh rather bloodshed our 3 million martyrs did director can not but correct mistake apologize us 2 story film humiliates us several scenes they showed that people bangladesh were involved various criminal activities during liberation war two lads our country become thief vicious criminal going your land their film its tremendously humiliating us all bangladeshis 3 according this story bangladeshis consider themselves indian how humorous they can do anything get indian citizenship extremely humorous,0.5645833333333333,0.04444444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.3}"
3.0,Could the movie be THAT bad?!,"As many of my readers have probably noticed, I have a strange affinity for bad films. Sure, I also enjoy foreign, independent and classic Hollywood films--but sometimes I enjoy a film so awesomely bad that it makes me laugh. Because of this, I periodically peruse IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 List to see which films are the lowest rated films of all time. And, aside from a few foreign language pictures which aren't available in the US, I have done a pretty good job of finding and watching these turkeys. A few of these incredibly low rated films are actually not that bad, though most are truly terrible--and many of also unintentionally funny--and these are my favorites. Birdemic, Prince of Space and Eegah are particularly funny examples from the list.Imagine my surprise recently when I noticed something VERY unusual. A new film managed to not only make the list but vault all the way to #1. Coming from out of nowhere is the Indian film Gunday--a 2014 offering from director/writer Ali Abbas Zafar. And, considering my recent articles for Influx about my love for Indian movies as well as for bad films, I realized that this was a definite must-see. After all, if I praised Bollywood movies for their fun and originality, I have some obligation to mention the bad along with the good. So I wondered, since the movie is ranked as the worst film of all time on IMDb, is it really THAT bad?! Is the movie worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space or is it a case where folks are jumping all over a film that really isn't THAT bad (such is the case with Glitter or Gigli)? When Gunday began, I could see that it was completely unlike most of the Bottom 100. Most of these films are ultra-cheap films with tiny budgets and few were ever considered prestige films. However, Gunday clearly is a big-budget Bollywood film--with all the trappings you'd expect from such a film. It has handsome actors, huge song and dance numbers and tons of style. The story is about two orphans who grew up in war-torn Bangladesh, Bikram and Bala. The two are starving and so gravitating towards a life of crime is understandable--and this sort of plot is VERY common in Indian films. They are in some ways like Robin Hood--big-time mobsters who have a heart for the poor and are their benefactors. Because of this and their toughness, no one would ever consider testifying against them and they have become the top crime lords in Calcutta. However, a policeman (the exceptionally talented Irrfan Khan) has made it his job to take down these criminals. And, in addition, the partner's strong bromance is threatened by a pretty young lady who both of them have fallen for big time. The first portion of the film which shows the pair as children is actually very good. It is a compelling story and you feel for them as kids. They face hunger, sexual abuse and many other obstacles and the audience naturally pulls for them--even though they do begin engaging in criminal activities in order to survive. A bit later, however, the film jumps way ahead in time. Now the pair (played by Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor) are grown up and are becoming the top criminals in the city. They also have become incredibly silly--with extremely well-coiffed hair, rakish good looks, shirts ALWAYS strategically unbuttoned and STYLE, STYLE, STYLE! In fact, they look much more like models in a Vidal Sassoon advertisement than mobsters! And, to make it worse, they act much like Sacha Baron Cohen in Brüno or Ben Stiller in Zooolander-- though these two American films were intended as comedies, not dramatic musicals like Gunday! It's a strange contrast to see their terrible performances alongside Irrfan Khan--who, as usual, is terrific. Now I am not saying that Singh and Kapoor will always be bad actors--but the sorts of performances the director elicited from them are absolutely terrible. Does all this bad acting and nonsense rise to the level of awfulness that merits the film being on the Bottom 100 List? Not really. While the film is pretty dumb at times (mostly, I feel due to the direction and performances by Singh and Kapoor), the film does have a few things going for it. The songs are terrific and catchy. Zafar can direct music videos--just not people acting like real people. And, as I mentioned above, Irrfan Khan is excellent in his role and this Indian actor has been getting a lot of well deserved attention in breakout films like Slumdog Millionaire, The Lunchbox and Life of Pi. Plus, parts of the story are interesting (though historically inaccurate)-- though I must admit that the film certainly does become tiresome after a while.So why is this poor but not terrible film rated #1 in the badness scale? I can only assume because it was so well publicized, marketed and designed to be a mega-blockbuster. Like the examples I gave above (Gigli and Glitter), this is a case where the public really LOVES getting on the bandwagon to trash a mega-film. But unlike these two films, Gunday actually made a ton of money...yet people hated it! Perhaps this makes this movie the one that Indians love to hate! All I know is that if Zafar can make more 'failures' like this one, he'll become an incredibly rich man!!By the way, if you're curious and would like to see the list, it's available at http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom?ref_=nv_sr_1",could movie be that bad,as many my readers have probably noticed i have strange affinity bad films sure i also enjoy foreign independent classic hollywood films but sometimes i enjoy film so awesomely bad that it makes me laugh because this i periodically peruse imdbs infamous bottom 100 list see which films are lowest rated films all time aside few foreign language pictures which arent available us i have done pretty good job finding watching these turkeys few these incredibly low rated films are actually not that bad though most are truly terrible many also unintentionally funny these are my favorites birdemic prince space eegah are particularly funny examples list imagine my surprise recently when i noticed something very unusual new film managed not only make list but vault all way coming out nowhere is indian film gunday 2014 offering director writer ali abbas zafar considering my recent articles influx about my love indian movies as well as bad films i realized that this was definite must see after all if i praised bollywood movies their fun originality i have some obligation mention bad along with good so i wondered since movie is ranked as worst film all time imdb is it really that bad is movie worse than plan 9 outer space or is it case where folks are jumping all over film that really isnt that bad such is case with glitter or gigli when gunday began i could see that it was completely unlike most bottom 100 most these films are ultra cheap films with tiny budgets few were ever considered prestige films however gunday clearly is big budget bollywood film with all trappings youd expect such film it has handsome actors huge song dance numbers tons style story is about two orphans who grew up war torn bangladesh bikram bala two are starving so gravitating towards life crime is understandable this sort plot is very common indian films they are some ways like robin hood big time mobsters who have heart poor are their benefactors because this their toughness no one would ever consider testifying against them they have become top crime lords calcutta however policeman exceptionally talented irrfan khan has made it his job take down these criminals addition partners strong bromance is threatened by pretty young lady who both them have fallen big time first portion film which shows pair as children is actually very good it is compelling story you feel them as kids they face hunger sexual abuse many other obstacles audience naturally pulls them even though they do begin engaging criminal activities order survive bit later however film jumps way ahead time now pair played by ranveer singh arjun kapoor are grown up are becoming top criminals city they also have become incredibly silly with extremely well coiffed hair rakish good looks shirts always strategically unbuttoned style style style fact they look much more like models vidal sassoon advertisement than mobsters make it worse they act much like sacha baron cohen br no or ben stiller zooolander though these two american films were intended as comedies not dramatic musicals like gunday its strange contrast see their terrible performances alongside irrfan khan who as usual is terrific now i am not saying that singh kapoor will always be bad actors but sorts performances director elicited them are absolutely terrible does all this bad acting nonsense rise level awfulness that merits film being bottom 100 list not really while film is pretty dumb at times mostly i feel due direction performances by singh kapoor film does have few things going it songs are terrific catchy zafar can direct music videos just not people acting like real people as i mentioned above irrfan khan is excellent his role this indian actor has been getting lot well deserved attention breakout films like slumdog millionaire lunchbox life pi plus parts story are interesting though historically inaccurate though i must admit that film certainly does become tiresome after while so why is this poor but not terrible film rated badness scale i can only assume because it was so well publicized marketed designed be mega blockbuster like examples i gave above gigli glitter this is case where public really loves getting bandwagon trash mega film but unlike these two films gunday actually made ton money yet people hated it perhaps this makes this movie one that indians love hate all i know is that if zafar can make more failures like this one hell become incredibly rich man by way if youre curious would like see list its available at,0.5210700144300147,0.02493408369408371,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.25}"

India's involvement didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of 3 million martyrs of Bangladesh did.The story of this film humiliates Bangladesh on several scenes. The director showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war.

1.0,Humilation of Bangladesh Liberation War,"At the very beginning of the film,they tell the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971.

1.0,Bollywood masala action film. Its not based on facts !,"Its making money and thats the headline. Just a spoiled effort. Action and over-dramatic dialogues are its USP. Rest is just another Bollywood weekend movie.Bangladesh liberation war was modified as Indo-Pak war without giving proper exposure to facts. Bangladesh was born from the war between India and Pakistan ! Thats the terrible blunder. So any person who knows the facts will be disappointed. As we know from the previous review Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces.The movie violated the sovereign feeling of Bangladeshi peoples.

1.0,It was Bangladesh's liberation war against Pakistan,"The movie starts with a story line; ""....Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War"". I strongly condemn this matter. It should be edited without any delay. Me & all the Bangladeshi people respect those Indians who sacrificed their lives in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 and we remember the contribution of Indian govt. at that time. But it doesn't change the history. Bangladesh born in a long turmoil ending up a 9 month long war against Pakistan Army in 1971 but the liberation story starts far more from 1952 by language movement. India joined with their military forces in 3rd December 1971 and the Pakistan Army surrendered on 16th December 1971. Meanwhile India supported Bangladesh by restoring refugees, food, finance, arms and with many other things. This is movie review page where I am opposing one specific content of the movie which is terribly hurting an entire nation. Yash Raj films still didn't respond in this matter where as Bangladeshi's are strongly opposing it specially the youth society. The mindset should be changed and the history should not be presented wrongly through a movie.",it was bangladeshs liberation war against pakistan,movie starts with story line bangladesh is born as pakistan surrender december 16 at end indo pak war i strongly condemn this matter it should be edited without any delay me all bangladeshi people respect those indians who sacrificed their lives liberation war bangladesh 1971 we remember contribution indian govt at that time but it doesnt change history bangladesh born long turmoil ending up 9 month long war against pakistan army 1971 but liberation story starts far more 1952 by language movement india joined with their military forces 3rd december 1971 pakistan army surrendered 16th december 1971 meanwhile india supported bangladesh by restoring refugees food finance arms with many other things this is movie review page where i am opposing one specific content movie which is terribly hurting entire nation yash raj films still didnt respond this matter where as bangladeshis are strongly opposing it specially youth society mindset should be changed history should not be presented wrongly through movie,0.5308730158730158,0.03325396825396827,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.64}"
