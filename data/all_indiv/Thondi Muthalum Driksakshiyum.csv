10,The beauty of reality,"Thondimuthalum driksakshiyum is one of the best malayalam movies made in recent years that is successful because of its brilliant script and poignant performances from the entire cast. This film is extremely realistic and builds upon situations that we come across in our daily life. The characters are very well-written and well- acted that they stay with us even after the movie ends. Biggest credit must go to Fahadh Faasil for yet another superb performance which is one of the best in his career and the way he changes our view of his character at different points in the story is just wonderful. Suraj Venjarammood shines in a very serious role and proves yet again that he deserves more serious roles like this. The debutant Nimisha Sajayan has also done justice to her character. What made Dileesh Pothan's first film ""Maheshinte Prathikaram"" successful was the way humour was managed in that movie without any kind of artificiality. That kind of Basheerian humour which arises out of realistic scenarios and without any kind of gimmick is again seen here which makes this film very entertaining. The focus of the script and the intensity is never lost in any part of the film thanks to Pothan. He must also deserve credit for the way so many new actors are used in the police station scenes and the acting by Alencier and other policemen are extremely natural. The script written by Sajeev Pazhoor is tight and never loses focus at any point in the movie. In fact one of the best things about this film is the use of very short dialogues in some crucial scenes which reveals so much about the characters and their motives without useless blabber. I rate this film 10/10 & hoping for more good realistic films like this rather than over-hyped masala movies.",beauty reality,thondimuthalum driksakshiyum is one best malayalam movies made recent years that is successful because its brilliant script poignant performances entire cast this film is extremely realistic builds upon situations that we come across our daily life characters are very well written well acted that they stay with us even after movie ends biggest credit must go fahadh faasil yet another superb performance which is one best his career way he changes our view his character at different points story is just wonderful suraj venjarammood shines very serious role proves yet again that he deserves more serious roles like this debutant nimisha sajayan has also done justice her character what made dileesh pothans first film maheshinte prathikaram successful was way humour was managed that movie without any kind artificiality that kind basheerian humour which arises out realistic scenarios without any kind gimmick is again seen here which makes this film very entertaining focus script intensity is never lost any part film thanks pothan he must also deserve credit way so many new actors are used police station scenes acting by alencier other policemen are extremely natural script written by sajeev pazhoor is tight never loses focus at any point movie fact one best things about this film is use very short dialogues some crucial scenes which reveals so much about characters their motives without useless blabber i rate this film 10 10 hoping more good realistic films like this rather than over hyped masala movies,0.5064231601731601,0.31290313852813845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8,Pothettan shines yet again! [+79%],"Dileesh Pothan's second venture (after the critically acclaimed 'Maheshinte Prathikaaram') turns out to be yet another excellent character study. The film builds itself up slowly yet steadily, with an assortment of characters each with their unique set of traits and sense of humor. At 2h 15 min, not once does the film feel like a drag. The viewer is constantly kept on toes with each passing scene. Kudos to the excellent casting choices by the crew. 'Thondimothalum Driksakshiyum' boasts of excellent all- round performances from the entire ensemble which comprises of a few seasoned actors such as Fahadh, Suraaj and Alencier while a good number of supporting actors are all newbies, just as in 'Maheshinte Prathikaaram'.It would seem disparaging if I don't intend to applaud the extremely grounded and realistic portrayals of some of the characters such as the culprit who is handed a punishment of bringing water to the station, the Sub Inspector, some of the Constables, the cop who always walks around in mufti (plain clothes), the Circle Inspector, the shopkeeper and so on. Each character leaves a solid impression on the viewer.Fahadh's intro is cleverly executed (his expressive eyes convey a lot yet can hide even more!). His character is constructed in a manner that is supposed to leave the viewer slightly baffled. Pothan ensures that he does not spoon-feed the audience in elucidating the various character arcs, instead leaves the job of construing behavioral traits and motives to the viewer. Laugh-out loud moments ensue when Alencier and Fahadh take centrestage during the interrogation scenes. The revelations made are so interestingly packaged that they seem both hilarious and believable at the time.Suraaj and newcomer Nimisha Sajayan who play Prasad and Sreeja share good on-screen chemistry as a run-away couple who get embroiled in a chain-snatching case where Fahadh's character (another Prasad) is the accused. What's additionally worth noticing is the brilliant social commentary it makes on the side, while the story keeps moving forward. Instances of mob frenzy, caste discrimination, land disputes and scams are also inculcated neatly in the screenplay (penned by Sajeev Pazhoor). Dialogues by National Award Winner Syam Pushkaran are able to strike a chord with the viewer instantly. The initial scenes of how a case is handled at the police station tend to remind the viewer of Nivin Pauly starrer 'Action Hero Biju'. But the similarity is only in the setting; the treatment is completely different.Rajeev Ravi's cinematography adds a dash of pragmatism to the scenes. The sepia color tone blends with the mood of the flick almost perfectly. Music and BGM by Bijibal is minimal yet effective. It is also quite intriguing to observe that the viewer is able to associate better with the comportment of each central character (especially the victim, the witness, the cop-in-charge and the accused) by the time the credits start to roll. Even the supposed exhibit (a necklace) has a specific purpose. A minimal dose of artsy ambiguity only helps.Alencier plays A.S.I Chandran to perfection while Suraaj puts on a mature show (unlike what's usually seen of him). Fahadh lends an eerie air to his character retaining a sense of delightful mystery throughout. 'Thondimothalum Driksakshiyum' is a must-watch.

9,Thondimuthalum Dhriksakshiyum is one of the best Indian movies of 2017.Dileesh Pothan and Fahadh Faasil deserves Best Director 2017 and Best Actor 2017. A Gem of a film.,"Thondimuthalum Dhriksakshiyum (2017): One of the more prominent film industries of India is found in the state of Kerala and we expect wonders from it every year.But unfortunately,2017 is disappointing with several passable films.Of all the films of Malayalam I have watched this year only Takeoff (Mainly because of Parvathy Menon) and Godha (Because of Wamiqa,Renji and music) impressed but neither of them are masterpieces which I expect.Then I found this gem of a film which is one of the most realistic Indian films I had ever seen.Plot: It tells the story of a poor couple Prasad (Suraaj Venjarammoodu) and Sreeja (Nimisha Sajayan), eloping from their village, whose lives depend entirely on a necklace adorned by the female counterpart. Unfortunately, during the bus ride away from home, the necklace is stolen. The wife assures everyone on board that the person responsible for the theft is the man seated behind her named Prasad (Fahadh Faasil), who had gulped down the piece of jewelry before anyone else could notice. This causes a lot of bustle, and the man is taken along with the couple into a local police station for questioning, which leads to the events that make up the rest of the film.My Review: Dileesh Pothan, the director, had released another feature starring Fahad Faasil last year, titled 'Maheshinte Prathikaram' that went on to win several accolades and was both a critical and commercial hit, but I thought it was a confused mess that held a very familiar and clichéd story within itself which is boring.That film is hugely overrated.'Thondimuthalum' is different because here, it works.Thondimuthalum's plot is so simple that if you heard the plot from some other person,you clearly will ignore this film but it is gonna be your huge mistake.This is one of the situations which proves the popular saying ""Don't Judge a Book by its Cover"".This is a genuine story presented with total honesty. The characters are real people and there are no real efforts to categorise them into various shades, which is such a delight. The emotions of each character affect us and Dileesh masterfully blends it all in a delightful manner. The viewers are able to connect with the characters on screen, in such a way that not one actor or an extra goes to waste. Most of film happens within the aforementioned police station, where we become empathetic towards the main persons of the film (being the two lovers, the supposed thief, and the police officers) as they become helpless in their own sorry worlds. I guess because of this reason, the film is more of a dark comedy than anything else, because within each laugh is a hint of pain.There isn't a villain in this picture, not really. Fahad Faasil's character, the man who is accused, is someone for whom we slowly fall for, partly because he's more naughty than cunning. The fact is that he is very clever, and in each and every move he makes, there is a spark of his intelligence.This makes him the victim of several hits and kicks from the officers, which ends up disturbing his accusers, who form a silent bond with him.His entire character justifies in a single line ""Never lose hope even in darkest times"". He never admits crime and tests the police's intelligence and when they chose stupid ways to close the case,we salute to Fahadh Fasil's role.The screenplay and dialogues by Sajeev Pazhoor and Shyam Pushkaran are brilliant and carries lot of weight.A particularly hilarious conversation happens when Alencier Ley takes statement from Suraj and Nimisha on how they lost their necklace on the second day in complete contradiction to what they took the first day.Coming to the director,Dileesh Pothan,he definitely deserves the Best Director of 2017 award.Movie plots clearly don't excite director Dileesh Pothan as much as true stories where life had come dizzyingly close to becoming like a movie and then, had fused back with life.This means that a conversation he overhears at a tea shop is more likely to give Pothan a setting for his next picture than a brainstorming session inside a conference room.He chose one of the most simplest plots of 2017 and successfully made the best film of 2017 out of it.Fahad Faasil gives a career best performance in 'Thondimuthalum', because his expressive eyes convey more to the audience than mere words ever could.I never thought he is such an intensive performer.What an amazing ability he has to transform to the character he plays ! His smile when it writes intermission on the screen is one thing that would be lot discussed in coming days. How he gives a detailed explanation to his cellmate on the finesse a thief should possess was a treat to watch. Even the smallest gestures like where he asks for food to Suraj with handcuffs in his hands but just takes it away when the police comes in evokes laughs. It's safe to say by now that he is at the cusp of entering the greater league of actors we ever had. It takes a lot of conviction for a director to take such a drastic casting call and also a lot of guts and confidence for a popular star to take on such an unconventional role, kudos to both Dileesh Pothan and Fahadh Faasil for their respective decisions.Others also played their roles naturally and Alencier Ley Lopez once again proves he is one of the best actors to play supporting roles without monotony.Technically this movie is very well made without any gloss.Camera-work is realistic and music has a good flow with movie.So,Thondimuthalum Dhriksakshiyum is easily one of the Top 5 Indian movies of 2017.Dileesh Pothan and Fahadh Faasil deserves Best Director 2017 and Best Actor 2017 respectively.A Must Watch gem of a film.My Rating 8.5/10",thondimuthalum dhriksakshiyum is one best

8,Fahadh Faasil runs absolute RIOT in Dileesh Pothan's instant classic of human derivation.,"Thondi Muthalum Driksakshiyum (2017) : Brief Review -Fahadh Faasil runs absolute RIOT in Dileesh Pothan's instant classic of human derivation. What a film and what a performance by Fahadh Faasil! This is easily one of the most innovative and exciting storyline came from Malayalam Cinema in the last decade. No hard-core drama, no emotional fetching but all it has got is pure realistic sense of human nature and our law system. Thondi Muthalum Driksakshiyum is about Prasad and Sreeja who enter wedlock and move to a new place to continue the rest of their lives. Unfortunate events begin to take place after Prasad, a small-time thief, robs Sreeja's gold chain during a bus journey. The police investigation follows only to make things uneasy for everyone included there. A small idea of chain thief could get such a big amount of cinematic content, i wouldn't have believed it if someone has told me but now i believe because I have experienced in the last 125 minutes i spent watching the film. Sajeev Pazhoor's excellent writing deserves all the praise for making every character look rich despite unwell scenarios. At one moment you feel angry at him but later you start loving his wrongdoings, how? That's the power of writing. That's the skills of a writer to grab you completely over the narrative with the help of detailed characterisations. Fahadh Faasil appears little late but what a mind-blowing performance he has given. Absolutely riot. Suraj Venjaramoodu and Nimisha also leave an impact with their adorable chemistry. Lopez sir shines like a star in the crowd, that luminous thing in the sky. Dileesh Pothan has made three films till date and i have seen all three of them, so i have no second thoughts on calling Thondi Muthalum Driksakshiyum as his Best Film So Far. That's it, that's all i guess. A deserving and real Classic, unlike some of those overrated fanboys material.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",fahadh faasil runs absolute riot dileesh pothans instant classic human derivation,thondi muthalum driksakshiyum 2017 brief review fahadh faasil runs absolute riot dileesh pothans instant classic human derivation what film what performance by fahadh faasil this is easily one most innovative exciting storyline came malayalam cinema last decade no hard core drama no emotional fetching but all it has got is pure realistic sense human nature our law system thondi muthalum driksakshiyum is about prasad sreeja who enter wedlock move new place continue rest their lives unfortunate events begin take place after prasad small time thief robs sreejas gold chain during bus journey police investigation follows only make things uneasy everyone included there small idea chain thief could get such big amount cinematic content i wouldnt have believed it if someone has told me but now i believe because i have experienced last 125 minutes i spent watching film sajeev pazhoors excellent writing deserves all praise making every character look rich despite unwell scenarios at one moment you feel angry at him but later you start loving his wrongdoings how thats power writing thats skills writer grab you completely over narrative with help detailed characterisations fahadh faasil appears little late but what mind blowing performance he has given absolutely riot suraj venjaramoodu nimisha also leave impact with their adorable chemistry lopez sir shines like star crowd that luminous thing sky dileesh pothan has made three films till date i have seen all three them so i have no second thoughts calling thondi muthalum driksakshiyum as his best film so far thats it thats all i guess deserving real classic unlike some those overrated fanboys material rating 8 10 by,0.5357872200263504,0.15146339168078296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10,A Modern Masterpiece,"This is an almost genius piece of film making. Dileesh Pothen's 'Maheshinte Prathikaram' brought Fahad Fazil back into the fold in a big way but it was a movie which grew on me, after being a little underwhelmed by it on first viewing. But here, he grips you from the start and never really lets go till the end credits roll. Fahad Fazil continues his fine form, but I would consider him to be more of an admirable supporting foil here. The movie's main protagonists are the couple played by Suraj Venjaramoodu and newcomer Nimisha Sajayan. After a realistically humorous mix up on first meet, they have a furtive romance before tying the knot. While traveling in a bus, a thief (Fahad Fazil) is caught in the act of stealing her gold necklace. While she is adamant that she saw him gulping it down, he protests his innocence to the police. In fact, I would say it is the scenes at the police station that elevates this film to another level completely. The brilliance of the narration is in the way it makes everything seem so utterly realistic, and yet peppy and satirically humorous in its enactment on screen. The police officers here are not black or white, but like most people occupy the gray area in between. While genuinely wanting to help resolve the conflict here, they also cannot help but try to twist things to suit their perspective at various points in the story. The resolution when it eventually comes is probably the best they could have done with this wacky beautiful film. Performances are uniformly brilliant. Suraj Venjaramoodu has been finally stepping away from his trademark buffoonery act in recent times, but this has to be one of his finest roles. The utter realism he brings to screen of a common man stuck in a little bit of a muddle and trying his best to resolve it is exemplary. Nimisha Sajayan maybe a newcomer, but she seems perfect for this – again a realistic blend of spunk and sass, yet vulnerable to the events around her. Suraj's chemistry, both with her and with Fahad Fazil is another clincher – it couldn't be better. The police officers, led by Alencier Ley, are all obviously fine actors who have got roles to shine and grab the opportunity.Movies like this don't come along often. When they do, they deserve every accolade and recognition they get. A must MUST watch.",modern masterpiece,this is almost genius piece film making dileesh pothens maheshinte prathikaram brought fahad fazil back into fold big way but it was movie which grew me after being little underwhelmed by it first viewing but here he grips you start never really lets go till end credits roll fahad fazil continues his fine form but i would consider him be more admirable supporting foil here movies main protagonists are couple played by suraj venjaramoodu newcomer nimisha sajayan after realistically humorous mix up first meet they have furtive romance before tying knot while traveling bus thief fahad fazil is caught act stealing her gold necklace while she is adamant that she saw him gulping it down he protests his innocence police fact i would say it is scenes at police station that elevates this film another level completely brilliance narration is way it makes everything seem so utterly realistic yet peppy satirically humorous its enactment screen police officers here are not black or white but like most people occupy gray area between while genuinely wanting help resolve conflict here they also cannot help but try twist things suit their perspective at various points story resolution when it eventually comes is probably best they could have done with this wacky beautiful film performances are uniformly brilliant suraj venjaramoodu has been finally stepping away his trademark buffoonery act recent times but this has be one his finest roles utter realism he brings screen common man stuck little bit muddle trying his best resolve it is exemplary nimisha sajayan maybe newcomer but she seems perfect this again realistic blend spunk sass yet vulnerable events around her surajs chemistry both with her with fahad fazil is another clincher it couldnt be better police officers led by alencier ley are all obviously fine actors who have got roles shine grab opportunity movies like this dont come along often when they do they deserve every accolade recognition they get must must watch,0.5049707602339182,0.2417397660818713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"

9,Pothettan brilliance again,"Just like in his previous film, Pothan manages to make the locations into characters that are essential to the story. The transition from the water abundant lush greenery of Alappuzha to the dry lands of Kasargod itself creates a drama that is almost unnoticed till the maker gives hints about it much later. Like the butterfly effect portrayed in ""Maheshinte Prathikaram"", Pothan visualizes much of his ideas without making it too obvious and asking more from his viewers, without losing the fun of it or making it too intellectual.The realistic approach of filmmaking in Malayalam films has been mostly gone through the section designated as art or parallel cinema until the last few years, where such films have become more commercially viable. Pothan's films are in the latter category, which combines the realism without losing the market appeal. The combination of Dileesh Pothan and creative director Syam Pushkaran also hides subtle political stands in plain sight. They try to point out a lot of social issues without being overly preachy. The film says a lot about hunger, caste system, identity, and bureaucracy, giving enough space for each of these issues.

7,"""A Simple,Realistic Drama That Hosts An Array Of Brilliant Performances ""","""Maheshinte Prathikaram"" released last year was a surprise hit at the Mollywood box office,that registered Dileesh Pothen as a renowned film-director with cult following among the movie-buffs who even managed to come up with a universal term ""Pothettan Brilliance'"" to point out instances of cinematic excellence in films by Pothen.""Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum"" was without doubt the most anticipated Malayalam movie of 2017 and I must say Pothen has succeeded in keeping the expectations intact by presenting an equally good film with some genuine performances from the solid cast as its major highlight.The story-line penned by critically acclaimed screenwriter Sajeev Pazhoor is a balanced mix of offbeat and mainstream elements with the simplicity in narration by Dileesh Pothen,eminent creative direction by Shyam Pushkaran,catchy cinematography by Rajeev Ravi and notable support from the cast combined making it a hearty watch for all the sections of the audience.The police station sequences in the movie in particular deserves a special mention for its originality and realistic treatment of the proceedings.Fahadh Fazil,Suraj Venjarammood and newcomer Nimsiha Sajayan all were at their best and enacted the roles invested on them impressively.The pick among the cast was real life police officer Sibi Thomas who gave a stellar act in Khakhi that was utterly realistic and authentic.On the negative side,the pace of the movie was a bit on the lower side for few parts of the story-line and the climax portions weren't as enjoyable as the rest of the presentation.Overall,""Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum"" is a simple film centered around a wafer thin plot that's narrated beautifully by Dileesh and the team.",simple realistic drama that hosts array brilliant performances,maheshinte prathikaram released last year was surprise hit at mollywood box office that registered dileesh pothen as renowned film director with cult following among movie buffs who even managed come up with universal term pothettan brilliance point out instances cinematic excellence films by pothen thondimuthalum driksakshiyum was without doubt most anticipated malayalam movie 2017 i must say pothen has succeeded keeping expectations intact by presenting equally good film with some genuine performances solid cast as its major highlight story line penned by critically acclaimed screenwriter sajeev pazhoor is balanced mix offbeat mainstream elements with simplicity narration by dileesh pothen eminent creative direction by shyam pushkaran catchy cinematography by rajeev ravi notable support cast combined making it hearty watch all sections audience police station sequences movie particular deserves special mention its originality realistic treatment proceedings fahadh fazil suraj venjarammood newcomer nimsiha sajayan all were at their best enacted roles invested them impressively pick among cast was real life police officer sibi thomas who gave stellar act khakhi that was utterly realistic authentic negative side pace movie was bit lower side few parts story line climax portions werent as enjoyable as rest presentation overall thondimuthalum driksakshiyum is simple film centered around wafer thin plot thats narrated beautifully by dileesh team,0.4542410714285715,0.2339471726190476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10,Good Film,"I watched Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum on Hotstar (Eng. subtitles), based on the numerous excellent reviews and of course I have seen a few good films starring Fahad Faasil as well as Suraj Venjaramoodu's Kollaiyude Sivarathri so I felt this film too must surely be good with such excellent actors.TD is very realistic, at times perhaps too realistic for comfort such as the police brutality scenes - which are probably worse in real life than what is depicted.The incident of chain 'snatching' .. it clearly wasn't snatching in TD but a smooth and skilful operation, anyway such crimes are a slice of very real life! The lead up to Nimisha - Sreeja and Prasad - Suraj's romance and marriage against her father's wishes and subsequent developments were portrayed in a matter of fact and very realistic manner just as such events unfold for so many others in life. Nimisha and Suraj are very believable as the couple and Fahad is the perfect slippery smart crook.The policemen and the police station could be any real taluka level PS, in fact all the sets and the locations seemed entirely real.TD is like watching a fictional story set in a documentary so to speak because it is all too real.The camera work, costumes, action shots, the relationships between the various characters, the events that unfold, the settlements, everything is perfect.The only minus is the length of the film, it dragged a bit in several scenes and could definitely have been much better had it been shorter.Overall, good cinema and worth watching.",good film,i watched thondimuthalum driksakshiyum hotstar eng subtitles based numerous excellent reviews course i have seen few good films starring fahad faasil as well as suraj venjaramoodus kollaiyude sivarathri so i felt this film too must surely be good with such excellent actors td is very realistic at times perhaps too realistic comfort such as police brutality scenes which are probably worse real life than what is depicted incident chain snatching it clearly wasnt snatching td but smooth skilful operation anyway such crimes are slice very real life lead up nimisha sreeja prasad surajs romance marriage against her fathers wishes subsequent developments were portrayed matter fact very realistic manner just as such events unfold so many others life nimisha suraj are very believable as couple fahad is perfect slippery smart crook policemen police station could be any real taluka level ps fact all sets locations seemed entirely real td is like watching fictional story set documentary so speak because it is all too real camera work costumes action shots relationships between various characters events that unfold settlements everything is perfect only minus is length film it dragged bit several scenes could definitely have been much better had it been shorter overall good cinema worth watching,0.45415476190476206,0.2631071428571429,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9,Highly Recommended !!,"Director Dileesh Pothan who made an impressive debut with Maheshinte Prathikaram has returned with another charming slice-of-life drama. When newly-wed couple Sreeja (Nimisha Sajayan) & Prasad (Suraj Venjaramoodu) are travelling by bus, a thief (Fahaad Faasil) steals Sreeja's gold chain. However, Sreeja catches him swallowing the gold chain and hands him over to the nearest police station with the help of co-passengers. The rest of the movie narrates what happens thereafter.Nimisha Sajayan as the housewife who is distraught and angry at her loss along with Suraj Venjaramoodu as the husband driven to his wits, Alencier Ley Lopez as the ASI Chandran on the brink of retirement bring an effortless authenticity to their roles while Fahaad Faasil nails his part as he transforms into a slippery smalltime thief shrouded in mystery.There is an inherent beauty to the narrative which flows like a gentle stream with minimal gush, yet capable of captivating the viewer with its steady flow. It draws us in very early and makes us totally invested in the story which keeps us wondering what next. The fact that Dileesh is able to bring out the beauty in the banal routines, seamlessly weave in multiple strands which add texture to even minor characters or happenings without disturbing the flow of the main narrative stand testimony to this helmer's confidence and control. He is emerging as a director with a distinct signature style and somebody to look forward to in the future.Kudos to the director who has marshalled an excellent cast and a brilliant technical team including ace cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, music director Bijibal and others in presenting a simple, subtle, yet absorbing story with a good dose of humour and garnished with just the apt level of thrill and suspense.",highly recommended,director dileesh pothan who made impressive debut with maheshinte prathikaram has returned with another charming slice life drama when newly wed couple sreeja nimisha sajayan prasad suraj venjaramoodu are travelling by bus thief fahaad faasil steals sreejas gold chain however sreeja catches him swallowing gold chain hands him over nearest police station with help co passengers rest movie narrates what happens thereafter nimisha sajayan as housewife who is distraught angry at her loss along with suraj venjaramoodu as husband driven his wits alencier ley lopez as asi chandran brink retirement bring effortless authenticity their roles while fahaad faasil nails his part as he transforms into slippery smalltime thief shrouded mystery there is inherent beauty narrative which flows like gentle stream with minimal gush yet capable captivating viewer with its steady flow it draws us very early makes us totally invested story which keeps us wondering what next fact that dileesh is able bring out beauty banal routines seamlessly weave multiple strands which add texture even minor characters or happenings without disturbing flow main narrative stand testimony this helmers confidence control he is emerging as director with distinct signature style somebody look forward future kudos director who has marshalled excellent cast brilliant technical team including ace cinematographer rajeev ravi music director bijibal others presenting simple subtle yet absorbing story with good dose humour garnished with just apt level thrill suspense,0.5782265046781176,0.17020527859237536,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10,Realistic insights presented with overwhelming brilliance and honesty,"Dileesh Pothan is going to stay for centuries on. Both his movies (""Maheshinte Prathikaram"" and ""Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum"" are textbook material - both from a cinema-making standpoint and from a pure viewership standpoint. I have watched ""Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum.."" three times now and intend to watch it many more times.Fahadh is a gem. His performance as the thief is out of this world. He just created another human being from himself out of his work.The spirit of the protagonist is outstanding. His ""never say die"" attitude is inspiring. One of the main reasons I have been wanting to watch the movie over and over is to have that spirit brush over on to me.Some of the calls he takes are sharp and insightful. He does not give up on his stance even as the doctor is speaking to him about his xray scan. But he decides to give in to the husband after the chase. He knows that that decision would entail excruciating pain from the hands of the police he has frustrated, but he takes that call out of love for his fellow human being. Not just the pain, most likely imprisonment as well.The movie has been able to present Prasad(the thief) to the people. Due to the nature of who a thief is, it is unlikely that you would know what a thief is like personally. Dileesh Pothen has painted a very realistic version of the thief who Fahad just became.Through Fahad, Dileesh communicates so many life insights. In the scene where an early teens' kid is shown eating voraciously, when the police officers make fun of the kid, Fahad says ""Do not mock him sir - at this age, hunger is on the higher side"" implying that he has had to suffer a lot of hunger at this age and that is what finally led him to become a thief.He understands the entire system. He knows what the police is going through. He understands what the couple is going through. He understands what he is going through. And he takes all these into consideration and makes his choices. And his ""never lose hope"" mindset guides him into a plan to have a happy ending for everyone in the movie - the police, the couple, and himself. The heart element of all this makes all this feel almost ethereal.Of course, it is the script that is the real hero and not the protagonist. So much of greatness without the artificiality of heroism.Suraj Venjaramoodu and Nimisha have played their roles really well as well. Nimisha is definitely the best actress in malayalam currently. Amazing performances over and over. The movie communicates a lot more viewpoints as well through the husband-wife relationships, the realities of police life. Fahadh's makeover and his character is what I have taken in. Dileesh is seriously amazing to have been able to create such an engaging movie which is at the same time realistic at every point in the movie. Reality is boring and movies are exciting with the glamour and stunts etc. That paradigm has not been leveraged at all. Every single shot in the movie is completely honest and realistic and yet so very engaging - not one dull moment all through the movie.Bijibal's music, Rajeev Ravi's cinematography, Shyam Pushkar as creative director, Dileesh Pothen's direction, Fahad's performance, Nimisha's performance, Suraj's performance, everyday insights that the movie offers - Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum is a must watch!",realistic insights presented with overwhelming brilliance honesty,dileesh pothan is going stay centuries both his movies maheshinte prathikaram thondimuthalum driksakshiyum are textbook material both cinema making standpoint pure viewership standpoint i have watched thondimuthalum driksakshiyum three times now intend watch it many more times fahadh is gem his performance as thief is out this world he just created another human being himself out his work spirit protagonist is outstanding his never say die attitude is inspiring one main reasons i have been wanting watch movie over over is have that spirit brush over me some calls he takes are sharp insightful he does not give up his stance even as doctor is speaking him about his xray scan but he decides give husband after chase he knows that that decision would entail excruciating pain hands police he has frustrated but he takes that call out love his fellow human being not just pain most likely imprisonment as well movie has been able present prasad thief people due nature who thief is it is unlikely that you would know what thief is like personally dileesh pothen has painted very realistic version thief who fahad just became through fahad dileesh communicates so many life insights scene where early teens kid is shown eating voraciously when police officers make fun kid fahad says do not mock him sir at this age hunger is higher side implying that he has had suffer lot hunger at this age that is what finally led him become thief he understands entire system he knows what police is going through he understands what couple is going through he understands what he is going through he takes all these into consideration makes his choices his never lose hope mindset guides him into plan have happy ending everyone movie police couple himself heart element all this makes all this feel almost ethereal course it is script that is real hero not protagonist so much greatness without artificiality heroism suraj venjaramoodu nimisha have played their roles really well as well nimisha is definitely best actress malayalam currently amazing performances over over movie communicates lot more viewpoints as well through husband wife relationships realities police life fahadhs makeover his character is what i have taken dileesh is seriously amazing have been able create such engaging movie which is at same time realistic at every point movie reality is boring movies are exciting with glamour stunts etc that paradigm has not been leveraged at all every single shot movie is completely honest realistic yet so very engaging not one dull moment all through movie bijibals music rajeev ravis cinematography shyam pushkar as creative director dileesh pothens direction fahads performance nimishas performance surajs performance everyday insights that movie offers thondimuthalum driksakshiyum is must watch,0.5298190476190476,0.2050904761904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"

7,Flawed and overrated .....,"The makers (there is a director, creative director and a writer) of Thondimuthalum Driksaakshiyum made a public apology to his highness Pimpinainteasy - the greatest movie watcher of all time, after they found out that he rated their film a 6/10 compared to the average IMDb rating of 8.5/10.Dear Pimpinainteasy,we agree wholeheartedly with your concerns about our film. Thondimuthalum suffered from a boring subtlety that tried to draw too much attention to itself. The truth is that we were unable to write a single memorable scene or piece of dialog. The writer is inferior compared to legends like Sreenivasan or Raghunath Paleri. We could not even find good supporting actors. Alancier is a completely unremarkable mediocrity who pales in comparison to greats Innocent, Jagathi or Shangaradi who could have done this role in their sleep. The less said about the other mumbling actors at the police station, the better. They were all fans of Marlon Brando I guess.The fraud Rajeev Ravi portrays rural Kerala as something that it is clearly not. The truth is we all have a hangover of some Sergio Leone or small town American film. We try to bestow these rural milieus with some kind of nobility and belligerence when the truth is that they are all just dirty backward dungholes. The greenery is not thanks to any commendable Malayali endeavor. It is just an act of nature. The only thing Malayalis can be proud of are the squalor and the ugly buildings.And the music composers pathetic attempt at imitating Morricone - I know you cringed in the theater when you heard the tuneless whistling rubbish that introduced Fahad's character.But I am sure you agree that the story was pretty unique. The film had immense potential which we failed to realize. Suraaj Venjaramudu is now an actor worth watching.
