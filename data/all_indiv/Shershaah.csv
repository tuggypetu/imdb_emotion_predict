8,Every Indian Should Watch Brave Story Of Vikram Batra Brilliantly Portrayed By Sidharth Malhotra,"When ever there is a war, natural calamity or a terrorist attack, the first people to come out and protect is Indian Army, who selflessly support us with their act of bravery. With never-ending tension going between India and Pakistan, so many sacrifices are being made by our Indian soldiers whose duty is to save the citizen from the scum of the Earth. To honor the soldiers who have laid down their lives to serve the country, there are few movies being made to tell the stories of gallantry. One such movie is on the Vikram Batra biopic drama, Shershaah, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani.Shershaah chronicles the life and story of the brave soldiers Vikram Batra (played by Sidharth Malhotra) who led a very difficult operation in Kargil War against Pakistan and even managed to pull down the enemy soldiers in hand combat, ensuring a solid victory for our motherland.Directed by Vishnu Vardhan, Shershaah is one such film which will keep you engaged right from the beginning till the electrifying climax. The powerful true story of Vikram Batra along with other soldiers who have sacrificed and struggled to ensure that safety of Indian citizen is their top most priority, The makers have done a fabulous job in portraying the stress, blood and sweat displayed by our honorable soldiers. Couple of scenes did caught my attention - Pakistani missiles hitting the Indian base in a surprise attack, the action scene at the police check point and last but not the least, the final showdown - which is the climax scene showing the ultimate sacrifice by Vikram Batra when he exposes himself to the enemy fire trying to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot. We get to see the real heroes only through some newspaper articles or social media who fought for their country, sacrificed their family and could not even return back to their motherland. Thanks to films like Shershaah speaks the true events of making of a soldier and the hardship and struggle these war machines go through.The initial reels had romantic track showing how Vikram Batra meets his fiancee Dimple hampers the momentum of the biopic drama, though the chemistry between Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani is sparkling. Also, it is high time, Bollywood can start making biopics without songs and melodrama which sometimes play the spoilsports. Nevertheless, writing by Sandeep Shrivastava is brilliant which should be lauded. Technically, Shershaah boast off brilliant cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Kashmir and Ladakh. Art direction is mind-blowing while background score creates more tensionTalking about performance, Sidharth Malhotra essays the role of Vikram Batra with T. The actor successfully shows diverse expressions of Vikram Batra right from the beginning when he joins the Indian Army as a rookie to the gallant soldier who fights for his country till his last breath. Shershaah might be a turning point in Sidharth Malhotra's career who comes up with a brave performance. In the supporting role, Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Nikitin Dheer have acted their part with equal justice.So overall, Shershaah is a spellbinding tale of a brave soldier which should be lauded and appreciated for its genuine attempt. Very good 3.5/5.",every indian should watch brave story vikram batra brilliantly portrayed by sidharth malhotra,when ever there is war natural calamity or terrorist attack first people come out protect is indian army who selflessly support us with their act bravery with never ending tension going between india pakistan so many sacrifices are being made by our indian soldiers whose duty is save citizen scum earth honor soldiers who have laid down their lives serve country there are few movies being made tell stories gallantry one such movie is vikram batra biopic drama shershaah which stars sidharth malhotra kiara advani shershaah chronicles life story brave soldiers vikram batra played by sidharth malhotra who led very difficult operation kargil war against pakistan even managed pull down enemy soldiers hand combat ensuring solid victory our motherland directed by vishnu vardhan shershaah is one such film which will keep you engaged right beginning till electrifying climax powerful true story vikram batra along with other soldiers who have sacrificed struggled ensure that safety indian citizen is their top most priority makers have done fabulous job portraying stress blood sweat displayed by our honorable soldiers couple scenes did caught my attention pakistani missiles hitting indian base surprise attack action scene at police check point last but not least final showdown which is climax scene showing ultimate sacrifice by vikram batra when he exposes himself enemy fire trying drag injured soldier safety process was shot we get see real heroes only through some newspaper articles or social media who fought their country sacrificed their family could not even return back their motherland thanks films like shershaah speaks true events making soldier hardship struggle these war machines go through initial reels had romantic track showing how vikram batra meets his fiancee dimple hampers momentum biopic drama though chemistry between sidharth malhotra kiara advani is sparkling also it is high time bollywood can start making biopics without songs melodrama which sometimes play spoilsports nevertheless writing by sandeep shrivastava is brilliant which should be lauded technically shershaah boast off brilliant cinematography capturing beautiful locales kashmir ladakh art direction is mind blowing while background score creates more tensiontalking about performance sidharth malhotra essays role vikram batra with t actor successfully shows diverse expressions vikram batra right beginning when he joins indian army as rookie gallant soldier who fights his country till his last breath shershaah might be turning point sidharth malhotras career who comes up with brave performance supporting role kiara advani shiv pandit nikitin dheer have acted their part with equal justice so overall shershaah is spellbinding tale brave soldier which should be lauded appreciated its genuine attempt very good 3 5 5,0.5203402410346855,0.21553057025279254,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.44}"

10,An Inspiring War Drama Of Braveheart's And Victories !!!,"The Kargil War, 1999 - the toughest mountain warfare ever. Fought at a dizzying altitude of 17,000 feet, this historic war had a lot at stake. The Pakistani troops had infiltrated into the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC), disguised as Kashmiri militants. The skirmishes quickly escalated into a full-blown war that also chalked the journey of a soldier from Lieutenant to Captain for his absolute dare-devilry and patriotic spirit to unfurl the tricolour at the highest point of conflict. Even if that meant laying down his own life for the cause.But before we get there, director Vishnu Varadhan and his writer Sandeep Srivastava take it slow. So we are taken right back to a childhood sequence of Captain Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) and shown his growing up years, finding the love of his life Dimple Cheema (Kiara Advani), before he is finally posted at the 13 JAK Rifles as a Lieutenant. While this build-up depicts the character's journey, it doesn't do so very sharply to merit so much screentime. In fact, most of the times, Kiara Advani's track and the romantic songs featuring her, feel like a distraction from the heavy-duty subject at hand. This also impacts the pace of the film that suffers from a slow first half.Of course, director Vishnu Varadhan had a mammoth task of doing justice to the copious amounts of data and milestones from the Kargil war, but the bulk of it is dealt with, in the second half. Sidharth Malhotra shines in the war scenes and his performance evolves through the film. His earnest efforts to recreate the aura of his character's larger-than-life persona shows on screen and this is one of his better performances. Kiara Advani looks her part as a resolute Sardarni, who loves her man with all her heart. But she doesn't have much scope to perform.Shiv Panditt is very aptly cast as Captain Sanjeev Jamwal, who is tough on the outside, but emotional from within. Nikitin Dheer is impressive as the cheerful Major Ajay Singh Jasrotia and so is Shataf Figar as the straight talking Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi. Together, these men make for an able team that you will root for, at all times. Among the many other character actors, there are a few stereotypes and clichÃ©s too, especially on the Pakistani side.The film's overall tone is obviously high on patriotism. Many combat scenes don't reflect the large canvas that the film is set up on, perhaps more deserving of a big screen experience. Yet, as an industry, Bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically and commercially acclaimed. By those standards, 'Shershaah' ranks high than most of the recent war dramas and tells an inspiring story that needs to be told.The source material of this film is so strong that it is bound to grip you once the men in uniform take it upon themselves to drive out the enemy and reclaim our land. 'Shershaah's biggest victory is its effort to recreate one of the most important chapters of our recent history with characters, who lead the way to a rousing climax.",inspiring war drama bravehearts victories,kargil war 1999 toughest mountain warfare ever fought at dizzying altitude 17 000 feet this historic war had lot at stake pakistani troops had infiltrated into indian side line control loc disguised as kashmiri militants skirmishes quickly escalated into full blown war that also chalked journey soldier lieutenant captain his absolute dare devilry patriotic spirit unfurl tricolour at highest point conflict even if that meant laying down his own life cause but before we get there director vishnu varadhan his writer sandeep srivastava take it slow so we are taken right back childhood sequence captain vikram batra sidharth malhotra shown his growing up years finding love his life dimple cheema kiara advani before he is finally posted at 13 jak rifles as lieutenant while this build up depicts characters journey it doesnt do so very sharply merit so much screentime fact most times kiara advanis track romantic songs featuring her feel like distraction heavy duty subject at hand this also impacts pace film that suffers slow first half course director vishnu varadhan had mammoth task doing justice copious amounts data milestones kargil war but bulk it is dealt with second half sidharth malhotra shines war scenes his performance evolves through film his earnest efforts recreate aura his characters larger than life persona shows screen this is one his better performances kiara advani looks her part as resolute sardarni who loves her man with all her heart but she doesnt have much scope perform shiv panditt is very aptly cast as captain sanjeev jamwal who is tough outside but emotional within nikitin dheer is impressive as cheerful major ajay singh jasrotia so is shataf figar as straight talking col yogesh kumar joshi together these men make able team that you will root at all times among many other character actors there are few stereotypes clich s too especially pakistani side films overall tone is obviously high patriotism many combat scenes dont reflect large canvas that film is set up perhaps more deserving big screen experience yet as industry bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically commercially acclaimed by those standards shershaah ranks high than most recent war dramas tells inspiring story that needs be told source material this film is so strong that it is bound grip you once men uniform take it upon themselves drive out enemy reclaim our land shershaahs biggest victory is its effort recreate one most important chapters our recent history with characters who lead way rousing climax,0.5056989696463381,0.1666179337231969,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

1,Bollywood does not know how to make war movies.,"With due respect to Capt.

Actors are not even trained on how to handle weapons properly.Check out movies like Hurt Locker or Black Hawk Down and see what real war scenes look like.Unlike in Bollywood movies Soldiers don't act spontaneously out of emotions - they act decisively, and with a plan.To the Director - Lack of realism is an insult to viewer's intelligence, especially if they come from army background.
