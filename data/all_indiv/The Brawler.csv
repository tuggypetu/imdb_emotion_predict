8,What is Both Beautiful and Ugly in India,"This insightful and true story reveals what is both beautiful and ugly in India and sheds light on what keeps the second most populous country in the world at the bottom of the Olympics. It is also the story of a young couple in love who struggle to live on their own terms in an arena that is far less forgiving than a boxing ring.Defeating other boxers is the easy part for Shravan. He is tough, well-trained and smart. Troubles really begin when Shravan falls for Sunaina. In the process he picks a fight with her uncle Bhagwan, also Shravan's coach. Next to Bhagwan, Rocky's coach Mickey looks like Miss Kitty. Bhagwan relentlessly punishes and humiliates Shravan with severe beatings, false charges, imprisonment, disqualifications by corrupt officials and more. When he cannot shake Shravan, Bhagwan goes after his support network; torture, kidnapping, rape and robbery. He throws his own brother on the street and breaks his knees. Bhagwan claims to be the victim. ""When a boxer is knocked out,"" he says ""it is the coach that bleeds."" Shravan tries to turn his anger into positive energy, and funnel it into his boxing gloves and his love for Sunaina.""Boxing is not a world of glamor like it is in West,"" said director Kashyap after the film's world premiere in Toronto. This film shows why this is sadly the case. It also provides a balanced snapshot of contemporary India with its amazing colors, song, dances and light, as well as its haze, corruption, crime and debilitating caste system. Actor Vineet Kumar Singh took a year off to train for his role as Shravan, and such thorough preparation is evident in his tremendous performance. The story is too long and disjointed in places, yet all together it is a fantastic, enthralling and dramatic portrait of the hypocrisy and corruption, as well as the beauty and color, in India. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.",what is both beautiful ugly india,this insightful true story reveals what is both beautiful ugly india sheds light what keeps second most populous country world at bottom olympics it is also story young couple love who struggle live their own terms arena that is far less forgiving than boxing ring defeating other boxers is easy part shravan he is tough well trained smart troubles really begin when shravan falls sunaina process he picks fight with her uncle bhagwan also shravans coach next bhagwan rockys coach mickey looks like miss kitty bhagwan relentlessly punishes humiliates shravan with severe beatings false charges imprisonment disqualifications by corrupt officials more when he cannot shake shravan bhagwan goes after his support network torture kidnapping rape robbery he throws his own brother street breaks his knees bhagwan claims be victim when boxer is knocked out he says it is coach that bleeds shravan tries turn his anger into positive energy funnel it into his boxing gloves his love sunaina boxing is not world glamor like it is west said director kashyap after films world premiere toronto this film shows why this is sadly case it also provides balanced snapshot contemporary india with its amazing colors song dances light as well as its haze corruption crime debilitating caste system actor vineet kumar singh took year off train his role as shravan such thorough preparation is evident his tremendous performance story is too long disjointed places yet all together it is fantastic enthralling dramatic portrait hypocrisy corruption as well as beauty color india seen at toronto international film festival,0.5903327922077922,0.10930916305916308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.23}"

8,Super Start of 2018,"Anurag Kashyap is redefining himself. I didn't like his last two films Bombay Velvet and Raman Raghav 2.0. But I like this one. I was amazed to see the whole story which was shown to us in trailer was there in first half itself. I got excited to think what the film will tell in the second half. First half was full of love, songs, romance, fight, and happy ending. Second half contains the issues in Government sectors, offices, sports and above all Uttar Pradesh. I wish Ravi Kishan's character had been written more. He suits in his perfectly. Debutant actress Zoya delivers superb expressions. Jimmy Shergil is as usual outstanding. Vineet Kumar Singh is terrific. He is now become star. Everyone knows that he can act superbly. But after this film, everyone would know that he can hold the entire film too. Songs are superb. Mushkil Hai Mel, Pantra, Bahut Dukha hai - Every song has its own charisma. Overall, a very good start of this year with this film.

9,A rare genre of sports drama,"#mukkabaaz 2hrs 35 minsimdb -8.4/10.PLOT A lower caste boxer struggles to keep up his career against different odds. Review So.... Anurag Kashyap after a decent film on a serial killer washed his hands for a film(told to be inspired by true events) related with street boxing in the alleys of UP. The film delivers as we all expect from Kashyap's film....brilliant performance,excellent direction and able screenplay.Remember,vineet kumar singh from ugly..he is the main character playing the street boxer shravan singh here.In his role he is more than perfect in his role...well adjectives will be short to describe his performance...he gets under the skin role so well that no one will be able to pick out a signle fault.His body transformation for this film is really inspiring.Jimmy Shergill was excellent in his role as Bhagwan Das mishra..the local goon leader and the villian..his body language and local accent was perfect.Zoya Hussein playing the role of a mute niece to shergill shines in her debut performance.Ravi kishan was also good....but the storyline was bit extended and fails to match the heights of gangs of wasseypur,Gullal...his previous masterpieces but this cinema is just short of achieving a classic tag because it slightly lacks kashyap's signature direction style which is unique.The gripping pace of the film will hold you to the seat but last 15-20mins seems to be forcefully extended.

With almost 3 years of training , we can see it easily in the movie that he has not only performed but lived it. Very well supported by Jimmy Shergill and Ravi Kishen.Zoya as Vineet's love life does full justice to the role in her debut.Coming to the direction part , we don't have the chance to find any flaws as the pace even little slow is kept very interesting and moving with a mixture of both commercial and art feel.Editing needs a special mention here.All in all its a well made movie.",method acting presentation,vineet kumar singh this name is going stay forever with you after you done watching mukkabaaz with small screen time roles anurag kashyaps wasseypur series ugly short film murabba part bombay talkies mahesh manjrekars lalbaug parel he is not new cinema world but first time he gets play lead he does it with impeccable performance what we call method acting with almost 3 years training we can see it easily movie that he has not only performed but lived it very well supported by jimmy shergill ravi kishen zoya as vineets love life does full justice role her debut coming direction part we dont have chance find any flaws as pace even little slow is kept very interesting moving with mixture both commercial art feel editing needs special mention here all all its well made movie,0.4801467051467051,0.11026635401635404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8,"It's not Gangs of Wasseypur, but Bombay Velvet neither.","The movie starts with a quote 'Inspired by true events'. This is where people who come for content find their head held high. It is also because of the person who has directed the movie - Anurag Kashyap. A person who keeps art to its minimum and reality to its maximum, which itself is an art.For me when I watched the movie, the other two movies that went through my mind were 'Saala Khadoos' and 'Brothers'. There's a saying movies run because of three factors, 3x entertainment.This is where the movie falls as unees bis.The ending could have been anything just like reality, so no comments on that one.Acting: Vineet Singh acted really well, so did other actors.I am comparing it with Gangs of Wasseypur, mostly because I don't think it would get that crowd.

8,A gripping dark tale of romance and passion,"As the experts say ""Form is temporary, class is permanent"". And Anurag Kashyap has come roaring back to form with 'Mukkabaaz'. Although one can argue that he never was out of form except for 'Bombay Velvet'.In this do-or-die movie, as stated by Anurag Kashyap himself he shows his true class. The dark narrative, brutish characters are all present in this film. The protagonist Shravan Kumar(Vineet Kumar Singh) is an aspiring boxer from Bareilly who trains under a retired boxer and present state minister Bhagwan Das Mishra(Jimmy Shergill) and falls in love with his mute niece Sunanina(Zoya Hussain). But Bhagwan, a Brahmin treats his boxers more like his laundry boys. This irritates Shravan and the two have an early faceoff.But Bhagwan is the real Godfather of Bareilly who can clutch anyone he wants under his feet and all he wants is to never let Shravan take part in any Boxing competition ever. This is where Kashyap is a treat to watch. He gives you these Scorsese-Tarantinesque characters who can you flinch with their terror and Bhagwan is exactly the same no-nonsense kind. He has no emotional vulnerability, no principles and will use his whole power to do anything he wants ""Kyunki wo Brahman hain,wo aadesh dete hain"" and its your duty to oblige.On the other hand there is Shravan, determined to achieve both his passion and his love. He is ready to fight every situation but is desperately running out of time. Finally he meets Sanjay Kumar(Ravi Kishan) is a Boxing tournament who immediately takes him under his wing. He starts to train Shravan for the State-level Championship, the only way for him to marry Sunanina.It is only Kashyap's excellence which even makes a love story this dark. You can sense the tension building in the second half but even then its impossible to predict the brutality in the second phase. Its noticeable that the whole focus of the movie is on Boxing and not the romance. Boxing is central to the film thus touching the plight of the sport in the state and country as you hear ""Boxing pe picture banti hai to 40 crore kamati hai, par boxing tournament hota hai to chaalis log bhi dekhne nahi aate"". The federation is being run by goons turning and twisting the sport according to their own benefits.Zoya Hussain is a fresh surprise in her debut role. She manages to express the anger of Sunanina beautifully with her eyes without speaking a single work. Ravi Kishan does not have much screen time but is a delight to watch throughout. Its baffling to see how such a talented actor has been underutilized in the hindi film industry. Jimmy Shergill another stereotypes underestimated actor has nothing new which he hasn't done in the past. He plays the same corrupt minister who turns the system as per his own wishes. But he presents himself with such brutality you can literally feel the anger brewing inside you against this man. Though it is Vineet Singh Sharma who captures the screen in his first central role. One of Anurag Kashyap's trusted Banner-men, Vineet is ferocious, flamboyant and flawless at the same time. He makes you feel for Shravan without showing weakness in a single frame. And what to say about Anurag Kashyap himself. He has made the actors act with their eyes rather than their words. This is where he is at his best. Where he tells the story of an underdog fighting against the system. The dark reality of the small towns where the God-men run the system without any intrusion. He has hit the right straps with 'Mukkabaaz' and we owe it to him for giving such peerless start to the new year. 'Mukkabaaz' sets the benchmark for this year's cinema.

8,"""Boxing ke upar agar film bane to 40 crore kama leti hain, aur boxing match dekhne kelie 40 log vi nahi ata""","Yes, this is something India is searching for years. The films resemble of some hollywood fight films. The story is of a middle class young guy who is fighting for fighting that means he is dying to play boxing and suddenly he falls in love with a girl. Overall the film makes a great drama, sometimes you can't realize this one is a true story. It's an unbelievable true story which you just can't miss. So if I talk about the acting, there is no fault in acting. everyone does a great acting, the directing was also good and it should be because the director is one and only Anurag Kashyap. But it's true that this is the simplest film by Anurag Kashyap. It's not touchy as Ugly, not more action than gangs of wasseypur, not more violence than Raman Raghav. But it is best in it's own place. Background score and music directing is average....!

9,perfect mix of humour & tension. one of the best from Anurag kashyap,"Anurag Kashyap is best with the small canvas & stars with less stardom. We have seen his best in Gangs of Wasseypur & this movie is not less than that. Be it story , screen play , acting, dialogs, music. The movie takes the direction within first 7-8 minutes of the start.Jimmy shergil fans wont be disappointed with his screen presence & dialoges.There are many dialoges in which you want to wistle & shout. The movie runs with a constant pace & screen play helps you to be involved in the film completely. Vineet Singh has been brilliant with his performance. Be it ugly or GOW. He had all emotions in the film be it laughter or action. The boxing fight sequels were average but so much happens at the same time that we dont bother for those scenes. In the normar fight sequences he fight like a boxer which was amazing to see unlikely other movies based on boxing were hero fights in the ring differently. Zoya Hussain was fine with the disablily. The other characters were brilliant like Ravi Kishan had a short role but waas sparkling.Shreedhar Dubey as Vineet's friend was ok. Overall you will be amazed to see performance of each character.

6,Does not appeal to Rural Small Town Mass audience - Why?,"I was a BIG fan of Anurag Kashyap when he came into the scene after super-hit Dev D and I have managed to watched all movies made by him.This movie is projected as a love story of an underdog lower caste aspiring boxer from small town in North India in LOVE with a upper caste Brahmin girl. The story was written by the lead actor Vineet Kumar Singh in lines of Sylvester Stallone's debut Rocky. Vineet had earlier worked with Anurag Kashyap in a few films and was searching for a producer with a caveat stating that - he will play the lead. With Dangal,Sultan, Mary Kom, Bhag Milka Bhaag and other sports films doing good - Anurag found the story idea interesting and agreed to produce, and direct the movie.After reading positive reviews I was expecting much, but frankly - I was under-whelmed. To a certain extend I understand why and how film buzzes positive reviews by urban city based class (may be caste-based also?) English speaking pseudo intellectual critics. But that is a different topic all together.I was trying to find out what could one changed in the movie to make it fare better at box office. My answer was ""not much"" because as many reviewers have written - superb acting,perfect casting, real locales, good setting, hard-hitting dialogues, tight narrative, good humor, good music, social, caste, feminist, corruption issues etc. etc. it has a typical Anurag Kashyap stamp of indulgence as an observer of today's society. One can say - it was a hard-hitting film.Then I questioned - It is an okay movie, but why it did not appeal me or general population much? I think: First, The deep connections with main characters and audiences is missing. The only character that connected with me was of Ravi Kishan as a Harijan (lower-caste) coach who instilled dignity to the proceeding - but his role was curtailed half way in the movie. Second, there are NO inspiring moments to linger to touch our heart and bring tears to our eyes or moments that will stay in one's psyche after leaving the theater. Third, In Anurag Kashyap's movies there is no poise - his narrative is relentless with intent to shock. The only thing that remained with me was the often repeated song's lyrics:""Mushkil Hai Apna Mel Priye Ye Pyar Nahi Hai Khel Priye""At one point I thought - I was watching a well made Bhojpuri movie. Nothing wrong with that except it had a Anurag Kashyap stamp all over it. I may be wrong but I think the fault-line runs much deeper. I think Anurag Kashyap tries overtly hard to make the movies to show his intellectual sensibility acumen. Anurag make movies for International art film noirs/ circuits/ festivals and multiplex based urban elite educated audiences and critics. He is trying hard to make a mass movie with earthy rural and small town topics but till now has failed to appeal to India's hinterlands. May be that is why his movies are only marginal profit making ventures at box office (except Dev.D).The good thing I like of Anurag Kashyap is that he gives opportunities to new talent in abundance...I will go with 6 out of 10 rating for this movie.",does not appeal rural small town mass audience why,i was big fan anurag kashyap when he came into scene after super hit dev d i have managed watched all movies made by him this movie is projected as love story underdog lower caste aspiring boxer small town north india love with upper caste brahmin girl story was written by lead actor vineet kumar singh lines sylvester stallones debut rocky vineet had earlier worked with anurag kashyap few films was searching producer with caveat stating that he will play lead with dangal sultan mary kom bhag milka bhaag other sports films doing good anurag found story idea interesting agreed produce direct movie after reading positive reviews i was expecting much but frankly i was under whelmed certain extend i understand why how film buzzes positive reviews by urban city based class may be caste based also english speaking pseudo intellectual critics but that is different topic all together i was trying find out what could one changed movie make it fare better at box office my answer was not much because as many reviewers have written superb acting perfect casting real locales good setting hard hitting dialogues tight narrative good humor good music social caste feminist corruption issues etc etc it has typical anurag kashyap stamp indulgence as observer todays society one can say it was hard hitting film then i questioned it is okay movie but why it did not appeal me or general population much i think first deep connections with main characters audiences is missing only character that connected with me was ravi kishan as harijan lower caste coach who instilled dignity proceeding but his role was curtailed half way movie second there are no inspiring moments linger touch our heart bring tears our eyes or moments that will stay ones psyche after leaving theater third anurag kashyaps movies there is no poise his narrative is relentless with intent shock only thing that remained with me was often repeated songs lyrics mushkil hai apna mel priye ye pyar nahi hai khel priye at one point i thought i was watching well made bhojpuri movie nothing wrong with that except it had anurag kashyap stamp all over it i may be wrong but i think fault line runs much deeper i think anurag kashyap tries overtly hard make movies show his intellectual sensibility acumen anurag make movies international art film noirs circuits festivals multiplex based urban elite educated audiences critics he is trying hard make mass movie with earthy rural small town topics but till now has failed appeal indias hinterlands may be that is why his movies are only marginal profit making ventures at box office except dev d good thing i like anurag kashyap is that he gives opportunities new talent abundance i will go with 6 out 10 rating this movie,0.42247585747585736,0.10361471861471862,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"

7,A passion killing climax of a passionate sportsman in a caste infected real society,"Where Cinderella Man was about a boxer in poverty, played like a very shy, mature and not very angry character by Russel Crowe, and South Paw on the other hand was a very angry boxer; The Brawler is about a boxer who somehow develops a passion for Boxing in all wrong situation. Anuraag Kashyap with all his raw and modern film-making talent, often suffers from the problem of showing a large story in small time frame. It took two movies for him to show Gangs of Wasseypur and in The Brawler also he has tried stuffing too many aspects of not only the realities required for the story but also the things Mr. Kahsyap was touched upon by, for instance the incident of Dadri. The main plot where the director could have elevated the hostility between two strong and opposite characters, while adding to the characters of two, he looks distracted towards other frames of life. There are movies where a huge amount of background stories are added to the characters not by showing all of it but by adding some features or a one liner to the character, for instance the role by joaquin phoenix in The Master, or 15-20 mins performance of Leonardo in Django Unchained. Ravi Kishan and Jimmi Shergil have outdone themselves again; also the Boxer and his wife are played upto the mark, but the character who probably took all the attention without saying too much was the friend of the Boxer, Mr. Gopal played by a very talented actor Shree Dhar Dubey. Mr. Dubey also left is remarkable presence in Masaan but in this film he was given more frames and he has not left a single one without defining to the audience as well as to the other actors also, ""what's ACTING is"". All in all the movie should be credited with its bold and beautiful story telling. There are always flaws in a product and hence the scope of betterment for the next one. The trauma going around the lead character shown in the movie makes it indigestible to accept that anyone can perform positively while his wife is kidnapped, kidney is broken and the skull is open owing to an iron rod. Also the scene where Bhagwan D Mishra breakes Duhshashan's Janghas seems week due to improper reaction from the wife of Gopal Mishra. The weakest part probably was the climax, but its a practical and most real climax so it is accepted as a story. Apart from Mr. Dubey's performance, the other best performance was from Mr. Ravi Kishan who from his attire (kudos to costume designer), his way of talking without much coming from the screenplay showed how a surviver and struggler from a low caste would behave and advise others.",passion killing climax passionate sportsman caste infected real society,where cinderella man was about boxer poverty played like very shy mature not very angry character by russel crowe south paw other hand was very angry boxer brawler is about boxer who somehow develops passion boxing all wrong situation anuraag kashyap with all his raw modern film making talent often suffers problem showing large story small time frame it took two movies him show gangs wasseypur brawler also he has tried stuffing too many aspects not only realities required story but also things mr kahsyap was touched upon by instance incident dadri main plot where director could have elevated hostility between two strong opposite characters while adding characters two he looks distracted towards other frames life there are movies where huge amount background stories are added characters not by showing all it but by adding some features or one liner character instance role by joaquin phoenix master or 15 20 mins performance leonardo django unchained ravi kishan jimmi shergil have outdone themselves again also boxer his wife are played upto mark but character who probably took all attention without saying too much was friend boxer mr gopal played by very talented actor shree dhar dubey mr dubey also left is remarkable presence masaan but this film he was given more frames he has not left single one without defining audience as well as other actors also whats acting is all all movie should be credited with its bold beautiful story telling there are always flaws product hence scope betterment next one trauma going around lead character shown movie makes it indigestible accept that anyone can perform positively while his wife is kidnapped kidney is broken skull is open owing iron rod also scene where bhagwan d mishra breakes duhshashans janghas seems week due improper reaction wife gopal mishra weakest part probably was climax but its practical most real climax so it is accepted as story apart mr dubeys performance other best performance was mr ravi kishan who his attire kudos costume designer his way talking without much coming screenplay showed how surviver struggler low caste would behave advise others,0.4661289107717679,0.09642861107146822,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"

The rest of the actors have also done a splendid job, notable is the character of Sunaina played by Zoya Hussain. She has won hearts even without dialogues as a dumb girl. Her intensity in the role is just praiseworthy. Anurag Kashyap like always got us to rave about his directorial capability. He is able to crave out some scenes which will move the audience to the core especially the traffic scene where Vineet singh is trying to stop the car of Jimmy Shergill.

7,Mukka is powerful,"Kashyap takes the most successful and used up story of the hero falling in love with the heroine from the villain's family along with the boxing story and gives it the freshness that such films lacked in its umpteen versions. The acor-writer Vineet Kumar brilliantly portrayed the flawed hero (which is quite rare in these type of Indian films) he wrote for himself. The problems of caste, politics, corruption are all dealt so organically at the same time it's also quite commercial especially for Kashyap's style. He's made the film perfectly balanced considering the content and presentation in every possible way (ie related to politics and audience expectations). Mute girl, cow lynching, ""bharat matha ki jai"" Kashyap is making statements at every juncture but still even the smallest details make sure how real the characters are. The ending is in a way a compromise by the protagonists but it's much more of a victory for them while facing the reality.

6,Kashyap mingled his thoughts about indian sports scene with his sense of film which will work comercially.,"Film does not provide any intimacy with the character. We got the chance of looking into their life from generalized perspective of average film making. Movie had too many songs and they were good but absence of required absence made them somewhat irritating at times. I did not like the portrayal of the the lead character but it somewhat goes with the way director intended to make the film(well he surely made the physical part look real which deserve every applause). Character portrayal by jimi shergill was also too much weighed on the commercial side but i guess its the thing of casting and director's idea of the film. tempo of the film was too fast for my taste. film had too much content too show in the limited time frame so tempo was mandatory i guess and good film making at such tempo is a tough task. well this tempo is common with all the films of kashyap. Better cinematography could have done great things for the films but it was just another average thing about the film. Lights in the scenes were imbalanced, the intention of the direction of light setting was right but more effort was needed. i sometimes think that cinematographers, art directors like people dont have anything to express of themselves.
