10.0,A Magnificent and Overwhelming Fairytale – An Oscar Deserving,"In 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had to pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of their lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In those years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the inhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh), comments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable to the Indian child game 'gilli-danda'. The nasty and arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion with Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a match against the British team, imposing the following condition: if the natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the next three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in that year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people. The sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), finds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan and his friends, teaching them how to play cricket. This movie is a magnificent and overwhelming fairytale. It really deserved an Oscar nomination! The nice and well-directed story has wonderful songs and interpretations, romance, treason, dispute, drama, beautiful messages, outstanding choreography, being a stunning film indicated as family entertainment. The expensive Brazilian DVD is a shame, showing a total lack of respect of the 'Columbia Tristar Home Video' with the Brazilian costumers: the important songs do not have subtitles in Portuguese. I changed the option in the 'Menu' to 'English', and there were subtitles in English. At least in the opinion of the ridiculous Columbia representatives, Brazilians shall learn English first to understand the wonderful lyrics sang in Hindi. I feel really sorry for those who cannot understand English, since they will miss the meaning of these songs. It is amazing how 225 minutes running time passes so fast when you see such a marvelous movie. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Lagaan – A Coragem de Um Povo' ('Lagaan – The Courage of a People')",magnificent overwhelming fairytale oscar deserving,1893 india was colony england starving native farmers had pay imposed tax british soldiers protection their lands delivering most their harvest british queen those years lands were very dry due lack rain inhabitants champaner decide request their rajah puran singh kulbhushan kharbanda waive taxes while waiting rajah bhuvan aamir khan beloved friend gauri gracy singh comments that silly game cricket was stupid game comparable indian child game gilli danda nasty arrogant captain andrew russell paul blackthorne who had had previous discussion with bhuvan listens his comment challenges bhuvan play match against british team imposing following condition if natives win game they would not need pay lagaan next three years otherwise they would triplicate their payment that year bhuvan accepts bet despite opinion his people sister captain russell elizabeth russell rachel shelley finds competition unfair indians decides help bhuvan his friends teaching them how play cricket this movie is magnificent overwhelming fairytale it really deserved oscar nomination nice well directed story has wonderful songs interpretations romance treason dispute drama beautiful messages outstanding choreography being stunning film indicated as family entertainment expensive brazilian dvd is shame showing total lack respect columbia tristar home video with brazilian costumers important songs do not have subtitles portuguese i changed option menu english there were subtitles english at least opinion ridiculous columbia representatives brazilians shall learn english first understand wonderful lyrics sang hindi i feel really sorry those who cannot understand english since they will miss meaning these songs it is amazing how 225 minutes running time passes so fast when you see such marvelous movie my vote is ten title brazil lagaan coragem de um povo lagaan courage people,0.592659574468085,0.1337943262411348,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.36}"

9.0,Just One Word: Wow!,"LAGAAN (4+ outta 5 stars) Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by the British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a cricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and I won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the most exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it all comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits and the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS long... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust and community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like watching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for a big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's cricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with the proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region three years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team... but if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has been no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes... this becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in the lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and Al Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his fellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or wooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great story! Great music! Don't miss this one!",just one word wow,lagaan 4 outta 5 stars years subjugation unfair taxation by british empire come head inhabitants small indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors cricket match this may seem like ridiculous idea movie i wont even mention fact that its musical but this was most exciting wonderful movie ive seen quite some time yes it all comes down cricket match between upper class british twits neophyte indian farmers movie is almost four hours long but wow what movie this is slow building trust community among usually bickering villagers as they prepare their ultimate battle is both fascinating inspiring its like watching magnificent seven or wild bunch gathering together big showdown only instead shooting killing theres cricket cocky british captain paul blackthorne makes deal with proud young bhuvan aamir khan he will give entire region three years no taxes if they can defeat british cricket team but if they lose they have pay triple tax this year since there has been no rain all season they cant even pay their regular taxes this becomes tense do or die situation aamir khan is terrific lead he resembles cross between tony curtis peter sellers al pacino he is always believable whether trying inspire his fellow villagers or facing his english enemies stony silence or wooing his lovely gauri gracy singh with song dance great story great music dont miss this one,0.5548926145079991,0.11353276353276354,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,"Boy, was I surprised!","Okay, I am not from India, not even close. I am from Scandinavia. Before Lagaan I had never watched any Hindi movies of any kind. I know about 3 words from the hindi language. And I don't like musicals much. I viewed the movie on a DVD of rather poor quality compared to the state of the art DVDs I am used to. And I was told the movie lasted close to 4(!) hours... I figured this would be a complete waste of time... BOY was I wrong! This movie is completely the opposite! It is just amazing! Mr. Gowariker has selected an incredible cast with Aamir Khan in the lead. He makes an stunning performance as the village rebel, Bhuvan. He tries to unite the village in a struggle for life against the greedy Britons. The Britons exploit the villages by collecting lagaan (tax). This means that most of the harvest surplus is gone and there is just enough left for food for the farmers themselves. It's a classic war between ""David"", the native villagers of India, and ""Goliath"", the powerful and greedy Britons. But what makes it really interesting is that this war is fought in a Cricket arena. This is a challenge from the Britons, who are well known with Cricket, against the village, where most people have never laid eyes upon a cricket bat. If the villagers win, there will be no lagaan at all, for three years! And if the Britons win, they will collect triple lagaan, which will mean the end of the village. The stakes could not be higher!!I can't remember a movie being this thrilling and having so much life in it. And the music has a huge impact thanks to the great voices of Udit Narayan, Lata Mangeshkar etc. And the dancing is a chapter in itself! Few or none will leave this movie not remembering the song ""Mitwa, sun Mitwa"". It is a must see for everyone, inside and outside of India. And this movies has been totally righteously nominated for an Oscar too, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes all the way to the top. It has my vote! It gets 10 out of 10 from me. Excellent!",boy was i surprised,okay i am not india not even close i am scandinavia before lagaan i had never watched any hindi movies any kind i know about 3 words hindi language i dont like musicals much i viewed movie dvd rather poor quality compared state art dvds i am used i was told movie lasted close 4 hours i figured this would be complete waste time boy was i wrong this movie is completely opposite it is just amazing mr gowariker has selected incredible cast with aamir khan lead he makes stunning performance as village rebel bhuvan he tries unite village struggle life against greedy britons britons exploit villages by collecting lagaan tax this means that most harvest surplus is gone there is just enough left food farmers themselves its classic war between david native villagers india goliath powerful greedy britons but what makes it really interesting is that this war is fought cricket arena this is challenge britons who are well known with cricket against village where most people have never laid eyes upon cricket bat if villagers win there will be no lagaan at all three years if britons win they will collect triple lagaan which will mean end village stakes could not be higher i cant remember movie being this thrilling having so much life it music has huge impact thanks great voices udit narayan lata mangeshkar etc dancing is chapter itself few or none will leave this movie not remembering song mitwa sun mitwa it is must see everyone inside outside india this movies has been totally righteously nominated oscar too i wouldnt be surprised if it goes all way top it has my vote it gets 10 out 10 me excellent,0.5458333333333333,0.25869047619047614,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Perfect First Time Bollywood Treat,"This was my first full-fledged trip into Bollywood and I couldn't have asked for a better entry. While there were some inconsistencies in sound, overall I loved the picture. Some of the songs and dances were breathtaking and emotionally charged. In particular the number where Bhuvan and the young boy are sitting on a hill and they're shrugging their shoulders, soon getting the village into the act. The other number where Bhuvan and Gauri re-enact the love of Krishna and Radha in exquisite dancing. Also there were many moments of stunning, breathtaking images, including the women of the village seated in the temple praying for salvation. Absolutely stunning. While I feel some judicious pruning could have trimmed the nearly 4 hour long version I watched (the DVD of which included an additional 17 minutes cut from this version) the picture did not seem nearly as long as it really was. Aamir Khan is such an instantly likable presence and Gracy Singh is simply irresistible as Gauri. Paul Blackthorne was a hilarious, old-school villain right out of a penny dreadful melodrama  and I mean this as a compliment. Rachel Shelley's Elizabeth was a perfect blend of Victorian reserved beauty and free spirit and noble in her heartbreak. So many other performances ran the gamut from old school ""b"" stereotypical characters to some original ideas.The blending of melodrama (in its purest sense) true comedic moments (the hen keeper), self and enlightenment culminated in the scene where Bhuvan shocks the village by touching an untouchable; his stirring, heartfelt speech about brotherhood and putting away castes shaming the village into enlightenment.Some of the criticism leveled at Lagaan is (I believe) unduly harsh. This is a charming movie and a perfect introduction into the joys of Bollywood.",perfect first time bollywood treat,this was my first full fledged trip into bollywood i couldnt have asked better entry while there were some inconsistencies sound overall i loved picture some songs dances were breathtaking emotionally charged particular number where bhuvan young boy are sitting hill theyre shrugging their shoulders soon getting village into act other number where bhuvan gauri re enact love krishna radha exquisite dancing also there were many moments stunning breathtaking images including women village seated temple praying salvation absolutely stunning while i feel some judicious pruning could have trimmed nearly 4 hour long version i watched dvd which included additional 17 minutes cut this version picture did not seem nearly as long as it really was aamir khan is such instantly likable presence gracy singh is simply irresistible as gauri paul blackthorne was hilarious old school villain right out penny dreadful melodrama i mean this as compliment rachel shelleys elizabeth was perfect blend victorian reserved beauty free spirit noble her heartbreak so many other performances ran gamut old school b stereotypical characters some original ideas blending melodrama its purest sense true comedic moments hen keeper self enlightenment culminated scene where bhuvan shocks village by touching untouchable his stirring heartfelt speech about brotherhood putting away castes shaming village into enlightenment some criticism leveled at lagaan is i believe unduly harsh this is charming movie perfect introduction into joys bollywood,0.598549107142857,0.2680183531746031,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,Very entertaining film,"1893. In a small farming community in India stands a British cantonment commanded by the cruel Captain Russell. When the Raja refuses to bow to his demands to eat meat he doubles the tax that the community must pay  even though the lack of rain means the community can barely pay the normal rate. When the villagers beg for mercy Russell challenges them to a cricket match  to win means the tax is waived, to lose means it is trebled. One man in the village, Bhuvan takes up the bet and must rally the village to learn the game and win at all costs.I was given this to watch because I had told someone at work that Bollywood movies are essentially a love story where the parents disapprove but it all gets sorted in a big dance number. So she gave me this to widen my knowledge. At first read of the plot I thought to myself `this is the air up there' with cricket'  then I saw the 3½ hour running time! But I said I'd watch it out of courtesy.However let me tell you that the time flew by really quickly. It only dragged occasionally but for most of the time I was really entertained by the plot and in some cases gripped by the drama. First of all  I'm not a fan of cricket but this could really be any sport as that is not important to the story. The plot may be the old `underdog' chestnut but it is still very well done with lots of energy and lots of nice touches that take the chestnut and add just enough difference to it to make it seem fresh.This main plot also has various stories underneath. The main one being the romance between Bhuvan and Gauri which is complicated by the arrival of Elizabeth, who also falls for Bhuvan. This is well handled and is very involving  although I don't really like Bollywood song and dance numbers very much, so these slowed proceedings a little for me. Although many of the songs are comic but also very well choreographed.The film is really helped by the constant interweaving of comedy in the form of the villagers' characters  they fight, they fall down they argue etc  but it is still amusing if not roaringly funny. However the focus on their plight is never lost  the drama is kept running just below the surface at all times and the final hour is tense. Tense! A cricket match! I didn't expect it to be exciting but at times you are on the edge of your seat  and it isn't as cliched a game as I'd expected it to be!It does have some flaws of course  the film is a little heavy handed at first in making sure we know the British are bad, it is done too early and too quickly  couldn't we have been led to that conclusion rather than pushed straight away? The songs I found to sound very similar to oneanother  but this may be the fact I don't like them. To add to this the sound quality between the songs and the dialogue was very different  the songs all had a very studio feel when heard beside the dialogue. Also the plot is a little cliched  although I after watching it I did think that it was well done and like I said, had nice touches (which I won't tell) that upped the drama  even if you THINK you know how it'll end.But over an almost 4 hr running time, minor flaws can be forgiven. Khan is a good Bollywood lead but the film helps him by not making him invincible  rather it does show him making mistakes etc. Singh is good as Gauri even if she is a standard `wide eyes' Bollywood starlet! Surprisingly good was `Holby City' actor Paul Blackthorne who not only manages to give a really mean performance but does it in both Hindi and English. He also looks a bit like Sean Connery  or at least he did to me!Overall this manages to make the long running time fly by quite easily  a rare feat for a movie these days. It is exciting, romantic and comic. It may have it's flaws but on the whole it is a very entertaining film in many ways.",very entertaining film,1893 small farming community india stands british cantonment commanded by cruel captain russell when raja refuses bow his demands eat meat he doubles tax that community must pay even though lack rain means community can barely pay normal rate when villagers beg mercy russell challenges them cricket match win means tax is waived lose means it is trebled one man village bhuvan takes up bet must rally village learn game win at all costs i was given this watch because i had told someone at work that bollywood movies are essentially love story where parents disapprove but it all gets sorted big dance number so she gave me this widen my knowledge at first read plot i thought myself this is air up there with cricket then i saw 3 hour running time but i said id watch it out courtesy however let me tell you that time flew by really quickly it only dragged occasionally but most time i was really entertained by plot some cases gripped by drama first all im not fan cricket but this could really be any sport as that is not important story plot may be old underdog chestnut but it is still very well done with lots energy lots nice touches that take chestnut add just enough difference it make it seem fresh this main plot also has various stories underneath main one being romance between bhuvan gauri which is complicated by arrival elizabeth who also falls bhuvan this is well handled is very involving although i dont really like bollywood song dance numbers very much so these slowed proceedings little me although many songs are comic but also very well choreographed film is really helped by constant interweaving comedy form villagers characters they fight they fall down they argue etc but it is still amusing if not roaringly funny however focus their plight is never lost drama is kept running just below surface at all times final hour is tense tense cricket match i didnt expect it be exciting but at times you are edge your seat it isnt as cliched game as id expected it be it does have some flaws course film is little heavy handed at first making sure we know british are bad it is done too early too quickly couldnt we have been led that conclusion rather than pushed straight away songs i found sound very similar oneanother but this may be fact i dont like them add this sound quality between songs dialogue was very different songs all had very studio feel when heard beside dialogue also plot is little cliched although i after watching it i did think that it was well done like i said had nice touches which i wont tell that upped drama even if you think you know how itll end but over almost 4 hr running time minor flaws can be forgiven khan is good bollywood lead but film helps him by not making him invincible rather it does show him making mistakes etc singh is good as gauri even if she is standard wide eyes bollywood starlet surprisingly good was holby city actor paul blackthorne who not only manages give really mean performance but does it both hindi english he also looks bit like sean connery or at least he did me overall this manages make long running time fly by quite easily rare feat movie these days it is exciting romantic comic it may have its flaws but whole it is very entertaining film many ways,0.49496273712737104,0.13389566395663957,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Great Art Movie !,"It is seldom in this modern era of IT generation that a long movie surpassing three hours of running time and without a show of synthetic acting, vulgarity and cheap comedy, captivates the audience to stick to their seats. WELL DONE Gowarikar ...... WELL DONE Amir Khan ....... Mr. Gowarikar, please note that if this sublime film had been directed by a British or American director like Danny Boyle or Richard Attenborough .... the Oscars would have definitely flown into the laps of the director and the protagonist actor. This is not to say that your directorial skills lack the excellence to win the coveted Academy Awards, but it is to mention the inherent bias and prejudice which prevails among the jury of the Oscar Award Committee towards directors, producers and actors of the Sub-Continent namely India. Mother India (1957) met the same fate from the then jury of Academy Awards committee who simply rejected its nomination for the Oscars on the grounds that it is laden with too much songs, formulaic in nature. Besides, the excellent performance of Amir Khan as an aggressive and challenging native youth 'Bhavan'; Rachael Shelley has put up a remarkable and evocatively strong performance as the suave young British lady Elizabeth Russell, who aspires to help out the hapless villagers from the cunning guile of his brother, Captain Russel. Now what can one say if the members of the Oscar awarding committee do not understand the meanings of wordings of the emotionally focused songs (due to language and culture difference). It is a handicap with them and not with the local Indian movie making team. Keeping aside this injustice, the movie characterizes pure and pristine feelings, emotions, struggle and fighting spirit of a raw and unskilled cricket team of illiterate Indian villagers who capitalized the opportunity to get waived the odious land revenue tax, with exacting standards of will power and perseverance.After a long time, there is an Indian movie bred with the contents found in the Indian films of yester years.",great art movie,it is seldom this modern era it generation that long movie surpassing three hours running time without show synthetic acting vulgarity cheap comedy captivates audience stick their seats well done gowarikar well done amir khan mr gowarikar please note that if this sublime film had been directed by british or american director like danny boyle or richard attenborough oscars would have definitely flown into laps director protagonist actor this is not say that your directorial skills lack excellence win coveted academy awards but it is mention inherent bias prejudice which prevails among jury oscar award committee towards directors producers actors sub continent namely india mother india 1957 met same fate then jury academy awards committee who simply rejected its nomination oscars grounds that it is laden with too much songs formulaic nature besides excellent performance amir khan as aggressive challenging native youth bhavan rachael shelley has put up remarkable evocatively strong performance as suave young british lady elizabeth russell who aspires help out hapless villagers cunning guile his brother captain russel now what can one say if members oscar awarding committee do not understand meanings wordings emotionally focused songs due language culture difference it is handicap with them not with local indian movie making team keeping aside this injustice movie characterizes pure pristine feelings emotions struggle fighting spirit raw unskilled cricket team illiterate indian villagers who capitalized opportunity get waived odious land revenue tax with exacting standards will power perseverance after long time there is indian movie bred with contents found indian films yester years,0.43340795007461674,0.16080925247591918,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"

,A cinematic masterpiece that will take your breath away...,"Sony Entertainment's Lagaan is more an experience than a movie.Indian actor Aamir Khan's home production is a cinematic experience which highlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner during the time of the British Empire's presence which deals with Lagaan (the tax of the land) and a village's upheaval against its oppressors.The film revolves mainly around three characters namely Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), Gauri (debutante Gracey Singh) and Elizabeth (British actress Rachel Shelley), and deals with Bhuvan's spirited fight to defend what is his birthright, as he embroils the entire village into a magnitude of problems which inadvertently ends up being their only escape from the tyranny under which they reside. Gauri is the simple village girl who loyally stands behind the man she loves yet cannot profess her love to, while Elizabeth is the beautiful sister of the British Lieutenant and the complication who aids the village in their fight against injustice.The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the villagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second presents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you away in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits.The opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as from the moment you are thrust into 1893's India, you gain footing and a sense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting for the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for the duration of the film. Apart from familiarising the viewer with its characters, the first half also takes you back with its breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and fitting background score. The characters are established, the situation presented and relationships etched, with each scene rhythmically flowing from one to the other in a continuos motion.The second half is less involved in justifying its characters and aims more towards culminating the scene which has been set in the first. By this time you are already a part of this world and your emotions have already been stirred, now they are put to the test as the events which will determine the entire crux of the film begin and get the viewer involved.The romantic triangle between Bhuvan, Gauri and Elizabeth is expertly handled. The beauty of its predicament is that no one feels a loss by the end of the film, and director Ashutosh Gowariker beautifully justifies eternal love (but not necessarily requitted love) through drawing a comparison with the spiritual romance of the Hindu god Krishna and Radha. A delightfully delicately handled scene and situation gives birth to the foundation which will resolve the triangle in a manner leaving warmth in the viewer's heart.Aamir Khan is a revelation. His acting is superb and be it the conviction and fire in his eyes, the way he draws breaths from the air of the abode he calls home or even gulps at the atrocities he witnesses, he has become Bhuvan completely. His portrayal is such that it puts you inside Bhuvan's psyche and enables the viewer to understand the character from his demeanour alone. His piercing eyes stare sharply like razor blades, cutting through the camera and leave a haunting impression on an unsuspecting audience, drawing them more and more deeper into his world.Gracey Singh performs ably and is also an extremely graceful dancer, as particularly evident in the Radha Kaise Na Jale song. She acts with her eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, all of her and gives to the role of Gauri completely, giving a debut performance of high calibre.Rachel Shelley makes her presence felt like an ethereal spirit. Apart from looking stunning she adds to whichever frame she is in with panache and style. Her crossover to Indian cinema, or indeed to this film, is delicately handled and a feat to be applauded. To light a face like Shelley's in the same frame as the villagers without making one or the other look considerably darker or awkwardly paler, is a difficult task in itself. But the cinematography, the lighting and make up is such that the characters come alive as physical presences which complement each other, as do Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley. Her interactions with Bhuvan and the villagers are intricately handled and executed wonderfully, and her inclusion in the O Rey Chori song is poetry on screen. To make a Western character dance in Indian cinema without causing a giggle from the audience or without it appearing unnatural is also something which needs to be handled with careful thought and the result is such that this song picturisation alone will invoke discussion on how beautifully it has been shot.Andrew Russell's boisterous character is brought to life by Paul Blackthorne, as he slides perfectly under the skin of a character that should reflect British pride and be menacing and hostile. He performs well and bounces off the supporting cast with utmost ease. The entire ensemble of supporting cast are deserved of mention, and particularly Raghuveer Yadav, who dynamically brings the character of Bhura across effectively and convincingly with edge.A R Rahman is the composer who has scored for many Indian and South Indian films, and this time too he does not betray his reputation of being a modern day Mozart. He literally teases then grabs you with his music, first resonating your veins, then breaths and finally allowing it to explode and burst through your body like an energy force, flowing in sync with your heartbeat. It's lilting melody, fresh sound and courageous allegros mesmerise and reflect the movie's emotions and spirit of hope. The songs are very well picturised and choreography is excellent, particularly Ghanan Ghanan, O Mitwa and O Rey Chori. The bhajan O Paalanhaare is bewitchingly lit and shot, injecting a spiritual vibe as candles' flickering flames hypnotise every viewer whose eyes dance to its command.The film belongs to Aamir and Ashutosh Gowariker all the way. Direction is superb and results in what is a true mark on Indian cinema, held together by Aamir's awe-inspiring performance.Lagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit and about Indians. You enter the cinema to be entertained, and leave with a piece of cinematic history being firmly etched in your heart.Fuad Omar.",cinematic masterpiece that will take your breath away,sony

8.0,the theatre cheered,"This is actually the first ever film I have seen where the audience clapped cheered and booed effectively as if they were a part of the actual proceedings in the film. I heard someone say that they felt that they were really at a cricket match. I loved the movie even though admittedly at the time (surprising for an Indian) I didn't know cricket at all...I learned while watching it with the help of a friend but also found I didn't need to! It certainly renewed my interest and made mea cricket fan soon enough, the next match that year I watched with grave interest.About the fikm, the acting was good. Rachel Shelly and Paul Blackthorne were impressive and unlike in other Hindi films where they are usually clichéd versions of foreign characters, they were very drawn out believable characters. Aamir Khan was definitely the star attraction (obviously) as in any case it was 'his movie' but honestly he was very good, one of hsi best performances i'd personally say. Gauri was given very little to do in the movie but she did stand out in her own way. The supporting cast were all excellent in each of their roles, although some characters were a bit too starkly depicted. The British cast on the other hand had precious little to do except look foreboding.The setting in the Gujrati village and country was beautiful. The sets were historically accurate I've been told and the backdrop just right for the match and one would it imagine it fit into the time frame suggested. The costumes were also appropriate. I especially liked that scene where Elisabeth imagines Aamir in a suit, it worked because being who she is of course shed see him like that.)Some historians might nitpick on small points, but they were so minor that the rest of the story overshadowed these errors. At first I wondered whether foreign viewers would understand it what the unusual concept of musical numbers, but most seem to have understood the game of cricket (non cricket playing countries I mean) and the historical context as well and seem to have also taken the musical numbers in their stride.The only thing that got to me was the length of the movie. I really wish that they had done some serious editing, it just ran too long and the cricket match was too dragged out. It should have either focused more on the cricket match for the majority of the film, or reduced the footage of the rest of the film to balance it out. I saw many scenes that could have been edited out and were totally unnecessary.The songs were enjoyable and only one or two were unnecessary and could have been cut down or deleted entirely, like the 'Radha Kaise Na Jale' and the song where both girls sing. Honestly this movie was one Hindi movie that did not require many songs at all if at all. A background score maybe but not 6 songs. It got tedious and it gets on the nerves especially when you've been sitting in the theatre for 2 hours and you know that there is 1 more hour to go. Luckily people with DVDs will be able to fast forward!Although Predictable in places with characters being over-drawn or under-drawn and everyone knew the ending that was inevitable, ending, (it isn't much of a long shot at all) but we watched it for the thrill of it anyway.The overall effect the movie was so good that I fully believe that it deserved a nomination and I never say that about most Hindi movies. Even though it did not win I'm very proud of this movie.",theatre cheered,this is actually first ever film i have seen where audience clapped cheered booed effectively as if they were part actual proceedings film i heard someone say that they felt that they were really at cricket match i loved movie even though admittedly at time surprising indian i didnt know cricket at all i learned while watching it with help friend but also found i didnt need it certainly renewed my interest made mea cricket fan soon enough next match that year i watched with grave interest about fikm acting was good rachel shelly paul blackthorne were impressive unlike other hindi films where they are usually clich d versions foreign characters they were very drawn out believable characters aamir khan was definitely star attraction obviously as any case it was his movie but honestly he was very good one hsi best performances id personally say gauri was given very little do movie but she did stand out her own way supporting cast were all excellent each their roles although some characters were bit too starkly depicted british cast other hand had precious little do except look foreboding setting gujrati village country was beautiful sets were historically accurate ive been told backdrop just right match one would it imagine it fit into time frame suggested costumes were also appropriate i especially liked that scene where elisabeth imagines aamir suit it worked because being who she is course shed see him like that some historians might nitpick small points but they were so minor that rest story overshadowed these errors at first i wondered whether foreign viewers would understand it what unusual concept musical numbers but most seem have understood game cricket non cricket playing countries i mean historical context as well seem have also taken musical numbers their stride only thing that got me was length movie i really wish that they had done some serious editing it just ran too long cricket match was too dragged out it should have either focused more cricket match majority film or reduced footage rest film balance it out i saw many scenes that could have been edited out were totally unnecessary songs were enjoyable only one or two were unnecessary could have been cut down or deleted entirely like radha kaise na jale song where both girls sing honestly this movie was one hindi movie that did not require many songs at all if at all background score maybe but not 6 songs it got tedious it gets nerves especially when youve been sitting theatre 2 hours you know that there is 1 more hour go luckily people with dvds will be able fast forward although predictable places with characters being over drawn or under drawn everyone knew ending that was inevitable ending it isnt much long shot at all but we watched it thrill it anyway overall effect movie was so good that i fully believe that it deserved nomination i never say that about most hindi movies even though it did not win im very proud this movie,0.5358900226757368,0.20728174603174598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"

As far as can be expected. It's handsomely made, has some good (if standard) storytelling turns, and oh, the dance sequences are lovely and a lot fun to watch, especially scored to Rahman.A particularly not very strong point: the love ""triangle"" which doesn't make much sense when one of them, the white lady Elizabeth, can't speak the other's language, and so can't Bhuvan. But, that's what is simply done in these movies do you roll with it, or try to. Luckily, this gets pretty much jettisoned once the cricket matches come up, and it's then all about the sports movie hystrionics - which I also enjoyed (often against my better judgment), in large part because, well, it looks like they'll lose the game (BUT WILL THEY!??!)And damn does Aamir Khan (the, uh. Jack Nicholson of India? By that I mean great at comedy, drama, charming, fine at singing, and uh, ok not sure how Jack dances and all) have to act his ass off to make this work as our hero - certainly when our antagonist, played by Paul Blackthorne, seems to be cast because the producers said, ""we want Billy Zane...

10.0,A Nutshell Review: Lagaan,"Having won multiple awards and gotten itself nominated in the 2002 Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, my interest in Lagaan was actually in wanting to discover more of writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker's works, having seen his latest movie Jodha Akbar, and having bought Swades: We, the People starring Shah Rukh Khan, still unwatched.I've never been a fan of cricket and have never understood the rules, but I suppose after the time you're through with Lagaan, you'll learn at least the basics enough to enjoy the game. No doubt my interest in this sport has been piqued, and non-fans shouldn't steer away from the movie, because knowledge of the sport is not a pre-requisite for you to enjoy this wonderful gem of a sports movie running close to a whopping 3.5 hours (and I heard in the collector's edition, it runs to 4?)Set in British India, we learn that Lagaan is a form of taxation that the villagers have to pay to their Rajas, who in turn pay the British for protection against, erm, invading forces and rivals from other Rajas. In fact, the British were double crossing everyone during their occupation of the country, and bad weather makes the lives of the villagers even more hard pressed since they have zero crops to sell. Every village needs a folk hero, and herein lies Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) who decides to step into the shoes of one, not because of bravado, but because of the atrocities dished out by the British against his fellow countrymen, especially when taxes for the year have been doubled.So the stakes are raised in a game of cricket. Defeat the British, led by Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) and have a tax waver of 3 years for the entire province, or if they lose, then their Lagaan will be tripled. And you don't need a rocket scientist to tell you that when the impoverished have their backs against the corner, they have little choice but to fight back. However, after years of being oppressed and cowering in the face of hardship, you'll need that bright spark or two to shake things up and bring everyone to their senses that Hope is something they have which they can turn into reality if they work at it.The storyline might seem cliché as per the usual sports movies, where our hero Bhuvan has to assemble a team of good men each with their own special farming background which can be incorporated into the game, and recruitment always is a challenge when nobody believes you, and thinks you're the troublemaker who started it all. There are leaders, and there are followers, and some good time is invested to develop this challenge, as well as to explore the plight of the villagers in more detail. The villains of the movie, those pompous Brits personified by Captain Russell with his nose perpetually in the air all the time, are put in very bad light with their looking down of the natives as slaves.But even amongst themselves, the Indians too have their infamous caste system, and this was touched upon when Bhuvan chooses to adopt the more meritocratic route in player selection, and this message undoubtedly stands out. I can't comment much on these themes that Gowariker touch upon in his films, such as that of religious tolerance in Jodha Akbar, but it seems likely that he had incorporated these knowing that his films do appeal to the masses, and therefore serve as a reminder to everyone.While the last 1.5 hours get devoted to the game, where two proud man go head to head against each other with their team, and team members having their own personal vendettas worked out during the matches, it never for a minute played out in a boring manner. In fact, it was entertaining to watch them go through the paces of the game in 101 terms, and from there, those unfamiliar with cricket will likely be able to pick up the basics. Even if the sport is not your cup of tea, its delivery will still appeal to you, as do the usual Bollywood staple of dance and song, as composed by renowned A.R. Rahman - I particularly liked the segment where any self-respective sports movie will have - the training montage, and with a love triangle of sorts fused between Bhuvan, his childhood sweetheart Gauri (Gracy Singh) and Englishwoman Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), sister of the villagers' enemy but one who decides to teach them the game so that they can get on equal terms with her countrymen.Despite its clichés, Lagaan is wonderful entertainment, and you will not realize the movie's running length, as you'll be engrossed in what transpires, and will find yourself rooting for the clear underdogs as they go about trying to battle oppression in unfamiliar terms.

9.0,The best cricket movie ever made,"The best cricket movie ever made.Set in India in the late-1800s, the local British rulers are imposing excessively high taxes on the local population. One of the local villagers has a run-in with the senior British officer, resulting in a cricket match between the British and the villagers. If the villagers win, they don't have to pay taxes for three years. If they lose, they have to pay three times their usual taxes.Interesting, engaging movie with some of the most realistic cricket scenes you'll see in a movie. The April 2004 edition of The Wisden Cricketer, probably the foremost cricket magazine in the world, had their list of the top 10 cricket moments in movies, and Lagaan come in at number 1. I wholeheartedly agree with their assessment. Cricket in movies is normally very badly done, looking as if the director had no clue about the sport. Even Bodyline, the movie about the infamous 1932 Bodyline series, had some laughable moments (eg the England wicket-keeper, Les Ames, standing up to the wicket for the express pace of Harold Larwood!). Considering that it was a movie exclusively about an historic cricket series, thus is even more cricket-centric than Lagaan, which is as much a human drama as a cricket movie, Bodyline's cricket scenes were very badly done. (Bodyline's script was just as bad, very biased and propaganda-like: going out of it's way to be anti-English). I expected similar inaccuracies in Lagaan and was pleasantly surprised. While there are some minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this is truly the most accurate and best cricket movie ever made. It is also good as a drama, not just a cricket movie, so recommended for those less-into-cricket too. (Aside: Bodyline came in at Number 3 on Wisden's list).",best cricket movie ever made,best cricket movie ever made set india late 1800s local british rulers are imposing excessively high taxes local population one local villagers has run with senior british officer resulting cricket match between british villagers if villagers win they dont have pay taxes three years if they lose they have pay three times their usual taxes interesting engaging movie with some most realistic cricket scenes youll see movie april 2004 edition wisden cricketer probably foremost cricket magazine world had their list top 10 cricket moments movies lagaan come at number 1 i wholeheartedly agree with their assessment cricket movies is normally very badly done looking as if director had no clue about sport even bodyline movie about infamous 1932 bodyline series had some laughable moments eg england wicket keeper les ames standing up wicket express pace harold larwood considering that it was movie exclusively about historic cricket series thus is even more cricket centric than lagaan which is as much human drama as cricket movie bodylines cricket scenes were very badly done bodylines script was just as bad very biased propaganda like going out its way be anti english i expected similar inaccuracies lagaan was pleasantly surprised while there are some minor inaccuracies inconsistencies this is truly most accurate best cricket movie ever made it is also good as drama not just cricket movie so recommended those less into cricket too aside bodyline came at number 3 wisdens list,0.3698290598290598,0.09846153846153848,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Once Upon a Time in India...,"That's funny. I always thought the reason of ""Lagaan"" continuous presence on IMDb Top 250 was due to its being ""a little more than"" your typical Bollywood movie, as if the opposite was a disqualifying parameter. I confess, from my slightly prejudiced perspective, I thought ""Lagaan"" was an empowering sports movie about the triumph of human spirit etc. but again, not the ""typical"" Hindi movie. But that would have been overlooking the subtitle: which goes straight to the point: Once Upon a Time in India. I guess if you set a story in India, you better tell it the ""Indian way"".So, the fact is: ""Lagaan"" IS your ""typical"" Bollywood movie, but that's not saying much as the director Ashutosh Gowariker finds that little extra push to elevate the film above the expectations of a national audience, thus delivering a story of universal appeal: something about the fight for dignity and justice, an underdog story with the same resonance as ""Rocky"", and told in an old-fashioned way with a despicable villain and a colorful gallery of challengers that goes from a handsome hero, a brute with a golden heart, a sneaky traitor, a comic relief etc. The film use many familiar elements from both Bolly and Hollywood's canon but the result is so enthralling, so exhilarating that it gets away with it.And take it from someone who's never been a fan of that Bollywood trope requiring that characters can break into singing and dancing in such a so well-choreographed act you wouldn't believe it's one of these spur-of-the-moment things. But the power of ""Lagaan"" is to know exactly what the audience longs, an emotional roller-coaster that includes singing and all dancing. There's such boldness in making a movie almost four hour longs by adding nothing that clearly advances the plot that even someone who's not familiar with Bollywood will understand that music isn't just an ornament, but as vital to the enjoyment as the rest. The film was long and riveting enough, but ""Lagaan"" primarily addresses its own audience and with such gusto that it widened its appeal to foreign audiences.But the story had a part to play in that success. Its premise alone is captivating: at the peak of the British Empire in India, an arrogant and racist Captain named Andrew Russel, commanding the province of Champenar, doubled the Lagaan tax to the villagers, who are already taxed to the bone. But with this new measure, they risk starvation and misery. Phillips (well-played by Paul Blackthorne) is no man to care for such considerations. And when the young and rebel villager named Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) goes with a few villagers to ask the local Rajah to intercede, the man with one foot in each world admits he's powerless. Russell spices up the situation, he challenges the villagers to beat them in cricket, a game Bhuvan called stupid, if they win, they won't pay Lagaan for three years, if they lose, they'll have to play triple Lagaan.When Bhuvan accepts, he faces a major uproar from the other villages of the provinces and before winning the game, there's a long process of winning the villagers' spirit and the process is crucial to reveal more about the characters and the setting. Meanwhile, Philips confronts his superiors and understands he'd rather win the game or he might pay the Lagaan from his own pocket. The dice are cast and we follow the training of villagers who never understood cricket, let alone played it. But it's not much in the game than the anticipation, to see these peasant trying to defy the British establishment, it's both funny like ""The Full Monty"" but many highly dramatic moments remind us that lives are at stakes and it's not just a game. The odds are worse but they've got to beat them.They are trying to win with what they have at hands and turning their flaws into tricks is the kind of inspirational material you expect from sport movie. One of the villagers is swift with slingshots, which earned him an ability to launch a ball so fast you literally don't see it coming, another one with a defect in his hand is able to make the ball spin, his status as a pariah allows a film to make a few comments about the caste system, to make sure there is an equivalent to British' ruthlessness. And to make up for the vileness of Captain his sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), finding her brother's method cruel and unfair help the villagers, much to the displeasure of Gaury (Gracy Singh) in love with Aamir. There are many subplots in the movie and they swiftly overlap just like the many rules of that cricket game that you don't need to understand in order to enjoy the film.Each sub-story is bound to a specific emotion, there's romance, there's drama, comedy and tragedy, and at the climactic game, all these element come full circle together. And no matter how hard you expect the game to be, how many sports movie you've seen, no matter how firmly you anticipate that it will all comes down to one final blow, the film will still manage to surprise you. And that's the power of Lagaan that Ebert summed up very well, you enjoy it, you realize it's new and fresh although it's a very familiar material. You really enjoyed it. It is Bollywood but its appeals transcend the story.It has escapism, fun, colors, it's the kind of film, you can't say they don't make them anymore well except maybe in Bollywood, the quintessential place for popular cinema. And it is an empowering sports drama about the triumph of human spirit.",once upon time india,thats funny i always thought reason lagaan continuous presence imdb top 250 was due its being little more than your typical bollywood movie as if opposite was disqualifying parameter i confess my slightly prejudiced perspective i thought lagaan was empowering sports movie about triumph human spirit etc but again not typical hindi movie but that would have been overlooking subtitle which goes straight point once upon time india i guess if you set story india you better tell it indian way so fact is lagaan is your typical bollywood movie but thats not saying much as director ashutosh gowariker finds that little extra push elevate film above expectations national audience thus delivering story universal appeal something about fight dignity justice underdog story with same resonance as rocky told old fashioned way with despicable villain colorful gallery challengers that goes handsome hero brute with golden heart sneaky traitor comic relief etc film use many familiar elements both bolly hollywoods canon but result is so enthralling so exhilarating that it gets away with it take it someone whos never been fan that bollywood trope requiring that characters can break into singing dancing such so well choreographed act you wouldnt believe its one these spur moment things but power lagaan is know exactly what audience longs emotional roller coaster that includes singing all dancing theres such boldness making movie almost four hour longs by adding nothing that clearly advances plot that even someone whos not familiar with bollywood will understand that music isnt just ornament but as vital enjoyment as rest film was long riveting enough but lagaan primarily addresses its own audience with such gusto that it widened its appeal foreign audiences but story had part play that success its premise alone is captivating at peak british empire india arrogant racist captain named andrew russel commanding province champenar doubled lagaan tax villagers who are already taxed bone but with this new measure they risk starvation misery phillips well played by paul blackthorne is no man care such considerations when young rebel villager named bhuvan aamir khan goes with few villagers ask local rajah intercede man with one foot each world admits hes powerless russell spices up situation he challenges villagers beat them cricket game bhuvan called stupid if they win they wont pay lagaan three years if they lose theyll have play triple lagaan when bhuvan accepts he faces major uproar other villages provinces before winning game theres long process winning villagers spirit process is crucial reveal more about characters setting meanwhile philips confronts his superiors understands hed rather win game or he might pay lagaan his own pocket dice are cast we follow training villagers who never understood cricket let alone played it but its not much game than anticipation see these peasant trying defy british establishment its both funny like full monty but many highly dramatic moments remind us that lives are at stakes its not just game odds are worse but theyve got beat them they are trying win with what they have at hands turning their flaws into tricks is kind inspirational material you expect sport movie one villagers is swift with slingshots which earned him ability launch ball so fast you literally dont see it coming another one with defect his hand is able make ball spin his status as pariah allows film make few comments about caste system make sure there is equivalent british ruthlessness make up vileness captain his sister elizabeth rachel shelley finding her brothers method cruel unfair help villagers much displeasure gaury gracy singh love with aamir there are many subplots movie they swiftly overlap just like many rules that cricket game that you dont need understand order enjoy film each sub story is bound specific emotion theres romance theres drama comedy tragedy at climactic game all these element come full circle together no matter how hard you expect game be how many sports movie youve seen no matter how firmly you anticipate that it will all comes down one final blow film will still manage surprise you thats power lagaan that ebert summed up very well you enjoy it you realize its new fresh although its very familiar material you really enjoyed it it is bollywood but its appeals transcend story it has escapism fun colors its kind film you cant say they dont make them anymore well except maybe bollywood quintessential place popular cinema it is empowering sports drama about triumph human spirit,0.49138818087416203,0.12956079486453317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,the play goes on,"I saw this in a Paris cinema on a Sunday afternoon. The French audience loved it, as did I. They clapped at the intermission and they clapped to the music while the credits were running. I thought the song and dance routines were great, providing the perfect bridge to a semi-mythologised narrative. The audience sometimes laughed at the exaggeration and coincidence of the plot, especially at the end -- the rain, the Englishwoman who never married. Astonishingly they even got the joke about 'this country will be the future of this game'. It seems that lack of knowledge of cricket and subtitles with words like 'runs', 'overs' and 'no ball' were not a handicap. Of course the pillorying of the British didn't go down badly here. I especially liked the representation of the Raj, not as a moderrnising influence, but as straight agrarian civilisation, extraction of the food from peasants' mouths.I was on the edge of tears throughout. Why? Because this was the first Indian production that to my knowledge has won a world audience. And it provided a new sentimental bridge to the world for my own trajectory. I could see how Bollywood is the only film-making centre that actually could do what Hollywood does, but in its own distinctive way, with a much more universal human interest. And the music of course. The plot and characters were caricatured, but that made it all that more accessible and touching, like a medieval passion play. I loved the symbolic roles contrived for the Muslim, the Untouchable, the Sikh, the collaborator, the headman, the intellectual etc.Above all, the plot of learning the game and beating the masters was perfect. It was CLR James to the tee. Beyond a Boundary indeed , with society in the shape of the crowd as much of the action as the players. And the idea of the bet! Play comes from an Old English word whose first meaning is to wager. The idea of life as a game of negotiated risks is very widespread among hunter-gatherers, where people have to be trained to respond instantly to the flash of white tail in the bush. Obviously it sometimes pays for peasants (and citydwellers) to pick up these skills.

Here, as told in the excellent movie Brother, we left this propaganda and are closer to the truth : West is an arrogant invader that spoils and squeezes resources from the natives ! This is maybe the first time i hear this argument in a movie and it's good ! 3) In our materialistic, consumerist and loose-valued society, we take anyone different from us as retarded, dumb and degenerate. Here, i see women veiled and working for the household and i can't say they are exploited as told by today propaganda. Those people wear traditional clothes but they can express their feelings and they have more interesting things to say that i'm a beauty, see my perfect body, etc 4) For sure, we are frightened by the fact that we know nobody's name on the cover, as much we are instructed to except big names for a big movie ! However, all those fresh faces are cool, talented and crush the Hollywood and french myth ! Newcomers can do as good and even better than films legends ! 5) The movie has a clear story, with well done cliffhangers involving well-defined and balanced characters and the production knows how to tell it : so it's not about like video music and cutting frame each seconds, grading colors to a what-if world and confusing special effects with a story ! At last, as it's a sport movie, we find as in Rocky all the values that sports can teach (solidarity, efforts) and i must praise all the production because the 3 days match was not all repetitive or unintelligible but this final showdown was a test in human nature !So if you are tired of seeing the same faces, desperate of propaganda and endless violence, try this movie and you will discover that yes, there's a different way to do movies  and different cultures in the world !",refreshing lesson cinema dad,first all i want thank my parents having this dvd their collection i dont know how they got it but with their help i could find awesome movie that as usual becomes totally transparent our western french medias sure as we are brainwashed expect big productions or big names we never pay attention oriental movies its big error as this one took me back candid joy as kid discovering films 1st time short this movie has all simple things that makes you feel happy 1 you leave your daily life you are taken into new one here we are india late xix its good as this land folklore are nearly forgotten by filmmakers except indy 2 octopussy i dont have watched other movies happening there 2 at last we have another point view actually when i see western movie happening orient its about war which natives are depicted as enemies west good savior here as told excellent movie brother we left this propaganda are closer truth west is arrogant invader that spoils squeezes resources natives this is maybe first time i hear this argument movie its good 3 our materialistic consumerist loose valued society we take anyone different us as retarded dumb degenerate here i see women veiled working household i cant say they are exploited as told by today propaganda those people wear traditional clothes but they can express their feelings they have more interesting things say that im beauty see my perfect body etc 4 sure we are frightened by fact that we know nobodys name cover as much we are instructed except big names big movie however all those fresh faces are cool talented crush hollywood french myth newcomers can do as good even better than films legends 5 movie has clear story with well done cliffhangers involving well defined balanced characters production knows how tell it so its not about like video music cutting frame each seconds grading colors what if world confusing special effects with story at last as its sport movie we find as rocky all values that sports can teach solidarity efforts i must praise all production because 3 days match was not all repetitive or unintelligible but this final showdown was test human nature so if you are tired seeing same faces desperate propaganda endless violence try this movie you will discover that yes theres different way do movies different cultures world,0.44565846611301163,0.1400239911603548,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.26}"

Excellent pacing, appealing acting, good music and about perfect movie entertainment. I've seen quite a number of Bollywood musical productions as the local Indian fast food restaurants tend to play non-stop DVDs that splice only the music and dance numbers together. It's been very hard to get a good recommendation of an entire film to see. The few that I've been able to watch were tough going, mainly due to the length and corny plot lines. The musical numbers were usually entertaining. I had to stop this film (on DVD) and resume watching it at a later time. I found myself watching from the beginning again and not getting bored! Director Ashutosh Gowariker has developed an excellent technique that I think the subtitle of the film gives a clue where his inspiration comes from. There are many scenes that remained me of the way Sergio Leone built scenes, introduced new characters and involved the viewer in the story. Really impressive.There is one problem, if this is your first Indian musical/drama, there's not much in league with this film. To extend the Leone connection, it's like watching ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and then trying to find another Spaghetti western that comes even close.Excellent.",once upon nearly perfect movie,i have never been able find bollywood film that was so easy sit thru entire film without getting impatient excellent pacing appealing acting good music about perfect movie entertainment ive seen quite number bollywood musical productions as local indian fast food restaurants tend play non stop dvds that splice only music dance numbers together its been very hard get good recommendation entire film see few that ive been able watch were tough going mainly due length corny plot lines musical numbers were usually entertaining i had stop this film dvd resume watching it at later time i found myself watching beginning again not getting bored director ashutosh gowariker has developed excellent technique that i think subtitle film gives clue where his inspiration comes there are many scenes that remained me way sergio leone built scenes introduced new characters involved viewer story really impressive there is one problem if this is your first indian musical drama theres not much league with this film extend leone connection its like watching good bad ugly then trying find another spaghetti western that comes even close excellent,0.5605362838915471,0.22175372142477406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
