1.0,Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost.,"While films like Parmanu, Padmavati, Padman, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety , 102 Not Out, Hichki or even Blackmail were treat to eyes in the first half of 2018 giving hope that Bollywood movies have matured but then there comes a crap like Race 3 that will spoil your mood and you will wonder that if the makers are taking the audience for granted. Race 3 tells the story of a dispute between a family when Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor) decides to give half of his wealth to the adopted son, Sikander Singh (Salman Khan) and the rest of it between his own kids, Suraj (Saqeeb Saleem) and Sanjana (Daisy Shah). Directed by Remo D'Souza, who has made a decent film ABCD and pathetic ones like A Flying Jatt and ABCD 2, Race 3 is one hell of a journey which you wish to forget once you leave the theater. Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it. None of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating. Coming to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better. Overall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost.",race 3 is insult bollywood avoid it any cost,while films like parmanu padmavati padman sonu ke titu ki sweety 102 not out hichki or even blackmail were treat eyes first half 2018 giving hope that bollywood movies have matured but then there comes crap like race 3 that will spoil your mood you will wonder that if makers are taking audience granted race 3 tells story dispute between family when shamsher singh anil kapoor decides give half his wealth adopted son sikander singh salman khan rest it between his own kids suraj saqeeb saleem sanjana daisy shah directed by remo dsouza who has made decent film abcd pathetic ones like flying jatt abcd 2 race 3 is one hell journey which you wish forget once you leave theater right opening scene film climax forget about logic even story is full potholes there is some breath air when anil kapoor tells about his plan but again film goes back loop hole sadly does not recover first film race 2008 was brilliant with solid twist turns followed by average race 2 2016 race 3 is nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you more you think about it none songs are good surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo salim sulaiman action scenes though few scenes were fine but again gone overboard race 3 is high production values less content dialogues are horrible funny especially our business is our business none your business even bhojpuri language used between scenes is irritating coming performances none actors have done justice their role i do not understand why salman khan is repeating himself even though he is bollywood industry more than 25 years actor who was superb films like dabanng sultan should start experimenting with roles anil kapoor is fine but could have been better bobby deol makes decent comeback but sadly not enough leave any impact lesser spoken about saqeeb salim daisy shah jacqueline fernandez better overall race 3 is insult bollywood avoid it any cost,0.5414661654135338,0.12664160401002508,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"

1.0,"This is not a sequel but a combined remake of Race 1, 2 and Hum saath saath hai","We all know that, in late 90s, Salman worked mainly in family films and in late 00s, he did action. And now, when 10s decade is At it's last phase, I feel, Salman Decided to work in a movie which would be an action family movie, so THE LENGENDARY Race 3. Movie takes the elements of both Races (1 & 2) and HSSH and shows it in the most pathetic and cringeworthy possible.Elements:Race: Step-siblings, faking death etcRace 2: Heist, shades of antagonistHSSH: Joint family, problems between the siblingsYou can say while carving the movie Race, the remaining wastage which was assembled together to make race 2 and the wastage of race 2 was assembled and wastage of HSSH was added to make race 3.PATHETIC, BORING, MINDLESS, PREDICTABLE AND CRINGWORTHY. These are just few words to honour the movie. Movie had some very pathetic performances, pathetic dialogues, pathetic songs with pathetic lyrics (Heeriye is a good number though) & pathetic storyline. The movie was too slow to be called entertaining, I didn't understand half of the story, no not because it had a very complex and out of the world story, just like that of Nolan's movies, but because I had a good sleep during the movie. Plus songs were so frequent and long that you can't help but sleep, so if you have trouble in sleeping or are insomniac. Please go for Race 3. It was an all and all Salman Khan movie, so I don't need to say how mindless it would be (But movies like tere naam, Saajan and Bajrangi Bhaijaan were way awesome). Twists were too damn predictable, Race series is known for amazing thrills and out of the world twists, but this one had none, yeah the last twist was good, but not amazing as that was also kind of predictable. The dialogues, the songs, the lyrics, the acting, the action scenes... everything about this movie was criminally cringeworthy. The best thing about the movie was Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor. Saif Ali Khan is missed badly and so is Abbas-Mastan. I request Ramesh Taurani, that if he is in a mood to make Race 4, please continue the Race 2 story and bring back Saif. Let Bobby be there, we have no problem.I've only one suggestion for you guys. There is a plethora of good movies, Avengers Infinity wars is still running in the theatres. Jurassic World is running. And if nothing, than please save your cash for Sanju, rather than watching this masterpiece of mud. In my honest opinion, movies like Ek tha tiger, PRDP, Khiladi 786 and even loha and Gunda are like citizen Kane, Titanic, Godfather and the Shawshank redemption in front of this movieCompletely avoidable",this is not sequel but combined remake race 1 2 hum saath saath hai,we all know that late 90s salman worked mainly family films late 00s he did action now when 10s decade is at its last phase i feel salman decided work movie which would be action family movie so lengendary race 3 movie takes elements both races 1 2 hssh shows it most pathetic cringeworthy possible elements race step siblings faking death etcrace 2 heist shades antagonisthssh joint family problems between siblingsyou can say while carving movie race remaining wastage which was assembled together make race 2 wastage race 2 was assembled wastage hssh was added make race 3 pathetic boring mindless predictable cringworthy these are just few words honour movie movie had some very pathetic performances pathetic dialogues pathetic songs with pathetic lyrics heeriye is good number though pathetic storyline movie was too slow be called entertaining i didnt understand half story no not because it had very complex out world story just like that nolans movies but because i had good sleep during movie plus songs were so frequent long that you cant help but sleep so if you have trouble sleeping or are insomniac please go race 3 it was all all salman khan movie so i dont need say how mindless it would be but movies like tere naam saajan bajrangi bhaijaan were way awesome twists were too damn predictable race series is known amazing thrills out world twists but this one had none yeah last twist was good but not amazing as that was also kind predictable dialogues songs lyrics acting action scenes everything about this movie was criminally cringeworthy best thing about movie was bobby deol anil kapoor saif ali khan is missed badly so is abbas mastan i request ramesh taurani that if he is mood make race 4 please continue race 2 story bring back saif let bobby be there we have no problem ive only one suggestion you guys there is plethora good movies avengers infinity wars is still running theatres jurassic world is running if nothing than please save your cash sanju rather than watching this masterpiece mud my honest opinion movies like ek tha tiger prdp khiladi 786 even loha gunda are like citizen kane titanic godfather shawshank redemption front this moviecompletely avoidable,0.5884782608695651,-0.09000000000000004,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.37}"

1.0,"Slow, Lame, Boring, Not even a Typical Salman Khan Movie.","First things first... I liked Sultan, Dabangg, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, even TZH and Kick were entertaining. Salman Khan is known for his stardom, fanbase, court cases except acting. Even his flops Jai Ho and Tubelight have crossed 1.1 billion mark at the box office. Race 3 is a movie which has been trolled the most than any other film of Salman or any other actor. Remo D'Souza was a very bad choice for big budget, multi starrer, action franchise. He is better off with dance related movies, A Flying Jatt was perfect lesson for him. Salman's involvement in Race Franchise, Questionable. Without giving any spoilers, and keeping the fact in mind that Race 3 is big budget movie sold to Distributors at very high price is really half baked, slow, illogical, bumpy and jerky roller coaster ride with hight production values. Good Cinematography, but Ayananka Bose had done better work before. Poor VFX, Prime Focus is good VFX company (see Bang Bang). Budget provided for VFX seems marginal. Performance are average. Music is letdown. Dialogues are wasted. Runtime is 159min too long. Too many songs. Even Abbas Mustan couldn't have pulled off this task (read weak script). They should have kept Saif Ali Khan (loyal to Race Franchise).",slow lame boring not even typical salman khan movie,first things first i liked sultan dabangg bajrangi bhaijaan even tzh kick were entertaining salman khan is known his stardom fanbase court cases except acting even his flops jai ho tubelight have crossed 1 1 billion mark at box office race 3 is movie which has been trolled most than any other film salman or any other actor remo dsouza was very bad choice big budget multi starrer action franchise he is better off with dance related movies flying jatt was perfect lesson him salmans involvement race franchise questionable without giving any spoilers keeping fact mind that race 3 is big budget movie sold distributors at very high price is really half baked slow illogical bumpy jerky roller coaster ride with hight production values good cinematography but ayananka bose had done better work before poor vfx prime focus is good vfx company see bang bang budget provided vfx seems marginal performance are average music is letdown dialogues are wasted runtime is 159min too long too many songs even abbas mustan couldnt have pulled off this task read weak script they should have kept saif ali khan loyal race franchise,0.49879797979797974,0.041606060606060605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
