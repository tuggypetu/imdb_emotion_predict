2.0,The first tomato can be thrown at the screen two minutes after the opening credits,"I wasn't angry about The Fog remake until I heard that it was going to be released by Revolution Studios, a company known to house crap movies. From then on, my hopes weren't that high, and they sank even lower when I saw the trailer. It looked to much like Boogeyman or Darkenss Falls rather than an atmospheric, imaginative, horror production like the original. The original Fog deserves to be a cult classic and is a great film, but I thought it could have used a couple of improvements. It was not John Carpenter's best effort, but it still was an 8 out of 10 movie. This remake had potential because it could have corrected some of the plot holes from the original. Not surprisingly, the modernized Fog created new loopholes in the story and in addition had a terrible script.The characters here were clichéd. The naive young girl who sees ""horrible things"" happening and who is befriended by her ""hot ex-boyfriend"". There is even a token black guy who serves as the ""comic relief"" for the film. Why can't they have black heroes in horror movies? Every character is seen in some state of undress, including Stevie Wayne, a mother of a young teenage boy named Andy, who struts around in panties in front of her son (I thought that was funny). I'm surprised Andy's old nanny wasn't shown strutting around in her undies while cleaning the dishes.The leper colony ghosts were not scary. They were all see through, and instead of a giant fishing hook, Father Blake carried a cane (WTF??), not for support while walking, but for a scene near the end of the film where flying glass shards contribute to the death of a character. Also, the fog in this film is all CGI, and is not nearly as menacing as the one in the original was.Father Malone's character in the original was a major contributor to the story, because he represented the sins of the founding fathers. In this one, he's just a stupid old drunk who has a minimal impact on the story and plays more like the typical ""old lady who can see the future"" kind of character. Also, why aim for a PG-13? It's obvious the filmmakers wanted to put some gore in this, and they did, because there were many deaths that involved people being maimed and/or set on fire, not necessarily in that order. Only a few more drops of blood and it would be R. There are two good things though. There is one pretty shocking death scene that was cool and there were some cool cinematography shots. The eerie image of the sailors on their ship in the fog gave me the chills. There was also a really creepy ghost who was only shown in shadows (you never saw his face) and who wore a top hat. It would have been interesting if they showed that ghost more, but alas, they shied away from it. And don't get me started on the ending. It's supposed to be a shocker, but it's extremely predictable. It also makes everything that preceded it make little sense. What was the point of that? Stevie Wayne's cheesy closing monologue was even cheesier than the concluding monologue in House of the Dead.Overall, this dreadful remake ran shy of where it could have won the race.",first tomato can be thrown at screen two minutes after opening credits,i wasnt angry about fog remake until i heard that it was going be released by revolution studios company known house crap movies then my hopes werent that high they sank even lower when i saw trailer it looked much like boogeyman or darkenss falls rather than atmospheric imaginative horror production like original original fog deserves be cult classic is great film but i thought it could have used couple improvements it was not john carpenters best effort but it still was 8 out 10 movie this remake had potential because it could have corrected some plot holes original not surprisingly modernized fog created new loopholes story addition had terrible script characters here were clich d naive young girl who sees horrible things happening who is befriended by her hot ex boyfriend there is even token black guy who serves as comic relief film why cant they have black heroes horror movies every character is seen some state undress including stevie wayne mother young teenage boy named andy who struts around panties front her son i thought that was funny im surprised andys old nanny wasnt shown strutting around her undies while cleaning dishes leper colony ghosts were not scary they were all see through instead giant fishing hook father blake carried cane wtf not support while walking but scene near end film where flying glass shards contribute death character also fog this film is all cgi is not nearly as menacing as one original was father malones character original was major contributor story because he represented sins founding fathers this one hes just stupid old drunk who has minimal impact story plays more like typical old lady who can see future kind character also why aim pg 13 its obvious filmmakers wanted put some gore this they did because there were many deaths that involved people being maimed or set fire not necessarily that order only few more drops blood it would be r there are two good things though there is one pretty shocking death scene that was cool there were some cool cinematography shots eerie image sailors their ship fog gave me chills there was also really creepy ghost who was only shown shadows you never saw his face who wore top hat it would have been interesting if they showed that ghost more but alas they shied away it dont get me started ending its supposed be shocker but its extremely predictable it also makes everything that preceded it make little sense what was point that stevie waynes cheesy closing monologue was even cheesier than concluding monologue house dead overall this dreadful remake ran shy where it could have won race,0.6366140572390572,0.011986531986531983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
2.0,Watch the news-it's scarier,"John Carpenter's name is synonymous with horror films. A few films were not well received, but he's gone on to develop a cult status. His movie The Fog was not considered a huge hit, but has become near and dear to many horror film lovers bloody hearts. So when it was announced that it was part of the rampage of remakes and sequels, half of those who heard rejoiced. They expected that better effects could make the film scarier. The other half of horror-files just shook their heads, expecting another disaster in film. What could a bigger budget and new hot young actors do to freshen it up? Would a bad episode of the Weather Channel really scare a new generation? I was one of the ones shaking my head, skeptical, but I gave it a shot.Two of television's young actors, Tom Wellington from Smallville, and Maggie Grace from Lost, star in this unnecessary update. The film tries to fill seats with promised SSA( Scares, Screams and Sex Appeal)- obvious from the quick cut trailer which shows typical horror shots AND a low shot of Maggie Grace in her underwear. The promises are never fulfilled. The remake keeps the same plot of the first movie. Apparently somewhere in Antonio Bay's history people have been wronged. Unhappy and looking for revenge, these people come back in the Fog around the town's anniversary. For some reason the film forgets to add the part which makes the audience care about the characters. You don't care if the living out run the Fog or not. With scary and prophetic statements like ""It came back from the sea.things always do"" this movie provokes eye rolling and incredulous looks every five minutes. Nothing in this movie made it redeemable. Trying to add comedy, DeRay Davis, as Spooner, is just confusing. At the same time makes one wonder why he's the only person who isn't white in the entire town. The only way that anyone should sit through this movie is if it's being used as a form of torture. I recommend you tell them what they want to know and forgo the pain. I wish I had. Leaving a horror film shocked or scared out of your wits is a desired effect. What The Fog leaves you with is scary- you've just wasted over an hour of your life watching a needless remake.",watch news its scarier,john carpenters name is synonymous with horror films few films were not well received but hes gone develop cult status his movie fog was not considered huge hit but has become near dear many horror film lovers bloody hearts so when it was announced that it was part rampage remakes sequels half those who heard rejoiced they expected that better effects could make film scarier other half horror files just shook their heads expecting another disaster film what could bigger budget new hot young actors do freshen it up would bad episode weather channel really scare new generation i was one ones shaking my head skeptical but i gave it shot two televisions young actors tom wellington smallville maggie grace lost star this unnecessary update film tries fill seats with promised ssa scares screams sex appeal obvious quick cut trailer which shows typical horror shots low shot maggie grace her underwear promises are never fulfilled remake keeps same plot first movie apparently somewhere antonio bays history people have been wronged unhappy looking revenge these people come back fog around towns anniversary some reason film forgets add part which makes audience care about characters you dont care if living out run fog or not with scary prophetic statements like it came back sea things always do this movie provokes eye rolling incredulous looks every five minutes nothing this movie made it redeemable trying add comedy deray davis as spooner is just confusing at same time makes one wonder why hes only person who isnt white entire town only way that anyone should sit through this movie is if its being used as form torture i recommend you tell them what they want know forgo pain i wish i had leaving horror film shocked or scared out your wits is desired effect what fog leaves you with is scary youve just wasted over hour your life watching needless remake,0.4902958152958154,-0.08735569985569985,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.26}"
1.0,This movie ROCKED.......me to sleep.,"After having read a few of the comments that have already been left, it wouldn't make much sense for me to add much more than has already been said. You've been warned: This is an hour and a half of your life that you will never, ever recover....and you will be irritated for it. ZERO chemistry between characters, sub-par acting at best, no story continuity, and, most importantly, NO SCARE FACTOR. I actually found myself chuckling through a few scenes that were supposed to be suspenseful. Terrible. With the technology available today, this had some serious promise to be an improvement over the original, but it failed miserably.

2.0,Avoid this movie at all costs.,"I saw this opening night and let me tell you. The first hour is so bad that at least a half dozen people got up and left. The lady behind me puked half way thru the movie as well (I think because the movie made her nauseous). The last 1/2 hr does have some cool cinematography but not enough to save the film from the horrible creation it is. Bad acting, horrible script writing, stereo- typical characters with less than 1-dimension. Leave well enough alone (the 1980 original). ___SPOILER BELOW____ The best (funniest) part of the film comes when the lead lady watches a videotaped segment of some murders and we see the hilarious reaction of guy who hid in the freezer.

4.0,Unnecessary and Terrible Remake,"In Antonio Island, Oregon, the dwellers are celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the seaside town and the mayor has built the statues of the founders: Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The descendant Nick Castle (Tom Welling) owns the Castle & Son, a fishing charter company, using his vessel Seagrass for tourism in the Antonio Bay. When his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) returns to the island, coincidently a huge fog appears with weird noises and killing locals. When Elizabeth slips in Nick's boathouse and falls in the sea, she finds an 1871 journal written by a man called Blake, who bought half the island for his leper people to build a town for them to live. While sailing in the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane, bringing his community to Antonio Island, Blake is betrayed by Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The quartet locks Blake and his friends in the vessel, steals their money and possessions and fires the ship, killing them. In the present days, the ghosts of Blake and his crew are seeking for revenge on the descendants of the criminals.1981 ""The Fog"" is a dark ghost story of the master of horror John Carpenter, with great cinematography and special effects, giving a scary atmosphere without the need of gore. The screenplay builds the horror in a low pace, but increasing the tension.I decided to see this remake just because of the names of Tom ""Clark Kent"" Welling, Maggie ""Shannon Rutherford"" Grace and Selma Blair. In spite of my wish of liking this movie, unfortunately it is terrible. The story is basically the same, but the modifications in the original screenplay are awful and confused. The edition never reaches the tension, and for example, I have not understood why Elizabeth leaves Antonio Bay (and Nicholas Castle) with the ghosts, or the modification in the statue of the angel in the cemetery. The songs that the DJ Stevie Wayne presents in her station are the best this movie offers to the viewers. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""A Névoa"" (""The Fog"")",unnecessary terrible remake,antonio island oregon dwellers are celebrating anniversary foundation seaside town mayor has built statues founders wayne castle williams malone descendant nick castle tom welling owns castle son fishing charter company using his vessel seagrass tourism antonio bay when his girlfriend elizabeth williams maggie grace returns island coincidently huge fog appears with weird noises killing locals when elizabeth slips nicks boathouse falls sea she finds 1871 journal written by man called blake who bought half island his leper people build town them live while sailing clipper ship elizabeth dane bringing his community antonio island blake is betrayed by wayne castle williams malone quartet locks blake his friends vessel steals their money possessions fires ship killing them present days ghosts blake his crew are seeking revenge descendants criminals 1981 fog is dark ghost story master horror john carpenter with great cinematography special effects giving scary atmosphere without need gore screenplay builds horror low pace but increasing tension i decided see this remake just because names tom clark kent welling maggie shannon rutherford grace selma blair spite my wish liking this movie unfortunately it is terrible story is basically same but modifications original screenplay are awful confused edition never reaches tension example i have not understood why elizabeth leaves antonio bay nicholas castle with ghosts or modification statue angel cemetery songs that dj stevie wayne presents her station are best this movie offers viewers my vote is four title brazil n voa fog,0.5980576441102756,-0.10253474595579858,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1.0,Watch the original instead. This is just pants.,"This remake tones things down for a more teen-friendly spookfest, which might have been OK if it had been spooky. Unfortunately you'll find more scares in a Scooby-Doo episode. The opening sequence removes much of the mystery by showing us the backstory to Antonio Bay straight away. Among the cast, only Selma Blair seems to be trying hard, but she just doesn't have Adrienne Barbeau's presence. Changes to the story don't work at all, especially the final moments involving Maggie Grace's story. The film ends on a whimper instead of a bang. Although this maybe a blessing, as a PG-13-friendly version of the shock ending of the original would probably only further the contempt many feel towards this flick. Probably the biggest flaw though is the sense of blandness throughout the film's running time. Scenes that worked well in the original come off as poorly staged in the remake. For good value for money, just watch (or rewatch) the original.",watch original instead this is just pants,this remake tones things down more teen friendly spookfest which might have been ok if it had been spooky unfortunately youll find more scares scooby doo episode opening sequence removes much mystery by showing us backstory antonio bay straight away among cast only selma blair seems be trying hard but she just doesnt have adrienne barbeaus presence changes story dont work at all especially final moments involving maggie graces story film ends whimper instead bang although this maybe blessing as pg 13 friendly version shock ending original would probably only further contempt many feel towards this flick probably biggest flaw though is sense blandness throughout films running time scenes that worked well original come off as poorly staged remake good value money just watch or rewatch original,0.5968434343434343,0.18194444444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1.0,Kill me now and save me from trash like this...,"I recently saw THE FOG and then read a lot of the reviews posted on IMDb about it. In my opinion, you people are being TOO easy on it. Can you rate anything BELOW a 1? Can I give a NEGATIVE rating to this film? And most of all, I'm writing Revolution Studios and demanding my money back. When you pay money to see something in a theater, I feel that there is a mutual and unspoken guarantee from the studio releasing it that the film will, at the very least, resemble something that LOOKS as if it were made by a group of people who know something about film-making. After seeing this, I would have to seriously question whether or not Rupert Wainwright has ever actually seen a film or if he's just going by what other people have told him (""Hey, Rupert, movies are really cool! You use this thing called a camera and it records people doing neat stuff! Doesn't that sound interesting?"").I don't need to be insulted like this. The original FOG was a good, solid piece of horror film-making that generated its scares by making the most of a small budget along with great music and decent effects. The new one is a poop stain on the remake underbelly that Hollywood has chosen to embrace. I don't just hate this movie, I LOATHE it. I loathe it and everything that it stands for because what it stands for is taking your money and then kicking you in the balls.",kill me now save me trash like this,i recently saw fog then read lot reviews posted imdb about it my opinion you people are being too easy it can you rate anything below 1 can i give negative rating this film most all im writing revolution studios demanding my money back when you pay money see something theater i feel that there is mutual unspoken guarantee studio releasing it that film will at very least resemble something that looks as if it were made by group people who know something about film making after seeing this i would have seriously question whether or not rupert wainwright has ever actually seen film or if hes just going by what other people have told him hey rupert movies are really cool you use this thing called camera it records people doing neat stuff doesnt that sound interesting i dont need be insulted like this original fog was good solid piece horror film making that generated its scares by making most small budget along with great music decent effects new one is poop stain remake underbelly that hollywood has chosen embrace i dont just hate this movie i loathe it i loathe it everything that it stands because what it stands is taking your money then kicking you balls,0.49124819624819627,0.12681096681096682,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.24}"
3.0,The biggest disappointment of the Year,"I was so disappointed about this. When I first heard they were remaking it, I was worried, but gave it every chance to actually be good. It wasn't. Everything that was good in the original was ruined in this one. There was no ""atmosphere"" to it, it was just a bunch of overly-beautiful WB-age stars thinly acting out a poor script. The whole purpose of the lighthouse and Stevie Wayne was to present this feeling of isolation and loneliness...in the new one, they seem to rarely use the lighthouse at all. There are extra points in the plot that are unnecessary and... and, I can just go on and on. It was just horrible.Then, I tried looking at it not as a ""remake"" but just as a regular movie, as though I was seeing the story for the first time. But, you know what: it still sucks. It doesn't capture you. There are a few good scenes and shots, but overall I just kept wondering when it would be over. So much potential with a story and it just didn't work.Unfortunately, that's Hollywood today. Horror films can be well made at the same time. Maybe they should stop relying so much on picture-perfect actors and corny digital special effects and start focusing more on the story, the characters, the music (Lord, the original score added so much), and just making it entertaining! 3 out of 10.",biggest disappointment year,i was so disappointed about this when i first heard they were remaking it i was worried but gave it every chance actually be good it wasnt everything that was good original was ruined this one there was no atmosphere it it was just bunch overly beautiful wb age stars thinly acting out poor script whole purpose lighthouse stevie wayne was present this feeling isolation loneliness new one they seem rarely use lighthouse at all there are extra points plot that are unnecessary i can just go it was just horrible then i tried looking at it not as remake but just as regular movie as though i was seeing story first time but you know what it still sucks it doesnt capture you there are few good scenes shots but overall i just kept wondering when it would be over so much potential with story it just didnt work unfortunately thats hollywood today horror films can be well made at same time maybe they should stop relying so much picture perfect actors corny digital special effects start focusing more story characters music lord original score added so much just making it entertaining 3 out 10,0.49225950816859904,0.1043486816214089,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.22}"
3.0,Not terrible.,"On Antonio Island, all sorts of weird and creepy things start happening. A boat full of people are found dead or near dead, a woman keeps having strange dreams, weird objects wash ashore, fires break out and then there is the fog...a fog which is creepy and brings folks from the mid-1800s back to the present day! Obviously, the island is totally screwed!In 1980, John Carpenter brought the world ""The Fog"". This horror film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau was successful and there were some who loved it. In 2005, a remake came out....and only bad movie buffs loved it...mostly because they loved to laugh at the film and how unintentionally bad it was. It currently is number 62 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list...evidence that many people strongly disliked this movie!So did this version go so wrong? I have two guesses. First, the studio green lit this film project before they even had a completed script! This is a very dangerous move and you would rationally think they'd have the script before making the decision to make the movie! Second, although John Carpenter is listed as one of the producers, apparently it was in name only and Carpenter told the media he essentially had no involvement in the remake.So what did I dislike about the film? Well, I was mostly sad because it wasn't as horrible as I'd hoped. After all, sometimes it's funny to watch a thoroughly terrible and inept movie...and this one wasn't that fun to watch. I think it's because of the generally slow pacing, a close-up shot of a dead dog, the hipster radio station character, the use of leprosy to evoke horror and much more....but it never was funny bad like ""The Room"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""The Apple"". Instead, it was tedious and poorly made...though I wouldn't place it in the Bottom 100...especially since some of the effects were impressive. Perhaps it made this list because folks expected so much more since the original was apparently better. By the way, there is a scene where someone or some thing painted a quote from the Bible on the wall. In Daniel, it read ""Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin"". Well, in the movie they misspelled 'upharsin'. Not a huge error but a sign of sloppiness nonetheless.",not terrible,antonio island all sorts weird creepy things start happening boat full people are found dead or near dead woman keeps having strange dreams weird objects wash ashore fires break out then there is fog fog which is creepy brings folks mid 1800s back present day obviously island is totally screwed 1980 john carpenter brought world fog this horror film starring jamie lee curtis adrienne barbeau was successful there were some who loved it 2005 remake came out only bad movie buffs loved it mostly because they loved laugh at film how unintentionally bad it was it currently is number 62 imdbs infamous bottom 100 list evidence that many people strongly disliked this movie so did this version go so wrong i have two guesses first studio green lit this film project before they even had completed script this is very dangerous move you would rationally think theyd have script before making decision make movie second although john carpenter is listed as one producers apparently it was name only carpenter told media he essentially had no involvement remake so what did i dislike about film well i was mostly sad because it wasnt as horrible as id hoped after all sometimes its funny watch thoroughly terrible inept movie this one wasnt that fun watch i think its because generally slow pacing close up shot dead dog hipster radio station character use leprosy evoke horror much more but it never was funny bad like room plan 9 outer space or apple instead it was tedious poorly made though i wouldnt place it bottom 100 especially since some effects were impressive perhaps it made this list because folks expected so much more since original was apparently better by way there is scene where someone or some thing painted quote bible wall daniel it read mene mene tekel upharsin well movie they misspelled upharsin not huge error but sign sloppiness nonetheless,0.6351515151515152,-0.033727272727272724,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
1.0,They destroyed a classic horror flick !!!,"OK, I should have known better before paying money to go see the 2005 remake of The Fog starring TOM WELLING and rated PG-13!! For me, the Fog, was a cult classic I used to love when I was a kid. The scary, eerie small town with a dark secret, the ghostly figures in the fog and the brutal way the townspeople got slayed in, contributed to a great ghost/horror story that was both exciting and enjoyable. Unfortunately we live in the ""era of the remake"" and naturally they had go screw this flick up as well. The small eerie town is replaced with a totally un-scary town, the fog looked like something pulled out of ""the perfect storm"" w/ George Clooney or ""the day after tomorrow"" (which is no surprise since it was the same company who handled the FX on ""Day after...""), Selma Blair was trying to hard to fill out the role of Stevie Wayne and it seemed awfully fake at times. One thing that really got me cracking was the black guy/comic relief. I couldn't really figure out what the hell a black dude was doing in a small (all white) fishing town anyway? (if U ask me he was totally misplaced in the movie).In overall they actually managed to turn, what could have been a great horror movie into a teen/slasher/ring-knockoff!!The same goes for the moody ""Carpenter music"" that was replaced with the standard PG-13 b*llsh*t pop-rock soundtrack, it basically stripped the movie from having any tense atmosphere. The script was horrible, there where no scares and no mood at all, instead of cooking up a better ""FOG"" they actually made it worse, I find it incredible that despite having the technology to make some visually nice horror flicks today and correct some of the flaws that were caused by lack of money or technology back then, the studios are still spitting out nothing but trash... PEOPLE what makes a movie is a good story and HEART not Special FX (a principle Carpenter used to work with back then when the funds were limited...even still the man still made some of the most memorable horror movies in my lifetime). The ghost looked like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean and the only moment I thought ""hmm...that's actually cool"" was when you could see the big ship and the crew's ghostly figures standing in the fog, kindda made me remember back to the original, unfortunately things only went (even more) downhill from there...I mean WTF is up with the ending!?!?! I thought it was supposed to be a horror flick? In overall: If U are a fan of the original Carpenter movie, DO not see this cr*p, almost no gore, no feeling with the characters (actually you couldn't care less if they all got killed...), no mood, no eerie music, bad CGI, and the list just goes on and on... my advice: Rent it on DVD or even better wait for it to be aired on TV!",they destroyed classic horror flick,ok i should have known better before paying money go see 2005 remake fog starring tom welling rated pg 13 me fog was cult classic i used love when i was kid scary eerie small town with dark secret ghostly figures fog brutal way townspeople got slayed contributed great ghost horror story that was both exciting enjoyable unfortunately we live era remake naturally they had go screw this flick up as well small eerie town is replaced with totally un scary town fog looked like something pulled out perfect storm w george clooney or day after tomorrow which is no surprise since it was same company who handled fx day after selma blair was trying hard fill out role stevie wayne it seemed awfully fake at times one thing that really got me cracking was black guy comic relief i couldnt really figure out what hell black dude was doing small all white fishing town anyway if u ask me he was totally misplaced movie overall they actually managed turn what could have been great horror movie into teen slasher ring knockoff same goes moody carpenter music that was replaced with standard pg 13 b llsh t pop rock soundtrack it basically stripped movie having any tense atmosphere script was horrible there where no scares no mood at all instead cooking up better fog they actually made it worse i find it incredible that despite having technology make some visually nice horror flicks today correct some flaws that were caused by lack money or technology back then studios are still spitting out nothing but trash people what makes movie is good story heart not special fx principle carpenter used work with back then when funds were limited even still man still made some most memorable horror movies my lifetime ghost looked like something out pirates caribbean only moment i thought hmm thats actually cool was when you could see big ship crews ghostly figures standing fog kindda made me remember back original unfortunately things only went even more downhill there i mean wtf is up with ending i thought it was supposed be horror flick overall if u are fan original carpenter movie do not see this cr p almost no gore no feeling with characters actually you couldnt care less if they all got killed no mood no eerie music bad cgi list just goes my advice rent it dvd or even better wait it be aired tv,0.5110969387755103,0.03438852813852814,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,This movie is really good if you're a complete moron,"Allow me to save you $8 by offering something you can do at home that is just as entertaining as watching this movie. Go get a load of whites and throw it in your dryer. Now, add in one red sock. (Make sure everything's dry so you don't end up with a bunch of pink laundry.) Now, hopefully you have the kind of dryer that has the clear window in front. If you do, start the load and watch the laundry spin around. Every time you see the red sock pretend to be scared.That's it. That's the equivalent to seeing this movie. As entertaining as watching your laundry dry and every bit as scary as a red sock.Others have already punched all the holes in the plot (or complete lack thereof) that are necessary. I won't beat that dead horse. As mentioned, the acting was completely mailed in. The CGI was hokey, stilted and throw in in a lot of scenes unnecessarily. This wasn't just a really bad movie, this was a really bad horror movie.

1.0,Why remake a classic and turn it into a piece of boring dreck?,"The grave robbers of Hollywood, completely devoid of new ideas, have taken to the graveyard once again to dig up classic movies of various directors to help their sagging box office.This year's director of choice is John Carpenter. We've seen a bad remake of ""Assault On Precient 13"" already and now comes ""The Fog"". Originally, it was a well crafted tale of suspense, horror and shock with a minimal amount of blood and gore, relying on the talent of Carpenter and his usual team of actors such as then wife Adreinne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Jamie Lee Curtis and mom Janet Leigh, et al and spun a great ghost story.Along comes the remake squad with the latest in teen idols like ""Smallville""'s Tom Welling, a load of digital effects and generous amounts of blood, gore and bad acting to deliver a hot steaming plate of manure shoved down our throats between handfuls of stale, overpriced popcorn.Message to Hollywood.

8.0,Highly enjoyable and impressive remake,"After a series of strange encounters, a small sea-town comes to believe the fulfillment of a deadly curse is being brought upon by a series of malicious ghosts and try to stop it before it's too late.Quite frankly, this is a highly underrated effort that's one of the more enjoyable remakes among this current crop. One of the only true flaws to this is the lower rating which does harm this one. The kills here really lack any sort of impact or brutality with the lack of blood throughout here, and the other attacks have a slightly less intense bite to them than they otherwise would with a darker tone to this. There's also the act that this one tends to overplay its scenes far longer than they're worth, which is slightly odd in that it makes for overlong and overly dramatic scare scenes that overstay their welcome at times and instead drains some of their impact. Still, there's a lot to like here in the fact that the build-up in here is incredibly well-done with this one featuring the early visions of the ships' fate along with the items washed ashore both creating a rather fine and exciting set-up as well as the burgeoning mystery they lead to surrounding the sudden appearance of the journal explaining everything that finally puts everything together. That helps makes scenes like the ambush or sea or the supernatural activities in the radio station to seem all the more enjoyable as well as being highly suspenseful by milking the idea of the fog being a malevolent entity in this one. The scenes of it moving through town, surrounding buildings and weaving along the hallways makes for a thoroughly chilling scenario about what's trapped in the fog. When it finally pays that off in the final half causes this to be all the more enjoyable and entertaining by making for a rather chilling connection with the back-story given already in here which is where this one gets the most out of its storyline. That also helps to make for a really fine finale by really getting the good attacks and really creepy scenarios in here that really make for a high-note ending here which really sells this one. The last part to like here is the rather inspired amount of suspense in here, from the attack on the lighthouse worker and the fog chasing the family through the house to even shorter scenes with the trapped car underwater, the fake-drowning in the outhouse or the final assault in the library which makes for some really good times in here. While they may seem a little like a cop-out, these make it enjoyable enough.Rated PG-13: Violence, some Language and shadowy Nudity.",highly enjoyable impressive remake,after series strange encounters small sea town comes believe fulfillment deadly curse is being brought upon by series malicious ghosts try stop it before its too late quite frankly this is highly underrated effort thats one more enjoyable remakes among this current crop one only true flaws this is lower rating which does harm this one kills here really lack any sort impact or brutality with lack blood throughout here other attacks have slightly less intense bite them than they otherwise would with darker tone this theres also act that this one tends overplay its scenes far longer than theyre worth which is slightly odd that it makes overlong overly dramatic scare scenes that overstay their welcome at times instead drains some their impact still theres lot like here fact that build up here is incredibly well done with this one featuring early visions ships fate along with items washed ashore both creating rather fine exciting set up as well as burgeoning mystery they lead surrounding sudden appearance journal explaining everything that finally puts everything together that helps makes scenes like ambush or sea or supernatural activities radio station seem all more enjoyable as well as being highly suspenseful by milking idea fog being malevolent entity this one scenes it moving through town surrounding buildings weaving along hallways makes thoroughly chilling scenario about whats trapped fog when it finally pays that off final half causes this be all more enjoyable entertaining by making rather chilling connection with back story given already here which is where this one gets most out its storyline that also helps make really fine finale by really getting good attacks really creepy scenarios here that really make high note ending here which really sells this one last part like here is rather inspired amount suspense here attack lighthouse worker fog chasing family through house even shorter scenes with trapped car underwater fake drowning outhouse or final assault library which makes some really good times here while they may seem little like cop out these make it enjoyable enough rated pg 13 violence some language shadowy nudity,0.5650287356321839,0.12627873563218395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,SO GLAD I GAVE THIS ANOTHER WATCH!!! A GOOD SUPERNATURAL THRILLER,"I admit it i hated this movie when i first watched it on dvd way back in 2005 & now after 15 years i decided give it another try out of pure curiosity again, as John Carpenters The Fog (1980) is probably my favourite Horror movie of all time & i have recently been watching alot of Aquatic water-based Horror Thriller's lately such as the Jaws franchise & Piranha & Anaconda & Humanoids from the Deep & Lake Placid & Crawl among others & i remembered the Fog remake from 2005.It's weird because i hated this remake & even tossed the dvd in the bin but now after such a long period of time & with fresh & more mature eyes lol i really enjoyed this & take it for what it is now, a modern version of a Horror CLASSIC & it was never going to be better or as good as the first film.This Fog is a polished version with some gorgeous scenes. What i now enjoyed about this flick is it's slow-paced & relaxing flow of it & it's quiet & creepy atmosphere. This is a relaxing movie that is more a Supernatural Thriller than a Dark Horror like the original & there in its tone it's supposed to be a new vision of the old story & i can except that now. The music is creepy & atmospheric but obviously not on the same genius level as the legendary John Carpenter but it's still a solid creepy score. The look & cinematography is actually really good here too with an overall creepy & moody look & some really nice shots of the Antonio Bay town & nice lovely night time scenes. The cast is no where near as good as John Carpenters original obviously but here they're fine in that early 2000's Slasher flick casting type of way. I did get nice vibes of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" in this film too with little fishing town & imagery. Back to the little cast of typical pretty faces like the new Nick Castle played by ""SmallVilles"" Tom Welling, he's not too bad as the local fisherman that was originally played by the legendary Tom Atkins, but he's ok as the typical good-looking lead hero type & Maggie Grace (Taken Trilogy) is actually pretty good here as Elizabeth, a girl who comes back to the small town just as everything gets Spooky & strange. Elizabeth does alot of investigating into the past history of the town which is a nice added bit of detail & her character is much more fleshed out than that of Jamie lee Curtis was im the original, some really nice looking scenes of her in the old museum checking it all out. We also get a good performance from Selma Blair (HellBoy 1&2) as the lighthouse DJ radio host Stevie Wayne, it's a fine part & the worst role goes to the ""Funny Black Guy"" played by Deray Davis as Spooner the friend of Nick, he's the typical wannabe funny black guy that was in all those Slasher flicks back in the day but he doesn't ruin it as he's not a main character & not too over the top. The Supernatural killers look pretty decent for computer effects & look like actual Ghosts rather than Carpenters much scarier Zombies but this is a new ""Vision"" so things change even if it's not for the better. But all in all ""The Fog"" from 2005 is actually a decent little supernatural Thriller with an ok little cast for a relaxing little low-key popcorn flick. There's actually a nice quiet & lonely feel to this flick which i really liked & some really good spooky scenes but it's definitely not scary like the first film but that adds to it's nice calm & old school early 2000's feel. It's definitely a product of it's time like all films but something nice & slow about it's thrills & chills & nothing is over the top or crazy like most Horror's or Supernatural films today, the pacing is nice here. This isn't totally the same & that's whats good as it follows similar beats but done differently & that makes it not a carbon copy & is in away it's own thing just following the old story slightly but also making changes & also adding much more depth to everything especially the History of the town & Mythology.I'm glad i gave this another watch after 15 years!!! It's not the Classic first film but it's very good little atmospheric Supernatural Thriller in it's own right & a nice late night flick.",so glad i gave this another watch good supernatural thriller,i admit it i hated this movie when i first watched it dvd way back 2005 now after 15 years i decided give it another try out pure curiosity again as john carpenters fog 1980 is probably my favourite horror movie all time i have recently been watching alot aquatic water based horror thrillers lately such as jaws franchise piranha anaconda humanoids deep lake placid crawl among others i remembered fog remake 2005 its weird because i hated this remake even tossed dvd bin but now after such long period time with fresh more mature eyes lol i really enjoyed this take it what it is now modern version horror classic it was never going be better or as good as first film this fog is polished version with some gorgeous scenes what i now enjoyed about this flick is its slow paced relaxing flow it its quiet creepy atmosphere this is relaxing movie that is more supernatural thriller than dark horror like original there its tone its supposed be new vision old story i can except that now music is creepy atmospheric but obviously not same genius level as legendary john carpenter but its still solid creepy score look cinematography is actually really good here too with overall creepy moody look some really nice shots antonio bay town nice lovely night time scenes cast is no where near as good as john carpenters original obviously but here theyre fine that early 2000s slasher flick casting type way i did get nice vibes i know what you did last summer this film too with little fishing town imagery back little cast typical pretty faces like new nick castle played by smallvilles tom welling hes not too bad as local fisherman that was originally played by legendary tom atkins but hes ok as typical good looking lead hero type maggie grace taken trilogy is actually pretty good here as elizabeth girl who comes back small town just as everything gets spooky strange elizabeth does alot investigating into past history town which is nice added bit detail her character is much more fleshed out than that jamie lee curtis was im original some really nice looking scenes her old museum checking it all out we also get good performance selma blair hellboy 1 2 as lighthouse dj radio host stevie wayne its fine part worst role goes funny black guy played by deray davis as spooner friend nick hes typical wannabe funny black guy that was all those slasher flicks back day but he doesnt ruin it as hes not main character not too over top supernatural killers look pretty decent computer effects look like actual ghosts rather than carpenters much scarier zombies but this is new vision so things change even if its not better but all all fog 2005 is actually decent little supernatural thriller with ok little cast relaxing little low key popcorn flick theres actually nice quiet lonely feel this flick which i really liked some really good spooky scenes but its definitely not scary like first film but that adds its nice calm old school early 2000s feel its definitely product its time like all films but something nice slow about its thrills chills nothing is over top or crazy like most horrors or supernatural films today pacing is nice here this isnt totally same thats whats good as it follows similar beats but done differently that makes it not carbon copy is away its own thing just following old story slightly but also making changes also adding much more depth everything especially history town mythology im glad i gave this another watch after 15 years its not classic first film but its very good little atmospheric supernatural thriller its own right nice late night flick,0.5557946391508035,0.1634298464092985,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.25}"

1.0,"Lame, Dumb, Un-Creepy, Dysfunctional, And...... The Devil of all Horror Films & Horror Remakes","As a film, As a Horror film and as a Remake it is the worse. Whether it falls in these three categories, The Fog 2005 is an awful adaptation of the 1980 John Carpentar classic.People complain about ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Friday the 13th"" and even ""Halloween"" being remade, but I think that this is the devil of all remakes. This remake has no originality and even if I heard bad things about this remake, like all films i gave it a chance. i did and as the first 10 minutes rolled in, i just wanted this piece of crap to end.I'll talk through on what I think of the film.Acting, 3/10: Very poor and pretty useless and we can expect from modern horror films. The girl on the radio, Elizabeth & The Smallville Actor try their best but they don't save this film at all. Aside from those actors acting terribly, The other actors do nothing to help and they are just plain and simple, with no character.Story/Plot, 0/10: What a messed up plot!? This plot doesn't work for me at all. In Carpentar's version it was all about a creepy ghost tale. It was about an evil atmosphere that would come on a certain night at a certain time after 100 years later. This remake's side of the story is very uninspiring. It's about 4 crooks burning a boat which has men, women and children. After they return 1000 years later to get revenge. It sounds like the same thing but it's that dysfunctional that I couldn't understand what's with that and this? Scariness, 0/10: The film is not scary at all. From start to end it isn't creepy. If you want scares go rent the 1980 classic because the kills and the atmosphere is more tense.Besides describing those things, I would like to describe the worse thing possible in the film that is unrealistic, overdone and not creepy whatsoever. The scenes of the Fog. When the Fog kills it is very unrealistic. When it kills, we see human hands grabbing people and we see that the Fog has cleared. When the Fog moves in and out of places it is done very quickly. It moves very fast and that gives us no tension or creeps whatsoever. Every scene with the Fog fails epically. It's not scary and it never creeped me out. I just sat there and said ""Yep, really scary"". The Fog in Carpentar's version is much more realistic because it moves in very slowly and that what gives it tension. And then when hands grab people, it's like the hands are camouflaged through the Fog to give off the nice effect.I didn't have hope for this film at the start and now I wish I had two hours of my life back because this version was very uninspiring. Nothing is pulled off well here. Nada....Even if Carpentar's The Fog isn't my favorite Horror film, I still think it beats the remake tremendously.1/10",lame dumb un creepy dysfunctional devil all horror films horror remakes,as film as horror film as remake it is worse whether it falls these three categories fog 2005 is awful adaptation 1980 john carpentar classic people complain about nightmare elm street friday 13th even halloween being remade but i think that this is devil all remakes this remake has no originality even if i heard bad things about this remake like all films i gave it chance i did as first 10 minutes rolled i just wanted this piece crap end ill talk through what i think film acting 3 10 very poor pretty useless we can expect modern horror films girl radio elizabeth smallville actor try their best but they dont save this film at all aside those actors acting terribly other actors do nothing help they are just plain simple with no character story plot 0 10 what messed up plot this plot doesnt work me at all carpentars version it was all about creepy ghost tale it was about evil atmosphere that would come certain night at certain time after 100 years later this remakes side story is very uninspiring its about 4 crooks burning boat which has men women children after they return 1000 years later get revenge it sounds like same thing but its that dysfunctional that i couldnt understand whats with that this scariness 0 10 film is not scary at all start end it isnt creepy if you want scares go rent 1980 classic because kills atmosphere is more tense besides describing those things i would like describe worse thing possible film that is unrealistic overdone not creepy whatsoever scenes fog when fog kills it is very unrealistic when it kills we see human hands grabbing people we see that fog has cleared when fog moves out places it is done very quickly it moves very fast that gives us no tension or creeps whatsoever every scene with fog fails epically its not scary it never creeped me out i just sat there said yep really scary fog carpentars version is much more realistic because it moves very slowly that what gives it tension then when hands grab people its like hands are camouflaged through fog give off nice effect i didnt have hope this film at start now i wish i had two hours my life back because this version was very uninspiring nothing is pulled off well here nada even if carpentars fog isnt my favorite horror film i still think it beats remake tremendously 1 10,0.5717699910152741,-0.08495058400718777,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.46}"
2.0,"John Carpenter, Come Back!","Actually, there were a few good things about this movie. Unfortunately, the best thing about it was the preview for RENT that ran just before it.And the British Columbia settings are awesome. I can see why my wife's parents made the trip from Texas to British Columbia three times and would happily go again.First and foremost it's not scary. There's not a single character developed well enough to care.Worst of all, it just doesn't make sense. Just who IS Elizabeth Williams? MAJOR SPOILER HERE, not that anyone would care. Here, she's a direct descendant of one of the townspeople who many generations ago betrayed the lepers on the ship. Or is she somehow a descendant of a woman on that ship whose corpse we see sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Was that woman Elizabeth Dane, or is the modern character being named Elizabeth just a coincidence.Is the town called Antonio Bay? That's what's on the town hall and Nick's boat. Is it Antonio Island? That's what Stevie calls it on the radio and what the sign at the power station says.Stevie has a radio station in a lighthouse and programs alternative rock. But she's the only dj. The station is on the air when she's there and off when she's not. And we never hear her run any ads. Where does she support herself and her child and afford a housekeeper? And who listens to her station? The population of Antonio Bay/Island seems to be primarily people over the age of forty except for the main characters. And why does she leave the lighthouse (with its sturdy metal doors) to drive into town? The original utilized the lighthouse setting so well.Every once in a while there's a car crash. Why? Did the director get confused and think he was remaking SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT? This is such a tiny island it's hard for vehicles to get up enough momentum for a really good crash.The town looks to be big enough to have a population of about 15- 20 thousand people. There's one black character, and he came from Chicago. Why? Nick is the main character, sort of the hero. But all he does is drive people here and there and near the end of the movie he drives to Stevie's house to rescue her son. The actor gets top billing but his character has no real function other than transportation.The director had previously made STIGMATA, a movie that had very few supporters. Why entrust this project to him? The man cannot direct for beans. If the pace of the movie hadn't been so glacial I wouldn't have noticed how inconsistent the storytelling was. The Director's Guild of America should bar him from ever going near a camera again.And the main question is, Why didn't they hire John Carpenter to direct this? He hasn't been all that busy since GHOSTS OF MARS and he could have contributed a script that would bring the whole project together. Carpenter is one of the few directors whose name on a project is in and of itself enough reason for me to go see it. Except GHOSTS OF MARS. Loyalty only runs so far. Heck, he's a grown man. Maybe he'd have gotten Adrienne Barbeau to come back to play Stevie. I'll bet she still looks good.Come back, John.

1.0,One big bore,"It has been said by other moviegoers, so what more can I say? This movie was very dull, to say the least. If you want to see a scary flick, this one is not for you. If you want to see likable characters, again this is not for you. If you want to toss out some money and waste 90 minutes of your life, go for it. It is best to just stick to the 1980 original. This version did not build up any suspense or leave you rooting for anybody. A very flat movie, indeed, which had very little fog in it. The fact that this was filmed close to my home community does not add any stars to my rating. In fact, I am ashamed to say that my community would have anything to do with this boring garbage.",one big bore,it has been said by other moviegoers so what more can i say this movie was very dull say least if you want see scary flick this one is not you if you want see likable characters again this is not you if you want toss out some money waste 90 minutes your life go it it is best just stick 1980 original this version did not build up any suspense or leave you rooting anybody very flat movie indeed which had very little fog it fact that this was filmed close my home community does not add any stars my rating fact i am ashamed say that my community would have anything do with this boring garbage,0.49134615384615377,-0.031185897435897433,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.35}"
2.0,pg-5,"I had to see it to believe it and guess what, I even watched the unrated version to be sure I see it all. But, I didn't see anything, maybe I was blinking with my eyes and missed the best part. To be honest. The beginning of 2000 up to today they are making remakes and admit it, they all suck. Well, most of them. But this one is a perfect example why not to remake a classic. Even on the cover of the DVD you could see that there wasn't a bloody shot in it. There wasn't even one scary moment in it. And to make it worse, the shower scene even didn't contain any nudity. When the 'ghosts' came on screen it did remind me of Pirates of the Caribbean. I even can't understand why it is rated for 16 and above her in our country. I could watch it with my 9 year old daughter. She would never be afraid of it.

5.0,Lacking compared to the original,"I love the 1980 version of The Fog, love it. It's so creepy with the music, the setting and the fog itself. The Pirates looked cool and horrifying plus we never saw them fully, the darkness covering them really made them creepy yet cool. Although this film isn't one of John Carpenter's favourites I must say it's worthy of a classic.Now the remake, I wasn't expecting much from this film because I know remakes are never as good as the original only a few can be as close or even better than the original like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.The plot is close to the first film with the ghosts returning for revenge on the descendants of the people who killed them but instead of the horror tone of the 1980 film we get more of a teen horror film with few scares. The fog effects are cool and make it look like it's alive and instead of the Pirates killing people with swords and hooks their more supernatural with using the fog to kill people.The pirates don't look too bad, they seem more ghost like than the original but we don't see them as much.Another difference is that Jamie Lee's character in the original now lives in the town and is going out with NIck Castle, another thing is that she is connected to the ghosts since in her past life she was married to Blake and he wants her again.Not as good as John Carpenter's original but if you want to see how different the remake is then go ahead, just don't expect any jump out of your seat moments.",lacking compared original,i love 1980 version fog love it its so creepy with music setting fog itself pirates looked cool horrifying plus we never saw them fully darkness covering them really made them creepy yet cool although this film isnt one john carpenters favourites i must say its worthy classic now remake i wasnt expecting much this film because i know remakes are never as good as original only few can be as close or even better than original like texas chainsaw massacre remake plot is close first film with ghosts returning revenge descendants people who killed them but instead horror tone 1980 film we get more teen horror film with few scares fog effects are cool make it look like its alive instead pirates killing people with swords hooks their more supernatural with using fog kill people pirates dont look too bad they seem more ghost like than original but we dont see them as much another difference is that jamie lees character original now lives town is going out with nick castle another thing is that she is connected ghosts since her past life she was married blake he wants her again not as good as john carpenters original but if you want see how different remake is then go ahead just dont expect any jump out your seat moments,0.5258771929824563,0.1662280701754386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6.0,It deserves a better grade.,"Some people might consider me a complete moron now, but I find this a pretty entertaining horror film. The fog isn't a movie where you have to think and stay focused the whole time, like the ring. It's more a no-brainer, you rent for a day, like the later Friday the 13th movies. This kind of movies don't need to be scary, you just need to enjoy the killing. The special effects are nicely done. The computer generated fog looks pretty neat, but in some scenes you can see they just used plain smoke. The acting wasn't great, but not the worst acting in a horror movie.I don't think this movie is a complete disaster, I rated it a 6, because it was entertaining, but not scary and that are most horror films these days. You just need to learn to like these new kind of horror movies and not expect it to be scary, but entertaining. I also didn't see the original, so I didn't compare it or something.",it deserves better grade,some people might consider me complete moron now but i find this pretty entertaining horror film fog isnt movie where you have think stay focused whole time like ring its more no brainer you rent day like later friday 13th movies this kind movies dont need be scary you just need enjoy killing special effects are nicely done computer generated fog looks pretty neat but some scenes you can see they just used plain smoke acting wasnt great but not worst acting horror movie i dont think this movie is complete disaster i rated it 6 because it was entertaining but not scary that are most horror films these days you just need learn like these new kind horror movies not expect it be scary but entertaining i also didnt see original so i didnt compare it or something,0.6201074787281683,0.2242834751455441,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.22}"
