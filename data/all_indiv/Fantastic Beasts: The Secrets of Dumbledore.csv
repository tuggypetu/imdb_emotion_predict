7,NOTHING FELT EARNED.,"Though the style part was enjoyable on it's own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant.

1,Brain Rot,"I will say that the visuals were amazing. I thought the cinematography was amazing. However that is where I get off the train.Even if they had Johnny Depp, the movie would have still sucked. Sure, Mikkelsen is a fine actor and he did the best he could, but his acting for Grindelwald is like trying to compare Heath Ledger's The Joker to Jack Nicholson's version. Both are good, but one is demented and insane while the other is a comic book impression. Depp was far more sinister, dark and abusive. I found Mikkelsen sort of like a step dad who wanted to punish you for breaking his bowling trophy but only gave you a long winded discussion about how you need to respect the possession of others. There was no fire. There was no anger. There was no evil.I blame the script writers/the author, along with a lot more blame going to Warner Bros. The script was predictable and boring. I thought the idea of the animal (the Qilin) picking the next leader as poor of a plot device as the 'time turner'. Lame. I found the multiple story arcs weak and contrived. The script could have been a lot better. The story could have been a lot better.I dismiss the idea that JK Rowling did a good job with this story. I found no magic in the story, not like the magic felt in the first movie or book. In fact, I have found this entire series lackluster. Yes, there are good characters and there were scenes which I liked out of the series of movies. However, I found the ""Fantastic Creatures"" as if she gave up writing and said, ""I'm tired, this will have to do"".I found the script was nothing more than filler that had no purpose other than to take up space and time. Take for example the story arc about assassinating the Brazilian candidate. Why? Absolutely filler for the story. This plot device was not needed.Anton Vogel was a weak and unintelligent character. Did he forget who Grindelwald was and why he was being held in a maximum security prison with his entire body encased in chains and braces? Oh, yeah, his followers would have blood in the streets. What total crap. This is such a weak plot device that I want to scream. Did JK Rowling completely forget the other books/movies?Too many Deus ex machina. Too many poorly constructed, illogical story arcs. Too much continuity toss out the window.Overall, the CG was the highlight of the movie. The rest of it I dismiss. It's really lazy and sloppy writing. I do not blame the casting or the director. They did the best that they could with the material they were given.",brain rot,i will say that visuals were amazing i thought cinematography was amazing however that is where i get off train even if they had johnny depp movie would have still sucked sure mikkelsen is fine actor he did best he could but his acting grindelwald is like trying compare heath ledgers joker jack nicholsons version both are good but one is demented insane while other is comic book impression depp was far more sinister dark abusive i found mikkelsen sort like step dad who wanted punish you breaking his bowling trophy but only gave you long winded discussion about how you need respect possession others there was no fire there was no anger there was no evil i blame script writers author along with lot more blame going warner bros script was predictable boring i thought idea animal qilin picking next leader as poor plot device as time turner lame i found multiple story arcs weak contrived script could have been lot better story could have been lot better i dismiss idea that jk rowling did good job with this story i found no magic story not like magic felt first movie or book fact i have found this entire series lackluster yes there are good characters there were scenes which i liked out series movies however i found fantastic creatures as if she gave up writing said im tired this will have do i found script was nothing more than filler that had no purpose other than take up space time take example story arc about assassinating brazilian candidate why absolutely filler story this plot device was not needed anton vogel was weak unintelligent character did he forget who grindelwald was why he was being held maximum security prison with his entire body encased chains braces oh yeah his followers would have blood streets what total crap this is such weak plot device that i want scream did jk rowling completely forget other books movies too many deus ex machina too many poorly constructed illogical story arcs too much continuity toss out window overall cg was highlight movie rest it i dismiss its really lazy sloppy writing i do not blame casting or director they did best that they could with material they were given,0.603831417624521,0.07241379310344828,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
2,"It puts the ""dumb"" in Dumbledore","It's sometimes funny and often creative, and it's an improvement over its predecessor by default, simply because rather than only 5% of the plot being consequential, about 30% of the plot is consequential.In fact, the best thing I can say about this ""film"" is that you can go to the bathroom during it without worrying about missing something; there's hardly anything important to miss.Just like the last movie, this has a screenplay that desperately tries to find reasons to keep these characters in the story, and it fails spectacularly. 90% of the characters could be missing from the story, or replaced with planks of wood, and not a single thing of note would change.The story just consist of characters wandering around and either chilling in the background or completing a task that has absolutely no bearing on the main conflict. It's a two and a half hour movie that should be an hour long.Even though the magic is creative, it's so inconsistent and so confusing in how it works that it's frustrating to watch rather than awe-inspiring.In fact, most of the things that happen in the movie don't make any sense. They rely on characters knowing things that they couldn't possibly have known. They rely on people acting in ways that are so unfathomably stupid and are not in line with who they were shown to be earlier in these three movies. It's a story in which not a single plot point can withstand the slightest amount of logical scrutiny.The writing is so insultingly idiotic that at one point in the film, when a character questions a plot point that doesn't make any sense, Dumbledore actually says ""Let's call it fate,"" ignoring the question entirely.That was JK Rowling saying to her stupid mob of gullible fans, ""Screw you. I don't even have to try anymore. Nothing has to add up or be consistent. You'll watch it and love it anyway.""Lastly, this movie has ZERO character development. Nobody learns anything, nobody does anything special, nobody even IS anything. It's a story populated by husks of human beings, and none of them are even remotely relatable or understandable. In fact, most of them are briefly shown and then forgotten about until the end of the movie.Just as in ""Crimes of Grindlewald,"" Grindlewald hardly committed any crimes, in ""Secrets of Dumbledore,"" Dumbledore only has one secret, and it doesn't even have any bearing on the story. How fitting. It's false, just like this movie. It's barely a movie.Stop making these, please.",it puts dumb dumbledore,its sometimes funny often creative its improvement over its predecessor by default simply because rather than only 5 plot being consequential about 30 plot is consequential fact best thing i can say about this film is that you can go bathroom during it without worrying about missing something theres hardly anything important miss just like last movie this has screenplay that desperately tries find reasons keep these characters story it fails spectacularly 90 characters could be missing story or replaced with planks wood not single thing note would change story just consist characters wandering around either chilling background or completing task that has absolutely no bearing main conflict its two half hour movie that should be hour long even though magic is creative its so inconsistent so confusing how it works that its frustrating watch rather than awe inspiring fact most things that happen movie dont make any sense they rely characters knowing things that they couldnt possibly have known they rely people acting ways that are so unfathomably stupid are not line with who they were shown be earlier these three movies its story which not single plot point can withstand slightest amount logical scrutiny writing is so insultingly idiotic that at one point film when character questions plot point that doesnt make any sense dumbledore actually says lets call it fate ignoring question entirely that was jk rowling saying her stupid mob gullible fans screw you i dont even have try anymore nothing has add up or be consistent youll watch it love it anyway lastly this movie has zero character development nobody learns anything nobody does anything special nobody even is anything its story populated by husks human beings none them are even remotely relatable or understandable fact most them are briefly shown then forgotten about until end movie just as crimes grindlewald grindlewald hardly committed any crimes secrets dumbledore dumbledore only has one secret it doesnt even have any bearing story how fitting its false just like this movie its barely movie stop making these please,0.535309523809524,0.01507142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6,Convoluted,"The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.Technically, The Secrets of Dumbledore is disappointing. First, the effects are overdone. Earlier action is compelling, but the finale is undercut by excessive CGI. Plus, the production design in that final act feels empty. Squandering the union of fantasy and period dressings, the climax is woefully shallow. Furthermore, the editing is bloated and arbitrary because scenes don't influence one another. Lastly, the imagery is drab due to needlessly muted colors and plain framing. The solid music, impressive cast, and meaningful sound can only go so far. Overall, The Secrets of Dumbledore might please some, but is unlikely to leave an impression.Writing: 5/10 Direction: 5/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Acting: 7/10 Editing: 5/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 7/10 Production Design: 6/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 6/10Overall Score: 6.3/10.",convoluted,secrets dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines redundant characters its so unfocused it doesnt have consistent tone or protagonist film centers around wizarding politics but doesnt elaborate them this shrinks potterverse satisfies nobody meanwhile redmayne laws protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying oddly no character feels essential besides grindelwald action sequences dont progress story ultimately movie is overstuffed develops nothing mikkelsen fogler excel their limited roles but theyre sparse this jumble without streamlining secrets dumbledore is emotionally uninspired technically secrets dumbledore is disappointing first effects are overdone earlier action is compelling but finale is undercut by excessive cgi plus production design that final act feels empty squandering union fantasy period dressings climax is woefully shallow furthermore editing is bloated arbitrary because scenes dont influence one another lastly imagery is drab due needlessly muted colors plain framing solid music impressive cast meaningful sound can only go so far overall secrets dumbledore might please some but is unlikely leave impression writing 5 10 direction 5 10 cinematography 6 10 acting 7 10 editing 5 10 sound 8 10 score soundtrack 7 10 production design 6 10 casting 8 10 effects 6 10overall score 6 3 10,0.49791666666666656,0.0024801587301587305,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"

5,Disappointing to the extreme,"The Harry Potter books achieved so much success because a dedicated writer thought about the story for years and the result, imperfect as it was, became beloved by millions of people as the effort showed. This film is perfect, though, a total and complete mess, written by people who can never come up with more than an elevator pitch and the crave for a big payout. The movie uses a plot that purposefully makes no sense, built on a previous film that no one remembers and manages to cement Dumbledore as a manipulative asshole whose value for humanity is that he looks nice compared to the genocidal maniacs he fights against. But he's gay, so that's fine.It gets worse, though. So many things in the film not only not make sense, but contradict lore from the books. The film is called Fantastic Beasts, but really it's just one and it doesn't do much except for the ending. The magical world of wizards is now angry, political, divided and warlike, because that's what Americans are like, obliterating the elegant traditionalist Britishness of the books. Magic is only used to show off, fight or destroy now.The more I think about it, the angrier I become, which is not really what I want or need. My advice is to skip this film completely. Too bad, too, because Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Dan Fogler and Mads Mikkelsen did a great job as actors. Alas, the material they had to work with was utter garbage.",disappointing extreme,harry potter books achieved so much success because dedicated writer thought about story years result imperfect as it was became beloved by millions people as effort showed this film is perfect though total complete mess written by people who can never come up with more than elevator pitch crave big payout movie uses plot that purposefully makes no sense built previous film that no one remembers manages cement dumbledore as manipulative asshole whose value humanity is that he looks nice compared genocidal maniacs he fights against but hes gay so thats fine it gets worse though so many things film not only not make sense but contradict lore books film is called fantastic beasts but really its just one it doesnt do much except ending magical world wizards is now angry political divided warlike because thats what americans are like obliterating elegant traditionalist britishness books magic is only used show off fight or destroy now more i think about it angrier i become which is not really what i want or need my advice is skip this film completely too bad too because eddie redmayne jude law dan fogler mads mikkelsen did great job as actors alas material they had work with was utter garbage,0.6144607843137254,0.14313725490196078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.22}"

4,The magic fizzled and was replaced by a political drama...,"Having recent sat through the two previous movies, I was looking forward to getting to see the third movie in the franchise titled ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"". I must admit that I was having some expectations to writer Steve Kloves and author J. K. Rowling.I must say that this 2022 movie ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"" from director David Yates was a swing and a miss, and it was a major step backwards for the franchise.First of all, the movie was lacking Johnny Depp, let's just be honest here, the role of Grindelwald could not be played by any other actor. And while I do admit my fellow countryman Mads Mikkelsen and his acting skill, then he just couldn't fill out the shoes left by Depp.And secondly, the storyline went from being a magical storyline about wizards and strange creatures to a hardcore politcal drama. I just stopped and got off the train here, because I had lost all interest in the turn of change in the storyline, as I have zero interest in political dramas. And that was exactly what ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"" had turned into; a political drama. Long gone was the appeal of wizards, magic, fantastic beasts and a good old fashioned fairy tale.Visually then ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"" was a good movie, of course it was. Just as the previous two movies were. The CGI and special effects in the 2022 movie are great and visually impressive, and definitely add a lot of flavor to the movie.The cast ensemble in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"" was good, and it was definitely nice to have lots of returning actors and actresses come back to reprise their characters and roles. And while Mads Mikkelsen is a good actor and certainly put on a good performance in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"", then he just was no Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was sorely missed from the movie, as he alone embodied the Grindelwald character.I was rather disappointed with what director David Yates delivered here. But I had not expected the movie to become a political drama. And I ended up walking out on the movie with just 20 minutes left to the end.My rating of ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",magic fizzled was replaced by political drama,having recent sat through two previous movies i was looking forward getting see third movie franchise titled fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore i must admit that i was having some expectations writer steve kloves author j k rowling i must say that this 2022 movie fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore director david yates was swing miss it was major step backwards franchise first all movie was lacking johnny depp lets just be honest here role grindelwald could not be played by any other actor while i do admit my fellow countryman mads mikkelsen his acting skill then he just couldnt fill out shoes left by depp secondly storyline went being magical storyline about wizards strange creatures hardcore politcal drama i just stopped got off train here because i had lost all interest turn change storyline as i have zero interest political dramas that was exactly what fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore had turned into political drama long gone was appeal wizards magic fantastic beasts good old fashioned fairy tale visually then fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore was good movie course it was just as previous two movies were cgi special effects 2022 movie are great visually impressive definitely add lot flavor movie cast ensemble fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore was good it was definitely nice have lots returning actors actresses come back reprise their characters roles while mads mikkelsen is good actor certainly put good performance fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore then he just was no johnny depp johnny depp was sorely missed movie as he alone embodied grindelwald character i was rather disappointed with what director david yates delivered here but i had not expected movie become political drama i ended up walking out movie with just 20 minutes left end my rating fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore lands four out ten stars,0.48584093211752793,0.23777862208713266,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"

6,"Still lacking a certain magic, the newest Fantastic Beasts is a step back in the right direction","In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.Becoming less and less about the titular beasts that started this Eddie Redmayne lead adventure all the way back in 2016 and more about trying to draw in extra audience engagement and enthusiasm by bringing back known staples such as Hogwarts and a much more prevalent Albus Dumbledore into this latest outing, you can see the battle raging between Fantastic Beasts trying to figure out exactly what it is and who its for and its a battle that isn't won clearly by the conclusion of this third outing, making it a sometimes frustratingly cold experience that still manages to entertain to decent degree.Without a clear identity or even a character we can truly call our own, with Redmayne's Newt Scamander getting to do his awkward shtick here once more but feeling more like a bystander to whats going on around him, with new addition Mads Mikkelsen's Grindelwald growing in power and his old acquaintance Dumbledore trying to assemble a crack team to help thwart his plans, Fantastic Beasts is hamstrung by its inability to focus its attention into a specific story arc or character journey, with its drab grey and gloomy sets, dark themes and heavy topics feeling rather unmagical for a film that potentially could've finally shed the shackles of past expectations to really let fly with some inventiveness and spark.There are snippets of such things here, a prison escape and some brief moments spent back in the halls of Hogwarts but for a majority of the films two hour plus runtime there's not a whole lot of memorable moments delivered in Yates film, which is by no means offensively bad or incoherent like much of Crimes of Grindelwald was but it still makes you wish someone could take hold of this property and turn it into the possibly great series it could be, something that is unlikely now with two films left to come.While not inspiring much jaw-dropping or magical chills, there's still an undeniable cinematic goodness to Rowling's magic filled universe and there is a feeling here that with Dumbledore building his ragtag group of foot soldiers and with Mikkelsen giving Grindelwald a significant amount of menace and unnerving energy, there's hope yet still that the final chapters of Rowling's mid-tier and seemingly unloved property can still work to a level that will ensure we walk away from the Fantastic Beasts series indifferent in ways but not upset at what's been done to our beloved world of wizards, witches and muggles (and the odd beast or two).Final Say -Still far removed from even the lesser of the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a small step back in the right direction following the crimes of the last entry and while its still not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination, its a passable diversion of anyone with a passing interest in the Harry Potter cannon.3 crab walks out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",still lacking certain magic newest

fantastic beasts trying figure out exactly what it is who its its battle that isnt won clearly by conclusion this third outing making it sometimes frustratingly cold experience that still manages entertain decent degree without clear identity or even character we can truly call our own with redmaynes newt scamander getting do his awkward shtick here once more but feeling more like bystander whats going around him with new addition mads mikkelsens grindelwald growing power his old acquaintance dumbledore trying assemble crack team help thwart his plans fantastic beasts is hamstrung by its inability focus its attention into specific story arc or character journey with its drab grey gloomy sets dark themes heavy topics feeling rather unmagical film that potentially couldve finally shed shackles past expectations really let fly with some inventiveness spark there are snippets such things here prison escape some brief moments spent back halls hogwarts but majority films two hour plus runtime theres not whole lot memorable moments delivered yates film which is by no means offensively bad or incoherent like much crimes grindelwald was but it still makes you wish someone could take hold this property turn it into possibly great series it could be something that is unlikely now with two films left come while not inspiring much jaw dropping or magical chills theres still undeniable cinematic goodness rowlings magic filled universe there is feeling here that with dumbledore building his ragtag group foot soldiers with mikkelsen giving grindelwald significant amount menace unnerving energy theres hope yet still that final chapters rowlings mid tier seemingly unloved property can still work level that will ensure we walk away fantastic beasts series indifferent ways but not upset at whats been done our beloved world wizards witches muggles odd beast or two final say still far removed even lesser harry potter films fantastic beasts secrets dumbledore is small

6,Its not about Fantastic Beasts Anymore,"The Fantastic Beast Movies should have been about Newt Scamander and friends going on wild and crazy adventures where they run into or face numerous mythical beasts. Imagine Newt interacting with an infant Fluffy (from HP Sorcerers Stone) or taming a Hungarian Horntail. Unfortunately, the fantastic beasts are overshadowed by the Dumbledore VS Grindelwald conflict. However, the film contained stunning visuals and great character performances; but lacked the tension and pizzaz required for a final battle. Worth a watch but falls short with the fantastic beasts being cast aside for a plot that does not entirely deliver.",its not about fantastic beasts anymore,fantastic beast movies should have been about newt scamander friends going wild crazy adventures where they run into or face numerous mythical beasts imagine newt interacting with infant fluffy hp sorcerers stone or taming hungarian horntail unfortunately fantastic beasts are overshadowed by dumbledore vs grindelwald conflict however film contained stunning visuals great character performances but lacked tension pizzaz required final battle worth watch but falls short with fantastic beasts being cast aside plot that does not entirely deliver,0.6839285714285716,0.17857142857142858,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.26}"

6,The lack of intensity in the action scenes made this movie rather forgettable than rewatchable,"Was the third installment in the Fantastic Beast ""universe"" a succes?Well, the main storyline was okey but the rest of it was kinda unimportant and not that interesting.. Also like i had with the previous two installments was the lack of intensity and emotions in the action scenes.And after 3 completed movie i still can't find my connection with most of the characters especially the main one's.The ""recasting"" of Johnny Depp was a huge mistake for the development of Grindelwald's character!One of the outstanding parts were the CGi and special effects so enjoyable and well created.Also the Harry Potter references were nice, lovely and not overdone It's a overall good movie but not one to rewatch weekly like the other two, it's pretty predictable with more forgettable moments than remembered once's.I really wanted to like it more but it just didn't really worked out for me...",lack intensity action scenes made this movie rather forgettable than rewatchable,was third installment fantastic beast universe succes well main storyline was okey but rest it was kinda unimportant not that interesting also like i had with previous two installments was lack intensity emotions action scenes after 3 completed movie i still cant find my connection with most characters especially main ones recasting johnny depp was huge mistake development grindelwalds character one outstanding parts were cgi special effects so enjoyable well created also harry potter references were nice lovely not overdone its overall good movie but not one rewatch weekly like other two its pretty predictable with more forgettable moments than remembered onces i really wanted like it more but it just didnt really worked out me,0.5106701940035273,0.2005731922398589,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.46}"

5,A gathering of missed opportunities,"A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service. Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.Instead of focusing on Newt, Dumbledore or Grindelwald the writers included screentime filling action for a number of side characters that does not influence the outcome at all. This only prevents the main story from progressing and (apart from the admittedly hilarious sidekick Kowalski) creates passages that you just have to endure.Plus the faceless army of Grindelwald's followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger to the heroes. They get shot down like puppets in a 15:1 strength ratio, are knocked out by Quidditch balls that wouldn't even cause a twelve-year-old any problems (see Harry Potter Part 2) and get beaten up by a Muggle with a suitcase.The whole ""we meet at Hogwarts to make a plan to save the world""-scene could have been replaced by a simple letter and wasn't any more than an excuse to include the castle in the trailer.",gathering missed opportunities,movie with some solid ideas character development promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself meaningless subplots ridicoulus moments mere fan service overall movie ended up being visually impressive gathering missed opportunities instead focusing newt dumbledore or grindelwald writers included screentime filling action number side characters that does not influence outcome at all this only prevents main story progressing apart admittedly hilarious sidekick kowalski creates passages that you just have endure plus faceless army grindelwalds followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger heroes they get shot down like puppets 15 1 strength ratio are knocked out by quidditch balls that wouldnt even cause twelve year old any problems see harry potter part 2 get beaten up by muggle with suitcase whole we meet at hogwarts make plan save world scene could have been replaced by simple letter wasnt any more than excuse include castle trailer,0.40480158730158733,0.055555555555555546,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.04, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.56}"

3,How disenchanting,"It is nothing short of magical... as to how they pulled this rubbish off. Pretty bad only augmented by the fact that this series is over. (Wand salute!)
