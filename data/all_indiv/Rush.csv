9.0,Was really surprised by how good this was,"Despite not being an auto racing fan, the stories of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and Lauda's accident are well known and on research was big news in the 70s. 'Rush' did seem intriguing, Ron Howard has done some good work in the past and my sister and her boyfriend absolutely raving about it. However having no knowledge of auto racing and having never found it my cup of tea there was a touch of intrepidation. As well as the worry as to whether there was going to be any bias and whether it was going to stray from the facts. After watching 'Rush', this viewer is so glad that she gave it a chance because it was a gripping and entertaining film from start to finish, and quite easily Howard's best work in some time.Some occasional rushed pacing and some weak dialogue, that lacked flow, sounded awkward and stuck out like a sore thumb against everything else that was done to such a professional level, were the only drawbacks to overall one of 2013's better films. The time period is very evocatively depicted, there is a real sense of time and place, there is wonderful vibrant colour throughout, the editing is slick, clever and gives the race scenes the thrills they need and the photography is similarly audaciously slick and like the cinematographer was part of the action itself, especially good in the climactic Japanese race sequence. Hans Zimmer's score is not his best work by all means, but it went with the racing theme remarkably well and does capture the mid-70s time period and the atmosphere of the sport to such great effect (again the final race in Japan stood out). The sound effects also help, having a real authenticity.For a film about auto racing, one does have to talk about how 'Rush' deals with the race sequences. The good news is that they are absolutely thrilling and keeps one to the edge of their seat, while all of them are brilliantly done, showing how glamorous and also dangerous the sport is (not many sports films I've seen have properly and fully captured the spirit of the sport it's portraying in the way Rush did) the highlight is the climactic Japanese race, which was both exhilarating and moving (masterful if having to sum it up in one word). Howard not only depicts the mid- 70s as if the viewer were transported back in time and part of the period (such was the evocativeness of the atmosphere) and adopts a visual style that never looks cheap and as said like the cinematographer was there part of the action, but he shows here that he knows how to tell a story. The storytelling is always compelling, thoughtful, informative and thrilling with a surprising amount of emotional impact, found myself really identifying with Lauda.The film is faithful to the facts, the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is genuinely engaging and are shown a lot of respect and dimension here. Neirher Hunt or Lauda are one-dimensional here and, although Lauda is the more sympathetically drawn of the two, one does not takes sides with one or the other. It also is tightly paced and assured, never getting bogged down in too much back story, too much soap- opera, too much sentimentality or technical jargon/minutiae (that would likely have gone over the heads of first-time viewers or non-fans of the sport). All the supporting performances are well-done, though some with not much to do, with Olivia Wilde and Christian McKay faring the strongest. It is however the two leads that carry 'Rush' cast wise, both of them as close to perfect as one can get. Daniel Br√ºhl gives Niki Lauda a real brooding intensity and genuine poignancy, making it very easy to feel sorry for him, while swaggering Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Hunt.All in all, a gripping and hugely entertaining film. Has its imperfections but they are far outweighed by the number of things 'Rush' does right. 9/10 Bethany Cox",was really surprised by how good this was,despite not being auto racing fan stories rivalry between james hunt niki lauda laudas accident are well known research was big news 70s rush did seem intriguing ron howard has done some good work past my sister her boyfriend absolutely raving about it however having no knowledge auto racing having never found it my cup tea there was touch intrepidation as well as worry as whether there was going be any bias whether it was going stray facts after watching rush this viewer is so glad that she gave it chance because it was gripping entertaining film start finish quite easily howards best work some time some occasional rushed pacing some weak dialogue that lacked flow sounded awkward stuck out like sore thumb against everything else that was done such professional level were only drawbacks overall one 2013s better films time period is very evocatively depicted there is real sense time place there is wonderful vibrant colour throughout editing is slick clever gives race scenes thrills they need photography is similarly audaciously slick like cinematographer was part action itself especially good climactic japanese race sequence hans zimmers score is not his best work by all means but it went with racing theme remarkably well does capture mid 70s time period atmosphere sport such great effect again final race japan stood out sound effects also help having real authenticity film about auto racing one does have talk about how rush deals with race sequences good news is that they are absolutely thrilling keeps one edge their seat while all them are brilliantly done showing how glamorous also dangerous sport is not many sports films ive seen have properly fully captured spirit sport its portraying way rush did highlight is climactic japanese race which was both exhilarating moving masterful if having sum it up one word howard not only depicts mid 70s as if viewer were transported back time part period such was evocativeness atmosphere adopts visual style that never looks cheap as said like cinematographer was there part action but he shows here that he knows how tell story storytelling is always compelling thoughtful informative thrilling with surprising amount emotional impact found myself really identifying with lauda film is faithful facts rivalry between hunt lauda is genuinely engaging are shown lot respect dimension here neirher hunt or lauda are one dimensional here although lauda is more sympathetically drawn two one does not takes sides with one or other it also is tightly paced assured never getting bogged down too much back story too much soap opera too much sentimentality or technical jargon minutiae that would likely have gone over heads first time viewers or non fans sport all supporting performances are well done though some with not much do with olivia wilde christian mckay faring strongest it is however two leads that carry rush cast wise both them as close perfect as one can get daniel br hl gives niki lauda real brooding intensity genuine poignancy making it very easy feel sorry him while swaggering chris hemsworth has never been better as hunt all all gripping hugely entertaining film has its imperfections but they are far outweighed by number things rush does right 9 10 bethany cox,0.5191798941798945,0.2313975551906586,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Thrilling character study,"As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that), but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented these men were at driving these ""coffins on wheels"", every race could spell out death. Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired, dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent. His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical, and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain. But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed, but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976 Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames, and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred and bandaged. Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful, critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing personalities coming together on the world stage. Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of sport.",thrilling character study,as asif kapadias gripping extremely moving 2010 documentary senna proved cinema audiences have thirst larger than life characters that inhabit formula one track sport itself is frightfully dull although im sure plenty will disagree with that but sportsmen willing lay down their life kick trophy are infinitely more fascinating especially days lax safety rules sport nowadays is little more than advertising wheels but when likes james hunt niki lauda battled it out track epic rivalries were created no matter how talented these men were at driving these coffins wheels every race could spell out death rush portrays clash two opposing personalities long haired dashing englishman james hunt chris hemsworth was all about adrenaline embracing post race parties lying with many women that would throw themselves at him he was reckless willing risk his life others order win but as described film there was no better driver world terms raw talent his rival austrian niki lauda daniel bruhl was focused clinical even helped design cars he would drive he was early night type rat faced cold every sense hes perfect villain but where rush succeeds most is challenging our early conceptions these two characters theres little fun be had with lauda but played by bruhl he evolves into underdog movie perhaps only one that actually gives damn about his own life life his opponents this naturally leads tragedy particularly wince inducing scene which lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed but its at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean each other as lauda watches hunt claw back some points 1976 formula one season it becomes clear that these two need each other survive their hatred one another only serves fuel flames leads laudas defiant early return drivers seat scarred bandaged fast cars beautiful women exotic locations hardly sounds like recognisable workload ron howard one most play it easy directors out there his past films have been unjustifiably successful critically commercially never stamping recognisable directorial trait onto his work yet here although bright sheen 70s initially takes some getting used he has managed create world that is very much alive using snappy editing pumping soundtrack some growing sound design re create this world petrol heads but he doesnt neglect his characters evokes great work done frost nixon 2008 which was also study two giant clashing personalities coming together world stage rush is exhilarating experience able distinguish each race next literally putting us drivers seat with use digital cameras although it occasionally drifts into formulaic territory with introduction wives played by oivia wilde alexandra maria lara respectively howard cleverly uses this as insight into hunt laudas personalities hemsworth is very good his first proper post thor role but it is bruhl that you take away film how he gets you initially loath him only be cheering him at climax is work great actor its crime that he has been snubbed by academy this year hopefully this will inspire host decent sports movies as rush proves that you can mix character study even existential musings with thrill sport,0.5362407599907602,0.21163750288750285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,Bound to win Academy Award nominations - and rightly so,"In 1976, the rivalry between two brilliant racing car drivers, the British James Hunt and the Austrian Nikki Lauda, came to a head in the almost literally life-and-death struggle of the Formula One championship. American director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Frost/Nixon"") and British scriptwriter Peter Morgan (both play and screenplay of ""Frost/Nixon"") have done a terrific job bringing the titanic struggle to the big screen, aided by some excellent casting and powerful sound and cinematography. Those were the days when most years a couple of drivers would be killed, so the stakes could not be higher.Sensibly the car racing does not over-dominate, since this is essentially a character- driven conflict, but when the racing is on screen - notably in the final race - the excitement is visceral. The Australian Chris Hemsworth (previously best known as ""Thor"") and the Spanish-born German Daniel Br√ºhl (""Inglourious Basterds"") are so good as the British and Austrian drivers respectively that the dialect coaches should receive a special commendation. Arguably Br√ºhl gives the stronger performance which should auger well for his future career.A great strength of this tale is that there is not a hero or a villain. Both drivers had privileged backgrounds and were superbly talented, but both were flawed. although in very contrasting ways, including styles of thinking, driving and womanising (Olivia Wilde as model Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as aristocratic Marlene Knaus respectively).I never saw the recent film ""Senna"" (2010) so ""Rush"" reminded me most of the much older ""Grand Prix"" (1966), but what is stunning about ""Rush"" is that it all happened. A season of the fastest sport in the world decided in the last race by one point - you couldn't make it up.

,"A Gripping, Adrenaline-Ridden Fuel Ride From Howard","Just come out the cinema in York from watching Rush! Oh my god! One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Br√ºhl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish.

They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat.

7.0,Quite good.,"I enjoyed ""Rush"", as have a ton of other people. As of today, it's #142 on IMDb and it was nominated for Best Picture. While my score of 7.0 is slightly less than the current 8.3, I was glad I saw this film.I was surprised because I thought the film would be very much like the classic race films ""Le Mans"" and ""Grand Prix""--two 1960s films about Formula 1 racing. However, it was very different. These older films focused on the driving itself--and both had amazing camera-work. Additionally, the films seemed much like watching the races yourself (particularly ""Le Mans""). However, both films were a bit light on plot. ""Rush"", on the other hand, had surprisingly little (and slightly underwhelming) race scenes--mostly because this was NOT the focus of the movie. Instead, it was more of a character study of the two drivers, Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How the men were similar and how they were significantly different is the focus of the film.The acting was very good and the film engaging. I could say more but, frankly, the film's been out for some time and it already has more than 350 reviews, so I'll just wrap it up now.PLEASE NOTE: The scenes after the 'big crash' are very hard to watch--particularly those in the hospital. This along with the crudeness of the language and brief nudity make this a film you might not want to show to your kids.",quite good,i enjoyed rush as have ton other people as today its imdb it was nominated best picture while my score 7 0 is slightly less than current 8 3 i was glad i saw this film i was surprised because i thought film would be very much like classic race films le mans grand prix two 1960s films about formula 1 racing however it was very different these older films focused driving itself both had amazing camera work additionally films seemed much like watching races yourself particularly le mans however both films were bit light plot rush other hand had surprisingly little slightly underwhelming race scenes mostly because this was not focus movie instead it was more character study two drivers niki lauda james hunt how men were similar how they were significantly different is focus film acting was very good film engaging i could say more but frankly films been out some time it already has more than 350 reviews so ill just wrap it up now please note scenes after big crash are very hard watch particularly those hospital this along with crudeness language brief nudity make this film you might not want show your kids,0.500220588235294,0.20843137254901964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,What's This? A Ron Howard Movie That Isn't Intolerable?,"I never thought I would ever watch a Ron Howard movie again much less write a good review of one.Howard hasn't made a movie since ""Parenthood"" that has not bored me to tears and almost angered me with its pedestrian refusal to take any risks. He's turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg's technical panache.However, the great reviews of ""Rush"" and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It's a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don't need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don't) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don't expect it to push any boundaries, but it's much more technically daring than anything else he's made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver's seat more than once.Grade: A-",whats this ron howard movie that isnt intolerable,i never thought i would ever watch ron howard movie again much less write good review one howard hasnt made movie since parenthood that has not bored me tears almost angered me with its pedestrian refusal take any risks hes turned into lesser version steven spielberg his films are just as maudlin emotionally manipulative but they lack spielbergs technical panache however great reviews rush awards attention that swirled briefly around daniel bruhl got my butt seat it i was surprised by actually liking it its lean mean telling intense rivalry between race car drivers james hunt niki lauda you dont need care much about race car driving i certainly dont enjoy story particularly that lauda who overcame devastating accident return track bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at time chris hemsworth as hunt is serviceable if nothing special this is still ron howard film so dont expect it push any boundaries but its much more technically daring than anything else hes made cinematography editing putting audience drivers seat more than once grade,0.5397256728778468,0.12430124223602483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.19}"

10.0,Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt? Really??!,"Really. His performance in Rush came as a huge surprise. This is his best performance by quite some margin, a role which he plays with a great deal of maturity and respect. He plays Hunt with just the right level of arrogance, cockiness, confidence and audacity to convince you that he was real life 70's playboy James Hunt, a man destined to live fast and die young.Bruhl is superb as Niki too. It's a role that he deserves much recognition for, particularly his accent and mannerisms. Lauda was one of the first of a new generation of professional driver, driving the old playboy characters out of the sport and Bruhl nails this icy determination to succeed magnificently. A particular nod goes to Christian McKay's portrayal as the slightly eccentric, petrol head extraordinaire, ever so aristocratic but hopelessly financially incompetent Lord Hesketh. The camera work is spectacular, none less so than with some very creative angles of the beautifully filmed on track action. The brief in-helmet camera shots are inspired, giving you a glimpse of the drivers world. CGI work will be spotted by the keen eyed, but you have to consider that without it that there are certain scenes involving priceless period machinery (the sound of a Cosworth DFV firing up and filling the cinema was worth the ticket price alone) that would be just impossible to film as accurately as they were depicted here with real machinery. As a result, they are able to use the CGI sparingly and to good effect.The main facts of the 1976 season are on the whole handled very accurately. Certainly, some liberties are taken with poetic licence, but this is still a scripted film and not a documentary. The factually heavy writing of the script along with beautifully filmed and liberal use of period machinery being recorded at pace on real asphalt will be enough to keep the fans of the sport well represented.It's a gripping telling of the 1976 Formula 1 season, which whilst not sharing the same shear spectacle of Howard's other 'too unbelievable to be true' film Apollo 13, Rush tells a story which would be just too unbelievable in terms of human bravery and personal destiny for any fictional story to be given credence. It's a tale which will be enough to hold the unfamiliar or casual viewer's attention with a steel firm grip to see how the different personalities handle the pressures of life both on and off the track and how rising to the top takes it's tole on these two polar opposite real life gladiators of the race track.With the lead actors clearly committed to giving their best performances yet and a tastefully handled script, Ron Howard delivers a visually impressive account of events that may well become one of his most respected directorial efforts yet.10/10",chris hemsworth as james hunt really,really his performance rush came as huge surprise this is his best performance by quite some margin role which he plays with great deal maturity respect he plays hunt with just right level arrogance cockiness confidence audacity convince you that he was real life 70s playboy james hunt man destined live fast die young bruhl is superb as niki too its role that he deserves much recognition particularly his accent mannerisms lauda was one first new generation professional driver driving old playboy characters out sport bruhl nails this icy determination succeed magnificently particular nod goes christian mckays portrayal as slightly eccentric petrol head extraordinaire ever so aristocratic but hopelessly financially incompetent lord hesketh camera work is spectacular none less so than with some very creative angles beautifully filmed track action brief helmet camera shots are inspired giving you glimpse drivers world cgi work will be spotted by keen eyed but you have consider that without it that there are certain scenes involving priceless period machinery sound cosworth dfv firing up filling cinema was worth ticket price alone that would be just impossible film as accurately as they were depicted here with real machinery as result they are able use cgi sparingly good effect main facts 1976 season are whole handled very accurately certainly some liberties are taken with poetic licence but this is still scripted film not documentary factually heavy writing script along with beautifully filmed liberal use period machinery being recorded at pace real asphalt will be enough keep fans sport well represented its gripping telling 1976 formula 1 season which whilst not sharing same shear spectacle howards other too unbelievable be true film apollo 13 rush tells story which would be just too unbelievable terms human bravery personal destiny any fictional story be given credence its tale which will be enough hold unfamiliar or casual viewers attention with steel firm grip see how different personalities handle pressures life both off track how rising top takes its tole these two polar opposite real life gladiators race track with lead actors clearly committed giving their best performances yet tastefully handled script ron howard delivers visually impressive account events that may well become one his most respected directorial efforts yet 10 10,0.48168863964318515,0.22152039879312602,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.52}"
9.0,Well worth the wait!,"The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian ""professor"" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail ‚Äì although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then ‚Äì and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here ‚Äì the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame ‚Äì only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt ‚Äì Lord Hesketh, ""Bubbles"" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame ‚Äì as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film ""feels"" like it's happening in the 70's. For anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you.",well worth wait,film is just over 2 hours long but when it was over it seemed like i had been cinema about 30 minutes film centres battle 1976 formula 1 world championship rivalry between austrian professor nikki lauda british playboy james hunt two are depicted as enemies but actual fact they were good friends who trusted respected each other as well as off track this bit artistic licence does not spoil film is reasonable order make battle between two f1 crown more intense film is nicely paced we are introduced both characters through their own narrative scenes that leave watcher no doubt as their background philosophy life two are first seen competition 1970 at formula 3 race at crystal palace where they have coming together sets scene rivalry throughout film im not sure if this is further artistic licence two definitely did race each other f3 but i am not convinced as whether this actual incident occurred after that we are given whistle stop journey between 1973 when hunt came into f1 1975 we are shown dangerous nature f1 at time with francois cevert accident at watkins glen gory detail although this does not seem like gratuitous but necessary bring home just how unforgiving sport was back then it truly was top 12 points scorers 1976 f1 cars were claim 3 1 ended up wheelchair 1 had his career ended by leg crunching crash we are then taken 1976 that titanic struggle world crown only one real issue here british grand prix result but i suspect this was simplified interests time casting is superb chris hemsworth aussie does excellent job public schoolboy james hunt while daniel bruhl both sounds looks frighteningly like austrian there is little room supporting cast amongst drivers which is shame only clay regazzoni has part any real substance peterson watson depailler scheckter andretti et al could have featured little more i think what did their contemporaries think two protagonists supporting cast is mainly required hunt lord hesketh bubbles horsley teddy mayer tyler alexander mclaren while ferrari team principals are rarely seen love angle is perfectly catered by olivia wilde hunts first wife suzy gorgeous alexandra maria lara downfall fame as future marlene lauda both give quality performances attention detail is superb although tracks are not actual ones understandable reasons cars helmets sponsors are all authentic film feels like its happening 70s anyone interested great personal stories f1 70s cars or just like see great film then rush is you,0.5854423868312758,0.2158950617283951,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8.0,"A dazzling story of F1, rivalry, respect & cheating death.","Those who have seen the trailer will know that Rush is the 'Formula 1 film'. The presence of Ron Howard's and Chris Hemsworth's names above the title may put some bums on seats but the fact of it being a film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers.So stop right there. Rush is not a movie about motor racing for speed fans any more than Titanic was about sailing for merchant seamen. Rush is a superbly shot, directed, edited and performed film that transcends the sport of motor racing, just as the principal protagonists themselves did almost forty years ago.The rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br√ºhl) is common knowledge. Just a couple of minutes trawling through Google's gifts will tell you how many championships each driver won, how they met, how they sparred, how they lived and (nearly) died¬Ö Rush isn't a film that tells you their story. Rush is the film that takes you into their world and shows you how that story unfolded in all its fast, crazy, riotous, dazzling, cynical, brash excess. By the end you may still not want to be an F1 driver or even watch a grand prix, but you sure as hell will wish you could have been there for at least some of the 70s.Howard has provided us with a mixed bag of films over the years with schmaltzy, flicks (A Beautiful Mind), thoughtful biopics (Frost/Nixon), compelling dramas (Apollo 13) and utter twaddle (Angels and Demons). So which category would Rush fall into? The tension Howard creates is ridiculous. Pistons pump, colours blur, the scream of engines deafen us. The editing is so tight it feels as though something will snap. The anticipation prickles the skin and, though we already know what and when, it is almost too much for us to watch it unfold. Technically, Rush verges on exquisite. The digital creation blends flawlessly with the live action and the skids, tumbles, crashes and explosions are horrifying.But it isn't just with the speed and madness around the track where Howard guides perfectly. The hospital scenes when Lauda is treated are almost grotesque. We find ourselves shying away from the visuals, involuntarily grimacing at Lauda's agony even when he demands more pain in order to drive him towards recovery and revenge.Rush boasts one of the finest film scores of the year so far with Hans Zimmer proving why he is among the busiest composers in Hollywood. It's not that the score that makes the film, but it enhances it beautifully, adding emotional colour to the startling visuals to magnify the tension.The joint leads are on impeccable form. Hemsworth portrays Hunt as the playboy we wish we could be (or bed) and his charisma doesn't ooze, it gushes. He is arrogant, cocksure, charming and handsome. He makes it obvious why men wanted Hunt's life and so many women welcomed him into theirs. It is a confident, full performance from Hemsworth that marks him out yet again as an actor with a certain chameleon-like quality and undeniable star power. Immediately we like Hunt but as 123 minutes rush by, he evolves into a flawed man we admire but ultimately decide we don't really want to be and, in some ways, pity. It's a fine performance that engages us on every level.When Br√ºhl's (The Edukators, Inglorious Basterds) Lauda strides onto the screen, it is with purpose, his Austrian directness and confidence taken as conceit and arrogance. He does not suffer fools (or almost anyone else) whether they are subordinates, rivals or the men paying for his drive. Supremely confident to the exclusion of social niceties, the Lauda we observe puts our backs up immediately but, just as the Hunt on screen evolves, so, too, does Lauda and by the film's end our allegiance has wavered. It is a sensitive performance from Br√ºhl and his understanding of the man he portrays and clear admiration for him infects us thoroughly.Some of the dialogue is lumpy, there are numerous liberties taken with the truth (though not to the extent that U571 completely rewrote history!) and much is glossed over. Howard has perhaps tried too hard to appeal to a mass audience by focusing on the principal women in the drivers' lives, notably Hunt's wife, Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and Br√ºhl's, Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). In Marlene's case, she is relatively impactful on her husband's life, suffering through his accident with him. In Suzy's case, however, though she was influential on a period of Hunt's career, it is difficult to see her as anything other than a bystander in his life and yet Howard sees fit to return to her though she is far from his thoughts.These are minor quibbles that make Rush a very good film instead of a 'great'. Nevertheless, my companion for the film who has no interest in motor racing and less knowledge gave a simple summary: ""Excellent."" Me? I'm a fair weather F1 fan. If there is a realistic hope of Button, Hamilton and Di Resta winning or there's been enough hype, I'm there. Otherwise it's Formula what? But, as I wrote, Rush transcends the sport. I was gripped throughout, I gritted my teeth, I gasped, clenched my buttocks and willed the drivers to the finish, on the track, in the hospital and in life.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",dazzling story f1 rivalry respect cheating death,those who have seen trailer will know that rush is formula 1 film presence ron howards chris hemsworths names above title may put some bums seats but fact it being film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers so stop right there rush is not movie about motor racing speed fans any more than titanic was about sailing merchant seamen rush is superbly shot directed edited performed film that transcends sport motor racing just as principal protagonists themselves did almost forty years ago rivalry between f1 drivers james hunt hemsworth niki lauda daniel br hl is common knowledge just couple minutes trawling through googles gifts will tell you how many championships each driver won how they met how they sparred how they lived nearly died rush isnt film that tells you their story rush is film that takes you into their world shows you how that story unfolded all its fast crazy riotous dazzling cynical brash excess by end you may still not want be f1 driver or even watch grand prix but you sure as hell will wish you could have been there at least some 70s howard has provided us with mixed bag films over years with schmaltzy flicks beautiful mind thoughtful biopics frost nixon compelling dramas apollo 13 utter twaddle angels demons so which category would rush fall into tension howard creates is ridiculous pistons pump colours blur scream engines deafen us editing is so tight it feels as though something will snap anticipation prickles skin though we already know what when it is almost too much us watch it unfold technically rush verges exquisite digital creation blends flawlessly with live action skids tumbles crashes explosions are horrifying but it isnt just with speed madness around track where howard guides perfectly hospital scenes when lauda is treated are almost grotesque we find ourselves shying away visuals involuntarily grimacing at laudas agony even when he demands more pain order drive him towards recovery revenge rush boasts one finest film scores year so far with hans zimmer proving why he is among busiest composers hollywood its not that score that makes film but it enhances it beautifully adding emotional colour startling visuals magnify tension joint leads are impeccable form hemsworth portrays hunt as playboy we wish we could be or bed his charisma doesnt ooze it gushes he is arrogant cocksure charming handsome he makes it obvious why men wanted hunts life so many women welcomed him into theirs it is confident full performance hemsworth that marks him out yet again as actor with certain chameleon like quality undeniable star power immediately we like hunt but as 123 minutes rush by he evolves into flawed man we admire but ultimately decide we dont really want be some ways pity its fine performance that engages us every level when br hls edukators inglorious basterds lauda strides onto screen it is with purpose his austrian directness confidence taken as conceit arrogance he does not suffer fools or almost anyone else whether they are subordinates rivals or men paying his drive supremely confident exclusion social niceties lauda we observe puts our backs up immediately but just as hunt screen evolves so too does lauda by films end our allegiance has wavered it is sensitive performance br hl his understanding man he portrays clear admiration him infects us thoroughly some dialogue is lumpy there are numerous liberties taken with truth though not extent that u571 completely rewrote history much is glossed over howard has perhaps tried too hard appeal mass audience by focusing principal women drivers lives notably hunts wife suzy olivia wilde br hls marlene alexandra maria lara marlenes case she is relatively impactful her husbands life suffering through his accident with him suzys case however though she was influential period hunts career it is difficult see her as anything other than bystander his life yet howard sees fit return her though she is far his thoughts these are minor quibbles that make rush very good film instead great nevertheless my companion film who has no interest motor racing less knowledge gave simple summary excellent me im fair weather f1 fan if there is realistic hope button hamilton di resta winning or theres been enough hype im there otherwise its formula what but as i wrote rush transcends sport i was gripped throughout i gritted my teeth i gasped clenched my buttocks willed drivers finish track hospital life more reviews squiss subscribe my blog like facebook page,0.6201587301587304,0.2086726260752234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,Ron Howard shows what he does best,"The true story of the rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda and the 1976 Formula One season is one of those stories where true life is more extraordinary then fiction. Fortunately two men with great experience at adapting true life stories, Ron Howard and Peter Morgan, have taken this project on, giving us a movie that is about a clash of ideals and personalities as well as about the drive of motor sports.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br√ºhl) are racing drivers with different approaches and philosophies whose rivalry starts in Formula Three racing. Hunt is a good looking playboy who enjoys drinking, partying and sex and has charisma to boot. Lauda is a serious minded, extremely determined, technically astute and is able to get the most out of a car, but is a cold, distant man who drives people away. Soon the men's rivalry see them battling it out in Formula One leading to the 1976 season where back-stabbing, danger and disaster affects the sport.As a sports movie Rush is a very well made and entertaining film that focuses on its characters ideals and differences. Hemsworth and Br√ºhl are in top form as they play these very different men. Lauda is a self- determined man who is willing to risk everything to get into F1, but easily rubs people the wrong way, whilst Hunt had a greater support network, media friendly but is a loose cannon. Both end up becoming each other's hubris as they take bigger risks in a sport that already dangerous.As well as the focus of their profession, Rush looks at the personal lifestyles of the two drivers, particularly Hunt's as he womanizes as Lauda settles down with a woman. Hunt is a thrill seeker who uses pure talent whilst Lauda is aware of the risks of his profession, but does not want to add to them.To anyone who knows about Niki Lauda is he suffers a tragedy and the easy route would have been to make Rocky style picture about someone overcoming adversity. Fortunately, Howard and Morgan made something more interesting by showing both men to be faulted, that Lauda is not a man who is easy to like, making personal digs against and being a very sore loser.At a running of two hours, three minutes, Rush moves along at a very brisk pace. The first 40 to 45 minutes focuses on a six year period as the rivalry builds up. Many story elements are dealt with quickly. A great example of this is when Hunt meets model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde, who does an impressive English accent) in the team garages and the next scene is them getting married. Rush is a movie that tackles many story elements with broad brushstrokes. It does seem like a longer cut may exist.Even though the film is called Rush, Howard and Morgan build up to the racing segments. We get a F3 race near the beginning and then we have a long wait the F1 races. Howard and Morgan focus on three main races in the 1976 season, N√ºrburgring, Germany, Monza, Italy and Fuji, Japan. Howard shows his technical acumen with the racing sequences, as we get up close to the action on screen with camera being place many on the parts of the cars, in the driving seat and even in the engine and in the air gun during a tyre change. There are intense, exciting sequences as Howard uses stylistic flashes and slo-mo as we see how dangerous races were in the 70s. Morgan also uses a similar montage trick he used in The Damned United to quickly build a picture of the '76 season with Howard using title cards to the sequence a bit of flash.The story about James Hunt or Niki Lauda could have made for a compelling movie on their own terms, but Howard and Morgan give us two films in one. Rush is a very well-made, engaging and compelling sports flick that is character driven and is about the build-up as well as the racing.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",ron howard shows what he does best,true story rivalry between f1 drivers james hunt niki lauda 1976 formula one season is one those stories where true life is more extraordinary then fiction fortunately two men with great experience at adapting true life stories ron howard peter morgan have taken this project giving us movie that is about clash ideals personalities as well as about drive motor sports james hunt chris hemsworth niki lauda daniel br hl are racing drivers with different approaches philosophies whose rivalry starts formula three racing hunt is good looking playboy who enjoys drinking partying sex has charisma boot lauda is serious minded extremely determined technically astute is able get most out car but is cold distant man who drives people away soon mens rivalry see them battling it out formula one leading 1976 season where back stabbing danger disaster affects sport as sports movie rush is very well made entertaining film that focuses its characters ideals differences hemsworth br hl are top form as they play these very different men lauda is self determined man who is willing risk everything get into f1 but easily rubs people wrong way whilst hunt had greater support network media friendly but is loose cannon both end up becoming each others hubris as they take bigger risks sport that already dangerous as well as focus their profession rush looks at personal lifestyles two drivers particularly hunts as he womanizes as lauda settles down with woman hunt is thrill seeker who uses pure talent whilst lauda is aware risks his profession but does not want add them anyone who knows about niki lauda is he suffers tragedy easy route would have been make rocky style picture about someone overcoming adversity fortunately howard morgan made something more interesting by showing both men be faulted that lauda is not man who is easy like making personal digs against being very sore loser at running two hours three minutes rush moves along at very brisk pace first 40 45 minutes focuses six year period as rivalry builds up many story elements are dealt with quickly great example this is when hunt meets model suzy miller olivia wilde who does impressive english accent team garages next scene is them getting married rush is movie that tackles many story elements with broad brushstrokes it does seem like longer cut may exist even though film is called rush howard morgan build up racing segments we get f3 race near beginning then we have long wait f1 races howard morgan focus three main races 1976 season n rburgring germany monza italy fuji japan howard shows his technical acumen with racing sequences as we get up close action screen with camera being place many parts cars driving seat even engine air gun during tyre change there are intense exciting sequences as howard uses stylistic flashes slo mo as we see how dangerous races were 70s morgan also uses similar montage trick he used damned united quickly build picture 76 season with howard using title cards sequence bit flash story about james hunt or niki lauda could have made compelling movie their own terms but howard morgan give us two films one rush is very well made engaging compelling sports flick that is character driven is about build up as well as racing please visit www entertainmentfuse com,0.5555251595040326,0.21635174293625004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Daniel Bruhl even beats Oscar bound Leonardo,Niki Lauder is among the most well known personalities in the history of Formula One. Even today millions of Germans watch his TV presentation at every race. We know his manner and speech extremely well and any actor portraying him faces an uphill if not impossible task. But Daniel Bruhl delivers a performance so wonderfully convincing in his faithful and profound portrayal that he should clearly be among the Oscar nominees for Best Actor. The story of Lauda's famous struggle with Hunt in 1976 has become the stuff of legends. And perhaps this production has used some artistic license to enhance them. But the film isn't really about the thrilling story of those events. That's just the vehicle for a much deeper drama examining the ever relevant dialectic between hedonism and pragmatism. It's about the self beneath the skin rather than the glamor of the surface: a concept normally quite alien to the Oscar awarding Hollywood elite. So poor Daniel Bruhl must await another vehicle to display his superb talents. And one day he might be remembered internationally in his career as Niki was himself.,daniel bruhl even beats oscar bound leonardo,niki lauder is among most well known personalities history formula one even today millions germans watch his tv presentation at every race we know his manner speech extremely well any actor portraying him faces uphill if not impossible task but daniel bruhl delivers performance so wonderfully convincing his faithful profound portrayal that he should clearly be among oscar nominees best actor story laudas famous struggle with hunt 1976 has become stuff legends perhaps this production has used some artistic license enhance them but film isnt really about thrilling story those events thats just vehicle much deeper drama examining ever relevant dialectic between hedonism pragmatism its about self beneath skin rather than glamor surface concept normally quite alien oscar awarding hollywood elite so poor daniel bruhl must await another vehicle display his superb talents one day he might be remembered internationally his career as niki was himself,0.6935185185185184,0.2652777777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Way more than just a Formula 1 sports film,"I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br√ºhl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.I also really like the fact that Rush is more than just a sports film about racing. It's a character study about two masters of their craft, embedded in deep rivalry. Both of them know that they stand unopposed, except for that one man, who's their polar opposite in both personality and driving style, yet who is just as capable. That's a great setting for a movie and Rush beautifully explores the possibilities given to it. You buy the rivalry and by the time of the final race I found myself at the edge of my seat, even though I already knew the outcome.It's also great how the movie never takes sides. It's not a film about Niki Lauda - even though he was involved in its making - nor is it about James Hunt. It's about them both and about the sport as a whole.To sum it up, I'd say this is the best sports movie I've seen in my life. But it's that because it's more than a simple example of its genre. It's a brilliant character study, an interesting period piece, a gripping drama and yes, at its core, a film with furiously fast cars. Highly recommended.",way more than just formula 1 sports film,i liked this film lot more than i would have anticipated sure i knew going that two main leads were both brilliant actors hemsworth especially has become recent favourite mine but they both exceeded my wildest expectations they became james hunt hemsworth niki lauda daniel br hl down smallest detail most delicate nuance 1976 racing season was before my time but even though im just casual formula 1 fan i had heard about it i knew who these two were they were such large characters such giants their chosen field that had this film not captured them perfectly it wouldnt have been half as good as it is now luckily howards directing performances these two are some finest ive seen long time i also really like fact that rush is more than just sports film about racing its character study about two masters their craft embedded deep rivalry both them know that they stand unopposed except that one man whos their polar opposite both personality driving style yet who is just as capable thats great setting movie rush beautifully explores possibilities given it you buy rivalry by time final race i found myself at edge my seat even though i already knew outcome its also great how movie never takes sides its not film about niki lauda even though he was involved its making nor is it about james hunt its about them both about sport as whole sum it up id say this is best sports movie ive seen my life but its that because its more than simple example its genre its brilliant character study interesting period piece gripping drama yes at its core film with furiously fast cars highly recommended,0.5821408221408222,0.3068905168905169,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.49}"
8.0,No better script than reality,"Originally I planned on not watching ""Rush"" at the theater, simply because I lost interest into Formula 1 considerably since the Schumacher years. However, finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a go. Which proved a pretty great choice as Ron Howard's latest movie makes for a very entertaining two hours. I was vaguely aware of the year season 1976, the developments and outcome of the driver championship and Lauda's spectacular crash of course as you get pretty much reminded here every second weekend when you see him being the co-host of current Formula One coverage. Putting Daniel Br√ºhl into perspective to what I see there, I think he nailed Lauda's character and his very own Viennese charm. Of course, it's different to compare with Lauda now being roughly 35 years older than in the movie and I was not even born the year Lauda ended his career, but I think he made a good job in portraying him. Aside from all comparisons to what Lauda was really like, he definitely created an interesting character that had your eyes glued to the screen during every scene he was in. It's not surprising Br√ºhl is in talks for his first Oscar nomination and it's nice to see him back so strongly, after I was a bit disappointed by his work in recent years, especially in ""Inglourious Basterds"" where his performance wouldn't make my top5 of the film despite having a pretty interesting character.While Br√ºhl kinda sways between lead and supporting territory, the movie's clear lead is Chris Hemsworth as Lauda's equally talented competitor James Hunt. In fact, he is around 5 years younger than Br√ºhl, but his character is slightly older. I believe Hemsworth made a couple smart career choices recently and, after thoroughly enjoying the first Thor movie, I'm pretty curious about the second, which comes out soon. His character here is a bon vivant who loves drinks, ladies and the sweet life, the polar opposite to Lauda's stubborn lone wolf. And these exact opposites are the basis of the film, the reason why it works so well as an intriguing character study of two extremes clashing. Their personalities also reflect directly on the women with them. While Olivia Wilde as Hunt's wife disappears almost as quickly as she entered the picture, Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's wife stays there till the end and we see a good portrayal from her as somebody who's attracted to the danger (their first meeting in the civilian's car), but at the same time constantly worried about her husband's well-being and powerless as she can do nothing but hope for the best.All in all, I recommend this film a lot. Really, you don't have to know anything about Formula One or racing in general in order to enjoy it for being a great character study. I haven't seen a full race either in maybe a bit less than ten years and it still felt like a compelling watch. The motorsports circus is really just the stage for the two protagonists and except very close to the end there's not that much racing action included anyway. And when there is, it always comes with an impact on the relationship between the two. But even if it's just the stage, all the scenes at the race tracks were executed very convincingly and I never thought that it's all just make-believe. They also managed to convey the aura of the Formula One from the 1970s that has sadly lost a lot of its charm by now. Howard knew that he had to make a film that appeals to the masses and Formula 1, compared to NASCAR, Indy 500 etc., has never been a sport that created too much interest in North America, which is why you don't really find American drivers participating that often either. He managed very nicely and it's a great example of a rivalry that pushed each of the rivals to the limit, often in a good way, and occasionally beyond. What I also liked about it is that it definitely ends on a positive note, possibly with the best scene of the movie with Hunt and Lauda meeting at the hangar, which sums up their relationship perfectly. Subtle criticism for the other's lifestyle, occasional mindgames, but also respect. It's always nice to go out in style as we usually tend to remember the ending more than everything that was before and, if badly executed, it can hurt the film's overall perception a lot. Not so here. Very well done as almost the entire rest of the movie.

,1976 was an exciting year in Formula One racing.,"This is a Ron Howard film of a predominantly true telling of the 1976 year of Formula One racing. Featured are the world champion from 1975, Austrian Niki Lauda, and his rival Brit James Hunt, seeking the world championship. Lauda and Hunt were quite opposites, the Austrian the focused, precise, calculating racer. It was a profession he was very good at. The Brit a flamboyant risk-taker, a womanizer who enjoyed a good drunk after a victory, and who nervously vomited before a big race.The actors chosen are excellent, with costuming and makeup resembling the real racers quite closely. The Aussie Chris Hemsworth puts on his best British accent as James Hunt, and Daniel Br√ºhl (full name ' Daniel C√©sar Mart√≠n Br√ºhl Gonz√°lez Domingo ') is authentic as Niki Lauda.This is much more than a telling of the racing season. In the hands of director Ron Howard we are treated to selective slow motion and stop action, and even POV shots of the racing engine's intake and exhaust valves at work from inside the combustion chamber. In slow motion, of course!Surely some archival footage was used, but they recreated certain racing situations very realistically. Overall the cinematography (shot digitally) and the sound track are superb. A very enjoyable movie, of two fierce competitors who gained deep respect for each other, in spite of their attempts to bury each other on the track.Their spouses were capably played by Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller Hunt and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda. Of note, Hunt died at a relatively young age of 45, but Lauda is still going strong in his 60s, as an aviation entrepreneur.June 2019 edit: Lauda died recently so I took the opportunity to watch this again. I enjoyed it almost as much now, 5 years after my first viewing.",1976 was exciting year formula one racing,this is ron howard film predominantly true telling 1976 year formula one racing featured are world champion 1975 austrian niki lauda his rival brit james hunt seeking world championship lauda hunt were quite opposites austrian focused precise calculating racer it was profession he was very good at brit flamboyant risk taker womanizer who enjoyed good drunk after victory who nervously vomited before big race actors chosen are excellent with costuming makeup resembling real racers quite closely aussie chris hemsworth puts his best british accent as james hunt daniel br hl full name daniel c sar mart n br hl gonz lez domingo is authentic as niki lauda this is much more than telling racing season hands director ron howard we are treated selective slow motion stop action even pov shots racing engines intake exhaust valves at work inside combustion chamber slow motion course surely some archival footage was used but they recreated certain racing situations very realistically overall cinematography shot digitally sound track are superb very enjoyable movie two fierce competitors who gained deep respect each other spite their attempts bury each other track their spouses were capably played by olivia wilde as suzy miller hunt alexandra maria lara as marlene lauda note hunt died at relatively young age 45 but lauda is still going strong his 60s as aviation entrepreneur june 2019 edit lauda died recently so i took opportunity watch this again i enjoyed it almost as much now 5 years after my first viewing,0.5096281179138321,0.2887891156462585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,"Well made, Well Acted, Surprisingly Good Movie","As a Cineworld Card Holder I was invited to a screening last night of Ron Howards new movie Rush.Before I start...I am not a F1 fan, but I knew enough of the history of the main protagonists to appreciate the film. The main set pieces of the film set a year before I was born in 1976, so mainly my knowledge was based on my Fathers recollection of the events. I'd seen James Hunt in interviews and recently watched footage with Niki Lauda so got an idea of the characters.The film is bang on in period, cars fashion and sets the tone excellently, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the fx are very much in keeping with the period, no ridiculous CGI.The acting, on the whole is nothing short of miraculous, Hemsworth and Bruhl are fantastic, particularly Hemsworth, who's accent, mannerisms and natural acting was a big surprise. I could see a few awards for this role. I have seen Bruhl in quite a few films and I am always impressed so this just continues the trend. All the support actors are very good in smaller roles.The film is well paced for 2 hours and quite graphic, particularly a few accident scenes.Direction: Ron Howard - nice job, I'm not a massive fan and particularly after the da vinci/Angels fiasco's a big return to decent form. The flair was there but played safe (As normal) but let the story and the actors take centre stage.If you like History in F1, a well documented rivalry and a film that capture this, watch it. It is similar to the excellent Control, Moneyball etc but with a bit of heart.8 1/2 out of 10",well made well acted surprisingly good movie,as cineworld card holder i was invited screening last night ron howards new movie rush before i start i am not f1 fan but i knew enough history main protagonists appreciate film main set pieces film set year before i was born 1976 so mainly my knowledge was based my fathers recollection events id seen james hunt interviews recently watched footage with niki lauda so got idea characters film is bang period cars fashion sets tone excellently cinematography is nothing short breathtaking fx are very much keeping with period no ridiculous cgi acting whole is nothing short miraculous hemsworth bruhl are fantastic particularly hemsworth whos accent mannerisms natural acting was big surprise i could see few awards this role i have seen bruhl quite few films i am always impressed so this just continues trend all support actors are very good smaller roles film is well paced 2 hours quite graphic particularly few accident scenes direction ron howard nice job im not massive fan particularly after da vinci angels fiascos big return decent form flair was there but played safe as normal but let story actors take centre stage if you like history f1 well documented rivalry film that capture this watch it it is similar excellent control moneyball etc but with bit heart 8 1 2 out 10,0.4728255528255528,0.23035217035217037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"

Hemsworths presentation of James Hunt is uncanny it's like a documentary he's almost as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.If your not a F1 fan or from the 70's it may not be more than a blokes film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best car racing movie ever",superb all round,having seen trailers tv set up bbc as grand prix insert i was thinking ok so ive probably seen best this its going be clunky parts or too far up its own but hey we can all be wrong ron howard has added depth story i knew well presentation has feel era colours are sometimes harsh edgy set pieces are well researched owners some classic f1 hardware must have had enjoyable time not quite so sure about insurance underwriters where story hits spot me is acting main protagonists they have life depth hemsworths presentation james hunt is uncanny its like documentary hes almost as good as daniel day lewis lincoln if your not f1 fan or 70s it may not be more than blokes film but give it go it is going end up being important as apollo 13 life mr howard quite frankly is by far best car racing movie ever,0.6161375661375662,0.3111111111111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.53}"
7.0,Couldn't get much Louda.,On of the best Grand Prix movies ever made.RUSH is a testosterone race fest. Ron Howard deserves credit for taking a redundant series of races and making them interesting and watchable. Good performances all around. The movie is elevated by an outstanding Hans Zimmer score. Excellent cinematography and ear pounding sound of engines put the viewer in the action.The hospital scenes are a bit tough for the faint of heart. The quiet face to face scene at the end between the competitors takes the movie to a higher level.This one should be seen and heard on a big screen.,couldnt get much louda,best grand prix movies ever made rush is testosterone race fest ron howard deserves credit taking redundant series races making them interesting watchable good performances all around movie is elevated by outstanding hans zimmer score excellent cinematography ear pounding sound engines put viewer action hospital scenes are bit tough faint heart quiet face face scene at end between competitors takes movie higher level this one should be seen heard big screen,0.5294444444444444,0.2707407407407407,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
8.0,Solid filmmaking from Ron Howard,"Based on the true story of the Formula 1 racing rivals brash English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and his tough methodical uncompromising opponent Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Br√ºhl) during the 1970s.Director Ron Howard has great skills to put together a top notch movie. The racing action is exciting. The 70s style looks good. I love all the cars. Everybody is great in this. I do have two minor problems. I hate most narrations and this is no exception. It is good for exposition but mostly takes the audience out of the movie. However a narration from the real Niki Lauda at the end would be great.The other problem is more basic. The movie follows both drivers equally. Although it's filled with details from both men, it's not as easy to fully commit to either men. A more traditional structure would follow one protagonist and it would be a more compelling story. My personal preference would be to follow Hunt up to the N√ºrburgring Nordschleife race. Then they could go back to Niki Lauda's story from the beginning showing the other side of the story all the way to the end. That way it would minimize the back and forth and maximize the rooting interest. Nevertheless this is a very solid thrilling movie. It's compelling and well worth the praise that it gets.",solid filmmaking ron howard,based true story formula 1 racing rivals brash english playboy james hunt chris hemsworth his tough methodical uncompromising opponent austrian driver niki lauda daniel br hl during 1970s director ron howard has great skills put together top notch movie racing action is exciting 70s style looks good i love all cars everybody is great this i do have two minor problems i hate most narrations this is no exception it is good exposition but mostly takes audience out movie however narration real niki lauda at end would be great other problem is more basic movie follows both drivers equally although its filled with details both men its not as easy fully commit either men more traditional structure would follow one protagonist it would be more compelling story my personal preference would be follow hunt up n rburgring nordschleife race then they could go back niki laudas story beginning showing other side story all way end that way it would minimize back forth maximize rooting interest nevertheless this is very solid thrilling movie its compelling well worth praise that it gets,0.4911261261261262,0.23093093093093098,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Precision craftsmanship,"When my wife and I first saw the US trailer for ""Rush,"" my wife asked me, ""Do you want to see it?"" ""Well, it IS a 'racing movie,"" I replied. I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching ""Rush,"" because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, ""Rush"" is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. ""Rush"" is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to ""know the price of everything and the value of nothing."" Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of ""Lonesome Dove"". Like, ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""Rush"" is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. ""Rush"" is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"".If you have not seen ""Rush,"" watch the international trailer, available on YouTube. This trailer is the perfect encapsulation of the movie. If you still are not interested, don't bother. However, I hope you are as impressed as I with my favorite film of 2013.",precision craftsmanship,when my wife i first saw us trailer rush my wife asked me do you want see it well it is racing movie i replied i have mixed emotions about not watching international trailer before watching rush because i would certainly have held much higher expectations first foremost rush is not about chris hemsworths pecs nor that matter is it that much about about chris hemworths character james hunt rush is about two extraordinary mens visions life their approaches racing it is viewed james hunts most famous challenger nicki lauder lauder is technocrat man who at least appears know price everything value nothing hunt is free spirit one simultaneously knows value everything nothing hunt lauder are presented much same manner as two main characters lonesome dove like lonesome dove rush is majestic its presentation these two lives rush is poetic its presentation absolute precision its score its cinematography its performances most both memorable appropriate score i have heard since good bad ugly if you have not seen rush watch international trailer available youtube this trailer is perfect encapsulation movie if you still are not interested dont bother however i hope you are as impressed as i with my favorite film 2013,0.5772534013605443,0.2469387755102041,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Criminally Underrated and Extremely Involving,"Formula One racing isn't a sport that I watch regularly but I certainly respect it more than its competing leagues. The tracks are complex, the opportunities to pass are limited and the pit stops must be carefully timed. But this movie isn't current F1 racing, this movie largely takes place in the late 1960s till the mid 1970s where it was far more dangerous and that much more invigorating because of it. We get a classic storyline of two rivals with two very different styles, they had to respect each other due to the sheer magnificence of their driving.There are so many things that I want to praise this movie for. I guess I'll start with how thrilling the world of 1970s Formula One is. The cinematography, the sound effects and the camera angles make this as close to a racing experience as you can imagine. I literally felt like I was in one of the cars racing and I haven't had a theatre experience like that in a while. It was like being on a roller coaster, I got caught up in the ""Rush"" so to speak. The racing sequences are exciting, and the movie does a great job reminding you of how dangerous the sport is. One of the taglines for the film is ""more powerful than the fear of death is the will to win"" I couldn't agree more. People are decapitated, ripped apart, cars burst into flames, this is not a sport for the weak hearted. The movie is involving, white-knuckle tense and I couldn't turn away for even a moment.Perhaps the biggest credit to Rush is how balanced and even the story is between the two main characters. Neither man is a hero, they both are arrogant jerks who are only interested in their own success. Lauda is cold, calculating, pompous but he has the wit and the skill to back up his big talk. Hunt on the other hand is like the handsome jock you knew in school. He is just as cocky, determined and unlikeable as Lauda but has the drive to win and the silver tongue to gain acceptance from the racing community. The movie does a great job showing you the virtues and faults of both men and amazingly enough you want both to come out on top. A good comparison on how well layered and how well balanced the characters are would be Warrior, another favourite of mine. It's a feat in storytelling and they pull it off perfectly here.The acting in the movie is superb to say the least. Both leading actors give excellent nuanced performances that would be worthy of Oscar consideration. Chris Hemsworth seems like a logical choice for the charismatic and determined Hunt. Detractors from this movie claim that it's another typical Hemsworth performance, but I was really surprised with how effective he was at portraying the gauntlet of emotions that Hunt goes through. He has a ton of natural screen presence, but this movie shows he's got real leading man skills (outside of Thor) If I was forced to pick between them though, I would credit Daniel Bruhl with the best performance. I've only seen him in Inglorious Basterds but in this movie he does a flawless accent and has so many levels to his acting job as Lauda. You believe he is Lauda and he's just so wonderfully unlikeable, I would give him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Lauda is a complex man with a strict code and due to Bruhlh's performance he's captivating.I've talked about the dual leads enough but another pleasant surprise about this movie is that it features some strong female characters. Olivia Wilde is only in the movie for a short period of time but she's good. Olivia is more known for her amazing good looks but she's a better actress than she's given credit for and has done some good work (House, Deadfall etc.). She's talented and she makes the most of her screen time. I also really enjoyed the performance of Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene who is the woman who eventually marries Niki. She's feisty and she's a good match for Niki. She's strong, beautiful and she plays a critical role in shaping where Niki heads in the course of the movie. With a cast that lacks proven Oscar contenders, the acting is Oscar calibre and is one more firing piston in the proverbial engine that is this movie.Much like any classic, the movie runs the gauntlet of emotions so well. This movie was sold to audiences through the trailers as an action/sports movie but it's more of a drama with some solid action scenes in it. I've gone on about how much it involves the audience in its plot but what I haven't mentioned is how tense and thrilling the end is. Its lean back in your seat and hold your breath type nerve wracking. The movie has its comedic moments as well, largely thanks to Hemsworth's charm and timing. The movie touches all the bases, making you want to cheer your favourite racer when they cross the finish line first and then drop your jaw in awe when they risk it all, almost killing themselves in the process.Rush had all the action you could want but turned out to be a superbly crafted drama. It's a beautiful movie with some Oscar calibre acting and wonderfully stylish moments. It's my favourite movie of 2013 and it's one of the bigger pleasant surprises I've ever seen in a theatre. I'm giving Rush a 9.5/10 rounding up to a 10/10.",criminally underrated extremely involving,formula one racing isnt sport that i watch regularly but i certainly respect it more than its competing leagues tracks are complex opportunities pass are limited pit stops must be carefully timed but this movie isnt current f1 racing this movie largely takes place late 1960s till mid 1970s where it was far more dangerous that much more invigorating because it we get classic storyline two rivals with two very different styles they had respect each other due sheer magnificence their driving there are so many things that i want praise this movie i guess ill start with how thrilling world 1970s formula one is cinematography sound effects camera angles make this as close racing experience as you can imagine i literally felt like i was one cars racing i havent had theatre experience like that while it was like being roller coaster i got caught up rush so speak racing sequences are exciting movie does great job reminding you how dangerous sport is one taglines film is more powerful than fear death is will win i couldnt agree more people are decapitated ripped apart cars burst into flames this is not sport weak hearted movie is involving white knuckle tense i couldnt turn away even moment perhaps biggest credit rush is how balanced even story is between two main characters neither man is hero they both are arrogant jerks who are only interested their own success lauda is cold calculating pompous but he has wit skill back up his big talk hunt other hand is like handsome jock you knew school he is just as cocky determined unlikeable as lauda but has drive win silver tongue gain acceptance racing community movie does great job showing you virtues faults both men amazingly enough you want both come out top good comparison how well layered how well balanced characters are would be warrior another favourite mine its feat storytelling they pull it off perfectly here acting movie is superb say least both leading actors give excellent nuanced performances that would be worthy oscar consideration chris hemsworth seems like logical choice charismatic determined hunt detractors this movie claim that its another typical hemsworth performance but i was really surprised with how effective he was at portraying gauntlet emotions that hunt goes through he has ton natural screen presence but this movie shows hes got real leading man skills outside thor if i was forced pick between them though i would credit daniel bruhl with best performance ive only seen him inglorious basterds but this movie he does flawless accent has so many levels his acting job as lauda you believe he is lauda hes just so wonderfully unlikeable i would give him best supporting actor oscar lauda is complex man with strict code due bruhlhs performance hes captivating ive talked about dual leads enough but another pleasant surprise about this movie is that it features some strong female characters olivia wilde is only movie short period time but shes good olivia is more known her amazing good looks but shes better actress than shes given credit has done some good work house deadfall etc shes talented she makes most her screen time i also really enjoyed performance alexandra maria lara as marlene who is woman who eventually marries niki shes feisty shes good match niki shes strong beautiful she plays critical role shaping where niki heads course movie with cast that lacks proven oscar contenders acting is oscar calibre is one more firing piston proverbial engine that is this movie much like any classic movie runs gauntlet emotions so well this movie was sold audiences through trailers as action sports movie but its more drama with some solid action scenes it ive gone about how much it involves audience its plot but what i havent mentioned is how tense thrilling end is its lean back your seat hold your breath type nerve wracking movie has its comedic moments as well largely thanks hemsworths charm timing movie touches all bases making you want cheer your favourite racer when they cross finish line first then drop your jaw awe when they risk it all almost killing themselves process rush had all action you could want but turned out be superbly crafted drama its beautiful movie with some oscar calibre acting wonderfully stylish moments its my favourite movie 2013 its one bigger pleasant surprises ive ever seen theatre im giving rush 9 5 10 rounding up 10 10,0.5495037871732787,0.24822437449556098,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
