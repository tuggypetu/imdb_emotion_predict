6.0,"I'm not proud of it, but this movie made me laugh","Maybe it's just because my expectations were so low, but I didn't hate Vampires Suck. In fact, I found myself laughing more than I thought I would. Jenn Proske nails the awkward, mumbling performance of Kristen Stewart and the pot shots at the Twilight franchise feel absolutely justified. It's a completely stupid parody and only a fraction of the jokes land, but, as strange as it sounds, I liked this movie.",im not proud it but this movie made me laugh,maybe its just because my expectations were so low but i didnt hate vampires suck fact i found myself laughing more than i thought i would jenn proske nails awkward mumbling performance kristen stewart pot shots at twilight franchise feel absolutely justified its completely stupid parody only fraction jokes land but as strange as it sounds i liked this movie,0.6954545454545454,-0.07727272727272727,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.42}"
3.0,"An improvement on the previous spoofs, but not saying much","Becca, an anxious, non-vampire teen, is torn between two boys. Before she can choose, Becca must get around her controlling father, who embarrasses Becca by treating her like a child. Meanwhile, Becca's friends contend with their own romantic issues – all of which collide at the prom.VAMPIRES SUCK will surprise many people because it's an improvement over the previous spoof films directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have been churning out for the past couple of years. However, that's like saying it's the better crap of all crap. The jokes still aren't funny and the filmmakers still don't realize the difference between satirizing and copying. But I would be lying to myself if I said I didn't find some good that came out of this film because there are some improvements.First of all, the performances are great by the two leads. In her first film, Jenn Proske does a dead on impersonation of Kristen Stewart. However, it's sad to see her in this because I think she's better than this. Matt Lanter also does a great impersonation of Robert Pattinson in his ""pain"" look. I don't know what made Ken Jeong come aboard the film but he's basically playing the same character in THE HANGOVER. He's not in the film that much, though. Also, I think it's pretty great that Carmen Electra isn't in here and I'm sure others will agree.The second obvious thing that stuck out to me was that the film focused on only the first two TWILIGHT films. The filmmakers finally learned that spoofing 600 movies is a bad thing. Saying that, the film still does have the many pop culture references, some too random to comment about. Fortunately, they really did tone it down quite a bit compared to the previous films where you get one every five seconds. You probably get one every five minutes here.I also liked the fact that it looked like an actual film because if you saw MEET THE SPARTANS and DISASTER MOVIE, you'd know the films were filled with shoddy sets made up in ten minutes. In here, you might question if they stole the sets and locations from the TWILIGHT films. I don't know if this counts as something good but I really think the film manages to create a decent storyline from the first two TWILIGHT films.Overall, the film is still bad because it's rarely funny, although I will admit I laughed at some bits that took a jab at the TWILIGHT series. If the story is better than the jokes itself, you know you got a bad comedy. It's an improvement from the last few spoof films, but that doesn't say much. I really don't recommend seeing it at all. If you must, just rent it on DVD that will inevitably come out a month after the film is released.",improvement previous spoofs but not saying much,becca anxious non vampire teen is torn between two boys before she can choose becca must get around her controlling father who embarrasses becca by treating her like child meanwhile beccas friends contend with their own romantic issues all which collide at prom vampires suck will surprise many people because its improvement over previous spoof films directors jason friedberg aaron seltzer have been churning out past couple years however thats like saying its better crap all crap jokes still arent funny filmmakers still dont realize difference between satirizing copying but i would be lying myself if i said i didnt find some good that came out this film because there are some improvements first all performances are great by two leads her first film jenn proske does dead impersonation kristen stewart however its sad see her this because i think shes better than this matt lanter also does great impersonation robert pattinson his pain look i dont know what made ken jeong come aboard film but hes basically playing same character hangover hes not film that much though also i think its pretty great that carmen electra isnt here im sure others will agree second obvious thing that stuck out me was that film focused only first two twilight films filmmakers finally learned that spoofing 600 movies is bad thing saying that film still does have many pop culture references some too random comment about fortunately they really did tone it down quite bit compared previous films where you get one every five seconds you probably get one every five minutes here i also liked fact that it looked like actual film because if you saw meet spartans disaster movie youd know films were filled with shoddy sets made up ten minutes here you might question if they stole sets locations twilight films i dont know if this counts as something good but i really think film manages create decent storyline first two twilight films overall film is still bad because its rarely funny although i will admit i laughed at some bits that took jab at twilight series if story is better than jokes itself you know you got bad comedy its improvement last few spoof films but that doesnt say much i really dont recommend seeing it at all if you must just rent it dvd that will inevitably come out month after film is released,0.5028240740740741,0.08601851851851854,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,"It had a few one liners that made me chuckle, but that was it","This film is about a girl who moves into a village that is rampant with vampires. She falls in love with a vampire but she got dumped before the prom.Seriously, what is the point of making ""Vampire Sucks""? It's like remaking two films into one, but in a really bad way. The supposed spoofs are not even spoofs, but are just re-enactment of scenes from ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"". The story is an amalgamation of the two films, but it is fragmented and incoherent.

7.0,Did what it had to do - Make fun of Twilight!,"Being directed by the directors/writers of films such as the Scary Movie films, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, etc., I knew that Vampires Suck won't be good at all, and just when I was getting tired of these kind of films, I didn't need it to. I only wanted to see this because it parodies the crappiest crap in the history of crap literature and crap film. I saw it, didn't really like it, but I was surprised - It made fun of Twilight, yet it was better than it in every single way! Like I do with the other spoof films, I only watched this for some hilarity (which some of you should do instead of bashing it). I couldn't help but burst out laughing at all the jokes, even if some of them were predictable. It doesn't only parodize Twilight, but pokes a tongue at the monotony of teenagers girls who are all manipulative narcissists, or a soldier of ""Team Jacob"".Compared to the forced acting in Twilight, the acting in this was Leonardo DiCaprio good. Their timing was perfect, they actually had facial expressions and varied their voice. Cough cough, Kristen. Cough cough.The good thing is that it was less boring than Twilight. It didn't waste its time on boring, senseless conversations - It was more ""action-packed"", it had more blood, the vampires actually seemed like vampires, and yes - You will see its astonishing horrible special effects that you always find in the other spoof films! Futheremore, the ending was epic!!! Let's just put it at that - One of the greatest film endings of all time...I think this is the second best spoof movie that I have seen (Spaceballs) being the first. You should give it a try, you won't be disappointed if you know what's coming.",did what it had do make fun twilight,being directed by directors writers films such as scary movie films epic movie meet spartans etc i knew that vampires suck wont be good at all just when i was getting tired these kind films i didnt need it i only wanted see this because it parodies crappiest crap history crap literature crap film i saw it didnt really like it but i was surprised it made fun twilight yet it was better than it every single way like i do with other spoof films i only watched this some hilarity which some you should do instead bashing it i couldnt help but burst out laughing at all jokes even if some them were predictable it doesnt only parodize twilight but pokes tongue at monotony teenagers girls who are all manipulative narcissists or soldier team jacob compared forced acting twilight acting this was leonardo dicaprio good their timing was perfect they actually had facial expressions varied their voice cough cough kristen cough cough good thing is that it was less boring than twilight it didnt waste its time boring senseless conversations it was more action packed it had more blood vampires actually seemed like vampires yes you will see its astonishing horrible special effects that you always find other spoof films futheremore ending was epic lets just put it at that one greatest film endings all time i think this is second best spoof movie that i have seen spaceballs being first you should give it try you wont be disappointed if you know whats coming,0.5037900874635568,0.019776482021379972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,Enjoyable if you are a fan of Twilight,"If you are a fan of Twilight you will enjoy this. There are more funny moments - laugh out loud moments than you'd expect. Without giving away any jokes for enjoyment - there were a lot of things to make fun of and the contemporary references were spot on. For this kind of movie they did as good a job as possible given the subject matter.Compared to other spoof movies its less corny and slapstick. Of course there are some exaggerated parts and overkill on certain jokes but overall it was well done. It was nice that they used famous dialog from the movies to spoof like ""about 3 things I was certain"" and ""i know what you are ..."" They of course had to combine and condense the stories of 2 long movies into one and it was quite cleverly done. Left me wishing could have spoofed even more scenes.The leads are good. Jenn Proske gets K Stew's mannerisms down well maybe she does them a little too often. Matt Lanter gets the Edward broody look quite well and looks the part. Chris Riggi as Jacob is OK and the vampire trio are good. Some of the supporting cast are a bit insipid like the Sullens. And some Volturri could have been better cast.The familiar scenes were well recreated - forest, Bella's room, school etc. Clothing was well copied. Didn't have a cheap feel at all. It was fun to see how well they recreated things like the truck accident etc.Overall watch it if you are a Twilight fan. I think a lot of critics weren't fans of the series so of course they found it boring.",enjoyable if you are fan twilight,if you are fan twilight you will enjoy this there are more funny moments laugh out loud moments than youd expect without giving away any jokes enjoyment there were lot things make fun contemporary references were spot this kind movie they did as good job as possible given subject matter compared other spoof movies its less corny slapstick course there are some exaggerated parts overkill certain jokes but overall it was well done it was nice that they used famous dialog movies spoof like about 3 things i was certain i know what you are they course had combine condense stories 2 long movies into one it was quite cleverly done left me wishing could have spoofed even more scenes leads are good jenn proske gets k stews mannerisms down well maybe she does them little too often matt lanter gets edward broody look quite well looks part chris riggi as jacob is ok vampire trio are good some supporting cast are bit insipid like sullens some volturri could have been better cast familiar scenes were well recreated forest bellas room school etc clothing was well copied didnt have cheap feel at all it was fun see how well they recreated things like truck accident etc overall watch it if you are twilight fan i think lot critics werent fans series so course they found it boring,0.5014933166248955,0.18909252297410192,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.31}"

7.0,"Maybe I've just gotten used to them, maybe they've actually gotten better. . .","Oh, Friedberg and Seltzer. How woefully you are viewed upon by over half the film world's population today. The films you have made have been deemed some of the worst ever. However, there are still some traces of fans out there, whether anyone believes it or not. I, myself, am certainly not a fan, but I understand both sides of the scale and review your films unbiasedly. With that said, I have to admit that I rather enjoyed the latest spoof from these two.The Twilight phenomenon is an utter joke among many already. A feature length spoof of the movies seemed like it was bound to happen, but who would have known it would have been created by them. Some might enjoy this because they find any mocking of the Twlight films joyous. Some might enjoy this because they honestly find the antics humorous. Most will hate it entirely because of the directors. In any matter, I found it fun because of how well crafted I actually thought it was and how many times it made me laugh because of how funny the movie managed to be by working off the films' it mocks cheesiness areas.Like some have already reviewed saying, this is an improvement in many ways. Unlike all their other films, this actually focuses on spoofing just the two first Twilight films and does not rely on criticizing every film they possibly can as well as making lame pop culture reference after lame pop culture reference to get giggles, even though there still are pop culture references in there, they're just not as lame and are spaced out for our brain's convenience.Jenn Proske and Matt Lanter are actually incredible, in a sense, in their performances. Proske covered every Kristen Stewart fault swimmingly as did Matt Lanter for Robert Pattinson. Even though that's generally not something to be proud of, it works here. The movie doesn't linger on humorless side jokes until the point where boredom is spewing out of our mouths, and the crew captures the essence that I was looking for in this film. Yes, it has many problems, what Friedberg and Seltzer film doesn't? It still is entertaining in the right mood, and just maybe the two have finally started to perfect on what they have been oblivious to all this time, or maybe I have just gotten used to their mediocrity, but regardless, I think this film deserves more appreciation than some Friedberg and Seltzer haters will give it.",maybe ive just gotten used them maybe theyve actually gotten better,oh friedberg seltzer how woefully you are viewed upon by over half film worlds population today films you have made have been deemed some worst ever however there are still some traces fans out there whether anyone believes it or not i myself am certainly not fan but i understand both sides scale review your films unbiasedly with that said i have admit that i rather enjoyed latest spoof these two twilight phenomenon is utter joke among many already feature length spoof movies seemed like it was bound happen but who would have known it would have been created by them some might enjoy this because they find any mocking twlight films joyous some might enjoy this because they honestly find antics humorous most will hate it entirely because directors any matter i found it fun because how well crafted i actually thought it was how many times it made me laugh because how funny movie managed be by working off films it mocks cheesiness areas like some have already reviewed saying this is improvement many ways unlike all their other films this actually focuses spoofing just two first twilight films does not rely criticizing every film they possibly can as well as making lame pop culture reference after lame pop culture reference get giggles even though there still are pop culture references there theyre just not as lame are spaced out our brains convenience jenn proske matt lanter are actually incredible sense their performances proske covered every kristen stewart fault swimmingly as did matt lanter robert pattinson even though thats generally not something be proud it works here movie doesnt linger humorless side jokes until point where boredom is spewing out our mouths crew captures essence that i was looking this film yes it has many problems what friedberg seltzer film doesnt it still is entertaining right mood just maybe two have finally started perfect what they have been oblivious all this time or maybe i have just gotten used their mediocrity but regardless i think this film deserves more appreciation than some friedberg seltzer haters will give it,0.5867595818815329,0.1673635307781649,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
6.0,"Now I regret that I spent the ""Still better love story than Twilight"" title on ""New Moon""","IMDb Bottom Rated Movies # 45 is a 'so bad it's good' over-the-top parody of ""The Twilight Saga"". Objectively, the movie is bad and ridiculous, but unlike the original, which with a budget of $ 400 million and serious intentions turned out to be bad, stupid and boring, this one with dozens of times smaller budget is deliberately bad and stupid and immeasurably entertaining. They dug up actors who mostly resemble those from the original franchise and mimic them pretty well, and Jenn Proske is both hotter and a better actress than gloomy Kristen Stewart's she skillfully mocks. The movie does not deserve the rating I gave it, but considering all of the above, I simply have to rate it at least one star more than the original.6/10",now i regret that i spent still better love story than twilight title new moon,imdb bottom rated movies 45 is so bad its good over top parody twilight saga objectively movie is bad ridiculous but unlike original which with budget 400 million serious intentions turned out be bad stupid boring this one with dozens times smaller budget is deliberately bad stupid immeasurably entertaining they dug up actors who mostly resemble those original franchise mimic them pretty well jenn proske is both hotter better actress than gloomy kristen stewarts she skillfully mocks movie does not deserve rating i gave it but considering all above i simply have rate it at least one star more than original 6 10,0.606965058750773,-0.026975108225108187,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.16}"
2.0,Further proof why Jason Friedberg and Andy Seltzer should stop making movies,"Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the single worst filmmakers currently working in the realm of mainstream cinema. This pair of writers/directors is responsible for single-handedly destroying the parody genre. I consider their third film, Meet the Spartans, to be the single worst movie of the last decade – one which gave us a dozen well known and lesser known treasures by Uwe Boll. But where Boll shows ambition and dare I say, ""style"", Friedberg and Seltzer exhibit laziness and a lack of purpose. These two hacks throw in dated pop culture references and steal the work of others, and seem to get away with calling it comedy.It is funny to note then that their first movie in two years, Vampires Suck, is a parody riffing on the Twilight series. The duo gleefully crib from Twilight and New Moon, providing us with the tale of new girl Becca (Jenn Proske) who falls in love with the vampire Edward (Matt Lanter), and all the problems that come with their newfound romance.My immediate question, before even beginning to try and discuss this waste of time, is why did Friedberg and Seltzer ever think it was a good idea to make a parody of the Twilight series? The films are unintentionally hilarious as it is. And True Blood has been on for three seasons now, and for all intents and purposes, it is merely a darkly satirical and much more adult version of Twilight. So right off the bat, these two brilliant minds are mining at something that has already been done. I guess it was money, but who would knowingly believe Twilight fans would rush out to see a movie bashing their beloved franchise much less the haters who would not be caught dead seeing the film as it is? It just seems overly baffling to me, what could possibly have made anyone think this film is a good idea. It recycles the unintentional jokes from the series, and packages them in a way that either rips them off lightly or just come off as not being anywhere near as funny as they were before. I chuckled at a few parts here and there, but they were only mild chuckles. There is nothing inherently funny or stands out as being hilarious at any given point in the film. Perhaps Friedberg and Seltzer are laughing – but no one else is laughing with them. I had the good fortune of not having to see this movie in a theatre, but I can imagine the film's showings are silent enough that the filmgoers can hear the projector whirling more than they can hear anyone laughing.I will give credit however in the fact that unlike their previous atrocities and crimes against cinema-goers all over the world, Vampires Suck does not deviate from its riffing of the Twilight. Characters still make dated pop culture references (is anyone in five years even going to remember The Kardashians? I barely know who they are now), but no one from other films is just thrown into the film at random. The film never stops to suddenly jump into making fun of another film or franchise (outside of a total throwaway blink-and-you-will-miss-it gag involving Alice from Alice in Wonderland). It stays consistent throughout, and to me, suggests a minor development of maturity on the parts of the filmmakers. Or of course, they realized there was nowhere they could possibly throw someone like Justin Bieber or Cobb from Inception, and not confuse the audience even more than they like already are.But this consistency comes with a price. Instead of whipping by, the film runs at an incredibly slow pace. I fell asleep twice, and somehow barely missed anything. They do a fairly nifty job of condensing the first two films, but it seems like they did not do nearly enough editing and whittling down. The film easily could have felt a lot faster paced, but it stalls a bit too much in almost every scene. And for a film that runs less than eighty minutes, it speaks a lot for what these two filmmakers were trying to accomplish or even what they wanted to show. If they cannot answer that simple question to the filmgoing public, then what is the point of even making movies in the first place? You will need to sift through the increasing amount of junk and waste in Vampires Suck, but Proske is actually fairly good in her role (her acting debut, sadly). She has the Kristen Stewart impression and mannerisms down perfectly, and she almost came off as a better Bella than Stewart ever has. She also has a commanding aura about her, which suggests she is in store for much greater work in the future. As long as she runs away from everyone involved here, I am sure she can prove this soon enough. Unlike her, no one else even remotely stands out or is even half decent in the cast (Ken Jeong and Diedrich Bader go to complete waste in supporting roles). They all just go through the motions, and are just as lazy and half-assed as everyone else. But then, why should they bother if the filmmakers do not even try? Despite being a lot more balanced than any of their brethren, Vampires Suck is still an awful and truly unfunny film that only further proves the point that Friedberg and Seltzer need to stop making movies. Even with a great lead, they still manage to botch the making of this film and still suffer from many of the problems their earlier films were plagued by. Years from now, will anyone even remember these films? Better yet, will anyone want to remember these films? 2/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",further proof why jason friedberg andy seltzer should stop making movies,jason friedberg aaron seltzer are single worst filmmakers currently working realm mainstream cinema this pair writers directors is responsible single handedly destroying parody genre i consider their third film meet spartans be single worst movie last decade one which gave us dozen well known lesser known treasures by uwe boll but where boll shows ambition dare i say style friedberg seltzer exhibit laziness lack purpose these two hacks throw dated pop culture references steal work others seem get away with calling it comedy it is funny note then that their first movie two years vampires suck is parody riffing twilight series duo gleefully crib twilight new moon providing us with tale new girl becca jenn proske who falls love with vampire edward matt lanter all problems that come with their newfound romance my immediate question before even beginning try discuss this waste time is why did friedberg seltzer ever think it was good idea make parody twilight series films are unintentionally hilarious as it is true blood has been three seasons now all intents purposes it is merely darkly satirical much more adult version twilight so right off bat these two brilliant minds are mining at something that has already been done i guess it was money but who would knowingly believe twilight fans would rush out see movie bashing their beloved franchise much less haters who would not be caught dead seeing film as it is it just seems overly baffling me what could possibly have made anyone think this film is good idea it recycles unintentional jokes series packages them way that either rips them off lightly or just come off as not being anywhere near as funny as they were before i chuckled at few parts here there but they were only mild chuckles there is nothing inherently funny or stands out as being hilarious at any given point film perhaps friedberg seltzer are laughing but no one else is laughing with them i had good fortune not having see this movie theatre but i can imagine films showings are silent enough that filmgoers can hear projector whirling more than they can hear anyone laughing i will give credit however fact that unlike their previous atrocities crimes against cinema goers all over world vampires suck does not deviate its riffing twilight characters still make dated pop culture references is anyone five years even going remember kardashians i barely know who they are now but no one other films is just thrown into film at random film never stops suddenly jump into making fun another film or franchise outside total throwaway blink you will miss it gag involving alice alice wonderland it stays consistent throughout me suggests minor development maturity parts filmmakers or course they realized there was nowhere they could possibly throw someone like justin bieber or cobb inception not confuse audience even more than they like already are but this consistency comes with price instead whipping by film runs at incredibly slow pace i fell asleep twice somehow barely missed anything they do fairly nifty job condensing first two films but it seems like they did not do nearly enough editing whittling down film easily could have felt lot faster paced but it stalls bit too much almost every scene film that runs less than eighty minutes it speaks lot what these two filmmakers were trying accomplish or even what they wanted show if they cannot answer that simple question filmgoing public then what is point even making movies first place you will need sift through increasing amount junk waste vampires suck but proske is actually fairly good her role her acting debut sadly she has kristen stewart impression mannerisms down perfectly she almost came off as better bella than stewart ever has she also has commanding aura about her which suggests she is store much greater work future as long as she runs away everyone involved here i am sure she can prove this soon enough unlike her no one else even remotely stands out or is even half decent cast ken jeong diedrich bader go complete waste supporting roles they all just go through motions are just as lazy half assed as everyone else but then why should they bother if filmmakers do not even try despite being lot more balanced than any their brethren vampires suck is still awful truly unfunny film that only further proves point that friedberg seltzer need stop making movies even with great lead they still manage botch making this film still suffer many problems their earlier films were plagued by years now will anyone even remember these films better yet will anyone want remember these films 2 10 this review also appeared,0.4773764430014429,0.11414629930254931,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,"Giving ""Twilight"" the treatment it deserved!!!","Normally, I don't review movies on here, but when I read everyone else slamming this movie, I thought maybe they should get the perspective of someone who enjoyed it.As a non-Twilight fan (haven't read the books and don't wish to for reasons to numerous to mention), I was determined to see this movie at the time when I wanted to tease a Twi-hard that I personally got to know from my disability social group about it. She refused to see this movie simply because they make fun of Twilight and Buffy, which motivated me even further.First off, yes, there were a lot of corny sex jokes, fart jokes, pop culture and celebrity references that many reviewers said wore out their welcome with projects like Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans. That may be true, but think about this for a minute. We are talking about a franchise that has spent 500 or so pages going on and on about Edward Cullen's ""great"" looks, using every descriptive synonym known to man, resulting in the most annoying teenyboppers since Benji and Joel Madden put the oh-so-overrated Good Charlotte on the music map, them and the Jonas Brothers. Ask anyone who has hated the Twilight series from the start, or started to hate it once they got through their Twilight-gushing phase (in other words, they grew up and developed literary taste!) Neither the books nor the movies deserve even a quarter of the recognition they got, because all the people behind it want you to focus on is how a naive, despairing, depressed girl who doesn't know what she wants getting into a love triangle with a fairy vampire and a werewolf. That and how gorgeous Robert Pattinson looks in his sparkles and pale makeup, and the same with Taylor Lautner in his shirtless scenes. The result: hordes of groupie girls going so far as to unrealistically want to have Edward Cullen and Jacob Black's children, despite the fact they are fictional characters. It's ridiculous and absurd, to say the least! This is why ""Vampires Suck"" can be halfway appreciated.

7.0,Vampires don't suck that much,"Having had the misfortune of living with a family member who has every single spoof movie on DVD. I know from painful, bitter experience just how bad they've become over the years with Date Movie being singled out for particular attention at just how something so bad ever got released being beyond human comprehension! So it was with a huge amount of trepidation and bribing from my friend that I went along to see this and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.Lets get it out there right now, it's not, nor will it ever be Academy Award material. The hint after all is in the genre name, it's a ""spoof"" movie, and to that end it lives up pretty well to expectation. There's the usual un-PC like jokes in there (baby and bowling ball spring to mind), the relatively unknown ensemble who end up doing a better job than the original cast. Jenn Proske as Becca Crane has Kristen Stewart's awkward-ness down to a tee, whilst Matt Lanter is a far hotter Edward than Robert Pattinson!True Twi-hards will HATE it with a vengeance, as it stereotypes everything bad about Twilight including the whole ongoing Team Edward/Team Jacob debate, and they'll definitely hate the ending, although I laughed my head off!Yes it's completely juvenile humour, yes there are glaring omissions in the script, it sometimes feels rushed, like they didn't know how to work a certain scene, so just grazed over it in their hurry to film another scene that they had worked on, but it's bloody good fun if you're just looking for a film where you don't need to think, and you're wanting to kill an hour or so of your time",vampires dont suck that much,having had misfortune living with family member who has every single spoof movie dvd i know painful bitter experience just how bad theyve become over years with date movie being singled out particular attention at just how something so bad ever got released being beyond human comprehension so it was with huge amount trepidation bribing my friend that i went along see this i have say i was pleasantly surprised lets get it out there right now its not nor will it ever be academy award material hint after all is genre name its spoof movie that end it lives up pretty well expectation theres usual un pc like jokes there baby bowling ball spring mind relatively unknown ensemble who end up doing better job than original cast jenn proske as becca crane has kristen stewarts awkward ness down tee whilst matt lanter is far hotter edward than robert pattinson true twi hards will hate it with vengeance as it stereotypes everything bad about twilight including whole ongoing team edward team jacob debate theyll definitely hate ending although i laughed my head off yes its completely juvenile humour yes there are glaring omissions script it sometimes feels rushed like they didnt know how work certain scene so just grazed over it their hurry film another scene that they had worked but its bloody good fun if youre just looking film where you dont need think youre wanting kill hour or so your time,0.5607390873015874,-0.06516617063492058,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,A Nutshell Review: Vampires Suck,"I wouldn't have watched this if not for a friend who wanted to catch a comedy together, though I must admit I'm still pretty intrigued and amazed at how writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer managed to continue get money thrown at them to make terrible, unfunny comedies such as sub par works like Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, Epic Movie and Date Movie, the last which to me was mildly amusing. Gone are the days of the Zucker brothers, and now we're stuck with low-brow efforts like what Friedberg and Seltzer continuously dish out, setting their sights at whatever's popular genre at the moment.And that of course is the phenomenon we call Twilight, where it's already three films old, and taking its cue from the Harry Potter franchise, decided to split its last book into two films, done squarely for profits. Poking fun at something popular is expected, but to do so in the Friedberg-Seltzer fashion just reeks of desperation. They seem to throw anything and everything into the film, without even due consideration if it's funny, or not. There are plenty of sight gags, innuendos, and just plain badly designed scenes that don't flow from one to another, making it look like a series of school children skits that got strung together, hammering wooden pegs into rounded holes, and jokes that's 99% bad, you'll find more pleasure from experiencing long nails clawed against a chalkboard.Even more curious is the demographics out to support / watch this film. As I was understandably surrounded by women of all ages who turn out in droves to watch the Twilight movies, I was again equally surrounded by the same demographics for this one in a near full house. Clearly, I don't think they're that vacuous to, for a moment, think that their highly anticipated sequel film had arrived, or even remotely suspect that this is a companion film. I suspect though that for all the spoof movies out there, there's always a great chance that the impersonators of their favourite yummy characters will look equally yummy. Sorry to burst your bubble, but Matt Lanter as Edward Sullen is miles away from Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen even though both cannot act, and Chris Riggi as Jacob White is not Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black even though both share equal number of pronounced abs (hmm... maybe this could be a reason, Team Jacob was actually out supporting this?). The only thing that was the rare shining light in this film, happens to be Jenn Proske as Becca Crane, who did an awesome job impersonating how Kristen Stewart would play Bella Swan, down to all the subtle nuances that if Stewart decides to leave her role, then the Twilight producers can plonk Proske right in. It's really uncanny watching her ham up the Bella spoof, but do note that I'm not praising her performance either as she's just carbon-copying what another actress had done, although pitch perfect.I did laugh out loud here and there, but it's laughing at the film in how it got away with the stupidest of jokes and the absurdity at who this project could have been green lit by a Hollywood studio (says a lot, doesn't it?) I hope Friedberg and Seltzer either learn from the best in the comedic business, or quit filmmaking altogether. Vampires Suck sucks. Period.

6.0,This movie sucks....less than expected!,"After making the woefully regrettable decision to pay money to see ""Epic Movie"", I had vowed to stay far away from this movie and any other with the word ""Movie"" in the title. But, because I am faint of heart and/or an idiot, I allowed myself to be talked into watching a leaked version online because A) it was actually pretty funny, according to friends who had seen it already, B) it was only about 70 minutes long, and C) this Edward was actually hot. After watching it for myself, I would agree on all three counts (especially C.daaaaamn). It's no great cinematic achievement, but for a devoted Twilight hater such as myself, it was worth a chuckle or two.Sure, ""Vampires Suck"" meets many of the same pitfalls other parody movies do. It operates under the delusion that anyone out of diapers thinks that a character being bludgeoned over the head time and time again for absolutely no reason is comedy gold. It often relies on stupid pop culture jokes (Look! A Jersey Shore reference! It's funny because it is a Jersey shore reference!) and unoriginal gross-out humor (it's funny because you want to vomit! Haha!). But, so help me if I didn't find myself laughing at the way the film mercilessly mocks everything laughable about the Twilight movies, a series that, let's face it, lends itself pretty easily to parody. In fact, all ""Vampires Suck"" really had to do was recreate the first two Twilight films pretty much scene-for-scene, tweaking here and there to make the scenes only slightly more ridiculous than the originals. The result is actually a pretty clever send-up of the ludicrously over-the-top melodrama that Twilight lovers eat up. This film holds a mirror up to pretty much everything laughable about the series that proves that a wildly successful book/movie franchise does not necessarily need a ""plot"": the rabidity of its fan base; the shameless parade of shirtless males; the idea that teenage Stephanie Meyerer, I mean, Bella, would be the object of every hot guy's lust despite being a mopy sourpuss with no trace of a personality; the insistence that Robert Pattinson is ""sexy"". The actress who plays Bella, or ""Becca,"" as she is renamed, does a killer job parodying Kristen Stewart's mannerisms (hair-tucking, downward gazes, constant lower-lip biting) by which I mean she mimics them exactly and everyone laughs at them because they are stupid. Mocking Twilight is not exactly hard to do, but I have to say this film does it quite cleverly at many points. I'll even say that the ending is magnificent.Needless to say, ""Vampires Suck"" is for members of Team I Want a Boy Who Doesn't Want to Kill Me only, as I'm sure Twilight fans would not appreciate being forced to acknowledge that the thing they love is dumber than a sack of fruit fly larvae. However, since like I said the movie is pretty much just a re-creation of the original Twilight movies, many of the jokes are best appreciated having actually seen them. So you'll probably like this movie if you are not a Twilight fan, but have actually seen the movies because A) you were dragged there by a girl whose pants you really, REALLY wanted to get into, B) you were stoned, walked into the wrong theater, and failed to realize that it wasn't The Hangover until it was too late, or C) you are self-loathing and willingly subjected yourself to them out of morbid curiosity (like me).So if you hate Twilight and everything it stands for, take a break from your violent (yet strangely erotic) fantasies about Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner and go see ""Vampires Suck"". It will ease your tortured soul, and maybe, just maybe, restore a molecule of faith in the parody genre.

7.0,Pretty good spoof giving relief to those done with Twilight,"My wife is a complete, total, and obsessed Twihard. She's read the books many times and seen the movies uncounted times, and gets all of her girl friends into it too. While I can admit that there are some good qualities to the movies (they are immensely popular after all), it all just gets to be a bit too much after a while. This movie gives a great outlet for those who are tired of the Twilight movies and want to laugh about it.The whole point of the movie is to loosely follow the original plot to set up zippy one-liners and make fun of pretty much everything about the original movies. This basically works, many parts of the originals really are completely ridiculous and very spoof-worthy. This movie drags in some places and some of the lines fall completely flat, but hey it isn't intended to be a piece of art. It is all pretty low-brow slapstick humor and I got the impression it was done in a hurry, but I had at least 10 full belly laughs.I can't imagine how Jenn Proske kept a straight face delivering some of her lines, and she must have spent time studying Kristen Stewart's acting, because she does a perfect exaggeration of Stewart's little pouty angsty faces. She even has the hand gestures down. It makes you realize how good of an actress Stewart is, to be able to play the same note again and again and make it convincing, but it is a delight to see it mocked too.Many of the scenes are nearly exact replicas of the originals, and you can tell that the cast had fun getting the details right.It definitely started to drag at the end but hey if you want an hour's worth of Twilight recovery, it's definitely worth it.BTW if you like this and want to see more, see Colt Ford's video for ""Chicken & Biscuits"".I was surprised at the low ratings for this movie here, reading the reviews, it sounds like some people didn't even realize that it was a parody. I think it only makes sense if you saw (or were forced to see) the Twilight movies and got tired of them.

When my wife bought the first Twilight film home on a rented DVD, I actually was surprised to like it: most teens could relate to one of the main characters, I'd bet, or would at least admit to having ""friends like that"".

1.0,'Vampires Suck' ... SUCKED!,"So far, the Twilight films have been extremely disappointing and they have all received pretty low ratings from me. I decided to check out Vampires Suck, thinking it would be a good laugh. Unfortunately, I could count the amount of times I laughed on one hand.The film was full of cheap gimmicks, badly written lines that were not even close to being funny and actually, much like the Twilight films themselves, terribly structured with mass chunks of uneventful time filling. The lead actress is a fantastic Kristen Stewart impersonator - literally every twitch, facial expression and bodily movement is spot-on. Even her voice is extremely similar! Having never seen her in anything else however, it remains to be seen how far her acting skills actually stretch. There is really nothing much to comment on, simply because there was nothing in the film that was really worth noting. Don't bother seeing this one - simply AWFUL!",vampires suck sucked,so far twilight films have been extremely disappointing they have all received pretty low ratings me i decided check out vampires suck thinking it would be good laugh unfortunately i could count amount times i laughed one hand film was full cheap gimmicks badly written lines that were not even close being funny actually much like twilight films themselves terribly structured with mass chunks uneventful time filling lead actress is fantastic kristen stewart impersonator literally every twitch facial expression bodily movement is spot even her voice is extremely similar having never seen her anything else however it remains be seen how far her acting skills actually stretch there is really nothing much comment simply because there was nothing film that was really worth noting dont bother seeing this one simply awful,0.5143772893772893,0.024999999999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7.0,Above average Seltzer/Friedberg effort,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Having always displayed a sophisticated sense of humour, I was drawn to Vampire's Suck from the trailer, which cleverly plays like an advert for another unbearable Twilight instalment, only for a fart gag to suddenly break in and hilariously shatter any such illusion. Another blissfully short effort from the modern Proft/Zucker, Vampire's Suck keeps itself moving just by not having any illusions about itself and just being enjoyably silly through-out, without the gross unpleasantness of Disaster Movie or just the lameness of Epic Movie. It keeps itself in the times by the obligatory pop culture references, including a politically incorrect pop at Lady Gaga...I don't want to talk like it's some great masterpiece, but by S & F's standards, you can't complain. ***",above average seltzer friedberg effort,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning having always displayed sophisticated sense humour i was drawn vampires suck trailer which cleverly plays like advert another unbearable twilight instalment only fart gag suddenly break hilariously shatter any such illusion another blissfully short effort modern proft zucker vampires suck keeps itself moving just by not having any illusions about itself just being enjoyably silly through out without gross unpleasantness disaster movie or just lameness epic movie it keeps itself times by obligatory pop culture references including politically incorrect pop at lady gaga i dont want talk like its some great masterpiece but by s fs standards you cant complain,0.5372222222222223,0.10777777777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,I enjoyed it...,"I personally enjoyed this movie (it seems I am one of the few reviewers who did). I will acknowledge that it was a little cheesy at times and some of the puns weren't funny, but I think you have to keep in mind that this movie is a parody and thus has a lot of ""stupid"" humor, which I personally love.Vampires Suck makes fun of all the ridiculousness of the Twilight series in a way that I found entertaining--for example, when Edward watches Bella sleep, Bella's first day of school, the opening scene (complete with Becca's voice-over) where Edward literally reveals himself in the sunlight... It is true that in a lot of the movie, nothing happens, but it is again a parody of a book series where not much happens for hundreds of pages.Jenn Proske is amazing as Becca and does a fantastic job at all the stutters and twitches, nailing Kristen Stewart's performance as Bella. I thought the rest of the cast was decent too; Anneliese Van der Pol stood out to me because I had only ever seen her in the Disney Channel show That's So Raven and I thought her performance was genuinely funny.In conclusion, of course this movie was a little bit cheesy! However, as a fan of parodies and not so much a fan of Twilight I found this movie to be hilarious and not a waste of money, but I guess it's not for everyone.",i enjoyed it,i personally enjoyed this movie it seems i am one few reviewers who did i will acknowledge that it was little cheesy at times some puns werent funny but i think you have keep mind that this movie is parody thus has lot stupid humor which i personally love vampires suck makes fun all ridiculousness twilight series way that i found entertaining example when edward watches bella sleep bellas first day school opening scene complete with beccas voice over where edward literally reveals himself sunlight it is true that lot movie nothing happens but it is again parody book series where not much happens hundreds pages jenn proske is amazing as becca does fantastic job at all stutters twitches nailing kristen stewarts performance as bella i thought rest cast was decent too anneliese van der pol stood out me because i had only ever seen her disney channel show thats so raven i thought her performance was genuinely funny conclusion course this movie was little bit cheesy however as fan parodies not so much fan twilight i found this movie be hilarious not waste money but i guess its not everyone,0.6354166666666666,0.12465277777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.16}"
1.0,I felt like I was sitting through the first two twilight films again but with more CRAP added in,"Okay, here's my review It was basically the EXACT SAME TWILIGHT MOVIES only condensed into an hour + 20 and with a bunch of LAME jokes (celebrity references, pop culture references, fart jokes, unfunny sex jokes) and really it didn't seem to make fun of twilight the only thing that really made fun of it was how ""Becca"" acted just like Kristin Stewart and Jacob ""contract"" line and then the ending. The ending was so stupid. Instead of italy they're at a prom and Ed+Bella get engaged and he ""supposedly"" turns her into a vampire but then edward is killed by a buncha Jacob fans and the movie ends.So, I really can't compare it to the others, it felt like THE EXACT SAME THING as twilight with the SAME camera angles and SAME music only with Aaron/Jason unfunny humor. Not ONCE did I laugh, but nor did I laugh with any of their other films.final verdict, not sure what rating to give this, it just felt like a very long youtube video (Ive seen better actually) and it looks like twilight fans are actually gonna enjoy it more than non-twilight fans, so sorry.",i felt like i was sitting through first two twilight films again but with more crap added,okay heres my review it was basically exact same twilight movies only condensed into hour 20 with bunch lame jokes celebrity references pop culture references fart jokes unfunny sex jokes really it didnt seem make fun twilight only thing that really made fun it was how becca acted just like kristin stewart jacob contract line then ending ending was so stupid instead italy theyre at prom ed bella get engaged he supposedly turns her into vampire but then edward is killed by buncha jacob fans movie ends so i really cant compare it others it felt like exact same thing as twilight with same camera angles same music only with aaron jason unfunny humor not once did i laugh but nor did i laugh with any their other films final verdict not sure what rating give this it just felt like very long youtube video ive seen better actually it looks like twilight fans are actually gonna enjoy it more than non twilight fans so sorry,0.4414309764309764,0.05181818181818182,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
