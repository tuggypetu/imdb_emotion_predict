10,Super 30 brings ignites a storm of emotions while sending out a very important message.,"The movie is gripping and absolutely scintillating. Not the typical Bollywood masala film though. The film makes you cry, laugh, feel delighted and helpless at the state of affairs in our society. The direction is great and except for 15-20 minutes in the second half, where the film is a bit slow, there is never a dull moment.Casting is fantastic as it is and Hrithik Roshan has once again proven that he is arguably the best actor among all the superstars of Bollywood.

10,This story needs to heard/seen by every Indian,"My honest opinion is ignore all the so called ""pseudo- intellects"" like Rajeev Masand/Anupama Chopra etc. A movie needs to entertaining and it has to have certain commercial appeal. If not ,it would be like watching documentaries. They comment on movies in their AC rooms without realizing the sacrifices people like Anand Kumar and the team involved in making the movie make. I request people to encourage such humble & selfless people like Anand Kumar instead of pulling them down. This is exactly the message the movie gives which such movie critics don't understand. If you really want India to progress, i think people should be watching movies like Super 30 instead of all the senseless movies which make tons of cash at the boxoffice but add no value in life.

1,Too much glorification to handle,"First of all, with all due respect to Mr. Anand Kumar - I want to say that this movie is not even close to a biopic. I couldn't even believe that it is based on true events. There are many things that raised my eyebrows during course of movie which I want to highlight.1- In reality, Mr.Anand Kumar simultaneously works at Ramanujan Classes & Super 30 but in movie, rift between Excellence Caoching &Super 30is shown just to glorify Anand's image.Nothing is wrong in working for a sum of money.2- When Anand goes penniless, he sells everything in the house but still kept the maid in house, whom he brought into his home for his mother's help during his financially stable days3- When Super30 students are uncomfortable in English, Anand tell them to perform a play outside Excellence Coaching for 30 mins. I mean seriously and then they sing a song like NO NO NO NO.....4- Anand may have faced several attacks in his real life but in the movie it is depicted as if Thanos is coming to snatch infinity stone from Anand. All students gather and fight with goons with actual guns and bullets with just the help of physics.5- Students without any formal education are able to design Gobar Gas Plant and 3D projector for their hostel6- Romantic angle were deliberately added. There was no need for that. Songs are really bad except first one. Hristhik Roshan, Pankaj Tripathi and Amit Sadh are total miscast for the movie.",too much glorification handle,first all with all due respect mr anand kumar i want say that this movie is not even close biopic i couldnt even believe that it is based true events there are many things that raised my eyebrows during course movie which i want highlight 1 reality mr anand kumar simultaneously works at ramanujan classes super 30 but movie rift between excellence caoching super 30is shown just glorify anands image nothing is wrong working sum money 2 when anand goes penniless he sells everything house but still kept maid house whom he brought into his home his mothers help during his financially stable days3 when super30 students are uncomfortable english anand tell them perform play outside excellence coaching 30 mins i mean seriously then they sing song like no no no no 4 anand may have faced several attacks his real life but movie it is depicted as if thanos is coming snatch infinity stone anand all students gather fight with goons with actual guns bullets with just help physics 5 students without any formal education are able design gobar gas plant 3d projector their hostel6 romantic angle were deliberately added there was no need that songs are really bad except first one hristhik roshan pankaj tripathi amit sadh are total miscast movie,0.45321969696969694,0.020265151515151517,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.21}"

His looks, body language and accent will give you some surprise as this type role is quite challenging for him. Super 30 is great movie because it has great supporting roles. Virendra Saxena did phenomenal job in the role of father. Aditya Srivastava looks good in negative role. Pankaj Tripathi delivered another brilliant performance in small role. Mrunal Thakur also did the justice with her role. Amit Sadh is also good entertainer for the audience.Script: Sanjeev Dutta has tried to pen down each and every detail related to the life and struggle of Anand Kumar. We must appreciate his effort. However there are some additional play which can be cut short or remove as it derail the momentum gained by script in first half. Sometime over melodrama does not help the movie because audience feel disconnect from the script.Visual Effects: Some good effects added more value to the script. These were really demanded in this type of script.Music: This department let down this movie as Ajay-Atul failed to mesmerized the audience. There is no song which can be consider as chart-buster. ""Basanti No Dance"" was pathetic one.Box-Office: It opened with 11 crores. Second day it collected 17 crores which means huge jump for this type genre.
