9.0,A must watch,"The characters in this film are solid, each and everyone nailed it to the core. The first half starts a bit confusing but later it catches up the pace once Suraj appears on the screen, to an extent he stole the show with a decent interval bang. The second half of the film is terrific, Prithviraj was just tremendous. The last 45 minutes of the movie are an absolute treat with lots of enormous twists and turns. More than all that this film discusses the current political situation in India and most events that take place in this movie is based on true incidents. A film that I personally believe that should be watched at least once.",must watch,characters this film are solid each everyone nailed it core first half starts bit confusing but later it catches up pace once suraj appears screen extent he stole show with decent interval bang second half film is terrific prithviraj was just tremendous last 45 minutes movie are absolute treat with lots enormous twists turns more than all that this film discusses current political situation india most events that take place this movie is based true incidents film that i personally believe that should be watched at least once,0.42750000000000005,0.06833333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.56, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"

6.0,Tries to counter marginalization with loudness! [+57%],"The film asks some pertinent questions and presents its politics fairly well, but the writing (which goes the over-expository route) and the generic cinematic styles employed make it a somewhat middling affair. Everything in the film is dialed to eleven, especially when it comes to lengthy monologuing. I felt the director took way too much time to make a certain character's death look like a big deal and then struggled to put the twists and backstories across with conviction. When around forty-five minutes of the film remained, I wondered how the makers were planning to change my mind about a certain opinion it presented in the first half, especially with Prithviraj's loud lawyer character going bonkers.While they managed to cover up some of the larger potholes, it wasn't the most easy drive. The narrative often feels disjointed, switching between ""okay"", ""wow"", and ""meh"". The character of Saba (played by a miscast Mamta), whom the film majorly revolves around, is conceived in broad strokes - virtuous, upright, and almost saintly. Suraj adds one more to his list of restrained, grey-shaded performances while Prithvi simply roars his way through the second half. The extended climax, which packs too much information about the sequel, could've been replaced with a subtle tease. But that's the fundamental issue with the film - it revels in its talkathons, its expositions, its overplays.",tries counter marginalization with loudness,film asks some pertinent questions presents its politics fairly well but writing which goes over expository route generic cinematic styles employed make it somewhat middling affair everything film is dialed eleven especially when it comes lengthy monologuing i felt director took way too much time make certain characters death look like big deal then struggled put twists backstories across with conviction when around forty five minutes film remained i wondered how makers were planning change my mind about certain opinion it presented first half especially with prithvirajs loud lawyer character going bonkers while they managed cover up some larger potholes it wasnt most easy drive narrative often feels disjointed switching between okay wow meh character saba played by miscast mamta whom film majorly revolves around is conceived broad strokes virtuous upright almost saintly suraj adds one more his list restrained grey shaded performances while prithvi simply roars his way through second half extended climax which packs too much information about sequel couldve been replaced with subtle tease but thats fundamental issue with film it revels its talkathons its expositions its overplays,0.4523148148148148,0.11926807760141094,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.47}"
7.0,Important and probably gonna be contraversial,"The second film by Dijo Jose Antony and he has improved a lot. But one of the things that can be noticed in his first feature Queen itself is that he wants to talk about important things and let the emotion of it spread to the audience and it should be conveyed to every single one of them. He's ready to sacrifice some logic and reality for these emotions. He makes it a point to present these issues on the nose and as dramatic as possible. Queen became a big commercial success for such a small movie even though the critics saw all the problems that were definitely in it. But still, it can't be denied how successful it was at what it set out to be.Jana Gana Mana works very similarly in that regard. There are many points in the film which are exaggerated just for the dramatic effect and unless you are able to be accepting the emotional side and not the real world logic, especially in the courtroom scenes, the movie will be a disappointment.Despite all these issues, the movie is grounded in almost every other aspect. The top-notch acting, specifically by the two leads and the plot itself makes it a compelling watch. Touching upon all the important issues faced by the common people in the country, touching too many nerves due to which the movie ended up banned in a lot of North Indian states, the movie is a bold statement about the state of the country.The way the movie moved through the two protagonists through the two halves was very cleverly done so that the paradigm shift really allows the audience to see the broader picture. The way they made the audience root for things is really commendable as it shows exactly how the world works and why it shouldn't be that way. The movie is made in a way so that its messages can be reached everywhere and also makes sure to teach them to be able to question things. For a movie that is gonna be labelled as something that doesn't consider the audience intelligent enough to comprehend everything unless spelt out, it makes the exact case of why the audience around the world isn't really collectively intelligent and even those who ask for the intelligent narration won't be able to deny those facts.There would be a kind of hate that would be easily faced by this movie. The way the movie dealt with those political aspects is enough for the filmmakers to be proud about it due to the truth in the fiction.",important probably gonna be contraversial,second film by dijo jose antony he has improved lot but one things that can be noticed his first feature queen itself is that he wants talk about important things let emotion it spread audience it should be conveyed every single one them hes ready sacrifice some logic reality these emotions he makes it point present these issues nose as dramatic as possible queen became big commercial success such small movie even though critics saw all problems that were definitely it but still it cant be denied how successful it was at what it set out be jana gana mana works very similarly that regard there are many points film which are exaggerated just dramatic effect unless you are able be accepting emotional side not real world logic especially courtroom scenes movie will be disappointment despite all these issues movie is grounded almost every other aspect top notch acting specifically by two leads plot itself makes it compelling watch touching upon all important issues faced by common people country touching too many nerves due which movie ended up banned lot north indian states movie is bold statement about state country way movie moved through two protagonists through two halves was very cleverly done so that paradigm shift really allows audience see broader picture way they made audience root things is really commendable as it shows exactly how world works why it shouldnt be that way movie is made way so that its messages can be reached everywhere also makes sure teach them be able question things movie that is gonna be labelled as something that doesnt consider audience intelligent enough comprehend everything unless spelt out it makes exact case why audience around world isnt really collectively intelligent even those who ask intelligent narration wont be able deny those facts there would be kind hate that would be easily faced by this movie way movie dealt with those political aspects is enough filmmakers be proud about it due truth fiction,0.5325703146755777,0.17053049289891398,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Prithviraj & Suraj captivate in this massy political thriller,"Young gun Dijo Jose Antony is only one film old in the Malayalam film industry but managed to give new meaning to the campus movie genre with his debut effort ""Queen (2018)"", which, despite featuring a fresh cast of newcomers, managed to smartly blend college life with a strong social message and the thrills of a legal procedural. In ""Jana Gana Mana"" the director has established stars to work with and leverages them to the best possible extent, delivering a strong, message-oriented thriller that balances massy moments with unexpected twists to keep the audience hooked for its entirety.""Jana Gana Mana"" arrived in theatres having already veered delectably off the beaten path, having released its teaser and trailer with scenes not from the movie but from its upcoming sequel, in what is surely a first of its kind promotional stunt in world cinema. The trailer especially featured a 4-minute awe-inspiring one-shot action sequence that had captured the imagination of Malayali audiences and it was with this burden of expectations that the movie premiered across screens worldwide today.We follow the story of ACP Sajjan, played by the ever-dependable National Award winner Suraj Venjaramoodu, who is assigned the sensational case of the brutal murder of a college professor who was adored by her students and was known for her staunch political stands. As the student protests build due to political interference and constant hurdles being placed in the investigation, the case moves to a tense courtroom drama, where the pace becomes breakneck, and the stakes become monumental.Despite a sluggish first half laced with some cringe-worthy moments of excess melodrama and misplaced songs, the introduction of Prithviraj's character and the inflexion points in the plot at the onset of the second half more than makes up for it. Vincy Aloshious is especially on-point in her supporting role as a student leader while Pasupathy Raj, Mamtha Mohandas, GM Sundar and Shari also deliver convincing performances. Jakes Bejoy's background score is a rousing companion to the narration throughout the length of the film, providing emotion and stimulation in equal measure, making the punch dialogues whistle worthy and generating goosebumps in the mass elevation scenes.Prithviraj and Suraj Venjaramoodu deliver another brilliant lead-duo combination hit after the blockbuster ""Driving License (2019)"", albeit with few scenes together. With a lingering promise of more back-and-forth between these two captivating actors in the sequel, I can't wait to see how their sparkling chemistry is carried forward. Without giving too much away about Prithviraj's character, he is enigmatic and powerful in equal measure and delivers strong messages about many of the societal evils we are facing in the world around us.The plot of the movie would have seemed ludicrous about 5 years ago but having seen and heard about incidents like the 2020 Jawaharlal Nehru University Attacks and false-flag operations and co-ordinated cyber-attacks deliberately set up by governments to sway voters as elections approach, truth is stranger than fiction in the world we live in today where right-wing fundamentalists have overrun our polity and have made extraconstitutional and extrajudicial decisions their second nature. While the messaging tends to get a bit loud and the storyline is sometimes spoonfed to the audience without much subtlety, one can forgive the makers as such is the importance of the messages they are trying to put out with this earnest project.The director and writer Sharis Mohammed deserve all the praise in the world for performing a magician's sleight of hand in the final act of the film, ending this tantalizing first instalment on a knife-edge, with the unsaid promise of making the franchise a genre-bending, era-defining duology, With the trailer and the teaser apparently giving us only a glimpse of what Dijo, Prithviraj and this kickass team have planned for us in the second instalment, the anticipation is clearly through the roof as to what they will come up with, without the shoot restrictions enforced by Covid that they had to circumvent for the first part. ""Jana Gana Mana"" is a mandatory theatre watch that should open the doors to braver, more political thrillers in the future for Malayalam cinema!

6.0,Important film but with lots of flaws,"The film tries to speak about various issues in the society about biases, dividing etc but the approach is very loud the film goes overdramatic far too often.But despite its right intent and partly interesting structure, the making is quite uneven. Much of the treatment is loud and over-dramatic, especially the court scenes in the latter half. While it meanders pointlessly in the initial campus scenes, too much is said in quite a few rushed sequences towards the end. Much of this has to do with the mystery around Prithviraj's character, who re-appears only at the interval point, after an introduction in the prologue. The script also banks on all the incessant talking that this character does, not only to convey its political ideas, but also to reveal the twists in the tale.A decent watch nonetheless.",important film but with lots flaws,film tries speak about various issues society about biases dividing etc but approach is very loud film goes overdramatic far too often but despite its right intent partly interesting structure making is quite uneven much treatment is loud over dramatic especially court scenes latter half while it meanders pointlessly initial campus scenes too much is said quite few rushed sequences towards end much this has do with mystery around prithvirajs character who re appears only at interval point after introduction prologue script also banks all incessant talking that this character does not only convey its political ideas but also reveal twists tale decent watch nonetheless,0.5076839826839826,0.05374458874458876,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

6.0,A commercial flick sans any logic (in court),"Jana Gana Mana is a decent movie for a time pass watch. It definitely does entertain. The movie takes a good hour or so to set up the base premise and then starts unravelling the twist in the story in the second half. The movie tries to address a lot of serious issues, but the entire court scene and the deliberation process was a joke. This was similar to Jyotika's movie ponmagal vandhal, a film where they also make the court scenes a joke. With a bit more prep and consideration the court scene could have been more realistic and make the movie a bit more believable. Also, the extended twist in the end was all jam-packed into the last 10-15 minutes and was super unnecessary. And it would have been great if Prithviraj's and Suraj's roles were reversed. Suraj is a great actor, but he cannot carry such a suavve role. Overall, a decent watch, but could have been much better. And oh, please stop casting Priyanka in movies.

,Jana Gana Mana Is A Cleverly Deceptive Political Film That Doesn't Trade Entertainment With Its Importance,"Call it an overtly meta reading of what's essentially a simple scene, but there's something about the timing of Jana Gana Mana's release that made this stretch feel a lot more significant. With Sathyan Anthikad's Makal set to release a day later, we get a scene where Jana Gana Mana's director Dijo Jose Antony appears as a college professor. It is set in Maharajas College and the lecture is on Indian Polity with a full strength of students in attendance. But his speech does not compliment the ""good students"" for attending his class. Instead, his big mass dialogue here forces them to get up from their benches and go out in protest against the murder of a professor in another state. He calls it the ""practicals"" of the subject he's teaching, but it feels like an event in itself with a filmmaker teaching his audience to be more political. When seen just a day before the release of an Anthikad film, it's a sign of how most makers today have rejected the apolitical stands of films like Sandesham and Priyadarshan's Cheppu to embrace full student participation. Given how the film comes back later to underscore this very point only adds to the film's cleverly deceptive writing.Read the full review on Film Companion.",jana gana mana is cleverly deceptive political film that doesnt trade entertainment with its importance,call it overtly meta reading whats essentially simple scene but theres something about timing jana gana manas release that made this stretch feel lot more significant with sathyan anthikads makal set release day later we get scene where jana gana manas director dijo jose antony appears as college professor it is set maharajas college lecture is indian polity with full strength students attendance but his speech does not compliment good students attending his class instead his big mass dialogue here forces them get up their benches go out protest against murder professor another state he calls it practicals subject hes teaching but it feels like event itself with filmmaker teaching his audience be more political when seen just day before release anthikad film its sign how most makers today have rejected apolitical stands films like sandesham priyadarshans cheppu embrace full student participation given how film comes back later underscore this very point only adds films cleverly deceptive writing read full review film companion,0.42910714285714285,0.19958333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.38}"

1.0,Another propaganda film,"These days you can't watch a decent Malayalam film without first reading the story. With a deceptive plot they convey a political agenda.
