10.0,The Goonies ARE good enough,"It was in 2001 or thereabouts that I watched and listened to the audio commentary track that is on the DVD version of The Goonies. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and seeing how the principal cast had aged (or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case) was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe, it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed, this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the video-enhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer, less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney, every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey, and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green, who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adult-oriented lines from is anyone's guess, but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do, other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.Speaking of fiendish traps, the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendish-sounding name, the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence, for example, would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject, who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scene-stealing goes to John Matuszak, who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie, Sloth, with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then, in 1985, scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays, as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years, I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train (now there's a title that brings images to mind) or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here, but the manic, cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels, the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell, all of the effects in The Goonies are practical, and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs, which may disappoint some viewers, but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film (the squid sequence being the most famous example), but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element, everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue, which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon, it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old, it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive. If you have not introduced your children around the age of ten or greater to its joys and moments, then shame on you.",goonies are good enough,it was 2001 or thereabouts that i watched listened audio commentary track that is dvd version goonies nostalgia is wonderful thing seeing how principal cast had aged or hardly aged josh brolins case was worth price admission its own but this is just one goonies selling points despite what imdbs ratings would have you believe it is immortal classic that warrants repeated frequent viewings it is not coincidence that many its cast crew have repeatedly appeared all sorts productions before since indeed this was probably first film that introduced me reality that same actor will often play ten different parts ten different films when i realised that jonathan ke quan was same brat that made parts indiana jones temple doom so amusing seeing him video enhanced commentary dvd nearly two decades later was surprise half film revolves around group children adolescents who live poorer less trendy part beachfront town unlike episode barney every member this principal group is given background string differences their castmates you will not see teenaged brand responding same situation same manner as ten year old mikey that is where major part films strength is derived only weakness characterisations is with martha plimpton kerri green who join adventuring boys little way into film exactly what they are doing other than giving character brand something similar himself bounce his more adult oriented lines is anyones guess but they do work their limited capacity it is just pity that chris columbus screenplay did not give them little more do other than defuse one fiendish trap towards end ride speaking fiendish traps adventurers journey one puzzling location next with barely stop breath it works because unlike similar adventure films where director expects us be impressed by fiendish sounding name specific places that are visited by goonies have function bone piano shown one such sequence example would appear nightmares children learning regular piano years after films theatrical release it also gives corey feldman good chance act out character who speaks very fluent spanish while i am that subject who could forget immortal scene early film where mouth deliberately loses something translation when rosalita is shown around but prize scene stealing goes john matuszak who plays unofficial eighth goonie sloth with weird aplomb that may well scare willies out parts intended audience but then 1985 scaring intended audience little was considered healthy part making film those age ranges depicted here they say you cannot have good protagonist without good antagonist bounce off robert davi joe pantoliano anne ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose rule about not working with animals or children fratellis work so well here because they are working with children late anne ramsey played her part so well that mere thought watching her anything scared willies out me years nowadays as i have fully realised mechanics behind film some years i am keen as mustard see some her other work such pieces as throw momma train now theres title that brings images mind or meet hollowheads that performance can produce two entirely different reactions same person at different stages their life should tell you all you need know about its quality robert davi joe pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here but manic cackling quality their introductory act also left quite lasting impression you might have noticed that i have so far only mentioned special effects passing while heaping praise upon acting this is because unlike films such as recent star wars prequels effects complement acting rather than overshadow it what i am able tell all effects goonies are practical some them quite inventive there is no use blood squibs which may disappoint some viewers but there are enough mechanical sets air vents fill three films some these effects did not turn out so well were cut final film squid sequence being most famous example but unlike lot films that depend special effects crucial element everything shown final cut is perfect sync here suspension disbelief is never issue which is just as well considering some preposterous things that roll by screen with certain nonchalance i gave goonies ten out ten like superman or original lethal weapon it shows that richard donner knows how make classic now that it is twenty years old it stands forever as relic time when world those under age eighteen was far less oppressive if you have not introduced your children around age ten or greater its joys moments then shame you,0.442563746932679,0.102040516118186,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,Goonies r good enough,"Anyone who grew up in the 80's will list the Goonies as one of their favourite films, or at least look back at it with a misty eye.It had everthing you could want, thrills, spills, pirates, booty, adventure, freaks and bad guys. I just wanted to be a Goonie or go on a Goonie style adventure. Even the place where they lived was cool. A big old house in a picturesque bay town. You don't get houses like that in England. The only interesting thing you would have found in my loft would have been a dead pidgeon.Then there were the Goonies themselves who just seemed so cool. Data's gadgets and smart mouthed ..erm.. Mouth.We are first introduced to them one by one in the fantastic introductory sequence. The bad guys of the piece, the Fratellis, organise a jailbreak in a huge 4x4. In the process of doing so they speed past every member of the Goonies, introducing their character traits. Then they all get together at the leader Mikies house and just doss around for a while feeling sorry for themselves, because a property magnate wants to but there little town and turn it into a country club (although the bay looks like it would make a poor golf course, but hey). So this is the Goonies last day together and they have to do something about it. And don't they just.What follows is like a comedy Hardy Boys crossed with a game of Mousetrap. Some of the set pieces are genius (the pirate, One eyed Willie, had a penchant for elaborate traps to stop people pinching his booty) and the sets are equally inventive. The gang get themselves into various scrapes with the traps, or the Fratellis or both and somehow always come out on top.Richard Donner's direction is always brisk, the young actors performances are superb (specially the fantastic 'Chunk'), the senior cast is very good and the dialogue is chock full of hilarious lines.I must admit I look back at it through rose tinted glasses. I was in awe of it when I was a kid, and now when I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood and all the things that was great about it. I cant fault the Goonies, even now. I still believe it is the perfect kids film.I am probably preaching to the converted, but if you havent seen the Goonies, go and buy it now!

10.0,Steven Spielberg exercises the farthest reached of his imagination in this unforgettable tale of childhood adventures.,"Every kid has imagined what it would be like to go on great and glorious adventures. Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values.

7.0,80s adventure flick revives childhood memories!,"The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a ""new release"" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a ""Goonie"" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including ""Data"" and his supply of gadgets, and ""Chunk"" with his obese but likeable image (love that ""Truffle Shuffle""!). But ""Sloth"" easily stole the show with his own likeable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually ""good enough"" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying!

10.0,"Fun fun fun, but first you have to do the truffle shuffle!","Treasure hunts. Who doesn't remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere? The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.I absolutely loved this movie. It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids. Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren't all that intimidating...they're actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don't judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.There isn't a character in this movie I didn't fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli's, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his ""booty traps...that's what I said, booby traps"" galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth. Those are only a few...there are many more. A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle). I've seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again. This is absolutely a pure, fun-filled movie to enjoy with your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, or simply by yourself. Hang on and enjoy the ride!

10.0,20-somethings and the Goonies,"Just prior to graduating with a degree in Film Studies a lecturer asked us, ""So what's your favourite film now?"" Whilst my peers spouted out Goddard films and obscure German expressionist shorts I sat quietly thinking; my favourite film has been My Favourite Film since I was seven... So when it came to me and I mumbled ""The Goonies"", I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of ""Hey you gu-uys!"" from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they'll whell up and utter ""Sloth loves Chunk"" or adopt a harassed Chinese tone ""Thats what I said...Booty traps!"". And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it's an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We'd loved seeing Indiana's adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and 'become' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We've all grown up together and I'd love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn't disappoint... So if you've not seen it do it right now, and if you have kids sit them down, hold their hand through the scary bits and enjoy!

10.0,Probably the coolest adventure movie of all time!,"The Goonies is eternally a terrific movie that anyone could easily fall in love with. I was a little surprised honestly that this movie isn't on the top 250, because it seems like everyone agrees with me that this is just a plain excellent movie. After all, it is directed by Steven Spielberg, when has he ever misled us? I think this movie is sort of like a time capsule, because you can tell that it was made in the 80's, but it'll forever remain a treasure that will pass on from generation to the next.It's about these pre-teen boys who are about to loose their houses to the local rich guys who will turn their houses into a golf course if their parents don't come up with the money that's wanted. When Mikey, the leader of the Goonies, gets his hands on his father's treasure map that belongs to his museum, he shows his friends, including his older brother, Brandon, that maybe this could be their last adventure to find the treasure and pay off the rich guys! Brandon, his girlfriend, Andy, her friend, Steph, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and Mikey come together to find the treasure. But it's gonna be hard when on the run Fratelli's want the treasure as well and will try to get there first! The Goonies are just so lovable and I would always recommend this not only for the family, but for yourself as well. Because it has great lines, exciting scenes, and just a fantastic story.

,Classic 80s flick,"I love The Goonies. It is a classic 80s children-adventure film. They don't make movies like this anymore... of if they do, its children hurting other children (Cruel Intentions... etc). I do miss that from the 80's... during that time you can have an adventure film that relies on humor and ""monsters"" without an overt display of violence and sex like in todays ""PG13"" movies. Anyway.. I rant... I love all the characters from The Goonies. Chunk is my fav (truffle shuffle, hostage crisis, Dead things Mikey! Dead Things!, and when he starts spatting off Hebrew when he is captured by the Frattellis).

8.0,"Great fun, and a childhood favourite of mine","The Goonies, what a fun movie. I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden.

It's this weird mix of the oddly serious and almost sinister (including a number of dead bodies) with the slapstick - sometimes downright silly - and sentimental that hinders the flick just a bit.

3.0,It must be a nostalgia thing,"I have friends who grew up in the 80s who swear that The Goonies is one of the greatest adventure films ever made. Being in my late teens at the time, I was a little too old to be interested when it first came out, and having finally caught up with the film nearly thirty years later, I can definitely say that I'm waaaay too old for it now. Although I'm usually a sucker for films involving the search for long lost treasure, this noisy, chaotic, poorly acted, desperately unfunny, unexciting waste of a big budget had me wishing I'd never bothered to see what the fuss was all about.When the most comprehensible lines of dialogue in the whole film come from a mentally disabled, drooling freak called Sloth and a character played by Anne Ramsey, then I know I'm in for a rough time. Quite why Spielberg and Donner opted for such an obnoxious collection of unruly brats for this film I'll never understand, the kids' incessant unintelligible screaming seriously grating on the nerves. Until now, I've always had time for Corey Feldman and Sean Astin, but here they are mostly unbearable; even worse are Ke Huy Quan as amateur inventor Data and loud-mouthed tub of lard Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen, both of whom deliver utterly charmless performances.If, like me, you've successfully avoided seeing this film for several decades, I suggest that you keep on doing so and save yourself the disappointment.",it must be nostalgia thing,i have friends who grew up 80s who swear that goonies is one greatest adventure films ever made being my late teens at time i was little too old be interested when it first came out having finally caught up with film nearly thirty years later i can definitely say that im waaaay too old it now although im usually sucker films involving search long lost treasure this noisy chaotic poorly acted desperately unfunny unexciting waste big budget had me wishing id never bothered see what fuss was all about when most comprehensible lines dialogue whole film come mentally disabled drooling freak called sloth character played by anne ramsey then i know im rough time quite why spielberg donner opted such obnoxious collection unruly brats this film ill never understand kids incessant unintelligible screaming seriously grating nerves until now ive always had time corey feldman sean astin but here they are mostly unbearable even worse are ke huy quan as amateur inventor data loud mouthed tub lard chunk played by jeff cohen both whom deliver utterly charmless performances if like me youve successfully avoided seeing this film several decades i suggest that you keep doing so save yourself disappointment,0.5181818181818182,-0.005176767676767679,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7.0,This Spielberg production is a fun movie concerning a feisty bunch of kids providing some very funny moments,"Various sympathetic friends nicknamed The Goonies (Josh Brolin , Sean Astin , Corey Feldman , Corey Haim , Martha Plimpton , Jonathan Quan , Kerri Green...,) form a group of young teens and botcher kiddies who amuse and laugh themselves . However , two underprivileged brothers are about to lose they house by eviction . They spend their time at home with jokes and having fun when they discover an ancient map , then takes place weird deeds and something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined . They hit on a labyrinth of underground tunnels and chambers while attempting to find the centuries-old pirate treasure . If they can recover the treasure without getting caught by the bad boys (Joe Pantoliano , Robert Davi , Anne Ramsey) , then all will be saved. They call themselves ""The Goonies."" The secret caves.

Join the adventure.The pirates map, The villainous crooks, The underground caverns, The booby traps, the skeletons, The monster, the lost treasure, and the magic that is... THE GOONIESThis is an amusing , likeable mess made in Spielberg style , in which a bunch of teens and kiddies set out on an adventure to find a legendary pirate's long-lost treasure , and the main goal was to pay homage to old adventure movies and Spielberg himself and his films of the 1970's ranging reverence from Steven's directorial films . This is a high-energy action fantasy for kids and adolescents of all ages . Entertaining film with funny situations , state-of-art special effects and interesting screenplay by Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg himself . It's excitement all the way as Steven Spielberg and Richard Donner, the makers of 'Indiana Jones', 'Gremlins' and 'Superman', combining forces to create the Family Adventure of the 1985 year .The sets look like the leftovers from Indiana Jones series , and full of amusement and jumpy moments as the children battle ancient pirate bobby traps as well as a trio of rather too hilarious villains played by Robert Davi , Joe Pantoliano and their malicious mother Anne Ramsey . The action speaks for itself , and there's a lot of it . Juvenile honors go to later famous duo : Corey Haim, Corey Feldman , and the endearing fatty boy Jeff Cohen . Imaginative and rousing musical score by Dave Grusin in John Williams style . Top-notch FX , as well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Nick MacLean . Lavishly produced by Steven Spielberg was reportedly on set many times throughout the course of filming . Nicely directed by Richard Donner , an action cinema expert with numerous and prestigious titles (Superman , Assassin , Conspiracy theory , Timeline , Lethal Weapon saga, 16 blocks ..).

I recently saw it again (20 years later), and I know what the problems are. Bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. Everyone yells practically nonstop in the film. You don't believe for a second that any one of these kids is a real person. There's one hint of a decent performance when Sean Astin is recounting the story of One Eyed Willy to his friends in an out of breath monologue. I won't blame the kids, but Spielberg and Donner. Chris Columbus' script felt slapped together in a weekend (probably was under the orders of Spielberg). I have friends who love it, and have fond memories of it as kids, but I guess I've always been overly critical. It's just that I wanted more as a kid.

8.0,One Eyed Willie's Treasure,"I find it interesting that while no film has been made to be a sequel to The Goonies, 3 different video games were derived from this film. Not surprising in that the film itself resembles a video game in that private little world a bunch of kids called The Goonies find beneath an abandoned seaside restaurant on the Pacific coast.The head of the gang is young Sean Astin and acting like a den brother is older sibling Josh Brolin when he's not trying to get something going with Martha Plimpton. Among the rest of the gang is Kerri Green, Jonathan Ke Quan, Corey Feldman, and Jeff Cohen.The kids have an old map found dusty and forgotten in the attic of Astin and Brolin. But also at the same time Anne Ramsey a current Ma Barker has busted one of her Rhodes Scholar sons out of the local jail and they find the abandoned restaurant a most convenient hiding place. So while the kids hunt for the treasure of legendary pirate One Eyed Willie, another group of kids chasing them, the bad guys chasing them all and the law looking for the bad guys, it's all a merry chase.Going below that restaurant the Goonies find an adventure that would be the envy of Indiana Jones filled with all kinds of traps and devices to kill or at least discourage. Obvious that Steven Spielberg borrowed liberally from that film of his to use for this one with juvenile appeal.The Goonies after over 30 years is still great family entertainment.

It's just got a lot to it. There's a cause to fight for, humour in buckets, adventure, terror, crime and romance all encapsulated in a great little story and with performances from some of the best child actors of the eighties.As a child of the eighties myself, it will always have a little nostalgic place in my heart that will remind me to revisit it and often. One of those films that you should definitely share with your own children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews and anyone else who hasn't seen it basically. It sounds like a cliche, but they really don't make them like this anymore. Mostly because they wouldn't get away with it.It is a fantastically funny film with slapstick that doesn't hit you too hard, as well as jokes of a more subtle nature, with something that everyone can enjoy. I love the cartoon sound effects that they used.I can't help but wonder how much of this film was improvised or just what the cameras caught while they were still rolling, as it looks like the cast has a fantastic time making it and there are some bits that are just too brilliant to have been scripted.One of the only issues I have with the film, which I have carried with me since I first saw it, is Sloth. That guy still scares the bejesus out of me even now. I mean, why did they have to make his ears wiggle like that??? To be honest the entire Fratelli family are pretty scary. You certainly wouldn't want to meet them in a dark alley.The only other flaw that I can find, which is true of many films of a similar kind, is that they all shout and talk over each other and it makes it impossible to hear what's going on.Apart from that, this film will always be a classic and should be a marker that all children's adventure flicks should be held up against.",shame shame i know your name,i didnt realise how highly i rated this film until i tried compare it other 700 films that i have reviewed rated over past couple years its just got lot it theres cause fight humour buckets adventure terror crime romance all encapsulated great little story with performances some best child actors eighties as child eighties myself it will always have little nostalgic place my heart that will remind me revisit it often one those films that you should definitely share with your own children grandchildren nieces nephews anyone else who hasnt seen it basically it sounds like cliche but they really dont make them like this anymore mostly because they wouldnt get away with it it is fantastically funny film with slapstick that doesnt hit you too hard as well as jokes more subtle nature with something that everyone can enjoy i love cartoon sound effects that they used i cant help but wonder how much this film was improvised or just what cameras caught while they were still rolling as it looks like cast has fantastic time making it there are some bits that are just too brilliant have been scripted one only issues i have with film which i have carried with me since i first saw it is sloth that guy still scares bejesus out me even now i mean why did they have make his ears wiggle like that be honest entire fratelli family are pretty scary you certainly wouldnt want meet them dark alley only other flaw that i can find which is true many films similar kind is that they all shout talk over each other it makes it impossible hear whats going apart that this film will always be classic should be marker that all childrens adventure flicks should be held up against,0.6110148809523809,0.14966964285714282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"

7.0,Good enough for me.,"Working from a story by executive producer Steven Spielberg, screenwriter Chris Columbus (""Gremlins"") and director Richard Donner (""Superman: The Movie"") here fashioned an appealing old-time adventure for kids and the young at heart. A bunch of rambunctious kids in a small town are due to lose their homes to stereotypically sleazy developers. But in the attic of Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brand (Josh Brolin), they find a map that will supposedly lead them to a legendary pirates' long-lost treasure. They then embark on an underground adventure with no small amount of peril to endure. All the while, they're pursued by a family of criminals including Mama (Anne Ramsey), Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano).Although this viewer didn't really see this in its entirety until he was himself an adult, it still worked quite well, thanks to lively filmmaking from Donner and company, a cracking pace, an assortment of elaborate ""booty"" traps, and an engaging bunch of kid actors, some of them making their feature film debuts. It's a true marvel of production design (by J. Michael Riva), set decoration, and cinematography (by Nick McLean, who also cameos as Mouths' father). The score (mostly by Dave Grusin) is also appropriately rousing, perfect for a movie that involves a bit of swashbuckling at the end. This is spirited entertainment with a healthy amount of humour; Mouths' instructions to Rosalita (Lupe Ontiveros) and Chunks' confessions to the Fratellis are perfect examples. Columbus even works in a reference to ""Gremlins"" at one point.The talented ensemble also includes Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen (who opted not to continue in the acting business) as Chunk, Kerri Green as Andy, Martha Plimpton as Stef, and Ke Huy Quan as Data, the youngster who sees himself as a junior James Bond complete with (malfunctioning) gadgets. Top adult character actors and actresses (Ontiveros, Mary Ellen Trainor, Michael Paul Chan, Gene Ross) turn up as well, with an especially endearing role for pro footballer John Matuszak as the deformed Sloth, mistreated but kindhearted.
