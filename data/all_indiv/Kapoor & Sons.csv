9.0,A Winner All The Way!,"2016 has found its first pleasant surprise in the form of 'Kapoor and Sons'. This One's a Heartwamring, Emotionally Powerful & also Humorous film, that wins you over. The Writing, The Direction & The Performances, all, are Tremendous. 'Kapoor and Sons' Synopsis: After their grandpa (Rishi Kapoor) gets a heart attack, Two Brothers (Fawad Khan & Sidharth Malhotra) come back to Coonoor & re-kindle with their Dysfunctional Family. Chaos Follows...'Kapoor and Sons' is a wholesome entertainer. I was seriously impressed & engrossed by the flow of the narrative. The entire concept, of this imperfect, dysfunctional family & the secrets within them, has a terrific undercurrent of emotions. While the first-hour is light in tone & also keeps space for some great jokes, the second-hour shifts into serious family drama, but the shift in the mood, never slows down the momentum. In fact, 'Kapoor and Sons' strengthens even more as it progresses & you begin to feel for the characters a lot more. Shakun Batra & Ayesha Devitre Dhillon's Screenplay is Tremendous. The Writing is genuinely great, as this story flows wonderfully & ends, on a very high emotional note. There is scope for the emotional bits, comedy, some romance & of course drama. And it all fits in perfectly. Batra's Direction is Excellent. He returns to the Director's chair after a long time & seems more self-assured this time. Cinematography captures the impeccable beauty of Coonoor, aptly. Editing is crisp. Music by Various Artists is melodious. Art & Costume Design are first-rate. Make-Up (Especially for Rishi Kapoor) is fantastic.Performance-Wise: 'Kapoor and Sons' boasts fabulous performances from its cast. Rishi Kapoor is adorable as the grandpa, who is unmistakably naughty & also the sweetest of his bloodline. Fawad Khan does a remarkable job, enacting a difficult role with flourish. His character is ""Unconventional"" & a complete departure from the stereotype ""Hero"" roles. Sidharth Malhotra is natural & portrays a rather sympathetic part with confidence. He & Fawad share a good on-screen chemistry between them & their confrontations are nicely handled too. Ratna Pathak Shah is flawless as the long-suffering woman of the house. Just watch her in the scene when she discovers of Fawad's true-self, her expressions are priceless. Rajat Kapoor is first-rate as the hard to like father/husband. And lastly Alia Bhatt, who's smile alone is worth your ticket.On the whole, 'Kapoor and Sons' is a must watch.

7.0,A Family drama with a twist !!,"The movie is about a dysfunctional Indian family ... the fights , misunderstandings ,complicated relationships .... something which most of us as Indians can easily relate to.The story primarily focuses on two brothers ,Fawad khan , a successful writer living in UK and Siddharth Malhotra, also a wannabe writer still trying to find his feet in the US . It also deals with the lives of their parents Rajat Kapur and Ratna Pathak shah who are trying to get their married life back on track. Not to forget ... the tharki buddha ... Rishi Kapoor as the grandfather, in an awesome role which really invokes spontaneous laughter with his witty one liners. the old one is as horny as a teenager with raging hormones. .. trying to smoke pot on the sly, watch porn on his I-papad (I-pad ) ,making cheesy comments abt the nurses in the hospital and what not . But he is also a lovable old guy who wants to keep the family together and have a happy family pic with all of them ... and hence the title .Complications occur with the entry of Alia Bhatt ( who does not have much of a role ) ..... she first falls for the ""maa ka accha baccha"" Fawad and then realizes that she gets along better with the rebellious Sid ... this causes a lot of complications in the brothers lives .... how they sort out things forms the rest of the story.The first half is light with lots of funny moments mainly due to Rishi Kapoor and his amazing potty ,porn and pyt (pretty young things) jokes. . The second half is more serious .. Rona Dhona ... melodrama and a few twist as the climax unfolds . Remember it is a Karan Johar film ........ and there is someone who is not who he seems to be ... wont tell who thou( spoiler alert!!!) smile emoticon:)All the members of the cast have acted well.""Ladki beautiful "" is quite catchy and will definitely appeal to the young crowd .. nothing much to say abt the music otherwise. Direction is okay .My rating : 3 Stars ( ***). I recommend watching the movie primarily for the 1st half and Rishi Kapoor's acting which really makes it worth every penny spent.",family drama with twist,movie is about dysfunctional indian family fights misunderstandings complicated relationships something which most us as indians can easily relate story primarily focuses two brothers fawad khan successful writer living uk siddharth malhotra also wannabe writer still trying find his feet us it also deals with lives their parents rajat kapur ratna pathak shah who are trying get their married life back track not forget tharki buddha rishi kapoor as grandfather awesome role which really invokes spontaneous laughter with his witty one liners old one is as horny as teenager with raging hormones trying smoke pot sly watch porn his i papad i pad making cheesy comments abt nurses hospital what not but he is also lovable old guy who wants keep family together have happy family pic with all them hence title complications occur with entry alia bhatt who does not have much role she first falls maa ka accha baccha fawad then realizes that she gets along better with rebellious sid this causes lot complications brothers lives how they sort out things forms rest story first half is light with lots funny moments mainly due rishi kapoor his amazing potty porn pyt pretty young things jokes second half is more serious rona dhona melodrama few twist as climax unfolds remember it is karan johar film there is someone who is not who he seems be wont tell who thou spoiler alert smile emoticon all members cast have acted well ladki beautiful is quite catchy will definitely appeal young crowd nothing much say abt music otherwise direction is okay my rating 3 stars i recommend watching movie primarily 1st half rishi kapoors acting which really makes it worth every penny spent,0.4661231884057972,0.2157608695652174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,Lovely!! The first thought that will come to your mind after watching the movie.,"Excellent,adorable,very pleasant and beautiful is the movie ""Kapoor & Sons"".It will make you both laugh(happy) and sad,and eventually tells about the basic beliefs of a family and what is the real meaning of a family.The story brings very much freshness as it is not a conventional family drama movie.It has many aspects and details which keeps the viewer engaged for whole time. The Direction of the movie is very good but it must have been easy as if the story is written so beautifully. Acting is also matching the standards of the story.Rishi Kapoor is as always very good although he just has to sit and deliver his thing.Siddharth Malhotra is fine in his role.Alia Bhatt has also done nice acting.But one of the main element of movie is Fawad Khan he has done excellent acting and at last he makes you love his character. There's lot to say about this movie and it can continue for paragraphs but keeping it short I would say please go and watch this movie and please tell everyone else to watch it.",lovely first thought that will come your mind after watching movie,excellent adorable very pleasant beautiful is movie kapoor sons it will make you both laugh happy sad eventually tells about basic beliefs family what is real meaning family story brings very much freshness as it is not conventional family drama movie it has many aspects details which keeps viewer engaged whole time direction movie is very good but it must have been easy as if story is written so beautifully acting is also matching standards story rishi kapoor is as always very good although he just has sit deliver his thing siddharth malhotra is fine his role alia bhatt has also done nice acting but one main element movie is fawad khan he has done excellent acting at last he makes you love his character theres lot say about this movie it can continue paragraphs but keeping it short i would say please go watch this movie please tell everyone else watch it,0.5471003401360545,0.38647959183673464,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.12}"
10.0,"Kapoor And Sons will make love, laugh and cry - Highly Recommended !!!","""Kapoor And Sons"" was out-of-box thinking family comedy film which was enhanced with matured acting, strong direction and well-defined characters.Rahul (‪#‎FawadKhan‬) meets his brother Arjun (Siddharth Malhotra) after 5 years in Conoor over the news about hospitalization of their grand father(Rishi Kapoor). Enters Tia Malik (Alia Bhatt), a happy- go-lucky gal who enjoys her freedom and lives her life to the fullest, who changes the fate of the brothers forever after they meet her.Directed by Shakun Batra, who previously made the well-liked ""Ek Main Aur EK Tu"" dares to cross the line and the result is fruitful. Hats off to the director for choosing such a different subject which challenges the patience of the audience and yet follows the simplicity of Indian Cinema. The film may start of with a typical boy-meet-girl romance but ends on something which I could never ever thought of. Batra succeeds in etching the characters of ""Kapoor And Sons"" with zest and vibrant which makes the film more alluring. Screenplay is commendable keeping audience's interest alive. Rishi Kapoor is the soul of the film. The veteran actor is magnificent and gives an electrifying performance. Fawad Khan is getting better with each film. He has given his best performance till now and is on the verge of becoming a method actor. Rajat Kapoor and Ratna Pathak drives the film to next level. Both actors have done a commendable job. Siddharth Malhotra is decent in his role while Alia Bhatt is always a reliable when it comes to acting. Cinematography is outstanding capturing the beautiful location of Conoor. Production design is simple yet charming. Music by Amaal Mallik, Badshah and Arko is a big let down with none of songs being memorable after you leave the theater.So , overall , a perfect family flick coupled with strong performances and brilliant direction.

9.0,"Not every family is happy,but that doesn't mean it isn't a family","A Grumpy Ole Bollywood story showing happy families starting on a positive note, followed by a tragedy being finally resolved in the climax is so prevalent since generations that we believe this is the story of every Indian family, the irony being: this is the story of every other family, not ours.Shakun Batra's Kapoor & Sons Since 1921 kills this myth and tells the story that is more ours than anyone else's. Kapoor & Sons is a story of a dysfunctional family living in the hills of Coonoor. A financially struggling Harsh Kapoor(Rajat Kapoor) living in a house with an unhappy wife Sunita(Ratna Pathak Shah) and heart patient but larger-than- life father(Rishi Kapoor) whose last wish is to have a full family photo being framed before his death.Harsh and Sunita have two sons: Rahul(Fawad Khan), the elder and perfect son who is a successful writer settled in UK and Arjun(Siddharth Malhotra), the younger son struggling on his own novel and surviving by doing different jobs in the States.Both Rahul and Arjun arrive home after learning that their Dadu has suffered from a cardiac arrest. This is where they both meet and become involved with the same girl Tia(Alia Bhatt), a freelancer taking care of an ancient property in the town and looking to sell it.The movie moves at a subtle pace giving us some beautiful and light moments until a moment when a web of secrets slowly start to unravel including a lie that threatens to tear the family apart. It gives you a feel-good vibe while keeping you attached with every character all through and giving a healthy dose of laughter induced frequently by the modern-age porn-loving Dadu and his antics.The performances of the whole cast are admirable. Rajat Kapoor as a man under the pressure of obligation to his family but unappreciated for his efforts is excellent. Ratna Pathak Shah as a faithful wife living in a burdened marriage and a proud mother is exemplary. Rishi Kapoor with his sarcastic one-liners is lovable. His interactions with his grandsons regarding porn is a treat to watch. Alia Bhatt is bubbly and beautiful at the same time. Siddarth Malhotra is the weakest link in the movie unable to transform himself from a cheated yet moved-on teenager to a distraught adult is unconvincing. But it is Fawad Khan who delivers a masterclass and holds the movie together as Rahul, the not-so-perfect son showing why he is a celebrated actor in Pakistan. Sukant Goel as Wasim also deserves a mention.The only flaw in the movie is the unraveling of the mysteries that you are confused, who is to blame and who is to be sympathized.All in all a decent byproduct by Shakun Batra who after his 'Ekk Main Aur Ekk Tu' has made a mark with his mature narratives. The movie delivers a beautiful message that even if there are problems, one should never abandon his family.",not every family is happy but that doesnt mean it isnt family,grumpy ole bollywood story showing happy families starting positive note followed by tragedy being finally resolved climax is so prevalent since generations that we believe this is story every indian family irony being this is story every other family not ours shakun batras kapoor sons since 1921 kills this myth tells story that is more ours than anyone elses kapoor sons is story dysfunctional family living hills coonoor financially struggling harsh kapoor rajat kapoor living house with unhappy wife sunita ratna pathak shah heart patient but larger than life father rishi kapoor whose last wish is have full family photo being framed before his death harsh sunita have two sons rahul fawad khan elder perfect son who is successful writer settled uk arjun siddharth malhotra younger son struggling his own novel surviving by doing different jobs states both rahul arjun arrive home after learning that their dadu has suffered cardiac arrest this is where they both meet become involved with same girl tia alia bhatt freelancer taking care ancient property town looking sell it movie moves at subtle pace giving us some beautiful light moments until moment when web secrets slowly start unravel including lie that threatens tear family apart it gives you feel good vibe while keeping you attached with every character all through giving healthy dose laughter induced frequently by modern age porn loving dadu his antics performances whole cast are admirable rajat kapoor as man under pressure obligation his family but unappreciated his efforts is excellent ratna pathak shah as faithful wife living burdened marriage proud mother is exemplary rishi kapoor with his sarcastic one liners is lovable his interactions with his grandsons regarding porn is treat watch alia bhatt is bubbly beautiful at same time siddarth malhotra is weakest link movie unable transform himself cheated yet moved teenager distraught adult is unconvincing but it is fawad khan who delivers masterclass holds movie together as rahul not so perfect son showing why he is celebrated actor pakistan sukant goel as wasim also deserves mention only flaw movie is unraveling mysteries that you are confused who is blame who is be sympathized all all decent byproduct by shakun batra who after his ekk main aur ekk tu has made mark with his mature narratives movie delivers beautiful message that even if there are problems one should never abandon his family,0.6005024737167594,0.22019944341372907,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,This family entertainer is a must watch!,"To start with, Rishi Kapoor takes the cake. And his Oscar winning make up artist (It take 6-8 hours to get that makeup done). Its not laudable just because Rishi Kapoor went thru that painstakingly slow process of getting the make up done but because he was the funniest person on the screen and whenever he was not in a scene I was just hoping his character will pop up somehow and crack us all up. Kapoor and Sons is a pure family drama (with a lot of humour) along with one witty Dadu in the house, his 2 sons (Rajat Kapoor + 1) and Rajat's 2 sons - Fawad being the elder son who gets all the pampering and Sidharth the so called chota nikkamma son.The best part about the movie is that it sticks to its title. Its about the Kapoor and sons and thats exactly what you get to see in this 2 hours and 20 minutes of drama, comedy and romance. The sons and their struggles, their inhibitions, their lies and their love. The other beautiful part is the direction and dialogues. Every time the family erupts in a brawl it does not appear made up. It seems as though a real family is fighting with real issues, its not filmy at all. Watch out for the plumber scene. His punchline is ultimate and so apt for that scene. Birthday part was neat too. We have not really seen much of Fawad Khan but this movie could as well be a turning point in his acting career in Bollywood. This changes everything for him. He has delivered real well. Not been a fan of Sidharth Malhotra myself but am not complaining with his performance either. But the true acting stars are Rajat Kapoor and Ratna Pathak (after Rishi Kapoor). Their acting standards needs no introduction and they have outperformed themselves, as always. Alia Bhat brings the glamour factor to the movie (after Fawad) and she seem to get connected to the family instantly (and how! watch out for the mess up). For the one liners, the argument scenes, the humour, the complexity in the relationships between each other/ with others and for the Kapoors and Sons, go watch it!",this family entertainer is must watch,start with rishi kapoor takes cake his oscar winning make up artist it take 6 8 hours get that makeup done its not laudable just because rishi kapoor went thru that painstakingly slow process getting make up done but because he was funniest person screen whenever he was not scene i was just hoping his character will pop up somehow crack us all up kapoor sons is pure family drama with lot humour along with one witty dadu house his 2 sons rajat kapoor 1 rajats 2 sons fawad being elder son who gets all pampering sidharth so called chota nikkamma son best part about movie is that it sticks its title its about kapoor sons thats exactly what you get see this 2 hours 20 minutes drama comedy romance sons their struggles their inhibitions their lies their love other beautiful part is direction dialogues every time family erupts brawl it does not appear made up it seems as though real family is fighting with real issues its not filmy at all watch out plumber scene his punchline is ultimate so apt that scene birthday part was neat too we have not really seen much fawad khan but this movie could as well be turning point his acting career bollywood this changes everything him he has delivered real well not been fan sidharth malhotra myself but am not complaining with his performance either but true acting stars are rajat kapoor ratna pathak after rishi kapoor their acting standards needs no introduction they have outperformed themselves as always alia bhat brings glamour factor movie after fawad she seem get connected family instantly how watch out mess up one liners argument scenes humour complexity relationships between each other with others kapoors sons go watch it,0.4496376811594203,0.20605590062111803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,A great family movie questioning and answering the essential values to make your family the ideal one,"It is so natural to find another family more perfect than yours. And am sure at some point or another we all have wished if we could one chance to peep into someone else's perfect world or be a part of it. Kapoor & Sons gives you that opportunity. Shot at a beautiful place, Conoor,showcasing a house which am sure will be envied by many. 2016 till now has seen many good movies. This is a bit different because of its plot.And maybe because of its simple execution yet complex reasonings. For one, it actually felt that I was not watching a movie but merely peeping into the lives of Kapoor & Sons. Such was the portrayal by all.Fantastic job by the Director Shakun Batra. And a fantastic job by the Editor Shivkumar V. Panicker. And nothing would have started had it not been for the story. Credit going out to Shakun and Ayesha DeVitre. Stars like Alia Bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra, Fawad Khan. All did exceptionally well in the part they were to play. And the binding factor, Kapoor Sahab, so effortlessly performed by Rishi Kapoor. Superb! The film takes you across the realm of wishes to reality, to realization and beyond. Raising and answering questions, which today's times have made us ignore, or maybe we have chosen to ignore. It's a nice family package which endeavors to identify the thin sensitive line which binds the family in strong bonds. Definitely a movie to be seen. And don't bother to screen. Take all generations with you. You never know. Together you might get the path to make your family, the perfect one.

,All for a Family photograph,"One of the best, non-mainstream (except for its songs) portrayal of a well-to-do dysfunctional family, that can be forgiven its mainstream transgressions, because, as a whole, its really holds up to scrutiny. There are (unintended?) callbacks to 'Fireflies' (more on that below), but mainly Hollywood Indie dysfunctional family-fare like 'Dan in real life', 'Winter Passing' and 'The Family Stone', though it does not reach their heights (or depths, if you're thinking of those movies plumbing thru dark themes). Content is king, and the makers focus on the narrative rather than the paraphernalia that bollywood often goes for, which makes this a breath of relatively better air.Make no mistake, its all predictable, a la 'Finding Fanny' (to me, it was a disappointment, since I had expected Adajania to aim higher than his debut masterpiece, 'Being Cyrus'), but gets the overall tone right. The flick looks and sounds good, with credit to the techs involved. And I dunno what's it about hill stations and rich dysfunctional families with dramatic pasts that they have to revisit in the course of a movie's running time. Remember Sabal Singh Shekhawat's 'Fireflies'? It trod the same ground, albeit in a darker, less dramatic manner, and man did it look great (my review here - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375666/reviews-1)... In any case, this is a far superior effort to the writing/directing team's earlier effort, 'Ek main aur Ek tu' (ripped off of 'What happens in Vegas', which wasn't a great source, in the first place). Miles ahead, miles above. No exaggeration.Performance-wise, the mainstream stars are just about adequate, but have the audience eating outta their fingers, and while seasoned veterans like Ratna Pathak Shah and Rajat Kapoor are fantastic, the revelation, to me, was actor Fawad Khan, who's prolly playing one of the most difficult roles, considering the milieu, and gives one of the most dignified portrayals I've seen to date, no matter which language this has been shot in.One of the most interesting things though - is how each dramatic beat seems to have been shot like an action sequence, with 2 different dramatic tones in play, 2 different scenarios in play, each reaching its comedic/drama-comedic/dramatic crescendo. This happens about 3 times in the movie, and is not unlike the setting up, and execution of, 3 different action set-pieces, with the intensity being heightened up a notch each time. Fascinating viewing, if you're looking for something like that, or not.Rishi Kapoor's old guy makeup detracts, the way Kamal's copy of Mrs. Doubtfire did, regardless of the credit heaped on the techs involved, its a 'dry' look, which takes away from the intended effect. RK is a great actor, but if they needed him to look 90, his role could have been cast better, using an actual older actor in his stead. For a movie that seems to take pride in not glossing over the little things, this one was way too big to ignore.The way certain nouveau topics have been treated in this flick, with one of them being the addressing of p*** (won't reveal the other, since it is integral to the plot), is refreshingly mature, and absolutely empathetic. Something new in a mainstream flick (I did call it Indie, but it is getting a huge mainstream push, courtesy the distributor/s). Very, very welcome. Though you would not think that if you were forced to play close attention to (all genders involved) the catcalls/hoots/comments coming from universally regressive minds in the multiplex (who'd surely take offense if you went ahead and identified their real selves to them). Sigh. Nothing's perfect. The kicker? Some of them brought their kids to watch this (for-sure adult/mature content. Perhaps the jokes' on them, eventually? One can hope.There are a couple of interestingly woven twists almost right into the final act, which, in spite of being predictable, pack a wallop. Good writing, great enacting. The (anti)smoking warnings do not detract from the viewing experience (esp. since there are multiple sequences of good ol' smoking, not just ciggies, mind), but that's perhaps because this is a movie that comes from a prestigious production house, which can take the local censor board on, if necessary.

8.0,You can find yourself in this family drama,"kapoor and Sons- Initially, after watching the 1st trailer of the movie, I didn't expect so much from it as the trailer was reflecting the ordinary family drama with lots of useless ""wear and tear"", but to my surprise, Kapoor and Sons undoubtedly surpassed my expectations with its great logical and touching storyline together with excellent performances from the actors which works like an icing on the cake. The story is about the differences in a family and how the family members come with the answers to their ignored questions. The most affecting thing about the movie is its direction, the movie goes so smoothly and appealingly that it binds you with itself and you don't be able to slide your attention for a bit. You started finding a connect with the characters in no time. In terms of story, direction and screenplay, the movie is undoubtedly 10/10. When it comes to performances, the real scene-stealer is Rishi kapoor, he reminded me of Amitabh bachchan in Piku, outstanding piece of performance from his side. The second scene-stealer of this 132 mins. family drama is Fawad Khan, how easily he carries his character in the movie is a treat to watch. Apart from these two Alia Bhatt, although in a short role, marks her presence with some terrific moments. Rest of the cast have also worked wonders. Remaining covers the plot and the movie's authenticity with the reality of life.

7.0,Intelligent family drama,"Kapoor & Sons review :Take a short vacation to the scenic Coonoor to meet this ultimate dysfunctional family. Truly, every member of the Kapoor clan has his/her own dark secret to guard with insecurities abound. Welcome then to the Karan Johar version of 'Dil Dhadakne Do' (2015) meets 'Monsoon Wedding' (2001).Let me now have the priviledge of introducing you to each of the family members:Dadu Kapoor (Rishi Kapoor) : A naughty at 90 grandpa who has fun browsing Mandakini's 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili' (1985) videos on his ""i-papad"" and cheating his friends at a card game, Dadu is the eldest Kapoor who wants his family in a saath saath pose for a family pic. Rishi Kapoor brilliantly transforms in to a nonagenarian with heavy prosthetics and right body language to deliver a memorable performance.Harsh Kapoor (Rajat Kapoor) : He's a father of two young sons cheating on his wife and going through a financial downside. Rajat Kapoor, a fine actor that he is, goes through the role effortlessly.Sunita Kapoor (Ratna Pathak) : She's the lady of the house and under severe emotional stress owing to her husbands suspected infidelity and her sons' sibling rivalry. Ratna Pathak is impressive as ever in a character which is slightly over the top and over reacts most of the time..Rahul Kapoor (Fawad Khan) : The achcha beta of the family, he's hot in looks and cool in attitude. Nursing a dark secret of his own, Rahul is the catalyst for most of the subplots in the Kapoor story. Fawad Khan has got in to the skin of his character and his is the real standout performance in the movie after Rishi Kapoor. Kudos!Arjun Kapoor (Siddharth Malhotra) : The punching bag and misunderstood guy in the family, Arjun has been unlucky professionally and trying hard to succeed. His life changes when he meets Tia. Siddharth Malhotra is earnest as Arjun displaying the right amount of restraint and vulnerability.Tia Mallik (Alia Bhatt) : She's the happy go lucky neighbour of Kapoor's who becomes a bone of contention between the two brothers. Alia Bhatt is pleasing on the eyes and does well whatever is expected out of her.Director Shakun Batra's second outing after 'Ek Main aur Ekk Tu' (2012) - a film I loved tremondously but didn't get its due, is a cleverly packaged family drama which should strike a chord with the urban classes. Relying more on performances than the script, Kapoor & Sons is a likeable fare.

7.0,"A movie that has nothing special, but something is really special","As soon as you see Dharma productions and these type of stars, there's a mindset created for the whole story line. Despite being on those same lines, this movie has its own charm in many ways. Right from the start, it creates an aura that's not new but lays its own significance. It has nice dialogue writing that flavors all types of moments in the film. It has usual family fights, still it provides a very light-hearted cinematography. Even after summing up all the points, 'Kapoor and Sons' is definitely forgettable. Nevertheless, it's a real good time pass. It has nothing special, but something is really special.Shakun Batra really has something when it comes to direction. Similar to the feel that his films provide, you'll not know that what you've liked, but you really enjoy. His direction is like a fuel that can lighten any dull thing. Even a family jhagda was directed in a very interesting way. I hope he gets a good script someday and his talent is rated well.Unsurprisingly, a certain star of the show was Rishi Kapoor. His complete indulgence in the character is just marvelous. A nearly perfect old man role stuffed with all ingredients in the right amount. All other actors have done a very good job. Each one has done full justice to their respective roles.Overall, a movie that has nothing special, but something is really special.",movie that has nothing special but something is really special,as soon as you see dharma productions these type stars theres mindset created whole story line despite being those same lines this movie has its own charm many ways right start it creates aura thats not new but lays its own significance it has nice dialogue writing that flavors all types moments film it has usual family fights still it provides very light hearted cinematography even after summing up all points kapoor sons is definitely forgettable nevertheless its real good time pass it has nothing special but something is really special shakun batra really has something when it comes direction similar feel that his films provide youll not know that what youve liked but you really enjoy his direction is like fuel that can lighten any dull thing even family jhagda was directed very interesting way i hope he gets good script someday his talent is rated well unsurprisingly certain star show was rishi kapoor his complete indulgence character is just marvelous nearly perfect old man role stuffed with all ingredients right amount all other actors have done very good job each one has done full justice their respective roles overall movie that has nothing special but something is really special,0.5601659451659453,0.32565897065897065,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,A highly subjective review,"Dear Shakun Batra, You made a film about the most boring people one could ever imagine. Yes, the two sons (Fawad and Sidharth) are writers. But they are of the Chetan Bhagat/Madhuri Banerjee variety. Or a genteel Amitav Ghosh/Tarun Tejpal at best. The father (Rajat Kapoor) is the sort who has like one drink every night. Oh and he is having an affair. Less said about the mother, the better. She does weird stuff like take one son's novel and give it to the other. For the silliest reason. Wtf? That part would have been interesting if it was expanded upon. But the mother explains it away. And well, things return to normal. The granddad (Rishi Kapoor) likes to watch porn and is very mischievous - his character is just a collection of the worst sort of clichés. The heroine is your typical obnoxiously modern (shouts a lot and acts like a male, drinks beer (nothing wrong with that) and hits on guys) girl. Her character is also a collection of clichés. This is NOT a dysfunctional family. There are no pathetic losers in this family. They are all winners who pretend to be dysfunctional. These are the sort of people who have great table manners. They drink fine wine and read Gabriel Garcia Marquez. And thinks that Di Caprio is a great actor. They are the sort of people who are socially mobile. Nothing interesting happens in the whole film. Just the regular problems of boring regular successful people. Best Regards, Pimpin.

7.0,Family Drama - An emotional roller coaster,"This is one emotional roller coaster ride. Roller coaster doesn't mean the movie is going to be fast paced, it is a pure drama genre which rolls around a dysfunctional family taking emotional twists and turns. Having said that if you want to know what is the meaning of a dysfunctional family watch this movie. The story revolves strongly around six characters which include a Grand Pa, Dad, Mom and two sons and a girl who plays the sons' love interest. So now you do the math and this is not a usual cinematic family with all artificialness or two boys falling for one girl type of story. The screenplay is structured in such a way you have a leisurely watch in the first half and a revelation session second half. Yes, as the story moves on towards the second half lots of secrets open up and emotions play around which include conflict in family, child neglect, fight, abuse etc., This movie lauds best performances delivered by the leads which eventually becomes the backbone of the tale. Rajat and Rathan Pathak they were so natural and vivid in their characters. Siddharth Malhothra delivers a decent performance with the usual struggling youth character and our Star import Fawad Khan was simply superb and wickedly talented playing his part which involves unconventional twists.Rishi Kapoor as the naughty and family love longing grandpa stands as an epitome of dedication at this age towards delivering a role which involves a heavy makeup session every day. Miss Bhatt adding the love spice to the story plays cool with her overloaded cuteness turns which will make any boy go crazy.As a South Indian viewer, I had one thing which kept on resonating in my mind was the location which said Coonoor a village in the famous hill station in Tamil Nadu where there is least chance of North Indians settling and this film boasts too many Hindi party surroundings and coversations. I felt it could have been reasoned out properly.Overall I enjoyed the movie and would give 7.5 on 10.

9.0,Surrendering to the will to live?,"Maybe, like what Schopenhauer said, every life history is the history of suffering. Life has no intrinsic worth but is kept in motion loosely by desire and illusion. We hopelessly fall in love, to marry to do everything possible to become an object of disgust to each other. The 'will to live' for continuity of progeny has hijacked our will power. He further went on to say that our inborn error is to think that we exist to be happy. But at every turn, we soon realise the contradiction that the world and life have to offer. It seems that is why the face of the elderly intrinsically appear deeply frowned and depressed, realising the futility of life and death that will ensue.From the moment of the first cry, life is just a barrage of tests, tragedy and turmoil. We somehow are geniuses in creating troubles for ourselves. Rational people make rash decisions under the influence of emotion, giving intellect a rest. We think we are wiser with time and will not make the same mistake twice. Once bitten twice shy, we tell ourselves. But hell no! At the most crucial moment, our hormones and heart dominate over our intellect. Like Sisyphus, within the cycles of seeming joy of achievement and agony of defeat, we have to find contentment.Aristotle believed that the final goal of mankind is happiness, and this is achieved with virtue and knowledge. The Greek thought we needed tragedy in life, through art and culture, to remind us of the hopelessness of life. It is a catharsis of sorts for us to purify our minds and souls to understand truths about suffering, loss, misery, adversity, and redemption.This 2016 film is not the usual Bollywood fare. Done in a not so melodramatic fashion, it showcases the issues an average middle-class family encounters as the husband-and-wife couple is married too long to each other and their children have all grown up with a mind of their own. The husband and wife cannot stand the sight of each other. Their every action seems like an annoyance. Sometimes they ponder where love disappeared to. Trying to make the most politically correct response and trying to pacify warring factions between offspring proof stressful. Celebrations come and go. Everybody puts a brave front, putting fake smiles to display of portrait of happiness. Simmering beneath the cover are the frustrations, anger and disappointments of broken dreams just waiting to explode. The display of emotion does not always end in resolution. The end result can sometimes be quite devastating, and we wallow in melancholy. Hindsight vision is 20/20. We had seen it all along. We tell ourselves that we will be wiser the next around. But we will never learn, just waiting to plunge on head-on to the speeding trailer all over again.",surrendering will live,maybe like what schopenhauer said every life history is history suffering life has no intrinsic worth but is kept motion loosely by desire illusion we hopelessly fall love marry do everything possible become object disgust each other will live continuity progeny has hijacked our will power he further went say that our inborn error is think that we exist be happy but at every turn we soon realise contradiction that world life have offer it seems that is why face elderly intrinsically appear deeply frowned depressed realising futility life death that will ensue moment first cry life is just barrage tests tragedy turmoil we somehow are geniuses creating troubles ourselves rational people make rash decisions under influence emotion giving intellect rest we think we are wiser with time will not make same mistake twice once bitten twice shy we tell ourselves but hell no at most crucial moment our hormones heart dominate over our intellect like sisyphus within cycles seeming joy achievement agony defeat we have find contentment aristotle believed that final goal mankind is happiness this is achieved with virtue knowledge greek thought we needed tragedy life through art culture remind us hopelessness life it is catharsis sorts us purify our minds souls understand truths about suffering loss misery adversity redemption this 2016 film is not usual bollywood fare done not so melodramatic fashion it showcases issues average middle class family encounters as husband wife couple is married too long each other their children have all grown up with mind their own husband wife cannot stand sight each other their every action seems like annoyance sometimes they ponder where love disappeared trying make most politically correct response trying pacify warring factions between offspring proof stressful celebrations come go everybody puts brave front putting fake smiles display portrait happiness simmering beneath cover are frustrations anger disappointments broken dreams just waiting explode display emotion does not always end resolution end result can sometimes be quite devastating we wallow melancholy hindsight vision is 20 20 we had seen it all along we tell ourselves that we will be wiser next around but we will never learn just waiting plunge head speeding trailer all over again,0.4540148448043184,0.10383695252116305,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,The reality of most families!,"The film has such a great sense of realness to it that I can't imagine a person, or a family, especially a desi one, watching this film and not being able to draw similarities between the family shown in the film to his/her/their own experiences.It is the story, a perfect story, of not only a family with issues, but possibly of any family that might have even had minor issues to deal with. I can personally testify that there were so many occasions in the film where I could associate it to something that might have happened with me in the past, or with a family member, or both.The greatness of the film yet lies in the fact that no one is perfect, and that everyone makes mistakes, of different magnitudes and forms, and yet everyone criticises the other and looks down on the other family member's mistake. The key is to let bygones be bygones, to develop patience to tolerate each other's mistakes and let it not come down to the death of a family member to realise his/his worth, or the worth of your family in general.And that's where the film seals the deal: the death of someone, the death that makes you realise the utter nonsense nature of things that you had been begrudging over each other all those years. Let it never come down to that, remember.The death scene, the accident itself was such a horrific one. I literally got a jolt when he hit into that truck! An extremely well shot scene!And before I sound like the wisest guy on the planet, I feel like adding here that is the past experiences at a pretty young age that taught me all this. For us though, what it took to get us all together was my illness that followed a surgery which kept me for more than two months in the ICU. Despite the immense suffering that I endured, it was an incredibly emotional and memorable phase of my life, to see things come together, to see ""them"" come together. This further highlights what an accurate film it was, and how brilliant it was at highlighting the story of almost every family, if not all.

8.0,"""Kapoor and Sons"" has humor, drama and message to spare!","Family relations can be complex, challenging and sometimes overwhelming. Where there is family, there is history. Where there is history, there are both good memories and bad. Where there are good memories, there is shared joy, but where there are bad memories, there can be grudges. Family is also supposed to mean love and togetherness, but sometimes, either or both may be lacking. Unresolved issues, long-standing resentments and unspoken pain can be part of the family dynamic, along with competing priorities, misunderstandings, sibling rivalries, strained marriages and even loneliness. You'll find all this and more in the Indian 2016 comedy-drama ""Kapoor and Sons: Since 1921"" (NR, 2:12).Amarjeet ""Dadu"" Kapoor (Rishi Kapoor, playing three decades older than his actual age, with the help of Oscar-winning make-up artist Greg Cannom) lives in the only home he has ever known – a bungalow in the small, hilly and relatively wealthy southeastern India town of Coonoor. Also in the house is his son, Harsh (Rajat Kapoor) and daughter-in-law Sunita (Ratna Pathak). Harsh and Sunita have two grown sons who both live outside of India. Rahul (Fawad Afzal Khan) lives in London and is a writer who has had a successful book, but is having trouble finishing his follow-up – and has a deadline hanging over his head. His brother Arjun (Sidharth Malhotra) is an aspiring novelist, but is working as a New Jersey bartender.When Dadu has a heart attack, his grandsons fly home to be with him and the rest of the family. Dadu recovers and he's soon back to his old uninhibited self, full of personality and generally only thinking about three things – young women, his own death, and family. Dadu's family decides to plan a surprise party for his upcoming 90th birthday and while they're doing so, Rahul and Arjun each end up meeting and spending time with a beautiful, lively, strong and independent young girl named Tia (Alia Bhatt), but neither brother is aware of the other's relationship with Tia and she doesn't know that they are bothers.But that's only the beginning of this family's problems, more of which reveal themselves at Dadu's party. Dadu's other son and his family also come to visit and pay their respects to Dadu. Dadu wants the family together so they can all take a family photo before he dies. As the family members gather for that photo the cracks between them widen and more secrets are revealed, jeopardizing whether Dadu's photo will even be taken – and whether some members of the Kapoor family will ever speak to each other again.""Kapoor and Sons"" is a funny, dramatic and touching character-driven story. Dadu is quite a character and both his words and his deeds are a consistent source of amusement. Tai is adorable, sweet, fun, funny and sympathetic in equal parts. The numerous conflicts among the younger two generations of the Kapoor family intersect in surprisingly affecting ways and have significant lessons to teach about communication, honesty, forgiveness, tolerance, the value of familial bonds and, most of all, love.I can't remember the last time I saw conflicts that were set up better throughout the story, woven together so skillfully, produce such drama when they all come together or teach the audience so much about so many truths concerning life and family. When this house of cards collapsed, it left me breathless – and very impressed. This movie is a bit too long and some moments were a little too predictable and/or melodramatic, but this is still a well-acted, powerful and entertaining film whose plot, message and lessons transcend any single generation or culture.

10.0,Imperfect Perfection!,"With a beautiful script and wonderfully thought provoking dialogues, this is a story of how 2 mistakes and one truth can build up pressure that shatters a family. But how acquiring the willingness to forgive with time, can bring the family back together.Acting is phenomenal all around. Rajat Kapoor is brilliant. Alia Bhatt shines even in a small role. Siddharth Malhotra's growth as an actor can be visibly seen as he is so real in many moments. Ratna Pathak Shah is great, and has many great scenes (especially near the end). Coming to the two standouts- It's just sad we lost Rishi Kapoor so young. Man was a legend!! He is so funny, raw, real, tired, juvenile, jovial, authentic and emotional in this role...no words...just chef's kiss.For me, the absolute best performance (and also the meatiest role) was portrayed by the outsider- Fawad Khan! I really wish Indo-Pak relations stay healthy so Bollywood can be further graced by his presence. The shades of subtle insecurity, fear, anger and emotions in his portrayal just add to an already impeccably authentic performance. So good!Cinematography and music are excellent as well.My only gripe is that it could do without the one item number.But all in all, this movie is an underrated Bollywood gem and one of the most realistically brilliant family dramas in recent history.",imperfect perfection,with beautiful script wonderfully thought provoking dialogues this is story how 2 mistakes one truth can build up pressure that shatters family but how acquiring willingness forgive with time can bring family back together acting is phenomenal all around rajat kapoor is brilliant alia bhatt shines even small role siddharth malhotras growth as actor can be visibly seen as he is so real many moments ratna pathak shah is great has many great scenes especially near end coming two standouts its just sad we lost rishi kapoor so young man was legend he is so funny raw real tired juvenile jovial authentic emotional this role no words just chefs kiss me absolute best performance also meatiest role was portrayed by outsider fawad khan i really wish indo pak relations stay healthy so bollywood can be further graced by his presence shades subtle insecurity fear anger emotions his portrayal just add already impeccably authentic performance so good cinematography music are excellent as well my only gripe is that it could do without one item number but all all this movie is underrated bollywood gem one most realistically brilliant family dramas recent history,0.6223981900452489,0.28782051282051285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.2}"

6.0,"Ratna & Fawad are good, screenplay is superb. Otherwise boring!","Lot's of people and critics are praising about this movie. Some are saying that this is the best of this year up till now. But, frankly speaking, I'm not agree with these kind of statements or even these kind of positive reviews of this movie. Director Shakun Batra, who earlier directed Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, which was not a hit, comes back with this family drama. I must say it is far better than the previous one. The major plus point is the screenplay. Scenes have been written so well. Because of that, the shooting schedule had been completed in a shorter time, I guess. Actors are good. Location is suitable. Background score is perfect. And I think, because of the number of twists and turns is more in the post interval part, critics loved this film. But, I want to ask them, what about the boring portions in the first half!? Alia Bhatt is as cute as she looks earlier in her films. Sidharth Malhotra lacks in acting in some scenes. And I heard this statement from many viewers. Rajat Kapoor is good. Rishi Kapoor is funny and adorable. His make-up is the only time-taking thing in the whole movie. Two factors that affect the movie are Fawad Khan and Ratna Pathak Shah. She is the best actor of this movie. And for Fawad, if you please don't consider his character, haha, I like him. He looks hot and charming and stylish. So, a hero material has been found. He will go far and up. Chul song is a waste of time for me. Two background songs are good. Comedy is fine. Bhajan in iPad, Mandakini the heroine, the plumber asking for the money- these are my favorite comic scenes. So, I think this film is a one time watch. As I've seen Pyar Ka Punchnama 2 as an overrated movie last year, this movie stands for this category in this year. On the whole, I am confuse about what I get from the film. So the praising audience, who find out the meaning of life and relationships from this film, can you help me",ratna fawad are good screenplay is superb otherwise boring,lots people critics are praising about this movie some are saying that this is best this year up till now but frankly speaking im not agree with these kind statements or even these kind positive reviews this movie director shakun batra who earlier directed ek main aur ek tu which was not hit comes back with this family drama i must say it is far better than previous one major plus point is screenplay scenes have been written so well because that shooting schedule had been completed shorter time i guess actors are good location is suitable background score is perfect i think because number twists turns is more post interval part critics loved this film but i want ask them what about boring portions first half alia bhatt is as cute as she looks earlier her films sidharth malhotra lacks acting some scenes i heard this statement many viewers rajat kapoor is good rishi kapoor is funny adorable his make up is only time taking thing whole movie two factors that affect movie are fawad khan ratna pathak shah she is best actor this movie fawad if you please dont consider his character haha i like him he looks hot charming stylish so hero material has been found he will go far up chul song is waste time me two background songs are good comedy is fine bhajan ipad mandakini heroine plumber asking money these are my favorite comic scenes so i think this film is one time watch as ive seen pyar ka punchnama 2 as overrated movie last year this movie stands this category this year whole i am confuse about what i get film so praising audience who find out meaning life relationships this film can you help me,0.6116391184573003,0.30885847107438,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.23}"
