9,A Genuine Love Story,"What a magnificent story with great direction and cinematography. I can't believe that the film was directed by a debut director. It is said that the director took almost 7 years to complete the film. This itself shows his sincerity to the film.Jomon T. John, had an epic comeback to films after a short period of time. He had done an amazing work to the film which made it, a blockbuster.Gopi Sunder again made his eminence in background scores through the film with some amazing piece of 'ringtone-to-be' scores.Prithviraj, experiencing an increase in his prestige through the film, made all the teenagers and college students, their own 'Prithvi'. His genuine way of acting will surely make him an award winner this year. Talking about the lead actress i.e Kanchanamala played by Parvathi Menon, was superb and had a stunning boldness and sensitive mind which made her a perfect heroine. The film had enough comedies without making the audience bore and had a twist and a sentimental climax. The supporting casts were superb especially, Appu played by Tovino Thomas and Sethu played by Bala. The camera and director showed their significance again very well in the climax scene. Unni Mohammed Sahib played by Saikumar, had a great sense of boldness and strong attraction towards his party as a Freedom Fighter in the film. Art Direction and Make-up was obviously great and magnificent as it is very strenuous and difficult to make a new film old or to make it in a background of 1960's. This film is an excellent example of Malayalam film industry and is certainly, a landmark film for the Malayalam Industry and hopes, for an another one like this.Adult Film - No | Family film - Obviously | Direction - 10/10 | Cinematography - 10/10 | Cast - 9.5/10 | Make Up - 10/10 | Songs - 9.5/10 | Background Score - 10/10 | Story -8/10 | Climax - 9.5/10 | Art Direction - 8.5/10 | Location Department - 10/10 | Overall - 9.5/10 | My Rating - 10/10",genuine love story,what magnificent story with great direction cinematography i cant believe that film was directed by debut director it is said that director took almost 7 years complete film this itself shows his sincerity film jomon t john had epic comeback films after short period time he had done amazing work film which made it blockbuster gopi sunder again made his eminence background scores through film with some amazing piece ringtone be scores prithviraj experiencing increase his prestige through film made all teenagers college students their own prithvi his genuine way acting will surely make him award winner this year talking about lead actress i e kanchanamala played by parvathi menon was superb had stunning boldness sensitive mind which made her perfect heroine film had enough comedies without making audience bore had twist sentimental climax supporting casts were superb especially appu played by tovino thomas sethu played by bala camera director showed their significance again very well climax scene unni mohammed sahib played by saikumar had great sense boldness strong attraction towards his party as freedom fighter film art direction make up was obviously great magnificent as it is very strenuous difficult make new film old or make it background 1960s this film is excellent example malayalam film industry is certainly landmark film malayalam industry hopes another one like this adult film no family film obviously direction 10 10 cinematography 10 10 cast 9 5 10 make up 10 10 songs 9 5 10 background score 10 10 story 8 10 climax 9 5 10 art direction 8 5 10 location department 10 10 overall 9 5 10 my rating 10 10,0.6568943402276736,0.38011063011063007,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.21}"

10,Soulful Cinematic Experience!,"Ennu Ninte Moideen: A Retrospect - The Best of 2015! The prime factor of a good movie, I consider, is ample amounts of emotion and, 'Ennu Ninte Moideen' is perfectly laced with apt amount of such emotions wherever needed. The movie started offering traces of thrill, and had an elevation which never took a drop. For its being a real story, one must appreciate the director, RS Vimal for blending hard emotions in a layer of humor and rebellion perfectly. The love story of Kaanchanamala and Moideen is purely evergreen; how were they able to expose so much of dedication, belief and love towards each other! Moideen was a real hero, he had the nerves of steel and a heart full of love, he is beyond doubts a personality of inspiration; not just for the affection he had for Kaanchana but also for the dedication he shown towards his land. While Moideen stands as an icon, there we have Kaanchanamala, epitome for boldness and perseverance! Along with them, the characters of Peruparambil Appu, Unni Moideen Haji and Kottatil Sethu had great prominence. When the characters are of such eminence, there requires actors of such caliber to perform them even. Prithviraj Sukumaran just lived as Moideen, he is one of the best actors I have ever seen! He is amazing me with his reputation and competence getting better by each movie. And, 'Moideen' lie as an example to prove his versatility in handling roles of any kind. His smile in the climax just filled my eyes! On par with Prithviraj, Parvathy pulls an equally brilliant performance as 'Kaanchanamala'; had all the boldness and zeal for the character. She too is surprising me with her selection of challenging roles. While these two actors shine, Sai Kumar perfected as Unni Moideen, one of the strongest characters in the recent times, the same in case of Lena. Along with these actors, Tovino Thomas and Bala come out as a surprise package in their roles of Appu and Sethu; Tovino is gonna make it great! When the story is eternal, there requires great skills to present it expressively on screen and this is where the director shine with immense support from the cinematographer and music directors. RS Vimal exposed the skill of an experienced director in his debut movie itself; his seven years of hard work was visible throughout the movie; it is his deep acquaintance with the subject that makes Moideen and Kanchanamala close to the heart! Jomon T John captures frames of greater quality that makes 'Ennu Ninte Moindeen' a high level cinema; one of the best cinematographed movies in Malayalam. At the music side, M.Jayachandran, Ramesh Narayan and Gopi Sunder offer beautiful songs while, Gopi Sunder's background score pulls the viewer's nerve; damn so effective it was! The soulful 'Mukkathe Penne' just raised the bar of emotion. Rafeeq Ahamed's lyrics were purely meaningful. Mahesh Narayanan edited the movie perfectly with notable pace in certain sequences. Even, the production values were rich with qualitative visual effects and sets offering that retro feel.Overall, 'Ennu Ninte Moideen' is a soulful cinematic experience that brings one of the evergreen love stories close to our heart and thanks to RS Vimal for offering us this cinema! When the movie ended, the entire theatre was clapping and I sat there feeling the tears rolling on my cheeks.Final Note: Must Watch; Undoubtedly the best movie of 2015! The house was fully packed for the 8:45AM show on Screen 4, Prasad's IMAX, Hyderabad in Dolby Atmos! This kind of applause and reception was never seen for a Malayalam Cinema; the atmosphere was exhilarating!

10,A classic love story which will be never forgotten,"'Ennu Ninte Moideen' is a film that truly makes you rooted to your seats .The film manages to hold the audience's interest till the very last scene! The story of Moideen and Kanchanamala set in the backdrop of the 1960's somewhere tugs at your heart. An irreversible tragedy but so beautifully portrayed by the director R.S.Vimal. Capturing the innate beauty of locales in Shoranur and the essence of the characters' emotions , cinematographer Jomon T John has done a brilliant job! The strongest quotient of the movie is that the script has been held together strongly by Vimal and that lends stability and authenticity to the film. Some excellent research has gone into the making of the movie and hats off to the team for putting together a classic movie woven with the perfect dose of drama , romance and some mind blowing music and background score.One does not exactly expect 'Ennu Ninte Moideen' to break any new ground, since this is a story that thousands of couples have gone through - before and after Kanchanamala and Moideen came along - and yet, if it still manages to leave you all shaken up, its courtesy the honesty in its depiction and the countless ways in which it seeks to subvert our expectations of how it would all ultimately turn out to be.Which is why the usual beats assume a spectacular power in the film, with the film maker and his performers infusing a rare might into this heartbreaking account of how everything - society, fortune, destiny and nature itself - transpires against a couple hopelessly in love, hurling them onto a whirlpool of doom.We get to see one of the finest performances in recent times through this film. Prithviraj and parvathy get into the skin of their respective characters of Moideen and Kanchanamala. Prithviraj lives as moideen giving the all required energy,showing us the maturity and credibility of the actor in the film. Paravthy yet again proves her acting brilliance.She is definitely an actress who would attain more height in the times to come. Tovino thomas did his role brilliantly. Bala gets a meaty role after a gap and he does it with excellence. Another brilliant performance came from Lena who acts as Moideen's mother. Rest of the cast comprising of Saikumar, Sudheer karamana, Kalaranjini, Sasikumar etc did a good job.The songs were beautifully composed by Jayachandran, Ramesh Narayan and Gopi Sunder. They were perfectly placed in the movie, without forcing on to us. The background score by Gopi Sunder was perfectly in sync with the mood of the film.Altogether,'Ennu Ninte Moideen' is a film that is a must watch. A beautiful movie by Vimal who explored romance to a different dimension which is lost mostly these days. It takes you to the world of true and eternal love. For sure,this story of Moideen and Kanchanamala would stay in your hearts and will never be forgotten. A classic tale of love. Hats off to the entire team.",classic love story which will be never forgotten,ennu ninte moideen is film that truly makes you rooted your seats film manages hold audiences interest till very last scene story moideen kanchanamala set backdrop 1960s somewhere tugs at your heart irreversible tragedy but so beautifully portrayed by director r s vimal capturing innate beauty locales shoranur essence characters emotions cinematographer jomon t john has done brilliant job strongest quotient movie is that script has been held together strongly by vimal that lends stability authenticity film some excellent research has gone into making movie hats off team putting together classic movie woven with perfect dose drama romance some mind blowing music background score one does not exactly expect ennu ninte moideen break any new ground since this is story that thousands couples have gone through before after kanchanamala moideen came along yet if it still manages leave you all shaken up its courtesy honesty its depiction countless ways which it seeks subvert our expectations how it would all ultimately turn out be which is why usual beats assume spectacular power film with film maker his performers infusing rare might into this heartbreaking account how everything society fortune destiny nature itself transpires against couple hopelessly love hurling them onto whirlpool doom we get see one finest performances recent times through this film prithviraj parvathy get into skin their respective characters moideen kanchanamala prithviraj lives as moideen giving all required energy showing us maturity credibility actor film paravthy yet again proves her acting brilliance she is definitely actress who would attain more height times come tovino thomas did his role brilliantly bala gets meaty role after gap he does it with excellence another brilliant performance came lena who acts as moideens mother rest cast comprising saikumar sudheer karamana kalaranjini sasikumar etc did good job songs were beautifully composed by jayachandran ramesh narayan gopi sunder they were perfectly placed movie without forcing us background score by gopi sunder was perfectly sync with mood film altogether ennu ninte moideen is film that is must watch beautiful movie by vimal who explored romance different dimension which is lost mostly these days it takes you world true eternal love sure this story moideen kanchanamala would stay your hearts will never be forgotten classic tale love hats off entire team,0.6102219564061669,0.4130183413078149,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"

7,A must watch love story for all,"""Ennu Ninte Moideen"" is a real life adaptation of the lives of Moideen and Kanchanamala set on the backdrops of Mukkam in 1960s. The story has been beautifully presented on the screen and will leave an everlasting impression in your heart. Debutant director R.S Vimal is remarkable and it can be understood that it took him seven years to complete this film. The remolding of this period was shown almost perfectly and also mixing the socio-religious problems of that period with an everlasting love story was done impressively. Rain was brought as a symbolic representation of their thoughts and hopes for each other. The cinematography of this movie captures the essence of 1960s convincingly. Prithviraj had acted well and did a respectful represtation of the real life Moideen. Parvathy has also done her part brilliantly and the supporting cast no less. Background score by Gopi Sundar was also remarkabale and provided a helping hand to the conveying of emotions throughout this movie.The second half of this movie was sped up and was flowing in a fast pace and looked like they tried to reduce the time period of this movie. In the end,this movie takes you on an enchanting ride to a love story giving justice to the eternal love of Moideen and Kanchanamala. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

The glaring facts that a low-bred, socialism lover named Moideen (Sukumaran) born in a political family and Kanchana (Menon), a rebellious girl, from a noble family are in love and will not be allowed to get together wreaks havoc in their lives, and on the way goes on to wreck the lives of the people they know and the people who know them, all in the name of caste and religion, two of the ugliest man-made inventions ever.R S Vimal's adaptation of a seemingly original story has all the elements that can even fire up emotions in a wooden plank. His spearheaded handling of the talented cast, clever exclusion of anachronism, thorough attention to details, and the slow-burning screenplay all makes for a high-octane 150 minutes. However, the story is what I personally had problems with. Not to mention the lack of coherence in the first two acts, the final acts look as if they were voluntarily muddled so as to boost the degree of tragedy that follows and which the story magically culminates in. Manipulation may look good in an Engineering student's Science journal, but when you sample it in a love story just so you can remain faithful to the sub-genre, it reeks of veneer. Brilliantly timed background music tries to get away with plagiarism, but that is not a problem. John's camera work is, as always, impeccable, and that is why, the film is at least a good run for one's money. It is not like tragedy is synonymous to being noteworthy, otherwise my life would be a masterpiece. Once you understand that tragedy has a greater effect on you than in perceiving the other, positive side of a clichéd romance story, you will start noticing the cavities hidden in the concoction.Brownie points for using the word ""slipshod"" in the subtitles.BOTTOM LINE: R S Vimal's ambitious Ennu Ninte Moideen is surely a remarkable film about two lovers' ill-fated journey together, but to dub it as the greatest... or even one of the greatest love stories of Malayalam cinema... is like saying Nivin Pauly is a greater actor than Mohanlal just because he is shining right now.GRADE: C+Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

The narration of the love is really amazing and heart touching. The casting and shorts are also well and up to the mark.

A pain most describable if you ever loved someone like this.Watch it for the experience. Now coming to the translation of the story into screenplay. I feel, the movie could have used some editing. There were parts in the beginning that dragged and I could hear people say during the interval ""what was all that hype about?""""Maybe we came with too much expectations"" etc etc Let me assure you,no such feeling was shared in the second half of the movie. Intense scenes of desperation laced with passion of their love took over. The story line definitely carries the movie a long way. This review would be incomplete without a mention about the amazing picturization. The rain scenes made you feel like you were actually there smelling the aroma of mud wet from rain (A pleasant treat for all who are away from sweet home Kerala). The casting was perfect - each actor competing with themselves to give their best performance. My personal favorite was Parvathy, Lena and Sai kumar.

2,Just another mediocre malayalam flick,"I went to watch this movie with some preconceived ideas of a typical malayalam film and this movie didn't disappoint me, even for a single scene! Much relieved at the end because the film was finally over, making me wonder the concept of movie making by some amateurs just to tarnish the image of excellent film makers who were courageous enough to take on any concept and make it into a saga of sight and sound. The new film makers think that showing scenes in slow motion will boost up the 'effect' and is a visual treat. So the movie starts with such a scene in rain and the hero enters the scene and as usual scores a fine goal( sorry for the spoiler!). Rain is a constant accompaniment to the extent it becomes a nuisance at times. The make up is horrible, especially the wig of the hero. They have tried to be attentive to certain details because the movie is set in 60s,but certain scenes tend to be repetitive and deliberate ( note the bus and newspaper).Showing religious symbols repeatedly as also bit outdated. Main reason why I didn't like was the main theme of the film. All this divine love is so outdated and this movie should have been made 50 years back! The rescue scene at the end is also badly done. The problem with malayalam movie scene is probably lack of exposure to good foreign language movies. The directors and actors should sometimes watch these classic movies and TV series and absorb the excellent techniques of cinematography,acting and movie direction.
