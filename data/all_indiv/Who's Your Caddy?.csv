1.0,It burned my eyes,"yet again i wish IMDb had a 0/10 ranking. my little brother made the mistake of renting this title from a red-box using a promo code. i was upset realizing that although the rental was free, the amount of energy i spent walking with him to the store to rent it was about as much that was put into this movie. It was horrendous. This, along with epic movie, murder-cycle, and the ghoul school, are some of the only movies that actually made my eyes hurt. While the stupid humor (or lack there of) managed to keep our golden retrieve entertained, my brother (who enjoyed from Justin to Kelly) and i would have no part of it, turning it off before the ending, which i had no desire in seeing. i regret seeing this movie and feel empty realizing that watching this probably did more damage to my body than my smoking habit.",it burned my eyes,yet again i wish imdb had 0 10 ranking my little brother made mistake renting this title red box using promo code i was upset realizing that although rental was free amount energy i spent walking with him store rent it was about as much that was put into this movie it was horrendous this along with epic movie murder cycle ghoul school are some only movies that actually made my eyes hurt while stupid humor or lack there managed keep our golden retrieve entertained my brother who enjoyed justin kelly i would have no part it turning it off before ending which i had no desire seeing i regret seeing this movie feel empty realizing that watching this probably did more damage my body than my smoking habit,0.4846153846153846,0.0625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,Worse than awful.,"This movie is one of a kind and even that is too big of a compliment for this seriously lackluster movie. It tries to be funny and thoughtful and ends up being incredibly and offensively stupid, racist, and trite.The comedy consistently misses the mark by a huge margin. This movie was intended to be a comedy although it's shockingly unfunny despite an almost foolproof set of comic circumstances and actors.Was it supposed to be a black Caddyshack or was it supposed to be a story of achievement? The movie's underlying message ends up being a thinly-veiled message of unfocused racist hate directed at white people which is actually not funny at all.Watching this film was an hour and a half of my life wasted. If you are considering watching or renting this movie please do yourself a favor and don't. Absolutely no redeeming value, even in it's terribleness. Consider yourself warned.",worse than awful,this movie is one kind even that is too big compliment this seriously lackluster movie it tries be funny thoughtful ends up being incredibly offensively stupid racist trite comedy consistently misses mark by huge margin this movie was intended be comedy although its shockingly unfunny despite almost foolproof set comic circumstances actors was it supposed be black caddyshack or was it supposed be story achievement movies underlying message ends up being thinly veiled message unfocused racist hate directed at white people which is actually not funny at all watching this film was hour half my life wasted if you are considering watching or renting this movie please do yourself favor dont absolutely no redeeming value even its terribleness consider yourself warned,0.6246376811594203,-0.13442028985507246,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.45}"
1.0,There Were No Jokes,"I saw this movie in theaters on its opening night because I thought the trailer made it look funny. When I sat down right before the previews started I thought about it and I had only seen the trailer for this movie twice. And no other marketing besides that; I now know why. The town I went to see this movie has a large African-American population so I thought it would be a treat and it would be a movie the audience would get behind and enjoy together. There were never more than six people in the theater at a time. Aside from my two friends and I a trio of black girls were there and left about 10 minutes into the movie, only to be replaced by a guy and his two kids, who I assume were his stepchildren that he hated because he had taken them to see this movie. To start off there were no jokes. The ""jokes"" were mostly Big Boi saying something, nothing special, like ""My daddy used to golf."" Then Faizon love(who I loved as Big Worm in Friday) would just repeat what he said in a higher voice and add the n-word. The editing made no sense and was choppy. Dialouge vital to the ""plot"" would be happening and in between the sentences there would be a cut of Faizon Love just dancing or something. To summarize buy this movie at the 3.99 Walmart bin if a friend you haven't seen in years invites you to his birthday party or something.",there were no jokes,i saw this movie theaters its opening night because i thought trailer made it look funny when i sat down right before previews started i thought about it i had only seen trailer this movie twice no other marketing besides that i now know why town i went see this movie has large african american population so i thought it would be treat it would be movie audience would get behind enjoy together there were never more than six people theater at time aside my two friends i trio black girls were there left about 10 minutes into movie only be replaced by guy his two kids who i assume were his stepchildren that he hated because he had taken them see this movie start off there were no jokes jokes were mostly big boi saying something nothing special like my daddy used golf then faizon love who i loved as big worm friday would just repeat what he said higher voice add n word editing made no sense was choppy dialouge vital plot would be happening between sentences there would be cut faizon love just dancing or something summarize buy this movie at 3 99 walmart bin if friend you havent seen years invites you his birthday party or something,0.4722056878306878,0.06447585978835979,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.34}"
1.0,I hope it gets buried in the middle of nowhere,"This is Norbit, Soul Plane, and The Cookout in a bucket, thrown up on. There is no reason to make such a movie. It will win no awards and it's only purpose is to fill the 7 dollar DVD bin at Wal-Mart. Why not do something productive, like making good movies? I wonder when it will stop. I hope someday that the culture it represents will die out. Bring a bunch of black actors together with some musicians, embarrass them with demeaning dialog, and throw in some white actors to look awkward and poke fun at. It's a routine that needs to go away as soon as possible. There's no creativity, and some people will actually bother to complain that racism is the reason that it isn't award winning.

,"A childish, annoying film that claims to be a comedy","This film is about a young black golfer trying to win his fame in a white golf club for the sake of his family name.I watched ""Who's Your Caddy?"" to see how bad it is. And it exceeded all my expectations. The plot is contrived and unconvincing, and it makes Christopher's climb to the top look more like a spoiled kid refusing to lose. And that constant ranting by Lady G is so annoying that I wish somehow her character suddenly dropped dead from a heart attack. Take a look at one of her scenes: Christopher is awarded with membership of the club, and she spent at least 30 seconds making silly incomprehensible noises. It is seriously annoying, childish and not fun. I cannot comprehend why the filmmakers think viewers would be entertained by this, as if we were 5 year old children.The underlying message about a man of humble origin making his way to the top is positive, but the constant class struggle is tiring to say the least. The class struggle is done in such a silly and contrived, making no room for sympathy or thought provocation.I lost all interest in continuing the film half way through, but I watched it anyway.

1.0,A triple bogey,"My mother and my brother told me this film was funny. I have considered leaving my home because of their taste in movies. This movie is absolutely terrible. Well, I take that back. I believe there was a moment when I cracked a smile at a joke. But the jokes were almost all targeted towards a braindead audience with no sense of humor, whatsoever.

Instead of creating an original comedy that will forever be etched in peoples minds the makers of this movie copied other movies and threw their jokes in a big mix.

1.0,"Wow, what crap","I hope that the people of the world are tired of racist movies that serve no purpose whatsoever. This movie insults black people and actually makes white people look good ( I never thought I'd be saying that). But it does, it makes everyone think that all black people are mentally unable to handle even basic tasks. So it gets a 1 for being racists towards blacks. As far as the plot, if this was pre 1985 when the supreme court ruled that golf courses must be open to anyone who can afford them, it hasn't been an issue. So to assume that there is a golf course out there in a fantasy world where black people are not allowed in is the most ridiculous thing I can think off. The sad part is there were a couple of good actors in this movie, but when you are working with crap you can't fix it no matter who you put in the movie.",wow what crap,i hope that people world are tired racist movies that serve no purpose whatsoever this movie insults black people actually makes white people look good i never thought id be saying that but it does it makes everyone think that all black people are mentally unable handle even basic tasks so it gets 1 being racists towards blacks as far as plot if this was pre 1985 when supreme court ruled that golf courses must be open anyone who can afford them it hasnt been issue so assume that there is golf course out there fantasy world where black people are not allowed is most ridiculous thing i can think off sad part is there were couple good actors this movie but when you are working with crap you cant fix it no matter who you put movie,0.5847222222222223,-0.0962962962962963,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,A shameful rip-off of Caddyshack.,"Cast your mind back to 1980, with a movie called Caddyshack. You might possibly have heard of this movie, as it's one of the best comedies of all time, backed with a stellar lineup (at the time) of top notch comedy actors.Now, 27 years later, we're seeing the movie again in the guise of Who's Your Caddy, Only this time, there are a few changes. White guys are replaced with black guys, and rap culture is fused into the plot, but aside from that it's a carbon copy. Even some of the jokes are lifted directly from the original.Absolute garbage. There is NO effort whatsoever to make Who's Your Caddy unique enough (or funny enough) to step away from Caddyshack's shadow. What was once fresh and unique, has become standard and staid, and as Who's Your Caddy copied a 27 year old movie wholesale, making the jokes so obvious you already know the punchline while the directors are in the setup. Who's Your Caddy has absolutely nothing recommendable in it's reels, even if you haven't seen the original.If you want to watch a funny golf movie, Watch Caddyshack, or if you're desperate, Caddyshack II. If you've seen them both before, then just fondly re-watch them, as your memories will be forever tainted if you what this shameful, shallow, remake.",shameful rip off caddyshack,cast your mind back 1980 with movie called caddyshack you might possibly have heard this movie as its one best comedies all time backed with stellar lineup at time top notch comedy actors now 27 years later were seeing movie again guise whos your caddy only this time there are few changes white guys are replaced with black guys rap culture is fused into plot but aside that its carbon copy even some jokes are lifted directly original absolute garbage there is no effort whatsoever make whos your caddy unique enough or funny enough step away caddyshacks shadow what was once fresh unique has become standard staid as whos your caddy copied 27 year old movie wholesale making jokes so obvious you already know punchline while directors are setup whos your caddy has absolutely nothing recommendable its reels even if you havent seen original if you want watch funny golf movie watch caddyshack or if youre desperate caddyshack ii if youve seen them both before then just fondly re watch them as your memories will be forever tainted if you what this shameful shallow remake,0.5608974358974359,0.125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,A great idea that is never lived up to,"I do love comedy, even starting to appreciate the less subtle blend, but Who's Your Caddy? just didn't work. I mean it did have a great idea with a relevant theme that a lot of people I think would identify with, but here's the problem, Who's Your Caddy? never lives up to it.The scenery is striking in a sense, but the editing in some scenes could've been tighter. The soundtrack was pleasant enough, but forgettable soon after.If there are any redeeming qualities it is the performances of James Avery and Terry Crews who put a lot of effort into their characters. By all means it was lovely to see Jeffrey Jones again but sadly he doesn't have much to work with.I don't mind in-your-face humour, but the in-your-face humour came so fast and was so outrageous a lot of the time. Also the racism jokes got too much after a while. Not to mention, I detected some sexism too, notably I agree with the film showing a woman's bum being slapped and actually encouraging it.The story is very predictable and unoriginal, if anything it often felt like it was ripping off Caddyshack, except Caddyshack's humour was much funnier, while the dialogue was weak and very demeaning. And did I mention that the film is riddled with stereotypes, I don't mind them when they are well incorporated but sadly they weren't here. I didn't care for any of the characters finding them either dull or annoying on the most part.I suppose though I would have cared for them more had the drama(a little too sappy for my tastes but a bit of a relief after a long time of forced and unfunny in-your-face humour) been introduced much earlier.All in all, a mess of a movie that doesn't make anything of its concept. 1/10 Bethany Cox",great idea that is never lived up,i do love comedy even starting appreciate less subtle blend but whos your caddy just didnt work i mean it did have great idea with relevant theme that lot people i think would identify with but heres problem whos your caddy never lives up it scenery is striking sense but editing some scenes couldve been tighter soundtrack was pleasant enough but forgettable soon after if there are any redeeming qualities it is performances james avery terry crews who put lot effort into their characters by all means it was lovely see jeffrey jones again but sadly he doesnt have much work with i dont mind your face humour but your face humour came so fast was so outrageous lot time also racism jokes got too much after while not mention i detected some sexism too notably i agree with film showing womans bum being slapped actually encouraging it story is very predictable unoriginal if anything it often felt like it was ripping off caddyshack except caddyshacks humour was much funnier while dialogue was weak very demeaning did i mention that film is riddled with stereotypes i dont mind them when they are well incorporated but sadly they werent here i didnt care any characters finding them either dull or annoying most part i suppose though i would have cared them more had drama little too sappy my tastes but bit relief after long time forced unfunny your face humour been introduced much earlier all all mess movie that doesnt make anything its concept 1 10 bethany cox,0.5339120370370369,0.03560185185185187,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,It's just not good.,"While it doesn't deserve the top of the bottom 100, it was in fact, a bad movie. I saw this movie for the soul reason of saying I saw it, and it wasn't as bad as people were trying to make it, but it really was lackluster at it's peak. Despite any racist claims, and all the controversy over this movie, it has a weak plot, terrible jokes, and was a waste of money.As far as it being racist, well, I wasn't offended, but both whites AND blacks could easily be offended because it plays into huge stereo-types of both races. At times I could hear ""We will overcome"" intertwined within the plot-line, and agreeable with several other comments on this movie, it was just unnecessary. To those who say this movie isn't a ""white/black thing"", watch the movie again: "".. this is not about who's at infractions. No no no. This here is about black and white..."" - Rev. J.J.Jackson played by Garrett Morris.I'm a fan of stupid humor, actually, I love movies like Borat, Hot Fuzz, Friday, Caddy Shack, et cetera, but this movie is just an insult to comedy. I didn't even mind the racial undertones, but give me a break, this movie was REALLY about a quick buck.

3.0,"Like a low quality remake of ""Caddy Shack""--why did they even make this in the first place?!","This film stars rapper Big Boi and his homies in a comedy that is, roughly, a reworking of the script from ""Caddy Shack"". However, instead of the head of the fancy country club president hating loud-mouthed Rodney Dangerfield, but Big Boi and his friends. As a result, the men decide to take revenge by buying the property adjoining the club and revoking the land leased to the club. So, the snooty club president (Jeffrey Jones) is forced to allow these rappers to join the club. As for the rapper posse, the behave pretty obnoxiously once they join the country club. You almost feel sorry for the club...except that they DID bring it on themselves.There is a serious subplot--though it really seems like a real cliché. It seems that Big Boi's father had been a caddy at this same club years before but was fired. And, in a way, Big Boi's joining was because of this. Also, there is a HIGHLY clichéd final segment--right out of caddy shack concerning a foursome golf game...for EVERYTHING (uggh).While this is clearly a low-brow and rather stupid film, it is surprisingly good when you realize it's currently ranking on the IMDb ""Bottom 100"" list. It clearly isn't nearly bad enough to merit inclusion here, though I have noticed that several very watchable African-American films are also on the list (""I Can DO Bad All By Myself"" and ""Phat Girlz""). Could there perhaps be some bias against comedies where the stars are Black? I hope not.As for the humor, it's mostly pretty low-brow. This is NOT a sophisticated comedy and it makes little pretense about that. I mean, think about it...when Jones cannot keep Big Boi and his friends out, he hires two midget assassins! And, there are lots of scenes where people get hit in the crotch. Need I say more?!

3.0,Lazy and derivative.,"When rapper Christopher ""C-Note"" Hawkins (Big Boi) is denied membership into an exclusive Carolina Pines Country Club by the snobbish Cummings (Jeffrey Jones), C-Note takes measures to make himself a nuisance buying the neighboring property and forcing his way into the club where his lifestyle and image clash with the uptight rigid Carolina Pines establishment with Cummings using every means possible to get rid of C-Note.In the series finale of the short lived Clerks: The Animated Series, there's a brief bit where Randall and Dante are pleased to find themselves in Caddyshack only to react in horror when text appears reading ""Caddyshack III: Caddies in da Hood. The shack is back......and BLACK"", now we know why they were scared. Released during the crowded July weekend in 2007 that also featured the debut of The Simpsons Movie, Who's Your Caddy limped out to the minimum number of theaters to qualify a ""wide release"" and opened at number 10 at the box office fading from theaters quickly. The movie received harsh reviews from critics with many pointing out the blatant similarities to Caddyshack. While the movie isn't unwatchable and probably doesn't deserve to be on the same tier as the Seltzerberg comedies where it currently stands, it's still a lazy pandering slog.The movie begins right out of the gate with the hackneyed use of classical music only to be interrupted by loud rap as we follow C-Note's entourage to the country club. The movie has the subtlety and restraint of a battering ram with most jokes basically approached in the same manner as that opening with very telegraphed pay offs you've seen before including a reference to the Flight of the Valkyries scene from Apocalypse Now when we see C-Note's helicopter that's treated as a joke in and of itself. Big Boi as C-Note does not have any comedic aptitude as he's played overly stiff and reserved with not much comic energy. Jeffrey Jones is also way past his prime playing a poor man's Ted Knight and with his slow lumbering mannerisms he doesn't bring the needed energy to make his character funny. Faizon Love as Big Large is clearly intended to be this movie's equivalent of Bill Murray's Carl Spackler, but instead is closer in spirit to Dan Akyroyd's Tom Everett from Caddyshack II. Faizon basically has two go tos: 1) Make funny faces and 2) repeat dialogue spoken by other characters in silly voices. Faizon does this repeatedly throughout the movie and also often laughs at his own exchanges making him rather grating during the film's runtime.Who's Your Caddy?

1.0,More like Who's Going to save this Awful Movie?,"A few weeks ago, I showed my boyfriend a movie called White Chicks, I'm sure you've heard of it if you haven't seen it. He loved it and I said for me what really made the film was Terry Crews, I love this guy and how much life he brings to the screen. My boyfriend then mentioned a film called Who's Your Caddy and said that Terry was in it and that he's absolutely hilarious. So we watched it and sadly not only is Terry in the film for just 5 minutes, but this was just a terrible movie. Not only is this one of the most racist films I've seen but it's incredibly sexist as well. I have no idea what Hollywood was on when they thought that this would be a good film to green light, but obviously they just didn't care.When ""street smart"" rapper Christopher ""C-Note"" Hawkins applies for a membership to an all-white Country Club, the establishment's proprietors are hardly ready to oblige him. Unwilling to accept that the club views him as unfit for membership, C-Note purchases land that contains the 17th green - willing only to exchange the hole for a membership. This sets the stage for an outrageous assault on the country club and its membership committee as C-Note and his fun-loving, streetwise crew disrupts the events and games at the club with their irreverent attitudes and a back-and-forth prank fest.See my thing is I actually do love the story, but I think I would have loved it as a drama with a little comedy. The whole element of this black man whose father was shunned from a trophy because of his color from the powerful white man and getting revenge, I think that's a really good idea. However, since the comedy was a little too outrageous and in your face most of the time, they add in this touching story ad very last minute and it's way too late for me to care.I hate stereotypes and this movie was out of control with the stereotypes. Between the black man who's a ghetto rapper, the big black girl who's so tough and sexual at the same time, the white rich man who won't give one thing a chance nor has any motive and the white son giving so easily into the rapper's life embracing it. Not to mention how the women are treated in this film, the white boy slaps a girl's butt and they encourage it! I thought that was a bit much. Plus the powerful white man wants to get rid of this group so badly to the point where he hires a hit man? A hit man who plants a bomb at his son's party where he could have been killed, what the heck? Everything about this film was wrong. The only thing that was redeemable was James Avery and Terry Crews.

1.0,Who's your Caddyshack,"Hmmmm, this movie looks very familiar. It resembles that other movie about golf. You know the one that came out in 1980? Only difference is that movie was funny and this one is flat out boring.Plot: C-Note(Big Boi of Outkast) is a rich rapper who wants to join a golf club but the snooty owner Cummings(Jeffrey Jones) refuses to let C-Note and his pals join the club. C-Note does everything in his power to annoy Cummings and later on challenges him to a golf tournament.Opinion: Doesn't that plot remind you of that movie with Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield and that silly gopher? This movie has other problems besides it being a ripoff of Caddyshack. You're sitting there waiting for a laugh and it never comes. Big Boi is not funny and the movie relies too much on fart jokes and clichés. Jeffrey Jones is overacting to the extreme just like he did in Howard The Duck. Sherri Shepard plays a caricature of a black woman and as a matter of fact the majority of the actors in this movie are caricatures. You know a movie is in trouble when you have Andy Milonakis in it! And the scene where Faizon Love and the rest of those guys are baring their naked buns in the locker room is not funny, its just sick. Almost as sick as Rip Torn shaking his naked butt in Freddy Got Fingered. If you're looking for a laugh look elsewhere. Who's Your Caddy is 100% laugh-free.

2.0,Why we should be tee'd off at this film,"When pitching the idea for Who's Your Caddy?, the filmmakers most likely said ""let's remake Caddyshack, for next to nothing, and do it with an African-American cast."" That's all this has to offer. The thing that made the 1980's Caddyshack so funny, so clever, and work well was because it was energized by a cast of comedic talent like Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield. I'm surprised nobody ever said ""let's ask Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and Tracy Morgan to be in this."" I'm known to like urban films. I thoroughly enjoyed the film Barbershop, and absolutely loved Boyz N The Hood, a drama film about three males growing up on the wrong side of the street. Even urban comedy films like Death at a Funeral, Don't Be a Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, and Friday I can't help but laugh at. They are well written, but they also have a mind to their madness. They aren't always just random shouting from the characters, with pointless jokes. They can be funny and have a big heart.Who's Your Caddy does nothing but try to ""start something."" It tries to pull racial issues where none exist, and it tries to make white people the anti-Christ of the world. This was 2007. Now it's 2011. Racism exists, but it's now much more seldom than it once was. Instead of acting like this is the first time blacks and whites ever crossed paths, why don't they try and make it something different. Something, you know? More current and entertaining.The story is a rapper nicknamed C-Note (Patton) is forbidden a membership to the prestigious golf-club that is Carolina Pines Country Club. So he purchases land that is part of the course, and winds up bribing his way into a membership earned from the club's strict owner (Jones). The rest of the film is just senseless humor about horses eating marijuana, farting, and racism. You can see this comedy comes from a very mature nature.One of my favorite black comedians, Faizon Love, makes an appearance, but he thinks that being funny means shouting all his lines and repeating everything everyone else says just adding ""the n word."" Andy Milonakis also shows up playing a teenager, but if you know the truth that Milonakis is in his mid-thirties, and he only has the voice and appearance of a teenager because of a condition that stunts his growth, the joke is ruined. Now if I went into this under the impression that Milonakis was around seventeen, done some homework, and learned that he was in fact in his thirties, than the joke is on me. But since I didn't, the joke is on the movie for thinking I'm that out of touch.The humor also derives from gangster rap and other things not currently present today. The film passes itself off as ""just another 2007 comedy."" Not a flashback one. Who's Your Caddy? tries to be current, but at the same time, it is so dated and so out of touch with today's society that if you're laughing at the movie, it's because it doesn't truly know what it is.The biggest problem is just the subject matter and immaturity brought to light in this film. It disgusts me that this comedy is making humor out of racism, a very demeaning and vile thing that still exists today. It makes white people out to be the enemy. They try to say ""Golf is a white man's sport and they don't allow black people."" Stop and think - one of the biggest golfers today is black. And if you go to any golf course, I live right by one, you'll see black people play it too. Sure the sport is dominated by whites, but blacks are just as welcome. There are no racial issues here. So why bring them up as if their were? Who's Your Caddy? says a lot about the world today. It says that white people are the enemy, they are used in this film to be awkward, and that the makers try to expose it in a comedy film with no redeeming qualities. Maybe this could've been a documentary, instead of a comedy if it wanted to focus on racial issues in the sport of golf. If that's the case, pick a genre.Starring: Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton, Jeffery Jones, James L. Avery, Tony Cox, Tamala Jones, Jenifer Lewis, Andy Milonakis, Sherri Shepperd, Tony Cox, and Lil Wayne.

10.0,Cinema For The Ages,"Who's Your Caddy? is rightly considered an American classic. Don Michael Paul directs wonderfully, in the vision of a modern day Harper Lee. The story is easy to follow and the humor is fresh and original. While all these characteristics would qualify Who's Your Caddy? as genius cinema, they do not necessarily indicate a classic. What moves Who's Your Caddy? to classic status is its morality and ability to draw sympathy out of viewers as much today as when it was written in 2005. Who's Your Daddy deals with heavy and vital issues - racism, oppression, injustice. Amazingly, it is able to handle these deep and sensitive areas without feeling depressing or preachy. Michael Paul accomplishes this by making the viewer feel like a child and allowing us to learn along with him. Big Boi's (C-Note) acting makes it is easy to enter the world of modern day Atlanta. Despite all the flaws of the city, it is also easy to love many things about the place and many of the characters.
