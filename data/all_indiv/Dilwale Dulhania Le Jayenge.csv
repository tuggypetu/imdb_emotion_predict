10.0,"Like every movie of its kind, and yet like nothing I've ever seen","Dilwale made me glad to be a Westerner, just so I could experience the sheer rush in the glorious way this film simply throws its Indian sensibility in your face. It is one of the most completely, openly joyful films I have ever seen. In many ways a totally Western film, it is yet completely un-Western, and absolutely invigorating.I found the (rather oddly looped in places) mix of Hindi and English dialog to be a lot of fun to follow (as incomplete as the subtitles sometimes seemed). The Indian/Western pop structure of the songs was entertaining and infectious. The choreography is simply amazing, and some of the most sheerly athletic I've seen. The Indian roots of the dance routines were at first almost unnerving--at once familiar yet bizarre, almost surreal (to my Western eyes). It was sheer fun making the cultural adjustment.The plot is predictable, almost pedestrian--certainly not what you'd call ""never done before,"" and yet I found myself completely absorbed in the story, and rooting for the main characters. This is in large part due to Shahrukh Khan's and Kajol's performances as Raj and Simran. He is totally endearing, and she is totally hot!, and their on screen chemistry is as cute & perky and smoldering & steamy as Fred and Ginger at their peak. It was, simply put, fun to watch them having so much fun.Director Aditya Chopra was, I understand, only 24 when he made Dilwale, and the film was so successful its Indian first run lasted a world-record 11 years (and may still be going on, as far as I know). A heckuva testimony to Bollywood indeed. This movie has instantly become one of my favorite musicals, and I look forward to finding more films from Chopra, Khan, and Kajol.

10.0,Srk-Kajol's chemistry at its best.,"Srk-Kajol have worked in a lot of blockbusters together(Baazigar, Karan Arjun, KKHH, K3G) but DDLJ will always be recognized as their best to date. Debutant director Aditya Chopra so perfectly brings these two together at the back-drop of a realistic family setting that its hard not to fall in love with them. Its chemistry at its finest. For Srk it was his first ""Raj"" character(play-girl type guy with the right values and morals) which he plays to perfection. For Kajol, DDLJ was a career making movie. As Simran she's beautiful, sweet, sensitive and a bit stuck-up too. Thank god Madhuri didn't have the dates to work in DDLJ cuz no actress suits Srk better then Kajol. There are countless heart-warming scenes between em' in DDLJ. Each one of them is uniquely different and just as much fun to watch. The entire setting of DDLJ is very simplistic, which brings out that special ""oomph"" in their romance. The songs are first-class. The strong supporting cast of Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Anupam Kher and Satish Shah definitely helped the movie to become the classic as its now seen as.Bottomline: DDLJ is 'romantic comedy' with Indian emotions at its peak. From the cast, chemistry, music, direction and the awesome pairing of Srk-Kajol....its perfect!",srk kajols chemistry at its best,srk kajol have worked lot blockbusters together baazigar karan arjun kkhh k3g but ddlj will always be recognized as their best date debutant director aditya chopra so perfectly brings these two together at back drop realistic family setting that its hard not fall love with them its chemistry at its finest srk it was his first raj character play girl type guy with right values morals which he plays perfection kajol ddlj was career making movie as simran shes beautiful sweet sensitive bit stuck up too thank god madhuri didnt have dates work ddlj cuz no actress suits srk better then kajol there are countless heart warming scenes between em ddlj each one them is uniquely different just as much fun watch entire setting ddlj is very simplistic which brings out that special oomph their romance songs are first class strong supporting cast amrish puri farida jalal anupam kher satish shah definitely helped movie become classic as its now seen as bottomline ddlj is romantic comedy with indian emotions at its peak cast chemistry music direction awesome pairing srk kajol its perfect,0.5416225749559083,0.32658730158730154,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,Very good romantic comedy,"I usually go for Bollywood films for the music-dance numbers. While this flick has a few good ones, I was mostly pleased with the plot. I liked the second half the best. I was very disappointed to learn from IMDb that this is the second of only two films done by Pooja Rupanel. She brought a lot of life and spark to a minor role - the female lead's younger sister. She should have done more films. Like any really good comedy, the story had its serious aspects - just enough to make the plot interesting.

9.0,The beauty of mainstream Hindi cinema,"Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a superb example of the genius of Hindi commercial cinema. If you see it, you'll get that it's not very different as a love story. It is even ordinary. But it becomes special for many reasons. First and foremost, for its fresh, naive spirit. Secondly, the many paradoxes it contains: it is powerful yet subtle, larger-than-life yet simple, funny yet sad, magical yet realistic, and so on. Thirdly, it is one of the first films portraying Indians who live outside their country (in this case, London). It also shows the yearning of the first-generation NRIs who live far away from their homeland and for many reasons find it difficult to come back. Yet, the film remains mainly a poignant, melancholic romance. Raj and Simran, the characters played by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol represent the last generation of youngsters who were innocent and naive. They were much more simple, respectful and full of life. Such people almost no longer exist nowadays. The film relates their love story in a rather mesmerising way. Every scene is important. There are many great moments in the film. Raj and Simran's entire acquaintance and interaction in the first half is charming. Their separation at the end of the first half, when both make each other understand of their true feelings without explicitly admitting it, is moving. The traditional wedding preparations in the second half are well-made; the values they show, Raj's attempts to conquer Simran's father, and the couple's deepening relationship are interesting. The only thing I regretted was the typical fight scene towards the end.Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, who undoubtedly form a great film couple, are both excellent in their roles. They act from the heart, and ably bring their characters to life. Shahrukh Khan is incredible as Raj, a modern guy who understands the value of family and marriage, and yet he has the look of a careless fool who does not take anything seriously. Khan acts with great ease, wit and humour, and his inner fear of losing his beloved is always understood. Kajol as the dreamy and poetic yet intransigent and smart Simran is exceptional, and she looks very hot throughout. Amrish Puri and Farida Jalal as Simran's parents provide great support. Amrish Puri is particularly impressive as the strict but soft-hearted father, and Jalal is touching as the woman who has lived life according to terms and does not want the same to happen to her daughter. Anupam Kher is funny and entertaining as Raj's father. The film's soundtrack is outstanding and is clearly one of the main reasons this film works so well and is unforgettable today. The music is very well identified with the film and its story. Just try to imagine you would be given to watch the movie with the songs edited out. You wouldn't want to, right? That's because every song is a gem and is as important as every other scene. Every song comes in the right place and is sung and pictured exceptionally well. The one closest to my heart is ""Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko"", for its beautiful melody and very melancholic feel, which is aided by its blend of fantasy and reality on-screen. It is performed to perfection by Lata Mangeshkar and Udit Narayan. DDLJ is a film that should not be missed by anyone. It is one of the great gifts of Yash Chopra and his banner. It is a milestone of Indian cinema for its ability to inject fresh and magical energies into a banal love story, and for making it classically memorable.",beauty mainstream hindi cinema,aditya chopras dilwale dulhania le jayenge is superb example genius hindi commercial cinema if you see it youll get that its not very different as love story it is even ordinary but it becomes special many reasons first foremost its fresh naive spirit secondly many paradoxes it contains it is powerful yet subtle larger than life yet simple funny yet sad magical yet realistic so thirdly it is one first films portraying indians who live outside their country this case london it also shows yearning first generation nris who live far away their homeland many reasons find it difficult come back yet film remains mainly poignant melancholic romance raj simran characters played by shahrukh khan kajol represent last generation youngsters who were innocent naive they were much more simple respectful full life such people almost no longer exist nowadays film relates their love story rather mesmerising way every scene is important there are many great moments film raj simrans entire acquaintance interaction first half is charming their separation at end first half when both make each other understand their true feelings without explicitly admitting it is moving traditional wedding preparations second half are well made values they show rajs attempts conquer simrans father couples deepening relationship are interesting only thing i regretted was typical fight scene towards end shahrukh khan kajol who undoubtedly form great film couple are both excellent their roles they act heart ably bring their characters life shahrukh khan is incredible as raj modern guy who understands value family marriage yet he has look careless fool who does not take anything seriously khan acts with great ease wit humour his inner fear losing his beloved is always understood kajol as dreamy poetic yet intransigent smart simran is exceptional she looks very hot throughout amrish puri farida jalal as simrans parents provide great support amrish puri is particularly impressive as strict but soft hearted father jalal is touching as woman who has lived life according terms does not want same happen her daughter anupam kher is funny entertaining as rajs father films soundtrack is outstanding is clearly one main reasons this film works so well is unforgettable today music is very well identified with film its story just try imagine you would be given watch movie with songs edited out you wouldnt want right thats because every song is gem is as important as every other scene every song comes right place is sung pictured exceptionally well one closest my heart is ho gaya hai tujhko its beautiful melody very melancholic feel which is aided by its blend fantasy reality screen it is performed perfection by lata mangeshkar udit narayan ddlj is film that should not be missed by anyone it is one great gifts yash chopra his banner it is milestone indian cinema its ability inject fresh magical energies into banal love story making it classically memorable,0.6002968960863697,0.2584096605149237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Come fall in love...with a Classic!!!,"Probably one of the greatest love stories ever told. Director Aditya Chopra made his debut as a director with this film. Aditya is the son of legendary Director/Producer Yash Chopra who gave us films like Deewar, Darr, Waqt, Kabhie Kabhie, Dil To Pagal Hai and Veer-Zaara.Aditya was one the first Directors of the New Generation of the Indian film Directors. With his first film he got rave reviews and was immediately classified as one of the best directors in Indian Cinema. With DDLJ, Aditya showed us what falling in love, respect, and family values are all about. This film also confirmed the Pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as one of the best in the Indian Cinema. It made Kajol and Shah Rukh superstars over night and two of the most sought after actors.DDLJ also started the trend of love stories in Indian Cinema. Before DDLJ, most Indian films were action films. But DDLJ changed all that and the way of war was changed to a way of love. It's incredible how this film changed the Indian Cinema and the way of making films. DDLJ is a Forever Classic.It recently set a new record for the longest running film when it crossed the 500th week mark (that means it's a 10 time golden jubilee), the previous record was 275 weeks and was held by SHOLAY (another forever classic). All I can say is you must watch this movie, because ""After Raj met Simran, love wasn't the same...come fall in love all over again"".",come fall love with classic,probably one greatest love stories ever told director aditya chopra made his debut as director with this film aditya is son legendary director producer yash chopra who gave us films like deewar darr waqt kabhie kabhie dil pagal hai veer zaara aditya was one first directors new generation indian film directors with his first film he got rave reviews was immediately classified as one best directors indian cinema with ddlj aditya showed us what falling love respect family values are all about this film also confirmed pair shah rukh khan kajol as one best indian cinema it made kajol shah rukh superstars over night two most sought after actors ddlj also started trend love stories indian cinema before ddlj most indian films were action films but ddlj changed all that way war was changed way love its incredible how this film changed indian cinema way making films ddlj is forever classic it recently set new record longest running film when it crossed 500th week mark that means its 10 time golden jubilee previous record was 275 weeks was held by sholay another forever classic all i can say is you must watch this movie because after raj met simran love wasnt same come fall love all over again,0.4784231200897866,0.4187429854096521,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.17}"

However, the girl's traditional father takes her back to India to fulfill a betrothal promise.'DDLJ', even if not so hugely successful, it still would have gained a cult-following. Aditya Chopra's Screenplay is engaging, moving & most importantly entertaining. The Love-Story works big time, so do the characters & the situations. Cinematography by Manmohan Singh is picture perfect. Editing is smooth. Chopra's direction is sensitive. Music by Jatin-Lalit, is fabulous.Shahrukh's performance as Raj, became a rage & catapulted him into Superstardom. He is lovable as Raj. Kajol as Simran, is fantastic, as always. The Chemistry between Shahrukh & Kajol, is infectious. Amrish Puri, however, steals the show as the traditional Indian father. The late legend delivers an incredible performance, that truly leaves you in awe of him. Farida Jalal is first-rate. Anupam Kher is great. Parmeet Sethi plays the bad-guy well. Satish Shah is decent, while Mandira Bedi is passable. Others are perfect.On the whole, 'DDLJ' is one of THE Finest films to come out of Hindi Cinema.

,Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Commentary,"This was the top Bollywood film of the 90s and after seeing it I really can't think of one that was better. There are some that are just as good but I can't recall seeing one that's better. The story's pretty routine: boy meets girl in Europe, they fall in love, girl is engaged to some other idiot, and the rest writes itself... Sound familiar? Well it wasn't back in '95 (or even if it was it wasn't done as well) and Aditya Chopra's treatment of the story was a big reason for it's success. In every other movie the couple first wants to kill each other before falling in love. But in this movie it's slightly different and more plausible. Shahrukh doesn't want to kill Kahol - I mean Kajol - and she doesn't really hate him either, she just (like the rest of us) is annoyed by the guy. Their situations aren't that far-fetched and their Europe storyline is played out quite realistically (of course the piano scene is an exception). This was the beginning of the ""Shahrukh plays Shahrukh era"" and, for what it's worth, he hasn't made a better movie or given a better performance since. Sure there are places where he overacts but there are just as many places where he's able to hit all his cues. His comic timing was never better and there was still some sincerity in his eyes, a reminder of the fact that he was still an actor, which has since been replaced by the cockiness of a megastar. This is the movie that shot him to superstardom and put him alongside Aamir and Salman. Kajol is just as good (if not better), and I think after their next movie they'll win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The supporting cast is fine although no one really stands out. There are many moments in the film, most notably in the script, where you might feel a sense of deja vu. But keep in mind that this was the original, it's everything else that's a rehash. Bollywood headed straight for the sewer after this movie with almost all films, many of them starring Shahrukh, copying the same formula. Even at its 3 hour length the movie never drags till after the two-hour mark. I also want to comment on the film's Art Direction because it warrants a mention. Whether it's in Europe, England, or India, the movie has a very natural look to it. Unlike today's big films like Dil To Pagal Hai, or K3G, this movie looks good without trying to look good and I think that's a quality that's been lost on today's films. Too much attention is spent on the look at the expense of the story (if there is one!). The soundtrack of course is a classic, truly one of the all-time bests, with almost every song being a hit. The film won an unprecedented number of awards while breaking many records. There was a feeling that Aditya would follow in his father Yash's footsteps but regrettably the pressure got to him. He followed this up with the dreadful Mohabbatein which was slammed by audiences and critics alike. But so what. His first film was good, and with the current state of Bollywood movies - Devdas anyone? - you really can't get better than this.",dilwale dulhania le jayenge commentary,this was top bollywood film 90s after seeing it i really cant think one that was better there are some that are just as good but i cant recall seeing one thats better storys pretty routine boy meets girl europe they fall love girl is engaged some other idiot rest writes itself sound familiar well it wasnt back 95 or even if it was it wasnt done as well aditya chopras treatment story was big reason its success every other movie couple first wants kill each other before falling love but this movie its slightly different more plausible shahrukh doesnt want kill kahol i mean kajol she doesnt really hate him either she just like rest us is annoyed by guy their situations arent that far fetched their europe storyline is played out quite realistically course piano scene is exception this was beginning shahrukh plays shahrukh era what its worth he hasnt made better movie or given better performance since sure there are places where he overacts but there are just as many places where hes able hit all his cues his comic timing was never better there was still some sincerity his eyes reminder fact that he was still actor which has since been replaced by cockiness megastar this is movie that shot him superstardom put him alongside aamir salman kajol is just as good if not better i think after their next movie theyll win nobel prize chemistry supporting cast is fine although no one really stands out there are many moments film most notably script where you might feel sense deja vu but keep mind that this was original its everything else thats rehash bollywood headed straight sewer after this movie with almost all films many them starring shahrukh copying same formula even at its 3 hour length movie never drags till after two hour mark i also want comment films art direction because it warrants mention whether its europe england or india movie has very natural look it unlike todays big films like dil pagal hai or k3g this movie looks good without trying look good i think thats quality thats been lost todays films too much attention is spent look at expense story if there is one soundtrack course is classic truly one all time bests with almost every song being hit film won unprecedented number awards while breaking many records there was feeling that aditya would follow his father yashs footsteps but regrettably pressure got him he followed this up with dreadful mohabbatein which was slammed by audiences critics alike but so what his first film was good with current state bollywood movies devdas anyone you really cant get better than this,0.4594487847222222,0.22774739583333325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,"God, I love this movie.","I recently took a class about India in college and towards the end of the semester, we watched a few clips from some Bollywood and Tamil movies. I was very moved and inspired by the clips alone! Then, I told my friend (who happens to be Indian) from my work study job that I like Bollywood. So she invited me to an ""Indian Movie Night"" at her dorm. We watched K3G and I was so touched by it! It was simply wonderful. Most of all, I became a SRK and Kajol fan. Their on-screen chemistry is remarkable! I can't explain it! Anyhoo, I asked my mom for some Bollywood movies for Christmas and one of the movies I got was DDLJ. And let me tell ya'll, it is now my favorite movie of all time. SRK and Kajol shine beyond reason in this flick. The script is excellent, everything is excellent especially the acting and memorable songs! The supporting cast (most notably Simran parents, sister and Raj's dad were figging awesome!) Mr. Amish (sic) Puri, who played Kajol's dad acts wonderfully with just his eyes! One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Raj's friend walks into Simran's dad store and says ""Uncle, can I have some beer?!"" Gosh, it's the way that cat said the line that made it so FUNNY! After watching it again yesterday, I realized that I love so many Hollywood movies (particularly classic ones) and yet I couldn't state my all time favorite one. But while watching the making of DDLJ (I own the special edition version with two DVD's inside), I became rather teary eyed. I mean, I'm getting teary eyed writing this review at this moment! This film touched not only my heart, but my soul as well. They are so many underlying messages in DDLJ that can strike a cord in a non-Indian's (like me, I'm Nigerian American) soul.

9.0,Still excellent after 20 years,"Bollywood has changed a lot over the last two decades. Production values have increased dramatically and that cheesiness that was so typical of old Bollywood films has been toned down somewhat and replaced by a professionalism that is often on a par with Hollywood. So how does this 20 year old film stack-up?In short, it is brilliant. Yes, it is has a certain kitschness. It has musical interludes that are so cheesy you almost want to laugh, and some of the acting is pretty questionable. But at the same time there's something sublime about the film. Somehow, the kitschness, the cheesiness and the low-budget production seems to have come together to create a work of art that will live on for decades to come.Raj and Simran, the male and female leads, are endearing. The support cast are very good. The story line, whilst at times being predictable, also has some clever little twists and turns, and by the end of it you feel like you've watched a movie that will stay with you for many years to come, which I guess answers why Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge has such enduring popularity.Is it perfect? Definitely not. Is it worth watching?

10.0,A timeless classic!,"Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge represented the cosmic confluence of a lot of young talent that came together fortuitously. A 24 year old director cast a 29 year old rising actor and a 21 year old actress of some note in a film that represented the lives of innumerable Indians who had left the homeland and gone off to foreign shores. The film did not just show them in their foreign milieu but looked into their hearts, minds, morals and then also showed them back in the homeland. In a sense it integrated the reality of NRI life with the reality of life in India. The picture was an idealized one and showed that among the affluent as well as the middle class while the outer trappings were very modern the mentality was very traditional. Raj Malhotra (Shahrukh Khan) is the only son of a rich business man (Anupam Kher) and seems a wastrel type of fellow, but scratch below the surface and he is a true blue ""Hindustani""! Simran (Kajol) is one of two daughters of Chaudhary Baldev Singh, dresses in Western garb but again is a true blue traditional girl. On a tour of Europe the two meet and fall in love, but Simran has been engaged since childhood to the son of Baldev Singh's friend in India. She obeys her father and is taken back to India for the wedding. Raj follows on her heels. But Raj will not do the hackneyed thing of eloping with her - he has his own unique style and tries to win her by winning the hearts and minds of her family. The very traditional nature of the story resonated with the older generation among Indians and NRIs alike, while breaking from the tradition of eloping, and the charm and charisma of the protagonists appealed to the younger set. This made the movie into a huge blockbuster and one of the longest running films in Hindi cinema. In addition it made the careers of Shahrukh Khan, Kajol and Aditya Chopra.I like this film for its freshness and feel good feel, it never ceases to yank me out of the doldrums. It did set a bad trend in cinema because on its heels followed countless films with similar locales, characters, story lines. But isn't imitation the best form of flattery? The acting by the lead pair is amazing. Raj will charm a bird out of a tree, and Simran is the dream of every young man. Both SRK and Kajol did complete justice to these extremely well written roles and deserve all the kudos they got! Some moments of note - Raj grabbing beer from the store, telling Simran what kind of girl he is looking for, exchanging photos is Europe, on the bridge telling Simran he has fallen in love with her, telling his father that Simran is engaged to be married - in fact all but the last 15 minutes are excellently acted. Kajol telling her mother about the man of her dreams, hating Raj in Europe, telling him she she is engaged to be married, interacting with her mother upon her return from Europe - Kajol too hit the right note in each and every minute of the film except the last 15 minutes! Others are competent, Farida Jalal is of note as the mother and Anupam Kher as the father.The music is outstanding, every song is a gem. Of particular note is the picturization of Na Jaane mere dil ko - the blend of fantasy and reality was a first and has often been copied since then. The song Tujhe Dekha to is outstanding and Mehndi Laga ke Rakhna is a perennial favorite. But I personally love the cheeky Ruk Jaa o Dil Deewane.The movie does have some hackneyed moments - the last 15 minutes leave much to be desired, not in the ending itself but how every one got to that point. Amrish Puri is OTT at times as the angry father, but you can take all of this as there is so much that pleases so much!This is a film that truly deserves the label of Evergreen - it is ever fresh and ever pleasing.",timeless classic,dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge represented cosmic confluence lot young talent that came together fortuitously 24 year old director cast 29 year old rising actor 21 year old actress some note film that represented lives innumerable indians who had left homeland gone off foreign shores film did not just show them their foreign milieu but looked into their hearts minds morals then also showed them back homeland sense it integrated reality nri life with reality life india picture was idealized one showed that among affluent as well as middle class while outer trappings were very modern mentality was very traditional raj malhotra shahrukh khan is only son rich business man anupam kher seems wastrel type fellow but scratch below surface he is true blue hindustani simran kajol is one two daughters chaudhary baldev singh dresses western garb but again is true blue traditional girl tour europe two meet fall love but simran has been engaged since childhood son baldev singhs friend india she obeys her father is taken back india wedding raj follows her heels but raj will not do hackneyed thing eloping with her he has his own unique style tries win her by winning hearts minds her family very traditional nature story resonated with older generation among indians nris alike while breaking tradition eloping charm charisma protagonists appealed younger set this made movie into huge blockbuster one longest running films hindi cinema addition it made careers shahrukh khan kajol aditya chopra i like this film its freshness feel good feel it never ceases yank me out doldrums it did set bad trend cinema because its heels followed countless films with similar locales characters story lines but isnt imitation best form flattery acting by lead pair is amazing raj will charm bird out tree simran is dream every young man both srk kajol did complete justice these extremely well written roles deserve all kudos they got some moments note raj grabbing beer store telling simran what kind girl he is looking exchanging photos is europe bridge telling simran he has fallen love with her telling his father that simran is engaged be married fact all but last 15 minutes are excellently acted kajol telling her mother about man her dreams hating raj europe telling him she she is engaged be married interacting with her mother upon her return europe kajol too hit right note each every minute film except last 15 minutes others are competent farida jalal is note as mother anupam kher as father music is outstanding every song is gem particular note is picturization na jaane mere dil ko blend fantasy reality was first has often been copied since then song tujhe dekha is outstanding mehndi laga ke rakhna is perennial favorite but i personally love cheeky ruk jaa o dil deewane movie does have some hackneyed moments last 15 minutes leave much be desired not ending itself but how every one got that point amrish puri is ott at times as angry father but you can take all this as there is so much that pleases so much this is film that truly deserves label evergreen it is ever fresh ever pleasing,0.46578021978021966,0.19672893772893768,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"

,First mainstream Bollywood film,"I'm not going to get too much into reviewing the story of this movie, most of the other reviews are covering that for you. Honestly I don't remember too much the story that well anyways beyond the basics. Besides this is a Bollywood film, you know the melodramatic story of a boy and girl who fall in love against their parents wishes. I'll stick to a more cultural commentary. I remember 1995's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge being a good movie that dealt with second generation Indians living in England. This was a funny film that struck a chord with younger Indians living in Western countries around the world, and it was an obvious smash hit in India as well. Let me say that every country in the world has something ""cool"" or ""bad ass"" about it. But India has often had the most uncool, nerdy stereotypes about it. When I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, most of the representation of Indians in Western culture was limited to Apu from The Simpsons. Taxi drivers, convenience store clerks, curry, cow worshipers, more curry, thick English accents, effeminate men and hairy women,... nothing here was ever cool (these stereotypes are still here, yet are finally changing, albeit slowly). What kind of crazy kid wanted to be Indian? If I could have gotten away with passing myself off as a Mexican, I probably would have tried it. But then there was Bollywood, showcasing the beautiful people of India that could dance and sing just as good as anyone on MTV. This was the cool side to India. It made India look beautiful, exotic, young, hip and cultured. One of the biggest audiences for Bollywood flicks outside of India had traditionally been Indian girls. Older audiences obviously watched too, but young Indian women growing up in America have always been keen to Bollywood, many years before the arrival of DDLJ. Bollywood models, gharba dances, since as long as I can remember Indian girls immediately zeroed in on knowing that Bollywood was a cool piece of Indian pop culture that non-Indians didn't have access too or couldn't immediately claim as ""theirs"". Instead of being impenetrably ""foreign"", this industry made India look much more ""exotic"". I suppose it's the better balance to all those National Geographic specials that showed nomads in India eating the most disgusting things imaginable. Like all Indian movies, Bollywood flicks are overacted with dumb plots and idiotic fight scenes, but it involves outrageously beautiful people dancing and singing and that's always going to be cool. Beautiful people can make almost anything look cool. If Apu from The Simpsons has an arranged marriage then from the Western point of view it may look backward, cruel and dorky. If Aishwarya Rai or Hrithik Roshan has an arranged marriage, then it seems much more exotic and cultured,...hey maybe there's something to the concept. Beautiful or well accomplished people can turn previously weirdo things about a country into something cooler then it used to be perceived as. People are damn superficial aren't they? (Bollywood stars all being so fair skinned is a topic for another time) But DDLJ had a cross over appeal that didn't just include Indian girls. It was the first film that I remember being ""big"" amongst Indians. When I say it was ""mainstream"" I don't really mean that it fully crossed over into non-Indian audiences (though I know it did), but rather this is was the first Bollywood movie that I remember that was widely talked about and had immense appeal among many different types of Indian American audiences. Before the release of this film, Bollywood movies seemed to exist in their own little niche of loyal cult followers (usually young Indian women). Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge broke some of the rules and didn't just appeal to Indian girls who wished they could be in a Bollywood movie and marry some hunky fair skinned North Indian guy. No this film had an exposure to a broader audience that seemed to really put Bollywood on the map for Indians that grew up outside of India. Indian guys were into this film, yeah probably because Indian girls were into it, but it was big change from what was going on before. A movie about second generation Indians was automatically going to appeal to every Indian growing up in Europe, Canada, Australia and of course the U.S. This was newer territory and since then Bollywood films have increasingly become more youth targeted in their marketing campaigns. Despite plenty of moments of stupidity (I remember a ridiculous ""Yeeeeeeaahhhhhhhh!!"" yell by Raj during a game of rugby), this movie was the beginning of a small change in Indian culture. Indian exposure to non-Indians and the dispelling of stereotypes is still very much a work in progress and people are unlikely to mention DDLJ on history papers in the future, but it had a milestone effect in my opinion within the community. The overtly glitzy Hrithik Roshan stuff today in 2006 seems a bit more aimed at pre-teen girls (so it's gone even younger), but DDLJ was the most talked about film in the 90s. 11 years have gone by, Shahrukh Khan is nearly 41 years old, he's basically an ""Uncle"" today, a status a lot of Gen-X Indian Americans are creeping towards. Of course Bollywood is a silly representation of India, it's like someone in Mumbai watching Rambo and thinking that's America. But for a brief moment in the mid 90s, people were united in talking about this Hindi movie, regardless if they spoke Hindi, Tamil or Malayalam. The movie had a great cast and awesome dance numbers, along with a more humorous angle then previous flicks I had seen.

8.0,"A very typical sort of Indian love story...well done and likable but oh, so familiar.","In Indian films, there are several plots which are practically clichés because they occur so regularly. The most common, it seems, are the two lovers who fall in love but one or both of them are already pledged by their parents to marry another. Because of this, the plot to ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" is anything but original. However, this familiarity is something the Indian audiences love and pay to see. After all, almost ten years AFTER this movie debuted it was STILL playing in some theaters--such is the love of this sort of film in its native land. Since I am not Indian but love Indian films, I took the plot in stride and see this as a film that can be good but cannot be great simply because of the plot. It's a big case of 'been there/done that' as I watched...though the film is enjoyable and has its moments.When the film begins, Raj (Shah Rukh Khan) is supposed to be graduating from college but isn't because he's a bit of an irresponsible but likable rascal. As for his soon to be lady love, Simran (Kajol) is quite the opposite--very responsible and dependable. However, when they both go on vacations through Europe from their homes in the UK, you KNOW that soon they'll get together but the journey will, of course, be a rocky one. Because the movie is over three hours long, you know they cannot quickly fall for each other--and Raj's devil-may-care ways naturally rub Simran the wrong way...and they battle each other but always end up coming back to each other in the end. And you KNOW they are now in love because they take time to do musical interludes where they both talk about their love for each other. But, given the formula, the cannot get together...at least not yet. Simran is supposed to get married to a man her father chose for her and she's supposed to head to India to marry once this vacation is complete.As I already mentioned a couple times, this film is very predictable and formulaic. But, it works better than it should because Shah Rukh Khan is very good as a likable sort of jerk. This is a tough balancing act because I've seen other Indian films with nearly identical plots where the guy is insufferable and easy to hate. Here, Khan manages to pull it off well. So did I love the film? No. I liked it and think it's worth seeing. The ending was particularly nice. But I don't, for the life of me, understand why it has as strong an appeal as it did in India. But what do I know?! At least I liked and enjoyed it.",very typical sort indian love story well done likable but oh so familiar,indian films there are several plots which are practically clich s because they occur so regularly most common it seems are two lovers who fall love but one or both them are already pledged by their parents marry another because this plot dilwale dulhania le jayenge is anything but original however this familiarity is something indian audiences love pay see after all almost ten years after this movie debuted it was still playing some theaters such is love this sort film its native land since i am not indian but love indian films i took plot stride see this as film that can be good but cannot be great simply because plot its big case been there done that as i watched though film is enjoyable has its moments when film begins raj shah rukh khan is supposed be graduating college but isnt because hes bit irresponsible but likable rascal as his soon be lady love simran kajol is quite opposite very responsible dependable however when they both go vacations through europe their homes uk you know that soon theyll get together but journey will course be rocky one because movie is over three hours long you know they cannot quickly fall each other rajs devil may care ways naturally rub simran wrong way they battle each other but always end up coming back each other end you know they are now love because they take time do musical interludes where they both talk about their love each other but given formula cannot get together at least not yet simran is supposed get married man her father chose her shes supposed head india marry once this vacation is complete as i already mentioned couple times this film is very predictable formulaic but it works better than it should because shah rukh khan is very good as likable sort jerk this is tough balancing act because ive seen other indian films with nearly identical plots where guy is insufferable easy hate here khan manages pull it off well so did i love film no i liked it think its worth seeing ending was particularly nice but i dont life me understand why it has as strong appeal as it did india but what do i know at least i liked enjoyed it,0.4995918367346937,0.1898115079365079,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.4}"
6.0,One of the most overrated films of Indian cinema,"I don't even know how the hell this film has been deemed a classic. It is cheesy to the core. The ""acting"" by Shah Rukh Khan is really bad, and honestly, I didn't really see anything special in his acting. I know he has the potential very now and then, but I really wouldn't consider this one of his finest. All I really noticed was an annoying laugh that kind of sounds like a goat. Kajol did okay, I think she did the best in the film though out of all the actors. And another thing I don't understand is how do people think this is a good film? I mean, SRK is a troublemaker who goes around causing mischief, and he falls in love with a serious girl (Kajol). Kajol literally lies to her parents, because she said that if she goes on her trip, she'll marry who her parents choose. During this trip she lets SRK do many awkward things to her and then they fall in love and then SRK crashes her wedding, and then Kajol totally forgets about her promise and all that crap. I mean, in one scene SRK literally undresses her while she's unconscious and then changes her clothes! That is messed up. And last, there is so much cheesy dialogue, and the story is filled with clichés. Anyways, the only thing I liked was the music. The soundtrack of this movie was excellent however. I only recommend this ""classic"" to people who are overly romantic. Overall I rate this film a 5.5ish out of 10. I really don't consider this a classic, I think it is overrated.",one most overrated films indian cinema,i dont even know how hell this film has been deemed classic it is cheesy core acting by shah rukh khan is really bad honestly i didnt really see anything special his acting i know he has potential very now then but i really wouldnt consider this one his finest all i really noticed was annoying laugh that kind sounds like goat kajol did okay i think she did best film though out all actors another thing i dont understand is how do people think this is good film i mean srk is troublemaker who goes around causing mischief he falls love with serious girl kajol kajol literally lies her parents because she said that if she goes her trip shell marry who her parents choose during this trip she lets srk do many awkward things her then they fall love then srk crashes her wedding then kajol totally forgets about her promise all that crap i mean one scene srk literally undresses her while shes unconscious then changes her clothes that is messed up last there is so much cheesy dialogue story is filled with clich s anyways only thing i liked was music soundtrack this movie was excellent however i only recommend this classic people who are overly romantic overall i rate this film 5 5ish out 10 i really dont consider this classic i think it is overrated,0.5524107142857143,0.11747023809523811,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.19}"

,"Aditya Chopra's ""untouchable"" winning trophy","Aditya Chopra should be kicking himself for having made DDLJ and setting the benchmark so high that he can't even touch it (leave alone reaching it! Surpassing it? Forget it!). DDLJ is akin to Sholay and in both cases, the directors miserably failed in subsequent ventures and went into sabbatical/ hibernation.The soul of the movie is extremely strong and execution taut. No matter how many times you watch it, even from in-between it captivates you instantly. Truly it can be said heart-and-soul was poured into making of DDLJ.And yes, in terms of editing the the DDLJ is based in Europe up to intermission and India after that. Master-stroke!SRK even though is at hamming-best but honestly it goes very well with the character. Kajol was slightly on the heavier side but has a strong screen presence. Amrish Puri was spot-on. I won't list all the actors, but they were all 100% (including the paunchy Karan Johar!).Songs deserve a special mention, including Anand Bakshi's lyrics. It was rumoured that DDLJ was ghost-directed by Papa. Well no comments to that.",aditya chopras untouchable winning trophy,aditya chopra should be kicking himself having made ddlj setting benchmark so high that he cant even touch it leave alone reaching it surpassing it forget it ddlj is akin sholay both cases directors miserably failed subsequent ventures went into sabbatical hibernation soul movie is extremely strong execution taut no matter how many times you watch it even between it captivates you instantly truly it can be said heart soul was poured into making ddlj yes terms editing ddlj is based europe up intermission india after that master stroke srk even though is at hamming best but honestly it goes very well with character kajol was slightly heavier side but has strong screen presence amrish puri was spot i wont list all actors but they were all 100 including paunchy karan johar songs deserve special mention including anand bakshis lyrics it was rumoured that ddlj was ghost directed by papa well no comments that,0.5008791208791209,0.27054945054945057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Winning the hand of sweetheart is a big project,"After watching Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge, I concluded that there's something about this movie which I had not read in any review or article pertaining to this movie. And that is - getting anything in your life you cherish, is a mission, a project which demands planning, efforts, self-belief, patience and perseverance. For a boy, winning the hand of a girl in marriage also falls into this line only. Winning her heart is one thing but after that, winning the will of her family / parents / guardians for the desired marriage is an altogether different and equally (if not more) difficult business.DDLJ is a love story of Raj (Shah Rukh Khan), an irresponsible motherless youth who happens to be the son of a rich NRI (Anupam Kher) in London and Simran (Kajol) who is the daughter of a London based Indian chemist (Amrish Puri) who despite living away from his motherland, has not compromised with the Indian family values. He expects his family members to follow the same path and Simran too has always complied with whatever she has been taught by him. However she has a vision of her prince-charming in her heart that she expresses in her poems. Against expectations, she gets permission from her father to go on a one month long tour of Europe with her friends and during this tour, she comes across Raj. And thereafter life is not the same either for Raj or for Simran.However, since Simran is already engaged to a youth in Punjab (India), her father gets furious when coming to know that she has fallen in love with someone. He, with his family, returns back to India and starts arranging for Simran's marriage with her childhood-fiancé, Kuljeet (Parmeet Sethi). Now it's a great challenge for Raj to win the hand of his sweetheart from her parents. He too comes to their place and gets intermixed in the family, pretending to be from the side of the groom. Winning over Simran's mother (Farida Jalaal) and younger sister (Pooja Ruparel) proves to be a cakewalk for him but winning the trust and will of Simran's father is a Herculean Task especially when he had already shown his true colour to him once on his chemist shop in London. How this Dilwala (a man with a heart) is able to carry (Le Jaana) his Dulhaniya (bride) with him forms the post-interval session of the movie.The first half shows the faith of Simran's father in the Indian family and social values and his love towards the soil of his motherland despite his living away from it. It also shows the development of romance of Raj and Simran which is heart-warming. In this movie, actually it's the script which despite being formula-studded, makes it a winner and renders it the status of a cult movie. There are several heart-conquering sequences with the impressive dialogs in both the halves. The doses of romance, sentiments and music are sufficient to take the audience in a state of trance especially when watching the film in theatre. And that's why this movie could run for one and a half decades in Maratha Mandir cinema of Mumbai.Jatin-Lalit's music is mesmerizing. Though all the songs are good and Tujhe Dekha To Ye Jaana Sanam and Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna Doli Saja Ke Rakhna were chartbusters, I will mention two different songs here – the first one is Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyar Sajna which underscores the depth of love in the hearts of both the lovers with a high level of intensity and the second one is Ghar Aaja Pardesi Tera Des Bulaaye Re which is definitely an underrated song of this album. You listen to it calmly and then you will feel the fragrance of the Indian soil through its word. Any NRI living abroad may get passionate to see his motherland by listening to this song. And Mere Khwabon Mein Jo Aaye is a song showing not only the talent but also the unmatchable sex-appeal of Kajol.Performances are great. Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol have shown amazing on-screen chemistry and won the heart of the audience quite effortlessly with their performances. It's a movie to be watched again and again by lovers (and that too together). All others have also done well including Anupam Kher, being the proud father of Raj (despite all the minus points in his son's personality) and Farida Jalaal, being the frustrated mother who wants her daughter not to undergo the same frustration in her life as she herself had undergone.However the actor who has immortalized himself in this movie is Amrish Puri who has delivered perhaps the best ever performance of his career. A loving and caring father whose thoughts are rooted in the Indian traditional values but at the same time, who loves his daughter very much. He is against the boy because he opines him to be unworthy of his daughter but when he sees the depth and sincerity of the boy's love for his daughter, he mentally prepares himself for their union, has been portrayed by Amrish in a highly realistic, impressive and touching way. I have never seen a better performance by any actor in the role of the father of grown-up daughters in Bollywood cinema.I hope that the eligible bachelors who are longing to marry their respective sweethearts will learn from this movie to keep their morale high when the odds are heavily tilted against them in this regard and energize themselves for the mission impossible (just a figure of speech) to win them from their parents / guardians through the sacred knots. Keep remember, to get the Dulhaniya (bride), you have to be a Dilwaala (strong-hearted).",winning hand sweetheart is big project,after watching dilwale dulhaniya le jaayenge i concluded that theres something about this movie which i had not read any review or article pertaining this movie that is getting anything your life you cherish is mission project which demands planning efforts self belief patience perseverance boy winning hand girl marriage also falls into this line only winning her heart is one thing but after that winning will her family parents guardians desired marriage is altogether different equally if not more difficult business ddlj is love story raj shah rukh khan irresponsible motherless youth who happens be son rich nri anupam kher london simran kajol who is daughter london based indian chemist amrish puri who despite living away his motherland has not compromised with indian family values he expects his family members follow same path simran too has always complied with whatever she has been taught by him however she has vision her prince charming her heart that she expresses her poems against expectations she gets permission her father go one month long tour europe with her friends during this tour she comes across raj thereafter life is not same either raj or simran however since simran is already engaged youth punjab india her father gets furious when coming know that she has fallen love with someone he with his family returns back india starts arranging simrans marriage with her childhood fianc kuljeet parmeet sethi now its great challenge raj win hand his sweetheart her parents he too comes their place gets intermixed family pretending be side groom winning over simrans mother farida jalaal younger sister pooja ruparel proves be cakewalk him but winning trust will simrans father is herculean task especially when he had already shown his true colour him once his chemist shop london how this dilwala man with heart is able carry le jaana his dulhaniya bride with him forms post interval session movie first half shows faith simrans father indian family social values his love towards soil his motherland despite his living away it it also shows development romance raj simran which is heart warming this movie actually its script which despite being formula studded makes it winner renders it status cult movie there are several heart conquering sequences with impressive dialogs both halves doses romance sentiments music are sufficient take audience state trance especially when watching film theatre thats why this movie could run one half decades maratha mandir cinema mumbai jatin lalits music is mesmerizing though all songs are good tujhe dekha ye jaana sanam mehndi laga ke rakhna doli saja ke rakhna were chartbusters i will mention two different songs here first one is ho gaya hai tujhko pyar sajna which underscores depth love hearts both lovers with high level intensity second one is ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaaye re which is definitely underrated song this album you listen it calmly then you will feel fragrance indian soil through its word any nri living abroad may get passionate see his motherland by listening this song mere khwabon mein jo aaye is song showing not only talent but also unmatchable sex appeal kajol performances are great shah rukh khan kajol have shown amazing screen chemistry won heart audience quite effortlessly with their performances its movie be watched again again by lovers that too together all others have also done well including anupam kher being proud father raj despite all minus points his sons personality farida jalaal being frustrated mother who wants her daughter not undergo same frustration her life as she herself had undergone however actor who has immortalized himself this movie is amrish puri who has delivered perhaps best ever performance his career loving caring father whose thoughts are rooted indian traditional values but at same time who loves his daughter very much he is against boy because he opines him be unworthy his daughter but when he sees depth sincerity boys love his daughter he mentally prepares himself their union has been portrayed by amrish highly realistic impressive touching way i have never seen better performance by any actor role father grown up daughters bollywood cinema i hope that eligible bachelors who are longing marry their respective sweethearts will learn this movie keep their morale high when odds are heavily tilted against them this regard energize themselves mission impossible just figure speech win them their parents guardians through sacred knots keep remember get dulhaniya bride you have be dilwaala strong hearted,0.522511737089202,0.23504694835680756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,"""A Gem..? No! not at all, But a Kohinoor.""","I've seen a lot of Bollywood romances. Not just Bollywood but romances throughout the world cinema. They are more or less the same typical story of a girl meets boy, they have some obstacles and finally a happy ending. But what makes a romance special or different. The story? Obviously not! It is but the other details mainly character dept and development, an ordinary story artfully crafted into a path breaking script and to some extent awesome music.You know a movie is great when you start to feel for the characters. Their pain their suffering, their happiness their problems become your own. 20 minutes into this 3 hour long experience, you become a part of it. You know what is coming next, but you want to see it happen. That's the power of SRK, Kajol and Aditya's finest.What is true love? It is something that can't be answered, but only felt, and only by those who have been through it. Everyone has their own definition. This movie moves along ""trusting in each other no matter what"". Another theme is the Indian culture. A diverse culture where girls are worshiped as the incarnation of Goddess Durga, at same time a girl child is frowned upon, a girl is caged in her house, forced to live the life which has been pre decided by her parents and the society. This is a girls tale towards her desire to be independent, and to be with the man who makes her feel independent. It is a story about a guy who is a spoil brat, but by heart an Indian who values his land's traditions.Being an Indian, I know about the orthodox beliefs of arranged marriage where love marriage is still frowned upon by the society, movies like these vow to influence that ""orthodox"" strata of the society, and forces them to reconsider their believes.Despite the overwhelming positives, there seems to be a flaw, I am of the opinion that the costumes did not match the overall theme of the movie. Kajol wears a lot of ""non-traditional"" outfits, which could have been avoided. I understand that the character wanted to be free rather than a caged bird, but it seemed a little bit ""excessive"". Just my thought though, and an ignorable one perhaps! After the movie, its not the story, but the characters and the songs are what stays with you.Direction: Outstanding piece of direction, a well shot film across Europe and Incredible India. Thanks to Mr Chopra we today have some trade marked scenes, which will live on generation after generation, like ""meeting in the fields"", ""the train scene"" etc.Script: An extraordinarily written piece of drama, with excellent character development.Acting: One of the best assemble. Each and every cast member has brought the characters to life. You feel as a part of the wedding. SRK and Kajol along with superb acting share a strong chemistry. Amrish Ji, Anupam Kher everyone was excellent. In the end a good advice by Mr. Yash Chopra to not Include Tom Cruise and make this an Indo-Amercian love story. And one more thing, I was really surprised to see Karan Johar LOL!.Music: There is not an Indian alive who hasn't heard ""Tujhe Dekha to Yeh Jana Sanam"". I know people, who in 2013 hum the tunes of the movie, without knowing from which movie the songs are. An overly excellent Soundtrack. ""Ghar aja pardesi"" is my personal favorite.DDLJ is Bollywood's and India's Pride!",gem no not at all but kohinoor,ive seen lot bollywood romances not just bollywood but romances throughout world cinema they are more or less same typical story girl meets boy they have some obstacles finally happy ending but what makes romance special or different story obviously not it is but other details mainly character dept development ordinary story artfully crafted into path breaking script some extent awesome music you know movie is great when you start feel characters their pain their suffering their happiness their problems become your own 20 minutes into this 3 hour long experience you become part it you know what is coming next but you want see it happen thats power srk kajol adityas finest what is true love it is something that cant be answered but only felt only by those who have been through it everyone has their own definition this movie moves along trusting each other no matter what another theme is indian culture diverse culture where girls are worshiped as incarnation goddess durga at same time girl child is frowned upon girl is caged her house forced live life which has been pre decided by her parents society this is girls tale towards her desire be independent be with man who makes her feel independent it is story about guy who is spoil brat but by heart indian who values his lands traditions being indian i know about orthodox beliefs arranged marriage where love marriage is still frowned upon by society movies like these vow influence that orthodox strata society forces them reconsider their believes despite overwhelming positives there seems be flaw i am opinion that costumes did not match overall theme movie kajol wears lot non traditional outfits which could have been avoided i understand that character wanted be free rather than caged bird but it seemed little bit excessive just my thought though ignorable one perhaps after movie its not story but characters songs are what stays with you direction outstanding piece direction well shot film across europe incredible india thanks mr chopra we today have some trade marked scenes which will live generation after generation like meeting fields train scene etc script extraordinarily written piece drama with excellent character development acting one best assemble each every cast member has brought characters life you feel as part wedding srk kajol along with superb acting share strong chemistry amrish ji anupam kher everyone was excellent end good advice by mr yash chopra not include tom cruise make this indo amercian love story one more thing i was really surprised see karan johar lol music there is not indian alive who hasnt heard tujhe dekha yeh jana sanam i know people who 2013 hum tunes movie without knowing which movie songs are overly excellent soundtrack ghar aja pardesi is my personal favorite ddlj is bollywoods indias pride,0.5679960317460317,0.2773728354978355,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
