9.0,Very well made--tough to watch.,"Warning--This movie is NOT for young kids or those who do not wish to see violence and adult content, as it's rather brutal and the language is pretty rough. Now I am not complaining about this, but this is clearly an adult film intended for adults. It's hard to really do this sort of film without making it this intense--just be forewarned. In addition, this is a very tense and unpleasant sort of film--be aware of this before watching.This film has a ton of reviews, so my summarizing the film or going into any sort of in-depth analysis is probably a giant waste of time. And, Bob the Moo has done such a good job of reviewing it, I say you just go read his! In brief, here's what I liked or at least respected in the film: It had a very gritty realism and managed to pull the viewer into it very, very well. The first portion (in boot camp) and the second portion (in Vietnam) were very different but both were very tense and compelling. While it wasn't pretty, it was well done.And, in brief, here's what I didn't like: The constant and clich√©d use of rock and pop music. A few decades ago, this would have been innovative. Now, FULL METAL JACKET sounds an awful lot like GOOD MORNING Vietnam and APOCALYPSE NOW and other films. The constant blaring soundtrack was, I suppose, meant to be surreal and illustrate how ludicrous the war was. However, I just thought hearing ""Surfin' Bird"" was annoying and a cheap use of music. Apart from that, there isn't anything to say negative about the film.Is this the greatest anti-war film? No. Its message (like the war) was rather mixed at times and lacked the same impact of films like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT or WESTFRONT 1918, but it sure did come close.",very well made tough watch,warning this movie is not young kids or those who do not wish see violence adult content as its rather brutal language is pretty rough now i am not complaining about this but this is clearly adult film intended adults its hard really do this sort film without making it this intense just be forewarned addition this is very tense unpleasant sort film be aware this before watching this film has ton reviews so my summarizing film or going into any sort depth analysis is probably giant waste time bob moo has done such good job reviewing it i say you just go read his brief heres what i liked or at least respected film it had very gritty realism managed pull viewer into it very very well first portion boot camp second portion vietnam were very different but both were very tense compelling while it wasnt pretty it was well done brief heres what i didnt like constant clich d use rock pop music few decades ago this would have been innovative now full metal jacket sounds awful lot like good morning vietnam apocalypse now other films constant blaring soundtrack was i suppose meant be surreal illustrate how ludicrous war was however i just thought hearing surfin bird was annoying cheap use music apart that there isnt anything say negative about film is this greatest anti war film no its message like war was rather mixed at times lacked same impact films like all quiet western front or westfront 1918 but it sure did come close,0.5564351851851851,0.025266203703703704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Paint It Black,"""With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black"". So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles.",paint it black,with flowers my love both never come back its not easy facing up when your whole world is black so sings man whose throbbing song marks films end merciless lyrics describe thematically story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing there are no villains this film only heroic victims villains are all off screen comfy behind mahogany desks or dressed success giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war strange logic first its boot camp dreary prospect at best ordinary group young american men here sadistic drill sargent colorful language barks out orders insults straight hades its do or die almost literally our greenhorns its ordeal blackness which some may never recover still grunts learn valuable lesson namely that life is mostly physical not mental its lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn but then its even blacker black vietnam combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals terrific sound effects pounding percussion amplified sounds equipment footsteps across explosive debris always present ever so subtle echo potent torturous these scenes convey zen like immediacy impending sense doom then at films end those lyrics composed two barely overlapping parts scripts structure is bit unorthodox but film works owing intensity that never lets up r lee ermey is course terrific as harsh drillmaster casting young lions is okay though tad weak one or two cases insertion pop songs era works well amplify cultural disconnect between war torn vietnam indifferent america like reading history book watching occasional war movie is good soul it puts ones problems perspective that reason this particular war movie is better than most its riveting intense sense impending blackness hovers ever present over storys heroic victims like sword damocles,0.48814589665653496,0.13812056737588652,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,'Born To Kill' - The best Vietnam war movie of all time,"SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. 'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the ""duality of Man"" according to Jung. 10/10",born kill best vietnam war movie all time,spoiler full metal jacket is 1987 realistic vietnam war film is one best films 80s ever made directed produced by stanley kubrick screenplay by kubrick michael herr gustav hasford was based hasfords novel short timers 1979 full metal jacket 1987 was nominated 1 oscar another 7 wins 9 nominations it is one my personal favorite war movies i love this movie death superb ensemble falls stanley kubricks brilliant saga about vietnam war dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers joker matthew modine animal mother adam baldwin gomer vincent donofrio eightball dorian harewood cowboy arliss howard more experience boot camp hell pit bulled by leather lung d i lee ermey viewing would be devil dogs as grunts maggots or something less action is savage story unsparing dialog spiked with catching humor basic training rigors hue city combat nightmare full metal jacket scores cinematic direct hit film focus two segment look at effect military mindset war itself vietnam era marines first half follows group recruits boot camp under command punishing gunnery sergeant hartman hell camp dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers boys trained mean machine killers its late 1960s at parris island south carolina u s marine corps training camp where group young marine recruits after having their heads shaved are being prepped basic training by brutal gunnery sergeant hartman r lee ermey whose orders are weed out all non hackers hartman gives each marines nicknames one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes joker matthew modine texas recruit becomes cowboy arliss howard finally leonard lawrence 6 foot 3 inch 280 pound slow witted recruit with low intelligence ambition becomes gomer pyle vincent donofrio focus hartmans brutality because overweight boy cannot keep up with other more physically fit recruits grueling obstacle courses first half more focus training basics preparing recruits before they ship them vietnam point view story telling private james t joker davis matthew modine about torture physics young men who is marine recruit platoon lead by gunnery sergeant hartman his parris island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad his mistakes how that young man turns killing mean machine that blows hartmans head off than pyle sits down toilet places muzzle weapon his mouth pulls trigger killing himself second half shows one those recruits joker covering war as correspondent stars stripes focusing tet offensive film now more focus one those recruits private joker matthew moddine boot camp parris island who is da nang vietnam reporting vietnam war military newspaper stars stripes he his partner combat photographer rafterman kevyn major howard meet prostitute leanne hong streets encounter thief nguyen hue phong who steals raftermans camera when they return their base they are given new assignments but joker wants go front lines get good story joker rafterman are assigned phu bai marine forward operating base near ancient vietnamese city hue joker is reunited with his team recruit his training boot camp paris island cowboy his unit lusthog squad before they met cowboys unit they are go trough they go mass grave find over 20 bodies mass grave that have been covered with lime film is staney kubricks best realistic vietnam war film all time one my all time favorite vietnam war flicks 80s other film is platoon 1986 once more theres excellent cinematography check out haunting almost claustrophobic landscapes vietnam combination demented treatment recruits receive boot camp with combined hours boredom seconds terror feel vietnam scenes is intense not everyone but feels real i love how film focus more city hue battlefield starts their battle scene sequences are outstanding terrific they look real there are dozens bodys out their we first see tank driving trough city hue citys are filed with fire burning buildings destroyed houses street is full blood sergeant animal mother adam baldwin nihilistic m60 machine gunner lusthog squad is one most beloved characters movie he is at best supporting cast member but you wouldnt even think about animal mother being just another guy he is so memorable that you look at him as one stars show born kill written jokes helmet is sequent that it has do with duality man according jung 10 10,0.48559958559958544,0.18623899248899245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6.0,A film of two halves,"'Full Metal Jacket' was a film that I had been meaning to watch for a while after all the good stuff I had heard about it.It really is a film of two halves, unfortunately I didn't like the 2nd half.The 1st half at boot camp was excellent, we saw a lot of character development and emotion as well as a lot of humour and really serious issues. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio were just brilliant.The 2nd half I didn't enjoy as much, it looked great and there was a lot of action but it was just a bit boring and felt really dragged out, whereas the 1st part just had everything that you wanted.Glad I got round to seeing it but wouldn't watch it again, slightly disappointed after a really good start to the film.6/10.",film two halves,full metal jacket was film that i had been meaning watch while after all good stuff i had heard about it it really is film two halves unfortunately i didnt like 2nd half 1st half at boot camp was excellent we saw lot character development emotion as well as lot humour really serious issues r lee ermey vincent donofrio were just brilliant 2nd half i didnt enjoy as much it looked great there was lot action but it was just bit boring felt really dragged out whereas 1st part just had everything that you wanted glad i got round seeing it but wouldnt watch it again slightly disappointed after really good start film 6 10,0.5007575757575757,0.12575757575757576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.11}"
,Kubrick - yay! One of the best war-based movies ever,"I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.As plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.Gustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.All the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.And so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.Is `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10.",kubrick yay one best war based movies ever,i like kubricks stuff generally any movie he directed was several notches quality terms above any other director particularly those working nowdays does full metal jacket continue show mastermind behind 2001 shining dr strangelove yup it does as plots go there isnt much here i dont particularly care because script makes up it full metal jacket is very much movie two halves first half dealing with group conscripts training at military camp hardships they endure under their hard as nails instructor second half is about their exploits vietnam itself fights nam havent we seen all that before yes but rarely with such experienced hand at work its camp scenes that are so wonderful gustav hasford et al have produced excellent script particularly opening hour theres barely moments pause before youre thrown into screaming face sergeant hartman hes hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful sharp theyll have you gasping shock while simultaneously laughing incredulity its way script runs without pause breath that helps so wonderfully fact that its so powerful its never just about one liners sergeant its also telling story about how humans work under these conditions first half is about how they suffer under their own at home very well told it is too second half about human condition under duress war its interesting comparison tale well told battle may lack some sort overall context or resolution but then i feel thats keeping with movie its about individual not war such elements cannot be easily quantified all characters have grounded real world feel them due both material versatility actors r lee emery is viciously delightful as manic sergeant hartman while managing add occasional touches humanity this is your own good attitude through subtle gestures matthew modine is amiable lead private joker as such balances hard soft edges admirably if not spectacularly other stand out though is vincent donofrio as private gomer pyle recruit picked upon by hartman other cadets theres wonderful innocence about him beginning which transforms into frightening hardening his soul later evil beyond hope look he gives later anyone who has seen movie will know one i mean remains as most frightening look ive ever seen depicted onscreen all all cast accredit themselves well here so direction its kubrick its good once more theres excellent cinematography check out haunting almost claustrophobic landscapes vietnam theres some lovely use filters that haunting blue theres brilliant subtle score thats eerie when used but never intrusive theres very good command pace viewer is never left idle or bored story particularly tremendous first half flows along smoothly great touches abound throughout check out many examples such as opening scene hartman marching right up recruits camera spitting screaming vindictive comments almost as if at viewer some may criticise almost disconnected feeling you have battle scenes towards end but i found their stillness their quietness raw power far more effective than flash bang wizardry employed tripe such as we were heroes i can blather about kubrick ages so ill stop now is full metal jacket perfect not quite because two halves syndrome although they do contrast complement one another first half is very much stronger half second feels weaker against it itself second half would normally be regarded well but it doesnt have visceral power that first does i love both bits but i do love one bit more this makes movie suffer just little theres so much like here though that i cant criticise too much so much cherish especially lines delved out once more main man succeeds definetely worth seeing 9 10,0.49103907456180185,0.17121644264826086,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,The movies finally got Parris Island right,"Though I've read only a couple of dozen of the nearly 500 comments on this film, I didn't see any from ex-Marines who'd had the Parris Island experience. I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s. For the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn't he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in ""The Boys of Company C,"" an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you're facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.Kubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle's ending, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.I've read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don't know if that's good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!A final note: It's interesting to compare ""Full Metal Jacket"" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's ""The DI,"" made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp.",movies finally got parris island right,though ive read only couple dozen nearly 500 comments this film i didnt see any ex marines whod had parris island experience i went through pi 1957 time period picture would have been about 1967 since country sequence includes 68 tet offensive little had changed those 10 years except switch m1s m16s most part kubrick got parris island right money why shouldnt he have since his screen di lee ermey was fact real di before he started acting he played another di boys company c earlier lesser vietnam flick he had built technical adviser screams insults profanity physical punishment were all part dis armamentarium when youre facing up 75 young strangers you need immediately establish absolute authority hang it 13 weeks furthermore you want break breakable as soon as you can my platoon had its private pyles though none ended up as he does full metal jacket i remember that they simply disappeared our ranks never be heard again nothing ermey as sgt hartman does is exaggerated kubrick however does exaggerate speaking pyles ending its almost impossible me imagine that recruit could manage sneak clip live rounds away rifle range every shooter at range has his own rifle coach every single round is very carefully accounted kubrick started killing one scene too early ive read that dis nowadays are forbidden use time honored f word are not allowed lay hands recruits i dont know if thats good or bad training i had my face slapped hard my first day boot camp that was just openers but then all us old timers like brag about how tough it useta be final note its interesting compare full metal jacket another attempt at portrayal parris island jack webbs di made around 55 or 56 webb tries authenticity but as i was learn year or so later his pi was boy scout camp,0.5306949806949806,0.04112544362544363,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,Kubrick is genius.,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war.

,The Battle Photographer,"Spoilers herein.Since Vietnam, there have been a few competent films by Americans about Americans on the ground in battle. I think which one you like best (or appreciate the most) probably says a lot about you and how you look through the filmmaker's camera.Ready? `Red Line,' `Metal Jacket.' `Catch-22,' `Apocalypse,' `3 Kings,' `Platoon,' `Private Ryan.' Seven types of people. How would you rank them? Who are you? How do you see?I listed them according to my own ranking, which is heavily weighted on the degree to which the filmmaker mastered the art of filmmaking to do something to my soul that no one else could through any other art experience. Private Ryan was just a noisey Norman Rockwell. Platoon's war was somebody's fault, and we watch colorful and depictions as accusations. But Red Line weaved a mystical hypnotic internal narrative that put me in the mind (and incidentally the body) of a character swept by violent events. So very expert at understanding how to make us see war around us permanently on leaving the theater.But I rank this film high as well. Less visceral, at least at first. But there is so much style in the manner of the storytelling that it alone has more power than the story itself.The story is clever, however, concerned with framing the narrative. `Joker,' (an apt name if there ever was one) starts with a voiceover. We immediately know it is his story, but we don't know which character matches the voice for sure until the toilet murder scene. So we spend about half of the film, not in the story proper, but in a metastory which defines the narrator. And bingo, at the end, he is turned into a reporter.Then flash to a whore's butt and the story begins with a stolen camera! Immediately thereafter we have a whole different stance from Kubric's camera. Before, it was sterile, `outside' the action like most other films. Now it turns into a camera that is part of the group. It's internal to the gathering and travels with the men as a member of the party. And the camera is now less apparently controlled by the reporter than by the sweep of fate.We go through a middle section which sets up the `war story' proper, and this is framed once again by dickering with a whore. Then we are carried along with Rafterman's cameras. (And incidentally, Kubric's daughter with a camera at the burial pit.)And now to battle, and the style takes on a new Dantesque hue at the third layer of Hell. Just one example: that trio of sounds leading up to final encounter with the sniper are three metallic grating/screeching sounds that transmute to nearly identical violin sounds leading up to Joker's decision to shoot. Another: the sets in this third are transforming. I invite you to compare them to Spielburg's for a literal eyeopener. `Enemy at the Gates' had a similar battle-sniper-set style, clearly derivative of Kubric, but more stagey. Here we have carefully composed primitive shapes and fractal textures that suggest more than mere war: the destruction of civilization but the preservation of a more basic order. Another: the action is interrupted by journalistic interviews where the characters look you right in the eye to underscore that you are there -- you are the narrator; you have to decide whether to shoot or not.Kubric is a very personal filmmaker, and his personality is tied up in abstractions unique to the film narrative.

7.0,That Giant Sucking Sound,"The unifying theme of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is that Vietnam put American in the toilet; each of the film's three parts, or ""Acts"", has characters in what is repeatedly described as ""a world of s--t."" The men are successful trained to kill - but, they do not know when to kill, who to kill, or why anyone should die. Narrator protagonist Matthew Modine (as James ""Joker"" Davis) not only wears a ""Peace"" button on his uniform, but also has written ""Born To Kill"" on his helmet (to illustrate the duality of man). The reason for the war is explained, ""We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out."" Probably, the film's strongest ""story"" is told in the first ""Act""; it features drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (as Hartman) belittling overweight Vincent D'Onofrio (as Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence). This story literally ends in the latrine, where a successfully trained killer demonstrates his ability. Some of the material in the rest of the film becomes very weak, in comparison; especially disappointing are some mid-movie scenes ""staged"" for the camera of ""Stars and Stripes"" photographer ""Rafterman"" (Kevyn Major Howard) - the characters all say silly things for the camera.

9.0,"""It's your hard heart that kills.""","Kubrick's scathing anti-war message begins immediately with a harrowing twenty minute indoctrination into Marine boot camp training that leaves little to the imagination. The acclaimed director hammers the viewer with the relentless battering of young recruit Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant (R. Lee Ermey), and effectively captures the dehumanizing aspect of preparing killers for the defense of their country. However I'm not convinced that Matthew Modine was the best choice to demonstrate the duality that Kubrick was going for with his 'Born to Kill' helmet juxtaposed with that peace button on his lapel. He wasn't a colorful enough character and didn't demonstrate a set of core values that one could relate to, as his own anti-war sentiment seemed to surface only when the picture shifted to 'in country' as Viet vets used to call it. In fact, none of the soldiers here are particularly memorable, not in the way Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe are remembered for their portrayals in ""Platoon"". The picture is at it's wicked best during the early boot camp sequence, but loses some focus during the battle at Hue City. The identity of the sniper was a clever twist, and I think this is where Kubrick most effectively demonstrated the duality he was going for, by showing us that it wasn't Joker's hard heart that made him pull the trigger, but his compassion for another human being. He then brings the absurdity of all war home by having the soldiers return to base camp while singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song. The post-Viet Nam decade brought forth a significant number of critically acclaimed films, and it's tough to choose a 'best' when you have such offerings as ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" in the mix, all of which have strong statements to make about the inherent inhumanity of all war.",its your hard heart that kills,kubricks scathing anti war message begins immediately with harrowing twenty minute indoctrination into marine boot camp training that leaves little imagination acclaimed director hammers viewer with relentless battering young recruit leonard lawrence vincent donofrio by brutal gunnery sergeant r lee ermey effectively captures dehumanizing aspect preparing killers defense their country however im not convinced that matthew modine was best choice demonstrate duality that kubrick was going with his born kill helmet juxtaposed with that peace button his lapel he wasnt colorful enough character didnt demonstrate set core values that one could relate as his own anti war sentiment seemed surface only when picture shifted country as viet vets used call it fact none soldiers here are particularly memorable not way charlie sheen tom berenger willem defoe are remembered their portrayals platoon picture is at its wicked best during early boot camp sequence but loses some focus during battle at hue city identity sniper was clever twist i think this is where kubrick most effectively demonstrated duality he was going by showing us that it wasnt jokers hard heart that made him pull trigger but his compassion another human being he then brings absurdity all war home by having soldiers return base camp while singing mickey mouse club theme song post viet nam decade brought forth significant number critically acclaimed films its tough choose best when you have such offerings as platoon apocalypse now deer hunter mix all which have strong statements make about inherent inhumanity all war,0.6280864197530865,0.13112139917695473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,The Marine's don't want robots - they want killers.,"This is the journey undertaken by Private ""Joker"" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.As most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford's (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that ""Jacket"" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private ""Joker's"" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.Then it's that second half...Where do we go from here? We already know that ""Joker"" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the ""Boot Camp"" set up. Modine's (who isn't strong enough to carry the picture) ""Joker"" is now the film's axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by ""Joker"".Full Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10",marines dont want robots they want killers,this is journey undertaken by private joker j t davis brutal training camp vietnam itself as most people know by now full metal jacket is divided very much into two different halves halves that me show best worst talented director stanley kubrick first part we are subjected training regime inflicted wet behind ears boys boys soon become marines out harshness vietnam war this is real dehumanising stuff frighteningly essayed by brilliance drill instructor r lee ermeys performance we know see feel that boys are primed be killing machines unemotional killing machines at that with kubrick astutely weaving brutality camp into moral quandary that was war itself one particular recruit private gomer heartfelt unnervingly great vincent donofrio is film gustav hasfords writer novel co screenwriter here point reference this incredible first half its with this strand that jacket burns itself into soul viewer hopefully set us up what will be private jokers matthew modine preparation vietnam conflict then its that second half where do we go here we already know that joker his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped their basic humanity soldiers primed kill its harsh but true but kubrick has already chilled our blood bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy boot camp set up modines who isnt strong enough carry picture joker is now films axis clever most definitely articulate character who is thrust into murky muddled battle tet offensive yeah so all it amounts is prolonged series rationale philosophical musings false war kubrick even shifting safe mode with clumsy narration segment spouted by joker full metal jacket is truly fine film but its not brilliant one it really should have been if one can take time venture deeper with second half then it doesnt deliver already made point promise first part technically its flawless incredibly designed with douglas milsomes cinematography stunningly effective but ill maintain my final day that full metal jacket finished up as being bloody pretty instead being poignant horrifying masterpiece 7 10,0.5528070175438596,0.09067251461988303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"

I will therefore not illustrate this point : thousands have done it before me, often brilliantly.I'd rather lay the stress on Kubrick's modernity in ""Full Metal Jacket"". Indeed the USA being once again at war, it is interesting to compare the way they wage war these days with the way they did back in the sixties. And the comparison is edifying. Just apply the following statements to Iraq and you will realize NOTHING HAS CHANGED : - the marines are trained to become killing machines without being taught minimum knowledge about the people they come to defend. - the boys know nothing about the Vietnamese and reason according to American standards : for instance ""Cow-Boy"" complains half-jokingly half-seriously that there are no horses in Vietnam. Another example is the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse Club hymn after fighting, which strikes as particularly out of place. - they try in vain to impose democracy through gruesome violence and destruction. Such similarities abound and testify to the film's absolute - and unfortunate - modernity. I wish Kubrick was still with us.

9.0,"In a World of S**T, they are not Afraid....","Kubrick's films are generally more accessible and mainstream than he is often given credit for. As gritty and unflinching as his take on the Vietnam War is, this is for my money his most mainstream work. Kubrick gives us a ""grunts-eye-view"" of military training and combat in a war that was particularly unpopular and well documented. This was the first war to be fully televised on TV, and Kubrick pokes fun at the soldier's awareness of this, and of the dubious nature of the propaganda put out by the military's own front-line reporting. Here we get a world-wind tour speckled with dark humor (but never too much politics, a similar stance that benefited the recent ""Jarhead,"" which owes a world of debt to this film), excellent use of pop music (who thought Kubrick could go all Scorcese on us), and brutal sequences of hard-edged violence.My one complaint is that Matthew Modine is extremely underwhelming in the lead role, but the rest of the ensemble is top notch. Lee Ermey is perfect as the sadistic but oddly sympathetic drill instructor who turns maggots into killing machines in boot camp, and Arliss Howard is especially good as the underwritten ""Cowboy.""

8.0,"""The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive""","Full Metal Jacket is an excellent war film. All the characters are very well written, and represent very common characters in the military. There's always a class clown, a hardened individual that's respected, and someone who just isn't capable.

8.0,`The dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive',"Mr. Stanley Kubrick was not a prolific director. After 71 years walking this Earth he left us with only 16 movies among which some of the most powerful cinematic experience to date. `Full Metal Jacket' is part of Mr. Kubrick's list of masterpiece and was released 12 years before his last movie `Eyes Wide Shut' as War always precedes Denial.Having a total control on his Picture from the writing to the editing, what you see on the screen is what he wanted you to see¬Öand what we see is close to a perfect demonstration: One can learn to kill. Through this learning one looses his individuality. By loosing his individuality one can loose is Innocence and reach Madness and of course during all those steps something can go wrong¬Ö To make this demonstration as obvious on paper as on screen you have to be methodic (as methodic as Stanley Kubrick) and you have to have the right actors and the right acting. Matthew Modine (Pvt Joker), Vincent D'Onofrio (Pvt Gomer Pyle) and R.Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sgt. Hartman) are a good example of how pristine the casting was. In order to draw a clear conclusion Stanley Kubrick used the chapter technique and delivers a 2 chapters demonstration. Chapter One ¬ñ The building of a Corp. ¬ñ The Training. Here Mr. Kubrick shows us how a Marine Corp. is built, how one can learn to kill and how through this learning one looses his individuality. This building has to go through 2 major processes: Humiliation and Team building. The humiliation process consists in the destruction of your ego, because your ego is what makes you unique. If an organization breaks your ego then you are most likely to be just like everybody else. Private Gomer Pyle is the perfect example of how someone goes through this humiliating process: he is the most humiliated Private and we all remember this wonderful quote from the Gunnery Sergeant Hartman Drill Instructor (R.Lee Ermey):'Are you quitting on me?! Well, are you?! Then quit, you slimy *beep* walrus-looking piece of *beep*! etc¬Ö' The second process in the building of a Corp., is in fact the team building process: It is an equally important process because at the end of this process each team member only exists through the team, alone each of them is `equally worthless' as our favorite Sergeant Instructor would say. Obviously something will go wrong because there is no such thing as invincibility (it's a chimer at best, a lie). The suicide scene is therefore the transition between the notion of individuality and the notion of Corp., between chapter one and chapter two. Admirably played by our 3 protagonist (Private Joker and Pyle and the Sergeant Drill Instructor) it emphasis the only true statement of the movie: `we live in a world of *beep*' and `the dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive'. Chapter Two ¬ñ Disintegration of a Corp. ¬ñ The War. This second piece of the demonstration (one can loose his innocence) is fueled with two dynamics: the desire of the killing and the reality of war. The desire of the killing is impersonating by Pvt `Joker', he is a combat correspondent who doesn't really understand the meaning of this War. At the same time he is `born to kill' and think that the combat will bring meaning to this absurdity. This contradiction is very well sum up in the following memorable quote from Pvt Joker: `I wanted to meet stimulating and interesting people of an ancient culture and kill them. I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill.' As soon as Pvt Joker links up with Pvt Cowboy, Mr. Kubrick makes us dive in `the reality of war' and the disintegration of the Corp. begins: The lieutenant goes first with him the authority, one by one the Marines falls under the fire of a sniper. The climax of this chapter is the fugitive vision of the sniper. The platoon has reached the border of Madness, where `a day without blood is like a day without sunshine'. Did Pvt Joker found the meaning he was looking for? Can we control the dogs of war once we've unleashed them? Once again there is no lesson only one statement as the thoughts of Pvt Joker `drift back to erect nipple wet dreams about Mary Jane Rottencrotch and the Great Homecoming *beep* Fantasy.' He is `so happy that he is alive, in one piece and short. He lives in a world of *beep* yes. But he is alive and not afraid'. Innocence is lost forever¬Öleft on the ground by the corpses and their `Full Metal Jackets'.",dead know only one thing its better be alive,mr stanley kubrick was not prolific director after 71 years walking this earth he left us with only 16 movies among which some most powerful cinematic experience date full metal jacket is part mr kubricks list masterpiece was released 12 years before his last movie eyes wide shut as war always precedes denial having total control his picture writing editing what you see screen is what he wanted you see what we see is close perfect demonstration one can learn kill through this learning one looses his individuality by loosing his individuality one can loose is innocence reach madness course during all those steps something can go wrong make this demonstration as obvious paper as screen you have be methodic as methodic as stanley kubrick you have have right actors right acting matthew modine pvt joker vincent donofrio pvt gomer pyle r lee ermey gunnery sgt hartman are good example how pristine casting was order draw clear conclusion stanley kubrick used chapter technique delivers 2 chapters demonstration chapter one building corp training here mr kubrick shows us how marine corp is built how one can learn kill how through this learning one looses his individuality this building has go through 2 major processes humiliation team building humiliation process consists destruction your ego because your ego is what makes you unique if organization breaks your ego then you are most likely be just like everybody else private gomer pyle is perfect example how someone goes through this humiliating process he is most humiliated private we all remember this wonderful quote gunnery sergeant hartman drill instructor r lee ermey are you quitting me well are you then quit you slimy beep walrus looking piece beep etc second process building corp is fact team building process it is equally important process because at end this process each team member only exists through team alone each them is equally worthless as our favorite sergeant instructor would say obviously something will go wrong because there is no such thing as invincibility its chimer at best lie suicide scene is therefore transition between notion individuality notion corp between chapter one chapter two admirably played by our 3 protagonist private joker pyle sergeant drill instructor it emphasis only true statement movie we live world beep dead know only one thing its better be alive chapter two disintegration corp war this second piece demonstration one can loose his innocence is fueled with two dynamics desire killing reality war desire killing is impersonating by pvt joker he is combat correspondent who doesnt really understand meaning this war at same time he is born kill think that combat will bring meaning this absurdity this contradiction is very well sum up following memorable quote pvt joker i wanted meet stimulating interesting people ancient culture kill them i wanted be first kid my block get confirmed kill as soon as pvt joker links up with pvt cowboy mr kubrick makes us dive reality war disintegration corp begins lieutenant goes first with him authority one by one marines falls under fire sniper climax this chapter is fugitive vision sniper platoon has reached border madness where day without blood is like day without sunshine did pvt joker found meaning he was looking can we control dogs war once weve unleashed them once again there is no lesson only one statement as thoughts pvt joker drift back erect nipple wet dreams about mary jane rottencrotch great homecoming beep fantasy he is so happy that he is alive one piece short he lives world beep yes but he is alive not afraid innocence is lost forever left ground by corpses their full metal jackets,0.5503793825222395,0.18202065791351507,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,A good (but heavy handed) anti-war movie that has an enjoyable vein of black humour,A bunch of young men join a marine training camp to prepare for war in Vietnam. However before they can face the enemy they must make it past the rigours of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Once past the training they face a war where many may not return alive. They learn that the dehumanising effects of war run through every stage and are complete.This is Kubrick's most accessible film and I suspect that contributes to it's high rating on the imdb. There can be no other reason why it would rank so high on it's own merits. This is not to say it's a bad film but it is certainly not one of the best anti-war films ever made. The plot is a game of two halves ¬ñ first the training camp and second the actual conflict. The point that both halves hammer home relentlessly is that war dehumanises those involved.The first half is enjoyable pure and simply because of Emery's Gunnery Sergeant. His is a witty character despite the inherent cruelty in his actions. However eventually his screen time is ended and the film continues to make the same point over again but in a different setting. The problem is that it hammers it's point home so heavily that it doesn't allow us to work things out for ourselves. Even things like Platoon and the like allow us to work it out ourselves! The film's strength is it's wonderful streak of black comedy that runs right the way through ¬ñ it is the reason for watching and makes it feel a little different from other hardcore war movies of this ilk.Kubrick is always going to be watchable but this is not one of his best. His cold direction is usually excellent but here it is alienating and clinical when we should really be getting to like the soldiers involved. The film is still good but I felt that the flaws are too much here. Emery is undoubtedly the main reason for watching this film. He gives a great performance that is a mix of improvisation and script that works well and guaranteed him work in the same role for many years. Modine is suitably wide eyed as our guide through his experiences but he is like most of the other marines ¬ñ just blank characters for Kubrick to work around. Only D'Onofrio (Pyle) came out of this as a real person.Overall this is a good anti-war film but not a great one. There is no doubting the power of the message and Emery easily carries the film till the war itself. It is still a very good film but I suspect that the fact that this is Kubrick's easiest film to get into explains why it is rated so highly.,good but heavy handed anti war movie that has enjoyable vein black humour,bunch young men join marine training camp prepare war vietnam however before they can face enemy they must make it past rigours gunnery sergeant hartman once past training they face war where many may not return alive they learn that dehumanising effects war run through every stage are complete this is kubricks most accessible film i suspect that contributes its high rating imdb there can be no other reason why it would rank so high its own merits this is not say its bad film but it is certainly not one best anti war films ever made plot is game two halves first training camp second actual conflict point that both halves hammer home relentlessly is that war dehumanises those involved first half is enjoyable pure simply because emerys gunnery sergeant his is witty character despite inherent cruelty his actions however eventually his screen time is ended film continues make same point over again but different setting problem is that it hammers its point home so heavily that it doesnt allow us work things out ourselves even things like platoon like allow us work it out ourselves films strength is its wonderful streak black comedy that runs right way through it is reason watching makes it feel little different other hardcore war movies this ilk kubrick is always going be watchable but this is not one his best his cold direction is usually excellent but here it is alienating clinical when we should really be getting like soldiers involved film is still good but i felt that flaws are too much here emery is undoubtedly main reason watching this film he gives great performance that is mix improvisation script that works well guaranteed him work same role many years modine is suitably wide eyed as our guide through his experiences but he is like most other marines just blank characters kubrick work around only donofrio pyle came out this as real person overall this is good anti war film but not great one there is no doubting power message emery easily carries film till war itself it is still very good film but i suspect that fact that this is kubricks easiest film get into explains why it is rated so highly,0.483026113671275,0.16262672811059908,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"Superb, one of Kubrick's best","I like Stanley Kubrick, and I love his films, especially 2001, Barry Lyndon, Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove and this, his penultimate film. Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. All in all, one of Kubrick's best and one of the best war movies you will see. 10/10 Bethany Cox",superb one kubricks best,i like stanley kubrick i love his films especially 2001 barry lyndon paths glory dr strangelove this his penultimate film full metal jacket is harrowing violent foul mouthed film yet it is superbly done true one or two parts may lack tropical realism but atmosphere film creates is extraordinary film looks excellent with skillful cinematography script is very well crafted does have sense realism while story is compelling with transition training at camp bombed vietamnesse city smoothly done i am with those who thinks first half is better than second but that is not say second half isnt good it is more than good but first half really was outstanding kubricks direction as always is superb as is acting especially lee ermey vincent donofrio all all one kubricks best one best war movies you will see 10 10 bethany cox,0.5336021505376345,0.37849462365591396,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.08}"
