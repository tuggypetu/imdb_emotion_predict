7,Katta local at its peak! [+71%],"By the time you finish watching Angamaly Diaries, a slice of Angamaly's dialect, flavor and rawness is bound to stay with you. That's vintage Pellissery for you. His brand of film-making is such that every venture that he takes up leaves a mark of its own. Lijo takes you on a bumpy ride filled with ups and downs aplenty. On the way, there's plenty of local flavor to be savored though. The shots of the delectable-looking food are alarmingly drool-worthy. But we also get to see the rather-ugly side of town in the form of pig-slaughter houses, bloodshed and filthy gang-wars that occur at the most untimely of situations. The movie racks up the debut of a bunch of (brilliant) amateur artists, 86 in number, who are hilariously madcap in their own unique mannerisms. The movie is told from the perspective of Vincent Pepe (played by Antony Varghese). There is a tinge of Kammatipaadam here and there, but this film draws its own boundaries and arcs with respect to its characters. The coming-of-age saga is executed with ample effervescence (church, celebratory events, women, local toddy and palatable starters, idolization of a local goon, thug-fights and the like!) that somewhat lend a breezy feel. The opening scene is a blast. One gets the idea straightaway that you're not in for the typical goonda film. The robust undercurrent of black humor adds to the overall zing. The name of characters are so inventively cooked- up..Appani Ravi, 10 ml Thomas, U-clamp Rajan, Maramkothi Sijo, the two Martys (Kanakuna & Parippu). These guys seem to have mastered the art of anger, aggression and sarcasm.The interval block is also terrifically done. A little something that Pepe rambles to his fellow-thug-friend and how things pan out a few moments later. The attention to detail is impeccable..it is quite evident that Chemban and Lijo know Angamaly inside out. Some of the scenes even carry the impression of the entries in a personal diary. Even when things start looking grim, the guys do sing-alongs, get drunk as often as they used to, tease their ladies, and try their best to untangle themselves from personal problems. The climax sequence is a masterstroke. A single take that spans 11 minutes taking place during a palli-perunnaal (church-organized festival & celebrations that include bandwagon, music & long processions) featuring hundreds of artists, briskly choreographed action, and a fairly unforeseen (cracker of a) finale. Music by Prashant Pillai and Cinematography by Girish Gangadharan are worthy of a standing ovation.On the downside, the storyline may seem too simple and uneventful to some. Also, the violence depicted is definitely on the higher end (but the writing is sufficiently compelling!), which may turn-off a few. I'd not say these are good-enough reasons to stay away from watching the film at all though.

6,"Eccentric, real, but slightly overhyped","I seem to have missed something in this movie that everyone else seems to see and love. The cast and the acting were on point (especially considering it was debut roles for most). I loved how it isn't one big sugar coated- it is real, raw, and unflinchingly bold. However, at some parts i was cringing at what seemed like a farrago of violence (that was getting really redundant), crassness and some more violence, with the essence of a real plot somehow missing. Even after finishing 3/4th of movie, some part of me was still waiting for the story to begin- or at least take a twist. It wasn't my cup of tea, or maybe i just had too much expectations. Nevertheless, the technical aspects of the film was remarkably good! :)",eccentric real but slightly overhyped,i seem have missed something this movie that everyone else seems see love cast acting were point especially considering it was debut roles most i loved how it isnt one big sugar coated it is real raw unflinchingly bold however at some parts i was cringing at what seemed like farrago violence that was getting really redundant crassness some more violence with essence real plot somehow missing even after finishing 3 4th movie some part me was still waiting story begin or at least take twist it wasnt my cup tea or maybe i just had too much expectations nevertheless technical aspects film was remarkably good,0.40398110661268555,0.1379217273954116,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.48, 'Fear': 0.14}"

The story co-weaves it's magic in the local dialect, food, music and culture of the people in Angamaly to the plot, while paying careful attention to every intricate detail, thus making it an highly engaging movie.The real beauty of Angamaly Diaries lies in its characters like Vincent Pepe, Appani Ravi, U clamp Rajan & co and their superb acting throughout the entire movie. Aided by a top notch screen play by Chemban Vinod Jose, is nothing short of outstanding.Breathtaking cinematography & editing adds flavours to new levels of film making. Make up, costume design and production design along with shooting locations lights up Angamaly diaries to a territory only a few filmmakers worldwide can reach.Background score reaches terrific heights to keep up with the pace & mood of the movie. Songs are of authentic local flavour and are of non filmi kind folk music which everyone would love. But the biggest credit of them all should go to Lijo Jose Pellissery who has braved all odds to deliver a spellbinding masterpiece of a movie in Angamaly diaries. If one considers the budget of the movie, it makes it that extra special.While every moment in the film will strike a chord with not only the youth, it will make the elder viewers nostalgic with those home made cuisines, romances, which used to happen secretly right under everyone's noses.Angamaly Diaries will take the viewers on a tipsy journey through the lives of people in the small town Angamaly and ultimately tell the youth that having fun in life is equally as significant as being serious about it, and every man will reach a point in his life, where they will have to draw the line between the two.",absolute masterpiece,angamaly diaries can be described as one finest gangster genre movies roll out india since rgvs sathya movie captures raw beauty kerala m lange beautiful visuals thumping music absolutely raw stunning natural acting one can see angamaly diaries is one freshest most terrific attempt made by anyone down south story co weaves its magic local dialect food music culture people angamaly plot while paying careful attention every intricate detail thus making it highly engaging movie real beauty angamaly diaries lies its characters like vincent pepe appani ravi u clamp rajan co their superb acting throughout entire movie aided by top notch screen play by chemban vinod jose is nothing short outstanding breathtaking cinematography editing adds flavours new levels film making make up costume design production design along with shooting locations lights up angamaly diaries territory only few filmmakers worldwide can reach background score reaches terrific heights keep up with pace mood movie songs are authentic local flavour are non filmi kind folk music which everyone would love but biggest credit them all should go lijo jose pellissery who has braved all odds deliver spellbinding masterpiece movie angamaly diaries if one considers budget movie it makes it that extra special while every moment film will strike chord with not only youth it will make elder viewers nostalgic with those home made cuisines romances which used happen secretly right under everyones noses angamaly diaries will take viewers tipsy journey through lives people small town angamaly ultimately tell youth that having fun life is equally as significant as being serious about it every man will reach point his life where they will have draw line between two,0.6116330197580198,0.1825948357198357,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,Terrific entertainment,"One of the best times I've had in a theater watching a Malayalam movie in ages. Angamaly Diaries is a really dirty (literally) gangster flick filled with pork fat and beef gravy and realistic fist fights and liquor.The film marks a great debut for Anthony Varghese as Vincent Pepe. Chemban Vinod Jose is not just a powerful actor, but also a damn good writer. Lijo Jose Pellishery finally fulfills the promise he showed through directorial flourishes in overrated films like Amen. The long take at the end was truly riveting. But the gang war scene in the rubber plantation just before the interval made the movie for me.The supporting cast (the director introduced 86 new actors apart from the hero) was terrific. Bitto Davis as 10 ml Thomas, Tito Wilson as U-clamp Rajan, Sarath Kumar as Appani Ravi and Athira Patel as Vincent Pepe's sister deserve special mention. Sinoj Varghese as the bomb-maker Kunjootan reminded me of Innocent. Merin Jose Pottackal as Maramkothi Sijo also stood out.The background score filled with industrial noises was perfect for the film's volatile characters with their volcanic anger.Something that separates Angamali Diaries from other gangster movies was that the gangsters in the film were actually very endearing. They are not like the murderous psychopaths driven by religion and ideas of honor in Gangs of Wasseypur. Nor are they like the low-lives in Goodfellas who would rat each other out at the drop of a hat. The Angamalikaar in the film are small timers trying to lead a honest life but turn to violence purely for survival. The scene where Pepe and 10ml request Appani and U-Clamp to drink with them after the settlement of a long standing dispute was so well done. It was one of the best dramatic moments in the film. The film's final scene reminded me of Goodfellas. Vincent Pepe who lived purely on impulse, finds himself inside a box, in a country where liquor and pork might be hard to come by. A country that is unlike the anarchic Angamaly which he loved so dearly. Was it a bitter sweet ending? Or did Pepe find peace in married life with his wife? I am not sure.(8/10)",terrific entertainment,one best times ive had theater watching malayalam movie ages angamaly diaries is really dirty literally gangster flick filled with pork fat beef gravy realistic fist fights liquor film marks great debut anthony varghese as vincent pepe chemban vinod jose is not just powerful actor but also damn good writer lijo jose pellishery finally fulfills promise he showed through directorial flourishes overrated films like amen long take at end was truly riveting but gang war scene rubber plantation just before interval made movie me supporting cast director introduced 86 new actors apart hero was terrific bitto davis as 10 ml thomas tito wilson as u clamp rajan sarath kumar as appani ravi athira patel as vincent pepes sister deserve special mention sinoj varghese as bomb maker kunjootan reminded me innocent merin jose pottackal as maramkothi sijo also stood out background score filled with industrial noises was perfect films volatile characters with their volcanic anger something that separates angamali diaries other gangster movies was that gangsters film were actually very endearing they are not like murderous psychopaths driven by religion ideas honor gangs wasseypur nor are they like low lives goodfellas who would rat each other out at drop hat angamalikaar film are small timers trying lead honest life but turn violence purely survival scene where pepe 10ml request appani u clamp drink with them after settlement long standing dispute was so well done it was one best dramatic moments film films final scene reminded me goodfellas vincent pepe who lived purely impulse finds himself inside box country where liquor pork might be hard come by country that is unlike anarchic angamaly which he loved so dearly was it bitter sweet ending or did pepe find peace married life with his wife i am not sure 8 10,0.6240503490503491,0.20307417807417807,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,The Goodfellas of Mollywood,"Angamaly Diaries is a festival from the very start where we are introduced to a man called Kaadu (Forest) Benny a goon who eats snakes and takes a quotation from a gay man owning a accessory shop for ladies. The best part is that this character has no significance and exists only in this scene. This is just one of the many colorful characters in this beautiful, violent, badass movies. The quotation he takes is of our heroes and the introduction scene has the most enjoyable fight scene with the hero dressed as Jesus along with his friends dressed as other characters beating up people in a bar with the band version of a SPB song playing in the background.Angamaly Diaries is about the Palliyangadi team, a group of people in Angamaly doing small businesses, getting into fights and enjoying their lives. Similar to Ray Liotta's character in goodfellas there is Vincent Pepe, a boy fascinated with a gang, and the movie goes on to how he forms this ragtag Palliyangadi team with his friends. The movie focuses on how his life takes a turn after he gets himself into a pork business where a problem happens. More than the script, the movie works because of how unconventional the setting is where we meet characters with monikers Appani, Pork, 10ml, U- Clamp out of many. None of the fight scenes have any mass associated with it, on the other hand these are fight scenes where the hero comes out more hurt if anything. The actors especially Sarath Kumar and Tito Johnson as Ravi and Rajan are delightful in their absolutely local, gritty avatars. The Pallingayadi team itself is an eclectic mix of people with Pork Varkey , 2 Martys and a Bheeman. Overall, Angamaly Diaries is that movie where you would enjoy every scene for the fast cinematography, realistic acting and the most energy filled fights which after seeing you feel like breaking the bones of every person you see.",goodfellas mollywood,angamaly diaries is festival very start where we are introduced man called kaadu forest benny goon who eats snakes takes quotation gay man owning accessory shop ladies best part is that this character has no significance exists only this scene this is just one many colorful characters this beautiful violent badass movies quotation he takes is our heroes introduction scene has most enjoyable fight scene with hero dressed as jesus along with his friends dressed as other characters beating up people bar with band version spb song playing background angamaly diaries is about palliyangadi team group people angamaly doing small businesses getting into fights enjoying their lives similar ray liottas character goodfellas there is vincent pepe boy fascinated with gang movie goes how he forms this ragtag palliyangadi team with his friends movie focuses how his life takes turn after he gets himself into pork business where problem happens more than script movie works because how unconventional setting is where we meet characters with monikers appani pork 10ml u clamp out many none fight scenes have any mass associated with it other hand these are fight scenes where hero comes out more hurt if anything actors especially sarath kumar tito johnson as ravi rajan are delightful their absolutely local gritty avatars pallingayadi team itself is eclectic mix people with pork varkey 2 martys bheeman overall angamaly diaries is that movie where you would enjoy every scene fast cinematography realistic acting most energy filled fights which after seeing you feel like breaking bones every person you see,0.5316091954022989,0.26321839080459775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8,"Gangs, Crime, Pork and Wine ( Lijo Jose Pelliserry Style )","First of all A big round of applause for the whole team of makers for Introducing 86 fresh new faces who have dreamed to face the camera and to make a thoroughly well acted and an entertaining film from them is no easy task and hell yeah it requires a lot of guts. The movie immerses you into this small town of Angamaly from the first frame.This movie revolves around a bunch of friends who are basically outlaws and series of unfortunate events in their lives, the best part is none of them had to act as they were literally living the characters, Malayalam film Industry get ready to witness some raw and realistic performances from a whole bunch of new talent ( since Kamatipaadam ) . Though there isn't much to say about the plot , there is a lot to experience from it's making especially the 11 minute single shot climax which is a marvel in film making . Lijo Jose Pelliserry needs to be given credit for presenting experimental cinema to Malayalam, What a comeback from his previous Collosal box office disaster Double Barrel ( Which according to me is one amongst the most technically well made movie but a failed experiment ). Chemban Vinod Jose for his tight screenplay needs to given full credit as there is pretty much lot happening and never a dull moment. Coming to the cast - Antony Varghese ( Vincent Pepe )the new kid on the block was excellent and this lad is here to stay , with a bunch of supporting casts who were spectacular in their respective roles. Special Mention to the guys playing the baddies, they were terrific .

1,"""Over-rated Movie""","Watched this movie after coming forward lots of hype in social medias saying that it's a must watch movie i felt it has heavily over-rated had great expectations but all was in vain. I felt that the story was copied from lots of Malayalam movies such as Kammatti Paadam, for example the narration part the way the movie starts making up gangs picking up fights then the 2 way love from premam and many movies like that plus to mention the foodies scenes shown in the movie seen a lot like that in salt and pepper and ustad hotel and many more. This movie was trying to bring a new slang into the Malayalam industry for me it felt as the worst slang ever nothing is clear to understand. Each scene ends in cursing and total violence it's not good for family audience. But I was able to learn that we could make 4 cores by just selling pork if that was the scene the whole of Kerala would have sold pork and got rich makes no sense. Don't know how this movie was a hit in the Malayalam movie industry it was complete nonsense and filled with lots of garbage. It was a mixture of lots of Malayalam movies they just wanted to fill up the given movie time with garbage that's all. After seeing this movie I have a complete bad reputation on the place Angamaly in Kerala and the people there.

8,A brilliant movie,"Watched this movie three times, each with different groups of people. Unfortunately none of the groups was impressed with this movie, but I loved it - better each time.People dislike this movie for its foul language and general rowdy sequences. But I loved the movie because of how the scenes are intelligently connected to each other and how the director has extracted the best out of the actors. Everyone has acted well. Special mention has to be given to Antony Varghese and Sharath Kumar, but all others (Lichi, Pepe's sister etc) have given their best in their roles. I think the credit must go to the director. Only during my second viewing did I notice that the climax sequence was one single shot. It is absolutely brilliantly done. It is amazing how naturally the actors join and leave the scene, slowly building up the tempo. Almost like watching a moving play. Those who haven't watched the movie - pay special attention to the sequence. It is a treat you don't want to miss.It is good to see that this movie was received very well and has received many positive reviews.

9,Angamaly is freshness,"Although the plot isn't particularly new in any way, the approach in the script and direction makes it look fresh. Actor turned screenwriter Chemban Vinod Jose's first-time script has a clear understanding of how life in Angamaly should be portrayed and is perfect for the style of Pellissery. The approach akin to kitchen sink realism gave a grounded sense, nevertheless, the elements, giving the adrenaline rush worked well too.

1,Worst movie of 2017,"Movie started by showing different views of Angamaly, then there starts the stunt and the annoying and boring stunt continues till the end of the movie. What kind of message they trying to convince? Violence and Laziness, they tried to say the story from friendship point of view, which will mislead our youth to consuming alcohol and marijuana. The censor board should not give permission for films like this. We do not need rape and violence in society we need calm and peaceful society, money can't buy life only love can, which this movie never touches.

Lijo Jose Pallisery has to be so proud of himself now that two may be three of his experiments have basically hit the ball out of the park. REferring to Amen , Angamaly Diaries and City of GOd (Intentionally omitted the unpalatable Barrels). Brutally honest story telling that's what stands out of this movie. Will draw flak for lots of pig lovers or animal lovers for the raw portrayal of butchering and consuming meat (pork) in such a large scale or time in the movie. No movie i have seen ever dared to do so. Loud but Sensible Dialogues is another plus point. There is limited or no space of rubbish in the entire length of the storytelling. Such a good cast, had a hard time to believe that all were first timers. Looked natural as ever. Classy background Musics and unique songs.
