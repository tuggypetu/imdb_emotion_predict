10.0,"a tribute to the endurance of man and nature, featuring a masterpiece of a performance","For a variety of reasons (that are well known in the darker period of the director's history at this time), Akira Kurosawa left Japan to make a film in Russia (Siberia to be exact). Instead of an epic action picture, he went to one of his other passions as a storyteller- the drama of pure humanity (like Ikiru and Red Beard, this film follows in that vein). The film runs two hours and twenty minutes, but it is a kind of epic story, that does have that pulse of adventure from his other films. But this time he combines that method of a big, spacious environment in the wild with a deep character study. His craftsmanship as a 'painter' of the frame is top-notch as always (all pretensions aside, he is one of the masters at finding the textures and moods in a scene's look as in its character and action), and the use of locations brings a quality that directors today would brush aside with via special and visual effects. Simply put, it is one of, if not the, ultimate testaments to man vs/with nature, with a character that remains one of the most memorable that Kurosawa's envisioned.To give an idea of who Dersu Uzala is to someone who hasn't seen the film, picture Yoda without the ability to lift objects with his mind and to kick ass with a light-saber, but still contains all of the direct wisdom and strength that make him one with his surroundings (and, as well, uses his own kind of 'force' for knowledge and defense, and for attack as an ultimately final resort). As a lonesome hunter and drifter with a family tragically lost, Dersu comes upon a team of explorers led by Captain Aseniev (Yuri Solomon, not the best performance but sturdy enough to sustain the physical scenes). He goes along with them as a guide of the sights and smells and feelings that the others just can't sense (out of lack of experience). Aseniev and Dersu end up becoming friends as they brace a torrid windstorm over a bare, wintry landscape, as Kurosawa brings out one of his towering sequences (topping anything David Lean could've drummed up for sure).It's always of interest to me to see characters doing things on screen, having to go against the elements that almost dwarf them in the face of nature (i.e. Cast Away's hour and a half second act). Dersu Uzala seems to be of few words and mostly actions, and soon gains respect and admiration after an odd introduction to the team- he shoots with a keener than keen eye, he spots tracks, he sets up protection in the harshest of conditions, and is always a step ahead of the pack. And bringing all this out is actor Maksim Munzuk, who appears here (like Falconetti in Passion of Joan of Arc) in the performance of a lifetime out of an otherwise obscure and small career. Munzuk never brings anything to Dersu that isn't in his character, and he makes at least a quarter of the film's success a reality (the other three-quarters could be attributed to Kurosawa alone). He can be tough, smart, funny (in an off-beat way), and if nothing else, humble. But more than anything, Munzuk makes Dersu seem alive in a way no other actor could've accomplished, and also brings out the better in Solomon's performance.The story itself has a superb appeal most of the way, but it is in it's last act that 'Derzu Uzala' reaches an intensely tragic plane. Dersu does something (which I won't reveal here and has been discussed elsewhere on the message board) that brings great shame to his own self-worth. In this part of the film, Kurosawa brings out what can be said to be some of the saddest moments in any of his work, however not without logic. While it was likely a major dramatic function in the novel, Kurosawa doesn't just throw these last twenty minutes or so to let steam flow out of the picture. I sensed something almost cathartic about these scenes, that rose the qualities of the rest of the story to a higher level, to one of almost spiritual in nature. It's hard to really pin-point to one who has not seen the film (and, indeed, I have seen the film all of one time). But once its over, you may feel you have seen a work far more rewarding than imaginable- even in awe.",tribute endurance man nature featuring masterpiece performance,variety reasons that are well known darker period directors history at this time akira kurosawa left japan make film russia siberia be exact instead epic action picture he went one his other passions as storyteller drama pure humanity like ikiru red beard this film follows that vein film runs two hours twenty minutes but it is kind epic story that does have that pulse adventure his other films but this time he combines that method big spacious environment wild with deep character study his craftsmanship as painter frame is top notch as always all pretensions aside he is one masters at finding textures moods scenes look as its character action use locations brings quality that directors today would brush aside with via special visual effects simply put it is one if not ultimate testaments man vs with nature with character that remains one most memorable that kurosawas envisioned give idea who dersu uzala is someone who hasnt seen film picture yoda without ability lift objects with his mind kick ass with light saber but still contains all direct wisdom strength that make him one with his surroundings as well uses his own kind force knowledge defense attack as ultimately final resort as lonesome hunter drifter with family tragically lost dersu comes upon team explorers led by captain aseniev yuri solomon not best performance but sturdy enough sustain physical scenes he goes along with them as guide sights smells feelings that others just cant sense out lack experience aseniev dersu end up becoming friends as they brace torrid windstorm over bare wintry landscape as kurosawa brings out one his towering sequences topping anything david lean couldve drummed up sure its always interest me see characters doing things screen having go against elements that almost dwarf them face nature i e cast aways hour half second act dersu uzala seems be few words mostly actions soon gains respect admiration after odd introduction team he shoots with keener than keen eye he spots tracks he sets up protection harshest conditions is always step ahead pack bringing all this out is actor maksim munzuk who appears here like falconetti passion joan arc performance lifetime out otherwise obscure small career munzuk never brings anything dersu that isnt his character he makes at least quarter films success reality other three quarters could be attributed kurosawa alone he can be tough smart funny off beat way if nothing else humble but more than anything munzuk makes dersu seem alive way no other actor couldve accomplished also brings out better solomons performance story itself has superb appeal most way but it is its last act that derzu uzala reaches intensely tragic plane dersu does something which i wont reveal here has been discussed elsewhere message board that brings great shame his own self worth this part film kurosawa brings out what can be said be some saddest moments any his work however not without logic while it was likely major dramatic function novel kurosawa doesnt just throw these last twenty minutes or so let steam flow out picture i sensed something almost cathartic about these scenes that rose qualities rest story higher level one almost spiritual nature its hard really pin point one who has not seen film indeed i have seen film all one time but once its over you may feel you have seen work far more rewarding than imaginable even awe,0.4856740280653323,0.14693466758684146,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,A great film from one of the all-time masters,"This 1975 joint Japanese-Russian film is a celebration of simple virtues, friendship, loyalty, love, and respect for nature. Based on the journals of the Tsarist explorer and surveyor, Captain Vladimir Arseniev, it is the story of the relationship between Captain Arseniev and an Asiatic hunter of the Goldi tribe named Dersu Uzala. With a love and understanding of the forest that is extraordinary, Dersu guides the Captain through several deadly encounters. He saves the Captain's life by building a shelter out of reeds during a ferocious wind storm. Maksim's performance as Dersu, the ancient woodsman, is very ""Yoda-like"": wonderous, dignified, and very natural. The friendship between the two main characters grows over many years and several expeditions in the wild. Their relationship is beautifully developed and moves to an inevitable climax when Dersu and the Captain move back to the Captain's home in the city.There is in this film a sense of the beauty, tranquility, and timelessness of nature. It takes place at a time in the early part of the last century when people had closer ties with nature and felt a kinship with animals, plants, and the elements. Dersu endearingly refers to all elements of nature including the river, the wind, the trees, and the animals as ""men"". As the English writer, Hugh Trevor-Roper said of Shakespeare so it is true of Dersu, ""He sees mankind almost as part of nature, sometimes basking in a delightful, smiling Nature; sometimes caught up in a fierce, cruel, inexorable, insatiable Nature"".I was totally absorbed in this film and in its regard for the essential goodness of man and the beauty of the natural world. Dersu Uzala is a great film from one of the all-time masters.",great film one all time masters,this 1975 joint japanese russian film is celebration simple virtues friendship loyalty love respect nature based journals tsarist explorer surveyor captain vladimir arseniev it is story relationship between captain arseniev asiatic hunter goldi tribe named dersu uzala with love understanding forest that is extraordinary dersu guides captain through several deadly encounters he saves captains life by building shelter out reeds during ferocious wind storm maksims performance as dersu ancient woodsman is very yoda like wonderous dignified very natural friendship between two main characters grows over many years several expeditions wild their relationship is beautifully developed moves inevitable climax when dersu captain move back captains home city there is this film sense beauty tranquility timelessness nature it takes place at time early part last century when people had closer ties with nature felt kinship with animals plants elements dersu endearingly refers all elements nature including river wind trees animals as men as english writer hugh trevor roper said shakespeare so it is true dersu he sees mankind almost as part nature sometimes basking delightful smiling nature sometimes caught up fierce cruel inexorable insatiable nature i was totally absorbed this film its regard essential goodness man beauty natural world dersu uzala is great film one all time masters,0.4457635467980296,0.18206896551724136,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Art!,"Akira Kurosawa was a masterful director and powerful storyteller, Dersu has always been my favourite of his films. It was also the first I saw - on Christmas Day afternoon 1978 on UK BBC2 - would that they were as adventurous nowadays! Since then of course I've seen all of his films from Stray Dog on, Rashomon and Ran being especial favourites, but I keep on coming back to watch this one, ostensibly the simplest tale Kurosawa ever filmed.The understanding and bonding that develops between the two men Arseniev and Dersu is wonderful to see, and over two hours holds your attention with expertly observed minutiae of character and scenic interplay. The last ten minutes cover a lot of ground (no pun intended) but it's all so logical and sad that I always need to see the end credits to recover.So many marvellous scenes: the tiger in the forest in the morning; the phlegmatic reclusive old Chinaman; the raft; wispy blue shaded smoke from night-fires; the conclusion of course; the view of those two great men, the Moon and the Sun in the same shot. Not everyone would like Dersu, their most likely comments being ""boring"" - but how wrong they are they'll never know!A film not fit to lick Dersu Uzala's metaphorical boots (or even Plan 9 from Outer Space's for that matter), Blazing Saddles was filmed the same year in America and a generation on still gets more praise than this poetic masterpiece!",art,akira kurosawa was masterful director powerful storyteller dersu has always been my favourite his films it was also first i saw christmas day afternoon 1978 uk bbc2 would that they were as adventurous nowadays since then course ive seen all his films stray dog rashomon ran being especial favourites but i keep coming back watch this one ostensibly simplest tale kurosawa ever filmed understanding bonding that develops between two men arseniev dersu is wonderful see over two hours holds your attention with expertly observed minutiae character scenic interplay last ten minutes cover lot ground no pun intended but its all so logical sad that i always need see end credits recover so many marvellous scenes tiger forest morning phlegmatic reclusive old chinaman raft wispy blue shaded smoke night fires conclusion course view those two great men moon sun same shot not everyone would like dersu their most likely comments being boring but how wrong they are theyll never know film not fit lick dersu uzalas metaphorical boots or even plan 9 outer spaces that matter blazing saddles was filmed same year america generation still gets more praise than this poetic masterpiece,0.525,0.16145833333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,A Man with a Beautiful Soul,"In 1902, a Russian army expedition is assigned to explore Siberia under the command of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin). He befriends the Goldi (Nanai) hunter Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) and invites him to guide the explorers through the stark forest up to Khanka Lake. Along their journey, Arseniev discovers that Dersu Uzala is a man with a beautiful soul and they become close friends. When his assignment ends, Dersu Uzala says goodbye to Arseniev. In 1907, Captain Arseniev is assigned for another expedition to the Ussuri River; when he meets Dersu Uzala in the forest, the lonely hunter joins his team and guides the group. However, he is older and has problems with his vision and Captain Arseniev invites Dersu Uzala to live with his family in Khabarovsk City. But the old man does not adapt to the urban lifestyle and decides to return to the forest. In 1910, Captain Arseniev is called to Korfovskaïa to identify the body of a man that has his calling card and might be Dersu Uzala.""Derzu Uzala"" is a simple and unforgettable tale of friendship between a Russian Captain and a lonely hunter with a beautiful soul. This wonderful movie has one of the most beautiful cinematographies I have ever seen and the camera work is impressive, with awesome angle and locations that seems to be of pictures in movement.

10.0,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Simplicity can sometimes be painful as well as majestic,"Dersu Uzala is not just the quintessence of pristine cinema or a landmark in art cinema, but is also a living proof that brilliance can be achieved with absolute simplicity. Storytelling is undoubtedly one of the most potent tools known to man: from the Illiad and Odyssey of Homer to the tales of Jataka, to the 1001 nights of Arabia, to the tales of Panchatantra, to the plays of Shakespeare, man has always found ways to amuse himself by spinning the yarn of his imagination. These tales, though picturesque, fantastic and resplendent, mostly overlooked the potency of austerity vis-à-vis grandeur as an element of revelation powerful enough to transcend the effects of all other affects know to man. Only a handful of storytellers like Akira Kurosawa and Satyajit Ray have shown the grit and perspicacity to use simplicity as the weapon to incite and hence portray the deepest of the human emotions on the celluloid. Kurosawa demonstrated the might of simplicity as an element that can pack a punch for the first time in Ikiru and followed it up with an unending list of pristine cinematic masterpieces including Seven Samurai. But, even Kurosawa's greatest critic would not find it hard to concede that cinema does not get any purer than Dersu Uzala. Dersu Uzala is a poignant tale of human bonding of trust, friendship and adoration between two contrasting individuals: a nomadic hunter and an army explorer. Captain Arseniev and his troops are on a topographic expedition and while camping during a night, they come across Dersu, who happens to be an aboriginal (Goldi) tribesman. Being fully aware of the handicap of being in a remote and tricky territory and of the indispensability of having an indigene in the ranks, Arseniev asks Dersu to be their guide. Dersu being humbled by Arseniev's courtesy obliges his offer almost immediately. We soon witness a great sense of camaraderie developing between the two of them as Dersu rises in status from being a comrade to a stalwart and a friend in the eyes of the captain. The long years of experience had equipped Dersu with a great sense of intuition and psychic-like abilities to anticipate change and danger. Dersu uses his skills to good effect as he maneuvers captain and his troops through the harsh Siberian terrain, sheltering and guarding them from the cruelties and wilderness of the Tundra. Behind the façade of a rugged hunter, we see a man of profound intellect and deep compassion in Dersu which is most conspicuous in his respect for the old Chinese and his selflessness in rescuing Captain Arseniev and one of his men. After the expedition is over, Arseniev embraces Dersu and bids him farewell as Dersu returns to the wilderness. Few years later, when Arseniev returns to Siberia on another expedition, he once again encounters Dersu, who again proves to be handy, only this time round he appears to be aging really fast as time, which can be a great healer as well as a great leveler, had begun to take a toll on the Goldi. His eyesight deteriorates under the superstitious effect of a self-imposed curse after having killed a Siberian tiger, which the Goldis worship, in an act of self-defence. Arseniev, in his pitied adoration for Dersu, takes him to the city to live with his family. Arseniev's son gets greatly attached to Dersu and his story-telling abilities, but Dersu finds it difficult to adapt to the relatively restricted and significantly tamed urban life and soon realizes that his life has been reduced to that of a captive. He implores the captain to let him return to the wilderness of the woods. With great reluctance, Arseniev grants him the permission to leave, but not before presenting his savior with a brand new rifle as a parting gift and a souvenir. Few months later, Arseniev receives a letter informing him that a dead body of a Goldi has been found with no identification on it barring Arseniev's visiting card. As Arseniev pays a visit to the place of burial, he identifies the dead Goldi to be none other than Dersu Uzala. The investigating officer speculates the Goldi's brand new rifle might have lured someone into killing him.Dersu Uzala is not just a movie, but is an experience of a lifetime. Dersu Uzala is the only movie that Akira Kurosawa shot in a language other than Japanese and he proved it once and for all that cinema at its most pristine, knows no bounds or barriers. Kurosawa uses his auteurist mastery to bring the memoirs of Russian explorer, Vladimir Arsenyev to life as he inexplicably metamorphoses cinema to new levels of poignancy and pristineness. The cinematography is breathtakingly picturesque and it evokes a sense of melancholy that makes the majestic Siberian wilderness appear hypnotic and at times, surreal. The panoramic shot of Dersu and Arseniev looking at the horizon caparisoned with the juxtaposition of the setting sun and the rising moon is also indicative of their respective lives: Dersu is long past his prime and there is no hope for revival, but Arsieniev's is still in his prime and has a promising career ahead. Dersu Uzala is strongly suggestive of the sole consistency in human life: change. It also demonstrates the might of nature as an unforgiving force, strong enough to humble even the most savage of the creatures. Dersu Uzala can also be termed as an allegorical account of the environmental imbalance that unrestrained human intervention is causing. Dersu Uzala, besides being one of Kurosawa's greatest masterpieces is one of those rare cinematic gems which can be relished again and again, each time with a completely different perspective. It's a must watch for everyone who loves and understands cinema. 10/10For more on cinema visit: http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review simplicity can sometimes be painful as

10.0,One of the best films ever,"This is one of my definite favorites.It tells a story of a man who is one with the wilderness and nature and cant live any other way.Dersu Uzala is an old Goldi(siberian asiatic minority) hunter who thinks he has been cursed after he kills a tiger.To him,every being,every part of the nature is equally worth as humans.The film gives us accounts of one Russian captain's friendship with Dersu.They are together through thick and thin and Dersu even rescues him from a blizzard when they are stuck on a frozen lake.Dersu has all the natural senses and therefore knows when he is in danger.He knows everything by looking and observing the landscape around him.So when he kills the tiger,its like a spell has been cast on him.Or is it just his imagination?His people believe in a ghost that rules the taiga,Kanga.He thinks Kanga will punish him in some way.Soon his fears start to get real.He cant kill his prey for food that he needs for living because his eyesight dramatically worsens.One frightening night(my favorite scene) it gets too much for him,listening to the howling wind in the dark,waiting for Kanga to send a tiger to kill him.And captain Arseniev,seeing the horror that struck him,offers him to come with him to his hometown.It happens so.Throughout the film,you cant help but wonder what will happen to Dersu.Not only because in the beginning Arseniev searches for his grave,in retrospection,but also because he is one lonely,sad man who lives only by hunting.There is no place for him but the taiga.And when the tragedy happens,its hard not to feel remorse and pity the old Dersu.His world has come crashing down.The end specially is painful and shows that there is no mercy in this world for a man who falls from grace in his own homeground.In the end,this film has outstanding photography,outstanding music,outstanding cast,beautiful scenery and do i need to say anything about the director? A timeless work that can never be surpassed.",one best films ever,this is one my definite favorites it tells story man who is one with wilderness nature cant live any other way dersu uzala is old goldi siberian asiatic minority hunter who thinks he has been cursed after he kills tiger him every being every part nature is equally worth as humans film gives us accounts one russian captains friendship with dersu they are together through thick thin dersu even rescues him blizzard when they are stuck frozen lake dersu has all natural senses therefore knows when he is danger he knows everything by looking observing landscape around him so when he kills tiger its like spell has been cast him or is it just his imagination his people believe ghost that rules taiga kanga he thinks kanga will punish him some way soon his fears start get real he cant kill his prey food that he needs living because his eyesight dramatically worsens one frightening night my favorite scene it gets too much him listening howling wind dark waiting kanga send tiger kill him captain arseniev seeing horror that struck him offers him come with him his hometown it happens so throughout film you cant help but wonder what will happen dersu not only because beginning arseniev searches his grave retrospection but also because he is one lonely sad man who lives only by hunting there is no place him but taiga when tragedy happens its hard not feel remorse pity old dersu his world has come crashing down end specially is painful shows that there is no mercy this world man who falls grace his own homeground end this film has outstanding photography outstanding music outstanding cast beautiful scenery do i need say anything about director timeless work that can never be surpassed,0.5685185185185185,0.07880471380471381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Still the best movie I have ever seen,"Dersu Uzala is slow, serene, beautiful, but nevertheless gripping. It tells of the friendship between a nomadic Siberian native and a Russian army explorer, and how the former is able to help the latter and his team to negotiate the many obstacles presented by the Siberian wilderness. We see how traditional survival methods and intrinsic common sense can help the more urbanised army men to cope with the extremes of climate and geography. Eventually the nomad is persuaded to join the general on his trip back to a town. His ignorance of urban life is apparent, but interesting nevertheless, as we do not imagine such people nor meet them in everyday life today. Kurosawa is on top form here, letting the camera take in the vastness of Siberia, and still allowing the viewers to observe the characters closely. The story is interesting too, with a sadly ironic ending (won't say any more!). I think everybody should watch this film, because everybody will have something to learn from it.",still best movie i have ever seen,dersu uzala is slow serene beautiful but nevertheless gripping it tells friendship between nomadic siberian native russian army explorer how former is able help latter his team negotiate many obstacles presented by siberian wilderness we see how traditional survival methods intrinsic common sense can help more urbanised army men cope with extremes climate geography eventually nomad is persuaded join general his trip back town his ignorance urban life is apparent but interesting nevertheless as we do not imagine such people nor meet them everyday life today kurosawa is top form here letting camera take vastness siberia still allowing viewers observe characters closely story is interesting too with sadly ironic ending wont say any more i think everybody should watch this film because everybody will have something learn it,0.434375,0.22083333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,My Favorite Kurosawa,"I own many of Akira Kurosawa's films. I have Ran, Throne of blood, Seven Samarai, Roshomon, Dreams, Hidden Fortress, Jojimbo, Snajuro, Red Beard, and even ""Kurosawa"" the documentary. I guess you can say that I like his work. The ""Kurosawa"" documentary narrated by Sam Shepard and produced by thirteen / WNET I recommend for anyone at all interested in Kurosawa's films as it will really wet your appetite.Of all of his films, Dersu Uzala is my favorite. It is also one of my favorite films by anybody. It was done shortly after Akira had went through a very dark time in his life and had attempted suicide. It was his first film afterwards and the content of the film appears to reflect more than a little of his mindset at the time. Dersu Uazla is both a feel good film and also a sad film. It touches the way that people as they grow older have a more and more difficult time adapting to life as it changes and has its affect on them. The end of the film can certainly show light on the inhumanity that appears to be growing more prevalent in our society. But, I think what you remember from the film is the love between two individuals, and that is what feels good.Many of Kurosawa's films have a great deal of spectacle, and he is perhaps known best for his Samarai films. There is none of that in this movie. Dersu Uzala is a statement by Akira of life. Akira was fighting to keep making films and was not having an easy time of it. If Akira Kurosawa could not make films, he could not feel that he was living. As a result, he attempted suicide. He survived to make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today. Dersu Uzala may be the most important of his films and the one that shows the great director's true personality. Just perhaps, it shows more about humanity than any of his other films. Again, it is my favorite.",my favorite kurosawa,i own many akira kurosawas films i have ran throne blood seven samarai roshomon dreams hidden fortress jojimbo snajuro red beard even kurosawa documentary i guess you can say that i like his work kurosawa documentary narrated by sam shepard produced by thirteen wnet i recommend anyone at all interested kurosawas films as it will really wet your appetite all his films dersu uzala is my favorite it is also one my favorite films by anybody it was done shortly after akira had went through very dark time his life had attempted suicide it was his first film afterwards content film appears reflect more than little his mindset at time dersu uazla is both feel good film also sad film it touches way that people as they grow older have more more difficult time adapting life as it changes has its affect them end film can certainly show light inhumanity that appears be growing more prevalent our society but i think what you remember film is love between two individuals that is what feels good many kurosawas films have great deal spectacle he is perhaps known best his samarai films there is none that this movie dersu uzala is statement by akira life akira was fighting keep making films was not having easy time it if akira kurosawa could not make films he could not feel that he was living as result he attempted suicide he survived make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today dersu uzala may be most important his films one that shows great directors true personality just perhaps it shows more about humanity than any his other films again it is my favorite,0.5737440476190475,0.3172529761904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,Russia meets the far east,"Akira Kurosawa's breathtaking ""Dersu Uzala"" looks at a meeting of cultures in pre-revolutionary Russia, as a captain in the czar's army befriends a hunter in Russia's far east. Even as Dersu helps the platoon negotiate the forest and tundra, it is clear that his way of life is dying out as the Russian Empire expands and swallows the indigenous peoples of northeast Asia.The movie has some of the most amazing cinematography.

9.0,A hauntingly beautiful film set in the wilderness of eastern Siberia,"On the face of it, Dersu Uzala would not seem like a candidate for a great film. The story is about a young Russian (Imperial Russia) officer is sent to the far east of Siberia to explore. He meets with a native of the region and they form a bond together. The territory in question is the wild, rugged eastern Siberia (north of Valdivostok). I would say that you have not lived until you have seen what Kurosawa can do filming nature in its raw splendor and magnificence. The scenes in this film like the wind rushing through the tall reeds, or the mist draping the forested hills, are images of haunting beauty.Kurosawa, one of the greatest film directors of the 20th century, made his final masterpiece with film. The characters are well drawn, the sub-text of the story (the clash of civilization vs. nature) is nuanced, but most of all it is the wild beauty of nature which is the focus of this film.

10.0,Dersu!! Kapitan!!,"A wonderful film. It showcases the natural beauty of the Taiga and presents a contrast between the technological and the pastoral. Dersu is one with the forest. He knows its ways and its moods. The Russians scoff at his ways and his 'primitive' belief system, but eventually come to rely on him, and even love him. It is a beautiful story that takes place in an world that very few of us in the West have had a chance to see. I thought the fact that the film was set in the pre-revolutionary period gave it a peculiar sort of charm - Russia before the Great War and the Russian Revolution was innocent and even naive, the same way the Russian soldiers were innocent of the wonders and the dangers of the Taiga. One of the things I loved most about this film was the cinematography - there are long, lingering shots of the landscape, the endless steppe, the forest, the rivers, the mountains. We believe ourselves to be powerful because we have been moderately successful in our attempts to harness nature for our own uses, but the film shows us that we are deluding ourselves, that nature cannot be controlled or resisted, and the truly powerful are those, like Dersu, who co-exist in harmony with nature and learn what the wilderness teaches.",dersu kapitan,wonderful film it showcases natural beauty taiga presents contrast between technological pastoral dersu is one with forest he knows its ways its moods russians scoff at his ways his primitive belief system but eventually come rely him even love him it is beautiful story that takes place world that very few us west have had chance see i thought fact that film was set pre revolutionary period gave it peculiar sort charm russia before great war russian revolution was innocent even naive same way russian soldiers were innocent wonders dangers taiga one things i loved most about this film was cinematography there are long lingering shots landscape endless steppe forest rivers mountains we believe ourselves be powerful because we have been moderately successful our attempts harness nature our own uses but film shows us that we are deluding ourselves that nature cannot be controlled or resisted truly powerful are those like dersu who co exist harmony with nature learn what wilderness teaches,0.64025,0.33325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"

,There Is No `Try;' Only `Do',"Spoilers herein.Kurosawa's genius was in envisioning a story in visual terms, then translating that through masterful framing, and direction of actors. Along the way, he became an absolute master of editing -- editing each day's shoot that night. And he invented a vocabulary of multiplanar storytelling with often three planes of action flattened by his telephoto lens.Then, success crept in, and his studio forced him to make more and more samurai pictures with plots not conceived in his mind. These are still wonderfully photographed, but you can see that the narrative itself wasn't fertilized in his visual imagination. That integration of visual narrative and the various production skills was broken, most clearly with `Red Beard,' and the realization led to collapse, a suicide attempt, and a long, long crawl back to `Ran,' possibly the most narratively integrated film in existence.Along the way, he went through a new apprenticeship and this film is one of the tests he endured. It has one of the Kurosawa master touches: it has an abstract, intelligent, sometimes beautiful camera. But it lacks nearly all of the other elements that add to the hypnotizing mastery of his earlier, integrated efforts:--he had no control over the story, which is quite second-rate and ordinarily conceived (meaning it is literary like Tolstoy and not visual like Tarkovsky)--he could not edit at night because of the cumbersomeness of the 70mm process and the insistence on using remote, Soviet processing labs--he had to work in a language that is not only different, it is profoundly so: Japanese phrases have a staccato rhythm that builds with an emphasis on the end. This is something Kurosawa uses to project to the next scene, or cut within the scene. Russian is a matter of lingual brushes that peak in midphrase and tail off. Each phrase has its own arc, its own closure that one cannot use to sew continuity between utterances. (There is the whole matter of noh gestures as well, but the structure of phrase is more basic and leverageable.) --he was forced to live in an `open' environment.This last is the primary test of this film (which incidentally bears fruit in `Ran'). Hitherto, all of his visual compositions were a matter of manipulating physical constraints to `contain' the frame. He would use buildings to frame village scenes and valley tree and rock elements to frame wilderness (the best of which are `Hidden Fortress'). `High and Low' is an exercise in inside/outside constraints, but always constraints. Here he is faced with an openness, where the openness is the unescapable soul of the environment. How to frame and focus when all his framing and compositional tools are unavailable? You shoot from the inside out, rather than the outside in as is traditional in all Japanese art.Lots of this film is unsure experiments in managing this new visual cosmology. The running along the bank of the rapids and the waking up in the emergency grass yurt were irresistably with the old eye for instance. But the lost wandering on the lake bed is an example of him struggling for a coherent frame. There is not a tree, nothing at all. So see how he uses nothing as a constraint, and he shifts that nothing of the open air to the surrounding grass sometimes when they frantically cut it. Framing with open space. See how he plays with this space constraining the fabric constraining the men in the opening of `Ran.'Its a painful journey, this film, not a joy, often tearful for us as we participate.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",there is no try only do,spoilers herein kurosawas genius was envisioning story visual terms then translating that through masterful framing direction actors along way he became absolute master editing editing each days shoot that night he invented vocabulary multiplanar storytelling with often three planes action flattened by his telephoto lens then success crept his studio forced him make more more samurai pictures with plots not conceived his mind these are still wonderfully photographed but you can see that narrative itself wasnt fertilized his visual imagination that integration visual narrative various production skills was broken most clearly with red beard realization led collapse suicide attempt long long crawl back ran possibly most narratively integrated film existence along way he went through new apprenticeship this film is one tests he endured it has one kurosawa master touches it has abstract intelligent sometimes beautiful camera but it lacks nearly all other elements that add hypnotizing mastery his earlier integrated efforts he had no control over story which is quite second rate ordinarily conceived meaning it is literary like tolstoy not visual like tarkovsky he could not edit at night because cumbersomeness 70mm process insistence using remote soviet processing labs he had work language that is not only different it is profoundly so japanese phrases have staccato rhythm that builds with emphasis end this is something kurosawa uses project next scene or cut within scene russian is matter lingual brushes that peak midphrase tail off each phrase has its own arc its own closure that one cannot use sew continuity between utterances there is whole matter noh gestures as well but structure phrase is more basic leverageable he was forced live open environment this last is primary test this film which incidentally bears fruit ran hitherto all his visual compositions were matter manipulating physical constraints contain frame he would use buildings frame village scenes valley tree rock elements frame wilderness best which are hidden fortress high low is exercise inside outside constraints but always constraints here he is faced with openness where openness is unescapable soul environment how frame focus when all his framing compositional tools are unavailable you shoot inside out rather than outside as is traditional all japanese art lots this film is unsure experiments managing this new visual cosmology running along bank rapids waking up emergency grass yurt were irresistably with old eye instance but lost wandering lake bed is example him struggling coherent frame there is not tree nothing at all so see how he uses nothing as constraint he shifts that nothing open air surrounding grass sometimes when they frantically cut it framing with open space see how he plays with this space constraining fabric constraining men opening ran its painful journey this film not joy often tearful us as we participate teds evaluation 3 4 worth watching,0.3806860815951724,0.12844582185491277,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.49}"

I would like to report that its a great film but its not. I enjoyed it but to me the story was lacking, I wanted to know more. I also had problems with the second half of the film which seemed to be straining to go into a man made direction instead of one that flowed naturally.The first half flows. I was just going to take a peak at the film only to find that 45 minutes had passed as if in a blink of an eye. The second half of the film is less natural, it moves in fits toward a conclusion we know from the outset of the film, but which is arrived at via a journey that doesn't seem natural.

10.0,Haunting Work Of Art.,"Think of Kurosawa, and, most likely, you will think first of his Samurai epics. However, his genius stands apart from any particular genre, and this film is a stunning case in point.Faced with such unpromising material as a story about the friendship between a Russian army officer and an aging hunter, set in Siberia in the early 1900's, most film-makers would run screaming for cover. Kurosawa revels in the story, and creates a true cinematic masterpiece.While the heart of the film is the human relationship between the ""Capitan"" and Dersu, the main star of the film is the Siberian wilderness itself. Rarely can such loving care have been lavished on ensuring that the natural beauty of a location comes through onto the celluloid. Some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed: the group round the campfire with the river in the background and the wind whipping up; the sequence where the captain and Dersu have to cut reeds to make a shelter as night falls and a storm approaches; the night-time scene (I kid you not!) of the group dragging a sledge across an icy waste.The simple story of exploration, man versus nature, and the evolution of a true friendship is both thought-provoking and deeply touching. The tiny Maksim Munzuk is superb as the title character and Yuri Solomin is a study of restraint in the role of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (upon whose actual journals the story is based).This is one of those rare films that you can watch twice back-to-back, or at any time to restore your belief that, in addition to being a means of mass entertainment, movies really can be an art form as well.",haunting work art,think kurosawa most likely you will think first his samurai epics however his genius stands apart any particular genre this film is stunning case point faced with such unpromising material as story about friendship between russian army officer aging hunter set siberia early 1900s most film makers would run screaming cover kurosawa revels story creates true cinematic masterpiece while heart film is human relationship between capitan dersu main star film is siberian wilderness itself rarely can such loving care have been lavished ensuring that natural beauty location comes through onto celluloid some scenes have be seen be believed group round campfire with river background wind whipping up sequence where captain dersu have cut reeds make shelter as night falls storm approaches night time scene i kid you not group dragging sledge across icy waste simple story exploration man versus nature evolution true friendship is both thought provoking deeply touching tiny maksim munzuk is superb as title character yuri solomin is study restraint role captain vladimir arseniev upon whose actual journals story is based this is one those rare films that you can watch twice back back or at any time restore your belief that addition being means mass entertainment movies really can be art form as well,0.44023809523809526,0.17944444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Rewards Patience,"If you're used to the propulsive, kinetic Kurosawa films like ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Throne of Blood,"" be warned that ""Dersu Uzala"" is very quiet and slow in comparison. But it's a film that rewards patience.It's a very simple film in many ways. It's about the bond that forms between a group of Soviet explorers and the Japanese tracker who helps them wend their way through the wilds of Siberia. The Soviets are pretty glib about the natural world they're traipsing through, while Dersu brings a Buddhist philosophy to his interaction with nature. It's a film that has a renewed relevancy in these days of climate catastrophe.I very much enjoyed the visual poetry of this film, filled with a reverence for the natural world. A scene set during a deadly windstorm in which Dersu and his Soviet friend must make a shelter out of prairie grass if they are to survive is one of the film's most memorable and weirdly beautiful. On the other hand, I remained ever so slightly distant from the film because of Kurosawa's decision to film almost every scene in long shot. The men are always given less importance because of how far away they are from the camera and by extension us, the audience. I'm guessing this was intentional so as to show their place in the natural world, but it does have the result of making it that much harder to become involved in their story. This is a minor quibble though, and mostly this is an exceptional film.""Dersu Uzala"" won the 1975 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Ironically, the only film to ever bring Kurosawa a competitive Oscar was won by the USSR.Grade: A",rewards patience,if youre used propulsive kinetic kurosawa films like seven samurai or throne blood be warned that dersu uzala is very quiet slow comparison but its film that rewards patience its very simple film many ways its about bond that forms between group soviet explorers japanese tracker who helps them wend their way through wilds siberia soviets are pretty glib about natural world theyre traipsing through while dersu brings buddhist philosophy his interaction with nature its film that has renewed relevancy these days climate catastrophe i very much enjoyed visual poetry this film filled with reverence natural world scene set during deadly windstorm which dersu his soviet friend must make shelter out prairie grass if they are survive is one films most memorable weirdly beautiful other hand i remained ever so slightly distant film because kurosawas decision film almost every scene long shot men are always given less importance because how far away they are camera by extension us audience im guessing this was intentional so as show their place natural world but it does have result making it that much harder become involved their story this is minor quibble though mostly this is exceptional film dersu uzala won 1975 academy award best foreign language film ironically only film ever bring kurosawa competitive oscar was won by ussr grade,0.49336734693877554,0.1732142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,please release a BluRay version for this world-class treasure,"This is one world-class piece of work desperately in the waiting line for a BluRay revamp, watched this Kurosawa's Soviet Union film in DVD format, the quality is discouraging, but the film speaks for itself in shedding bells and whistles and homing in on a camaraderie between a Soviet military explorer and a seasoned local hunter among the bleak Ussuri inhospitable region. Storyline-aside, it is another Kurosawa's awesome visual spectacle, a tremendous field shooting endeavor, epitomizes by the sun-moon co-existence with solemn placidness, furthermore, it is a hymn to mother nature, Dersu personifies as the harmonious co-habitant of the mighty wilderness, a sublime soul with well-versed survival skills, on the contrary to my recent watched documentary TOUCHING THE VOID (2003, 8/10), DERSU UZALA owns a purer and more admirable prospect, instead of conquering the insurmountable to chase a spur of glory and invincibility, it is far more intrepid and unpretentious to be a part of it with reverence and be respectful to its law and act, in addition to its indefatigable undertone against industrialized modernism (it is the brand-new rifle, a token of friendship, actually wreaks the somber demise of Dersu). Strictly speaking, there is merely two characters in the film, Dersu (Munzuk) and the Russian Captain (Solomin), a bond is tenably formed through their expedition in the wild, from lush jungle to walking-on-the-thin-ice frozen river, the life-saving bravado during a squalling night when they lost their track on a snow land or a torrent peril, Kurosawa molds a great range of topography with taut excitement where it is required. The character study of Dersu also is been executed through the observation and the interaction from Captain (viewers' proxy), who is enthralled by Dersu's simple yet ethereal nature, a rare bird may or may not be extinct now. The dual-acting from Munzuk and Solomin is the fruit of naturalistic emancipation and unassuming engagement. Also a memorable presence is Isaak Shvarts's accompanying score segues from lithe to menacing, eerie to sonorous, with Russian folklore and shanty as well.Being a Chinese, I cannot avoid mentioning the sensitive timing (after China and Japan's rapprochement in 1972 and China and Soviet Union's dispute in 1969) of the film-making, which prompted an accusation from Chinese government concerns a so-called political libel on Chinese people, mainly by vilifying Hunhutsi (which literally means red beard in Mandarin) as the villain and the nature-balance defier. But honestly, this episode is largely overstated since there is no direct confrontation at all in the film, at least for my compatriots, don't let this smokescreen blinds your eyes, DERSU UZALA is a spirited ethnological oeuvre could inspire whoever has a chance to watch it, preferably on a big screen or at least a BluRay edition.",please release bluray version this world class treasure,this is one world class piece work desperately waiting line bluray revamp watched this kurosawas soviet union film dvd format quality is discouraging but film speaks itself shedding bells whistles homing camaraderie between soviet military explorer seasoned local hunter among bleak ussuri inhospitable region storyline aside it is another kurosawas awesome visual spectacle tremendous field shooting endeavor epitomizes by sun moon co existence with solemn placidness furthermore it is hymn mother nature dersu personifies as harmonious co habitant mighty wilderness sublime soul with well versed survival skills contrary my recent watched documentary touching void 2003 8 10 dersu uzala owns purer more admirable prospect instead conquering insurmountable chase spur glory invincibility it is far more intrepid unpretentious be part it with reverence be respectful its law act addition its indefatigable undertone against industrialized modernism it is brand new rifle token friendship actually wreaks somber demise dersu strictly speaking there is merely two characters film dersu munzuk russian captain solomin bond is tenably formed through their expedition wild lush jungle walking thin ice frozen river life saving bravado during squalling night when they lost their track snow land or torrent peril kurosawa molds great range topography with taut excitement where it is required character study dersu also is been executed through observation interaction captain viewers proxy who is enthralled by dersus simple yet ethereal nature rare bird may or may not be extinct now dual acting munzuk solomin is fruit naturalistic emancipation unassuming engagement also memorable presence is isaak shvartss accompanying score segues lithe menacing eerie sonorous with russian folklore shanty as well being chinese i cannot avoid mentioning sensitive timing after china japans rapprochement 1972 china soviet unions dispute 1969 film making which prompted accusation chinese government concerns so called political libel chinese people mainly by vilifying hunhutsi which literally means red beard mandarin as villain nature balance defier but honestly this episode is largely overstated since there is no direct confrontation at all film at least my compatriots dont let this smokescreen blinds your eyes dersu uzala is spirited ethnological oeuvre could inspire whoever has chance watch it preferably big screen or at least bluray edition,0.4765331890331889,0.0552218614718615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,A beautiful and Simple Film,"Dersu Uzala takes the best bits from, say, Andrei Tarvosky - the languishing and poetical visuals but omits his often gregarious and incomprehensible plots, to leave a fine mixture of storytelling, character building and epic scale. The cinematography is often breathtaking.In two parts, the two and three quarter hour film, introduces us to an almost Siberian ""Indian"", the sort we might have seen in westerns from the '50s. Dersu Uzala is a simple trapper in his 70's, living from hand to mouth in the wastelands of Siberia. Lush in summer, bleak and raw (and arctic) in winter he relies totally on his instinct and experience. He has also escaped from a previous 'life'. In the 19th century, a group of Russian army surveyors are mapping the area and become out of their depth in the relative wilderness. They stumble upon Dersu and they soon form an unbreakable bond and through a series of survival adventures and near death skirmishes with the inclement weather and nature itself the film moves with dignity and statesmanship. What will happen to the ageing Dersu? Can this wild man ever be tamed? These are all the questions that this Oscar winning fable addresses - and more. Kurosawa's own life mirrored Dersu's alienation and for those of more used to the director's ruggedly brilliant black & white masterpieces made thirty odd years prior, will find this refreshing - and moving. This is one film that can be enjoyed by all. Take it in one, or two sittings and let the warmth, frailty - and harshness - of one man and his surroundings wash over you.",beautiful simple film,dersu uzala takes best bits say andrei tarvosky languishing poetical visuals but omits his often gregarious incomprehensible plots leave fine mixture storytelling character building epic scale cinematography is often breathtaking two parts two three quarter hour film introduces us almost siberian indian sort we might have seen westerns 50s dersu uzala is simple trapper his 70s living hand mouth wastelands siberia lush summer bleak raw arctic winter he relies totally his instinct experience he has also escaped previous life 19th century group russian army surveyors are mapping area become out their depth relative wilderness they stumble upon dersu they soon form unbreakable bond through series survival adventures near death skirmishes with inclement weather nature itself film moves with dignity statesmanship what will happen ageing dersu can this wild man ever be tamed these are all questions that this oscar winning fable addresses more kurosawas own life mirrored dersus alienation those more used directors ruggedly brilliant black white masterpieces made thirty odd years prior will find this refreshing moving this is one film that can be enjoyed by all take it one or two sittings let warmth frailty harshness one man his surroundings wash over you,0.4866365777080063,0.2102106227106227,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,A return to one's original self,"How fantastic is it that Kurosawa was a fan of Russian literature, and picked this obscure memoir to make a film out of when the Soviet production company Mosfilm approached him during a very difficult period in his life. Somehow it seems appropriate, being so quiet and contemplative, and like a return to truth or one's original self. The story is fairly simple, relating the real-life adventures of an exploration into the rugged region around the Ussuri river basin when the group's captain (Vladimir Arsenyev, played by Yury Solomin) befriends a mountain man (Dersu Uzala, played by Maxim Munzuk).Early on we see that Dersu identifies everything around him as a person - the sun, moon, wind, water, a tiger, etc. It seems childlike, but it's actually rather profound - he sees a unity to everything, and that man is not separate from his environment. He lives as one with nature, respects its power, doesn't waste, and helps others when he can. As the captain says, ""He had a beautiful soul. He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know, and probably wouldn't ever see."" He also recognizes subtle signs in things like tracks or weather conditions that others can't see. The scene where he ingeniously builds a makeshift shelter out of tall grasses on the taiga when it gets late and the wind starts howling is excellent. I don't know whether this character or movie helped shaped George Lucas's vision of Yoda, but there are certainly similarities.The pace of the film is on the slow side, and that combined with minimal action may turn some viewers off, but I found that it went well with Dersu's spirit and the environment they were in. ""Man is very small before the face of nature,"" the film says, as Kurosawa gives us beautiful footage of wide open spaces, ice floes, and forests. Let the simplicity wash over you and cleanse you, like Dersu undoubtedly did with Arsenyev's soul. It's not Kurosawa's very best, but this is a good one, and it got the 65-year-old director back on track to make more films at the end of his career.",return ones original self,how fantastic is it that kurosawa was fan russian literature picked this obscure memoir make film out when soviet production company mosfilm approached him during very difficult period his life somehow it seems appropriate being so quiet contemplative like return truth or ones original self story is fairly simple relating real life adventures exploration into rugged region around ussuri river basin when groups captain vladimir arsenyev played by yury solomin befriends mountain man dersu uzala played by maxim munzuk early we see that dersu identifies everything around him as person sun moon wind water tiger etc it seems childlike but its actually rather profound he sees unity everything that man is not separate his environment he lives as one with nature respects its power doesnt waste helps others when he can as captain says he had beautiful soul he provided needs person he didnt know probably wouldnt ever see he also recognizes subtle signs things like tracks or weather conditions that others cant see scene where he ingeniously builds makeshift shelter out tall grasses taiga when it gets late wind starts howling is excellent i dont know whether this character or movie helped shaped george lucass vision yoda but there are certainly similarities pace film is slow side that combined with minimal action may turn some viewers off but i found that it went well with dersus spirit environment they were man is very small before face nature film says as kurosawa gives us beautiful footage wide open spaces ice floes forests let simplicity wash over you cleanse you like dersu undoubtedly did with arsenyevs soul its not kurosawas very best but this is good one it got 65 year old director back track make more films at end his career,0.521674347158218,0.17868663594470047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"
