,A Symbolic witty original modern day fairy tale that is nothing short of a masterpiece,"(Probably) Simplicity can never be a passé. A whole generation still connects to the ""Ta Na Na Ta Na Na"" of Malgudi Days. R.K Narayan Ki duniya talked about the real India, some simple people, their life & its ordeal.Rajat Kapoor's refreshingly eccentric yet gimmick-less (even hype-less) ""Ankho Dekhi"" is kind of a dejavu of Malgudi Days. The film revolves around Bauji who lives in his own ideological world & believes in inherent goodness of people. But he isn't gullible person & believes only in ""Ankho Dekhi"". And in a moment of realization he literary sets on to a journey whereby he decides that he will only believe what he can see for himself. From religion to education to even science - Bauji seeks for his own truth, an experienced one. He will come across as a visionary to someone while others might outright reject him as a nitwit. Kapoor webs an authentic image of a regular middle-class household in the surrounding areas of urban India, the still-prevailing joint family & the ego dynamics. His execution is gentle traversing at its own pace much like the ways of Bauji.Kapoor's narrative talks about many issues in subtle way & he webs in some brilliant situations to express his points. Like the scene where the priest gives ""Prasad"" (Godly offering) to Bauji, he takes it, have it & then says that the sweet is good totally unaware of the anger of the priest who kept on insisting that it's not a mere sweet, it is godly offering. Then in another accomplished sequence bauji kept on saying that he won't believe in gods until one of them comes & have tea with him which angers the religious fanatic ones. Going away from religion, he even pokes on the education system whereby he establishes the importance of knowledge beyond books. The debate with the maths teacher on how could one assume that two parallel lines would meet at infinity deserves mention. Then the sequence of visiting a zoo to check whether a tiger roars or meows was superlative.Kapoor got able support from cinematography, editing & music department bringing out the essence of the narrative deftly. And as the masterstroke climax happened I almost jumped from my seat to applaud & that's when the end credit began with the following note – ""Thanking my teachers Mani Kaul & Kumar Shahani"" (two of the finest film makers of Indian parallel cinema); what a way to give back to his masters! This is indeed one of the finest films from Rajat Kapoor.Otherwise typecast & wasted in loud comical characters Sanjay Mishra didn't let slip this opportunity & gave his career best performance as bauji. Hopefully his acting potential will be frequently utilized from now on. The supporting cast were tremendous comprising of Rajat Kapoor himself, Manu Rishi, Pahwa, Miya Sarao (who made a striking debut as the daughter of Bauji), Namit das, even stalwart Saurabh Shukla in a cameo.Without being preachy the premise makes you (makes us) introspect – all of us, lost in the jungle of consumerism are losing our own thought prowess; the power of self experience. As bauji would have said which goes in English somewhat this - Whatever I am saying is my truth, my experience. Don't go by it only as your's experience & truth can be different.(For some reason IMDb is not allowing me to out the Hindi sentence thus have to give the translated version). In this way the film hits the consumerist (And media dominated) culture whereby people are losing their self identity.Give this movie a try, you will probably come with a thoughtful grin & might set for your very own 'flight of fancy"" (as Masand said).(Sadly this witty original film got overpowered by ghostly baby dolls & their gang of marketing terrorists..)",symbolic witty original modern day fairy tale that is nothing short masterpiece,probably simplicity can never be pass whole generation still connects ta na na ta na na malgudi days r k narayan ki duniya talked about real india some simple people their life its ordeal rajat kapoors refreshingly eccentric yet gimmick less even hype less ankho dekhi is kind dejavu malgudi days film revolves around bauji who lives his own ideological world believes inherent goodness people but he isnt gullible person believes only ankho dekhi moment realization he literary sets journey whereby he decides that he will only believe what he can see himself religion education even science bauji seeks his own truth experienced one he will come across as visionary someone while others might outright reject him as nitwit kapoor webs authentic image regular middle class household surrounding areas urban india still prevailing joint family ego dynamics his execution is gentle traversing at its own pace much like ways bauji kapoors narrative talks about many issues subtle way he webs some brilliant situations express his points like scene where priest gives prasad godly offering bauji he takes it have it then says that sweet is good totally unaware anger priest who kept insisting that its not mere sweet it is godly offering then another accomplished sequence bauji kept saying that he wont believe gods until one them comes have tea with him which angers religious fanatic ones going away religion he even pokes education system whereby he establishes importance knowledge beyond books debate with maths teacher how could one assume that two parallel lines would meet at infinity deserves mention then sequence visiting zoo check whether tiger roars or meows was superlative kapoor got able support cinematography editing music department bringing out essence narrative deftly as masterstroke climax happened i almost jumped my seat applaud thats when end credit began with following note thanking my teachers mani kaul kumar shahani two finest film makers indian parallel cinema what way give back his masters this is indeed one finest films rajat kapoor otherwise typecast wasted loud comical characters sanjay mishra didnt let slip this opportunity gave his career best performance as bauji hopefully his acting potential will be frequently utilized now supporting cast were tremendous comprising rajat kapoor himself manu rishi pahwa miya sarao who made striking debut as daughter bauji namit das even stalwart saurabh shukla cameo without being preachy premise makes you makes us introspect all us lost jungle consumerism are losing our own thought prowess power self experience as bauji would have said which goes english somewhat this whatever i am saying is my truth my experience dont go by it only as yours experience truth can be different some reason imdb is not allowing me out hindi sentence thus have give translated version this way film hits consumerist media dominated culture whereby people are losing their self identity give this movie try you will probably come with thoughtful grin might set your very own flight fancy as masand said sadly this witty original film got overpowered by ghostly baby dolls their gang marketing terrorists,0.5458451494741818,0.20801075268817207,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,Just watch it at the earliest & try to find your own precious 'SATORI' in its 2 meditative hours.,"Thought provoking films have always been an important feature of our Regional Cinema since the beginning and Hindi film-makers have also delivered many worth watching gems in this particular genre in the past (especially before the 90s). But even then, very rarely we have seen a film which comes up with a fine blend of both entertaining as well as enlightening moments in its beautifully executed narration, reaching out to the audience individually in more than one unique manner. Writer-Actor-Director Rajat Kapoor's ANKHON DEKHIis a perfect example of such rare, not to be missed precious cinema. And as suggested by its name, the film simply needs to be seen, felt and enjoyed at the earliest instead of just being read about, discussed or pre-judged by its various appreciative reviews written by different critics.Actually films like ANKHON DEKHI should not be ideally reviewed in the usual manner since they are certainly going to have many distinctive meanings or interpretations for different viewers (as per their own viewpoints), which in fact can easily be stated as the film's real beauty too required to be kept intact. For instance where a few might enjoy it just as a light, feel-good comedy revolving around a lower middle class family, there for others it may turn out to be a highly transforming experience, giving them a new bright insight into their own struggling life, demanding many major changes.So with many thanks to Rajat Kapoor (writer-actor-director), Manish Mundra (producer), Seema Mishra (Bauji's wife), the entire supporting cast, music, background score & art department along with the emotionally touching & exceptionally terrific Sanjay Mishra as Bauji, I would like to strongly recommend ANKHON DEKHI to one and all as a rare meaningful achievement not to be missed.With a sincere wish that every reader of this honest write-up watches ANKHON DEKHI and many more movies like these like a true seeker, I would like to end here hoping that may you also find your own precious SATORI in those two meditative hours in the dark spent with Bauji. And may we all live a more contended, loving and thankful life in the future, forgetting this silly mad race for money, luxuries and power (to the extent they certainly deserve to be forgotten).",just watch it at earliest try find your own precious satori its 2 meditative hours,thought provoking films have always been important feature our regional cinema since beginning hindi film makers have also delivered many worth watching gems this particular genre past especially before 90s but even then very rarely we have seen film which comes up with fine blend both entertaining as well as enlightening moments its beautifully executed narration reaching out audience individually more than one unique manner writer actor director rajat kapoors ankhon dekhiis perfect example such rare not be missed precious cinema as suggested by its name film simply needs be seen felt enjoyed at earliest instead just being read about discussed or pre judged by its various appreciative reviews written by different critics actually films like ankhon dekhi should not be ideally reviewed usual manner since they are certainly going have many distinctive meanings or interpretations different viewers as per their own viewpoints which fact can easily be stated as films real beauty too required be kept intact instance where few might enjoy it just as light feel good comedy revolving around lower middle class family there others it may turn out be highly transforming experience giving them new bright insight into their own struggling life demanding many major changes so with many thanks rajat kapoor writer actor director manish mundra producer seema mishra baujis wife entire supporting cast music background score art department along with emotionally touching exceptionally terrific sanjay mishra as bauji i would like strongly recommend ankhon dekhi one all as rare meaningful achievement not be missed with sincere wish that every reader this honest write up watches ankhon dekhi many more movies like these like true seeker i would like end here hoping that may you also find your own precious satori those two meditative hours dark spent with bauji may we all live more contended loving thankful life future forgetting this silly mad race money luxuries power extent they certainly deserve be forgotten,0.6212977602108037,0.30164925654056096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,A Man Introspects. ♦ 83%,"Rajat Kapoor has always fascinated me: with his acting, directing & even writing. His Raghu Romeo was a good project. His roles in Dil Chahta Hai & Monsoon Wedding upped the ante. Ankhon Dekhi could just be his magnum opus.Sanjay Mishra's character is the protagonist; troubled with life's ways, troubled with the monotony, he starts introspecting as his daughter's love affair is known about. He realizes that nothing can be believed to be right until you see it with your eyes, ankhon dekhi. What follows is a myriad number of references about a man's life: his birth, his family, his kids, his work & his thought. What the plot tries to suggest is the idiosyncrasy we all possess and that it is all different for different people. It may force people to ape others, but that is not the right way.With beautiful vocals & music by Kailash Kher, brilliant cinematography & marvelous direction, Ankhon Dekhi is perhaps Bollywood's best film this year, so far. The performances is the best thing about it; each & every cast member is so involved with their characters, that I was taken aback when a supporting actor playing the mother of a boy who is diagnosed with a disorder, enacts the relief when he ails out of it. Her expression & conduct all were absolutely mesmerizing. Plus, the brotherly relationship is talked about, with respect to joint families. It showcases the Indian which we had thought is lost; perfectly captured Delhi streets & chawls; fantastic photography.The climax is equally haunting and is free for interpretation to viewers; ends with a bang & so sharply expresses a man's views. It mixes wonder with reality & does it right.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended because this is no ordinary cinema. This is a masterwork.",man introspects 83,rajat kapoor has always fascinated me with his acting directing even writing his raghu romeo was good project his roles dil chahta hai monsoon wedding upped ante ankhon dekhi could just be his magnum opus sanjay mishras character is protagonist troubled with lifes ways troubled with monotony he starts introspecting as his daughters love affair is known about he realizes that nothing can be believed be right until you see it with your eyes ankhon dekhi what follows is myriad number references about mans life his birth his family his kids his work his thought what plot tries suggest is idiosyncrasy we all possess that it is all different different people it may force people ape others but that is not right way with beautiful vocals music by kailash kher brilliant cinematography marvelous direction ankhon dekhi is perhaps bollywoods best film this year so far performances is best thing about it each every cast member is so involved with their characters that i was taken aback when supporting actor playing mother boy who is diagnosed with disorder enacts relief when he ails out it her expression conduct all were absolutely mesmerizing plus brotherly relationship is talked about with respect joint families it showcases indian which we had thought is lost perfectly captured delhi streets chawls fantastic photography climax is equally haunting is free interpretation viewers ends with bang so sharply expresses mans views it mixes wonder with reality does it right bottom line highly recommended because this is no ordinary cinema this is masterwork,0.6421978021978022,0.30340659340659343,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Sheer Brilliance!,"'Ankhon Dekhi' is Sheer Brilliance! A powerful, symbolic, heart-breaking film, that is also blessed with incredible performances! 'Ankhon Dekhi' centers around Bauji, played by Sanjay Mishra, who, after a dramatic incident, decides that he will only believe what he sees with his eyes.'Ankhon Dekhi' narrates Bauji's ""see it to believe it"" story, with strong emotion & poetic pacing. Writer/Director Rajat Kapoor delivers a human-story, that in many ways, narrates life. His Screenplay deals with faith, family bond, sadness & reality. Its blunt, but also beautiful. His Direction, on the other-hand, is simplistic. A Special Mention for the wonderful music. Performance-Wise: Sanjay Mishra is mesmerizing as Bauji. The immensely talented actor delivers a knock-out performance, that in my opinion, deserves a National-Award! He's the life of the show. Seema Pahwa is outstanding. She compliments Mishra, marvelously. Rajat Kapoor, himself, pitches in a restrained performance. Maya Sarao is a talent to watch out for. She's superb. Brijendra Kala, Manu Rishi & Namit Das, are impressive, as well.On the whole, 'Ankhon Dekhi' left me overwhelmed.",sheer brilliance,ankhon dekhi is sheer brilliance powerful symbolic heart breaking film that is also blessed with incredible performances ankhon dekhi centers around bauji played by sanjay mishra who after dramatic incident decides that he will only believe what he sees with his eyes ankhon dekhi narrates baujis see it believe it story with strong emotion poetic pacing writer director rajat kapoor delivers human story that many ways narrates life his screenplay deals with faith family bond sadness reality its blunt but also beautiful his direction other hand is simplistic special mention wonderful music performance wise sanjay mishra is mesmerizing as bauji immensely talented actor delivers knock out performance that my opinion deserves national award hes life show seema pahwa is outstanding she compliments mishra marvelously rajat kapoor himself pitches restrained performance maya sarao is talent watch out shes superb brijendra kala manu rishi namit das are impressive as well whole ankhon dekhi left me overwhelmed,0.721031746031746,0.3773809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Aankho Dekhi is to be experienced...,"The Plot: Aankhon Dekhi is a movie in which the lead character Bauji (Sanjay Mishra), in his late fifties, seeks answer to the very question of 'Truth'. He stays in an Old Delhi small house with his family as well as extended family. His exploration begins when an acquaintance gossips about Ajju's (Namit Das) of ill-repute, with whom Bauji's daughter Rita (Maya Sarao) is in love. But Bauji finds Ajju to be just the opposite on meeting him. And that is when, Bauji's journey towards developing the Power of Discernment begins. The movie is woven around this theme where Bauji through his excellent acting conveys a great message that every human being has his / her own truth which is unique in itself. Bauji's philosophy is not to believe anything that hasn't been validated by his own experience. But when he tries to adopt this in his life, lot of events happen which is full of humour. Bauji's eccentricities do embarrass his family at times. He does earn his gang of cronies.Direction and Script Writing: Another great work from the director Rajat Kapoor. The story (by Rajat Kapoor) has been presented in a thought provoking manner, yet very lightly. He engages the audience through this delightful work and quaint sense of humour. Dialogues have been carefully crafted. No element of preaching, yet would facilitate people to reason their own reasons.Cast and their Performance: What a delight to watch Sanjay Mishra as Bauji. Nobody else could have pulled Bauji's character better than him, he has actually gone into the skin of the character.Rajat Kapoor as Rishi (Bauji's brother) has carried his reticent character so nicely. He is calm and at times ferocious and arrogant as well.Seema Pahwa as Bauji's wife is also great. She is very convincing – at times loud, at times very expressive, at times nagging, at times caring.Rest of the ensemble cast also add lot of value to the plot and pitch in noticeable performances: Namit Das (Ajju), Manu Rishi Chadha (Sharmaji), Brijendra Kala (Shibbo Babu), Maya Sarao (Rita), Taranjit Kaur (Chachi),Chandrachoor Raj (Shammi), Alka Chawla (Sarup Bua), Mahesh Sharma (Bagga), Anil Chaudhary (Chaudhary Sahab), Shrikant Verma (Masterji), Manish Karnatak (Jeevan), Saurabh Shukla (Boss), Dhruv Singh (Dhruv), Danish Hussain (Gopi), Yogendra Tiku (Pandit), Chaitanya Mahawar (Ashok), Chetan Sharma (Anil), Shivam Sethi (Arun).Cinematography: Movie is shot at old Delhi's location. Cinematographer Rafey Mahmood has captured the feel of Old Delhi & its narrow lanes wonderfully through his shots.Music: Music by Sagar Desai suits to the tone of the movie. Lyrics (by Varun Grover) are good.Moments to watch out for: There are many such moments: Bauji's argument with one of his customer and Maths teacher, his bland & affable manners, his relationship with daughter (rather with family & neighbours), his way of looking at things, bauji going to zoo to check whether a tiger really roars etc. Thumbs up: Watch the movie for its thought-provoking theme and of course for Sanjay Mishra's splendid performance. If you are offbeat movie lover, you must not miss this movie. You won't get bored, guaranteed.Thumbs down: Probably no 'Thumbs down' moments.One-Liner: Aankhon Dekhi is to be experienced.",aankho dekhi is be experienced,plot aankhon dekhi is movie which lead character bauji sanjay mishra his late fifties seeks answer very question truth he stays old delhi small house with his family as well as extended family his exploration begins when acquaintance gossips about ajjus namit das ill repute with whom baujis daughter rita maya sarao is love but bauji finds ajju be just opposite meeting him that is when baujis journey towards developing power discernment begins movie is woven around this theme where bauji through his excellent acting conveys great message that every human being has his her own truth which is unique itself baujis philosophy is not believe anything that hasnt been validated by his own experience but when he tries adopt this his life lot events happen which is full humour baujis eccentricities do embarrass his family at times he does earn his gang cronies direction script writing another great work director rajat kapoor story by rajat kapoor has been presented thought provoking manner yet very lightly he engages audience through this delightful work quaint sense humour dialogues have been carefully crafted no element preaching yet would facilitate people reason their own reasons cast their performance what delight watch sanjay mishra as bauji nobody else could have pulled baujis character better than him he has actually gone into skin character rajat kapoor as rishi baujis brother has carried his reticent character so nicely he is calm at times ferocious arrogant as well seema pahwa as baujis wife is also great she is very convincing at times loud at times very expressive at times nagging at times caring rest ensemble cast also add lot value plot pitch noticeable performances namit das ajju manu rishi chadha sharmaji brijendra kala shibbo babu maya sarao rita taranjit kaur chachi chandrachoor raj shammi alka chawla sarup bua mahesh sharma bagga anil chaudhary chaudhary sahab shrikant verma masterji manish karnatak jeevan saurabh shukla boss dhruv singh dhruv danish hussain gopi yogendra tiku pandit chaitanya mahawar ashok chetan sharma anil shivam sethi arun cinematography movie is shot at old delhis location cinematographer rafey mahmood has captured feel old delhi its narrow lanes wonderfully through his shots music music by sagar desai suits tone movie lyrics by varun grover are good moments watch out there are many such moments baujis argument with one his customer maths teacher his bland affable manners his relationship with daughter rather with family neighbours his way looking at things bauji going zoo check whether tiger really roars etc thumbs up watch movie its thought provoking theme course sanjay mishras splendid performance if you are offbeat movie lover you must not miss this movie you wont get bored guaranteed thumbs down probably no thumbs down moments one liner aankhon dekhi is be experienced,0.6393580246913579,0.30445679012345683,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Brilliant and Artistic in every sense!!!,"Bauji, a man in his fifties decides to only believe the facts which he sees by his own eyes or feels them and then starts a beautiful yet surprising journey to discover the real meaning of life or to discover himself. There are so many scenes where you literally feel the art of cinema. Without showing any unnecessary dance sequences and cheap dialogues, the film quickly dissolves you in its cinematic mood. It's a gem which will attain cult status after so many years. Rajat Kapoor, the man behind this masterpiece should be appreciated for his devotion towards cinema. Every scene has its details and a meaning which is too deep. Every dialogue is witty as well as thought provoking. Music sets the real mood and cinematography is mind-blowing. ""Sab Kuch Yahi Hai, Aankhe Khol Kar Dekho""Never seen such a perfect and accurate cinematography in any Indian film. The humorous instances during the movie give us an open chance to think what we are doing and what we should do. They play with our thoughts and beliefs. Sanjay Mishra has given a performance which can not be explained in words, along with Rajat Kapoor and the rest of the cast. For me, this film scores in every field of cinema. Direction, art design, music, cinematography, screenplay and performances and i know i can watch it a million times. It will leave you stunned and surprised in the ending.

9.0,This review is for everyone who didn't like the movie...,"When I was watching the movie I was confused. When I finished watching it I was disappointed. Why? Because like some other people (who have given poor reviews) I felt the movie didn't give a clear, well defined message/lesson. Main character seem so wayward that he felt more eccentric than philosophical. He quits his job because he didn't wanted to lie but right after that he lies to his own family. In certain situations he is kind to even strangers, in other he was stubborn to his own brother. One day out of the blue he decides to stop talking for life and later just like that he starts talking again. He was inconsistent, I thought.But all this disappointment melted away in 15 minutes, When I understood the true message that movie is trying to deliver.

9.0,A tight slap on high budget sleazy movies..,This is one of the best movies in the year 2014. This movie proves that a good movie doesn't require hot item numbers or overpriced so called actors or overdone physics violating action scenes. The actors in this movie are simple yet each one has given an awesome performance. You can relate the characters with the people in your locality or someone you see in day to day life. In the beginning movie would seem a little slow but soon it becomes quiet interesting. It shows what happens when a person rejects the common rules and starts believing in only what he has seen. The climax is totally surprising and unforeseen. Sanjay Mishra has given an example of his diverse talent and played a very difficult role of being funny and serious at the same time. No wonders it won the award of Best Critic's Movie. The story is really good and it will leave you thinking and imagining for a few hours or may be days. Another different movie like this is Queen. You should watch that too.,tight slap high budget sleazy movies,this is one best movies year 2014 this movie proves that good movie doesnt require hot item numbers or overpriced so called actors or overdone physics violating action scenes actors this movie are simple yet each one has given awesome performance you can relate characters with people your locality or someone you see day day life beginning movie would seem little slow but soon it becomes quiet interesting it shows what happens when person rejects common rules starts believing only what he has seen climax is totally surprising unforeseen sanjay mishra has given example his diverse talent played very difficult role being funny serious at same time no wonders it won award best critics movie story is really good it will leave you thinking imagining few hours or may be days another different movie like this is queen you should watch that too,0.5065773809523809,0.18794146825396826,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6.0,Rajat Kapoor's Ankhon Dekhi is another milestone in his journey.,"Truth can make you happy, miserable and also make your pants wet before it sets you free. Rajat Kapoor's Ankhon Dekhi is an excellent film with a slice of life. It's a brilliant portrayal of an ordinary man's journey to find his own existence. Sanjay Mishra, the lead protagonist is in a network of relationships as a father, brother, husband, neighbour and travel agent. A small family incident triggers a thought in Bauji's (Sanjay Mishra) mind that he would not take things at face value and would only believe what he experiences- discovering his own truth. He questions anything and everything that comes his way which creates situations for humour, satire and moments of profundity. He lives in a congested house in old Delhi lane. The excellent camera work gives you a worm's view of life, relationships and reality. You almost smell the air, taste the food and see the damp, well-lived walls.Bauji's first discovery is that truth is beautiful. He says to his office boy 'You are beautiful. His name is Satya. Things in life around him begin to appear in different hues and flavors. In one scene, Bauji is checking his specs and is surprised at his own short-sited view. The story travels from ordinary to divine to absurdity as Bauji deconstruct his own life. It is his personal journey. He even rebukes his lazy followers to embark upon their own path of discovery.The cast is predictable as Rajat Kapoor's regular ensemble but that they each have lived up to their calibre and reputation. Performances are brilliant and real. Kapoor doesn't preach; he just lays bare the challenges of one's journey of self-discovery. The cost of finding the truth is high and sometimes appears as selfish as Buddha leaving his wife. Bauji's startling questions stop you to ask yourself, who are you? What have you become? What is your personal truth? What you are looking for is right around you. All you need is to discover it employing your own sense and sensibility. The lazy and the lost ones give up easily and rely on other people's perspective. But the search could be dangerous and disturbing as well. Watch the end of the film.Rajat Kapoor has given his best performance as Rishi Chacha. Seema Pahwa is wonderful as Amma. It's sad that she doesn't get roles to showcase her talents. Maya Sarao as Rita is excellent. There are several characters and each one stays with you. Rajat has done a brilliant job as writer director.The plot loses its path at times but the acting keeps the audience engaged. The pace in the first half is a bit slow but picks up speed post the interval. Excellent camera-work, the tactile background score makes you almost feel the life of a middle class family with your fingers tips.Ankhon Dekhi is a high tea in your day. The taste and experience stay with you for a long time.

6.0,"Not much impressive as it could be, beware of pseudo-admirers of art cinema","My review here is unique in the sense that I want to criticize the film and hence my review is different from all other reviews. The reviews of the film posted here on IMDb (and elsewhere) are good and some of them are brilliant but I found some pseudo-admiration of the movie which prompted me to write the review.The movie is good because of its uniqueness, not many movies are made in commercial cinema which take the theme adopted in the movie. So people who love to watch art/parallel cinema would surely be attracted to the concept of the movie. The actors in the movie are mostly theater artists, who are popular for good acting and commonly appear in low-budget films. The basic theme of the movie showing the life experiences of the protagonist from ''his own eyes'' is appealing and philosophical in its essence. The film clearly showed demonstration of philosophical principle of ""seeing is believing"" through discussions, mass awareness campaigns (standing at metro station with message board in hand), life experiences of the lead character, Sanjay Mishra. When the movie had so many scenes conveying the philosophical ideas, yet I do not understand why most of the reviewers are saying that movie doesn't intend to spread any message. It seems pseudo-admiration at its heights!! The beautiful part of the movie is its emphasis on family roles and responsibilities, and dynamics of attachments and emotions among family members. The movie is set in a joint family context, which is shown in the beginning following strict social norms and conventions. Looking at all the mess going on around the family, and his inability to handle the circumstances, the lead character of Bauji diverts everyone's attention to his sudden shift of philosophical ideas and preoccupation of the principle ""seeing is believing"". When everyone was following ""believing is seeing, he chose to do the opposite. At this point it seemed that the movie would take on deep, mysterious turns and would show depth of the protagonist's character. But the movie is disappointing in this regard.The movie takes many turns and shifts in actions of Bauji - not believing in anything heard until experienced, leaving job due to his ideas, remaining silent because everyone was getting fed up of his philosophical talks which were incomprehensible by people, gambling to earn money, brother and his family separating to manage their expenses and duties etc.. All these incidents shake the feelings of Bauji to the core and it is seen that with every incident he takes some dramatic step and changes his behaviors. But in all this superficial drama, the emotional and wise character of Bauji is showing its strength and the only merit that this movie deserves. The emotional bonds of the family members are persistent and deep, even when they separate. The responsible character of Bauji to arrange marriage for his daughter, saving his son from a debt of Rs. 28/38,000 (unclear amount) is the most appreciable part of the movie. The minute details of middle class family life of Old Delhi were remarkable. Very fine details were shown in behaviors and verbal expressions of characters, which, to me, is the only plus side of the story and adds energy to the movie. This is the only part of the movie to which anyone can relate.The most saddening part of the movie was its confusing story-line, abrupt incidents and events, lack of coherence in incidents, loose adherence with any single theme, lack of connections between different scenes/acts and sentiments of the leading character. If all other characters were predictable, the main character was uncertain and unpredictable. His unpredictable characterization made him incomprehensible and confusing. Why suddenly he became fond of philosophical ideas, why he didn't consider many daily responsibilities as important (like leaving job), how come he suddenly tended to become sannyasi-like, and why he held strong emotional bonds. On the surface he seemed to be dramatizing all this philosophical non-sense just to divert everyone else's attention from social norms and restrictions, because he was always an emotional person caring for his family. Was he trying to wind up his life's duties to experience his dream of flying, was he trying to become a good father- a liberator for himself and family? This was not clearly shown. He was trying to conclude his life as an accumulation of experiences and fulfillment of wishes.If you have seen many such movies, to make it comprehensible and easy to follow, the story-line should be consistent, convey a deep message and lesson, follows a uni-dimensional approach to story and must establish links to different scenes and themes. On the contrary, Ankhon Dekhi lacks consistent story-line (except family sequences), is multi-thematic, shows uncertain actions of the leading character which make no sense in broader picture, except attributing the protagonist as crazy and free-thinker. I do not advocate such pseudo-admiration of incomplete depictions just because these depictions are meant to be shown through the lens of an art movie. Overall, the movie doesn't give a pleasurable feeling, except admiring disconnected scenes and actions of the lead actor. There are many scenes depicting behaviors of Bauji which show strong and compassionate character, an emotional and deeply attached person who cares for family. For example, debating maths teacher of his niece, asking daughter to prepare for her marriage, saving his son from debt of gambling, appreciating classical music, being an intellectual and providing wise lessons to his followers etc.Overall, the movie is nice, watchable, shows inner turmoil of an old man who is awaiting his death, good family sentiments and strong emotional bonds within a joint family But at the same time it is inconsistent in connecting scenes and shows multiple themes/messages with loose meanings. These meanings become hidden/suppressed and no single message or theme dominates the whole film. Due to overburdening with multiple messages and themes, the movie loses its charm and pleasure. This leaves many viewers confused and disappointed.",not much impressive as it could be beware pseudo admirers art cinema,my review here is unique sense that i want criticize film hence my review is

,"Staying firm, standing your ground","When this came out, it sure seemed like t'was a good week for Indian Indies.Rajat Kapoor, finally out with a great effort after one of the best pulp crime dark comedies ever made in the Indian milieu, 'Mithya'.(He has made other movies before and since, but that stood out for me, and parts of 'Mixed Doubles')This one's called 'Aankhon Dekhi' and was out in just a few screens - in and out within a week, and in few lucky locations, about 2 weeks.Rajat has always been a bold artist, both in his acting as well as directing choices, but this perhaps could be his boldest work, in spite of being an Indie, and the pitch itself would have been nightmarish to pull off. Its also perhaps his slickest, and he ensures that Delhi is captured every lovingly throughout. The respect for his characters shows throughout, as do his musical choices, all of which firmly scream 'Indie'. Sanjay Mishra, widely regarded a great actor, is perfectly cast (along with the rest) as the family patriarch, with Rajat casting himself (against type) as the Khadoos chacha. Its all about how each of lives reaches a point where something happens to make us change perspective (which one character also casually dismisses as 'menopause'), and how that even that affects us in making a radical change affects those around us. Though this flick is much more than that, with us, as the audience, just joining the protagonist in a journey that he's already on, this is the beginning point for us as we get on the ride. It called to mind the trip I had a few months earlier with 'Om Dar- ba-dar', though this one stays firmly in the real world and sticks the landing too. A trip nevertheless, both for us, the audiences, as well as the lead protagonist, who has a crisis of faith (some might disagree, but this was my lens doing the viewing) when we first encounter him initially, and yet stays firm in his conviction of doing something different in his life that he has never done earlier, something that casts him in a different light, and brings the neglected skills, nee, requirements that are critical thinking and the ability to reason. Sadly, though this is a poster child of sorts for both those attributes, the audiences, mainstream and Indie alike, have chosen not to use both in their decision to ignore this. Ironic, like most things are. In hindsight, this also would've made a good entry to being shortlisted as this country's entry for the Oscars, and I'm not sure it was considered. Like that 1988 movie I referred to earlier, the trip, I do hope this one also finds it audience over time, and Rajat manages to match the level of film- making that he seems to have attained with this one.I did observe a few audience-members (most of them well-behaved and who enjoyed/respected the material) complain about the abruptness of certain sequences, but I beg to disagree completely. This is not for anyone who's after instant gratification - Salman movies exist for that purpose. This one takes its time, and breathes.I still have no clue why there was almost next-to-no-buzz about this one, no festival talk either (this would make a great representation for India all across) and all I've seen's just the poster since 1 month back. Sad. 'Lunchbox' guys did it wayyy better in terms of publicity, and movies such as this one deserve such an approach.Ranvir Shorey and Saurabh Shukla have blink-and-miss cameos. Its always nice to watch them in action, no matter how short the runtime. Wish there was one with Vinay Pathak as well.Don't miss it - support good cinema by watching it on the big screen.

8.0,MY REVIEW: Watch it to believe it!!,"Ankhon Dekhi. It is not just another off beat movie from Rajat Kapoor. Instead, it is his big leap as a film maker. He teams up with versatile Sanjay Mishra and result is incredible thought provoking film.Ankhon Dekhi centers around Raje Bauji, played by Sanjay Mishra who, after a dramatic incident, decides that he will only believe what he sees with his eyes. This one little idea changes Bauji for ever. The strength of the movie is its sharp performances and authentic down town setup. Then there are delicious dialogues, delicious sequences of people first questioning Bauji and then following him blindly. All supporting actors including Rajat Kapoor also do an excellent job.This movie is about feeling and experiencing what Bauji felt and then doing your own interpretations. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Ankhon Dekhi. It is about extra ordinary tale of an ordinary person.",my review watch it believe it,ankhon dekhi it is not just another off beat movie rajat kapoor instead it is his big leap as film maker he teams up with versatile sanjay mishra result is incredible thought provoking film ankhon dekhi centers around raje bauji played by sanjay mishra who after dramatic incident decides that he will only believe what he sees with his eyes this one little idea changes bauji ever strength movie is its sharp performances authentic down town setup then there are delicious dialogues delicious sequences people first questioning bauji then following him blindly all supporting actors including rajat kapoor also do excellent job this movie is about feeling experiencing what bauji felt then doing your own interpretations i am going with fantastic 8 out 10 ankhon dekhi it is about extra ordinary tale ordinary person,0.6119444444444444,0.19993055555555558,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6.0,Starts off well but drags later on.,"Frankly, I was expecting Bheja Fry kinda fun. I know, wrong expectation. But then, I saw the movie only when I heard a lot about it - as a must watch. It was fun till the 1st half, then it felt a little too long to to be hooked on to. Anyways, here's the crux... Bauji (Sanjay Mishra) is an old man living in a joint family in a small house with his brothers family. His daughter is seeing a boy and the family finds this out one day. That day they lock her up in a room and the go to this boy's place to beat him up! Later they do realize that the boy indeed is a decent person, but in the process Bauji makes a crude decision that he will not believe in anything that he has himself not seen or heard! That pretext calls for some good fun. He gets laughed at, demeaned and even ignored for his theory and logic. He also quits his job at the travel agency citing the reason that the ticket booking orders that he was talking was not right as he would not like to book tickets for places where he himself has not gone. Saurabh Shukla can be seen here for a guest role as Bauji's boss. Another good scene is when Bauji tries to argue with his brother's son's maths teacher. Discussion on parallel lines meeting at infinity is cute and funny. This teacher later becomes Bauji's follower, among many who later accompany him in all his endeavors! Bauji takes more extreme steps and even stops talking. The Satya Ki Khooj madness goes to an all new level, altogether. There are any other incidents that happen later on and the plot gets confusing for me. Down the line it gets dragged and i started longing for the movie to end. I have written this for many other movies too and I wish movies were shorter in duration so that even a good movie is not tagged a star less coz of its length. Having said that I would also like to tell you that i did not like the ending. But I would sure recommend it as a good one time watch.",starts off well but drags later,frankly i was expecting bheja fry kinda fun i know wrong expectation but then i saw movie only when i heard lot about it as must watch it was fun till 1st half then it felt little too long be hooked anyways heres crux bauji sanjay mishra is old man living joint family small house with his brothers family his daughter is seeing boy family finds this out one day that day they lock her up room go this boys place beat him up later they do realize that boy indeed is decent person but process bauji makes crude decision that he will not believe anything that he has himself not seen or heard that pretext calls some good fun he gets laughed at demeaned even ignored his theory logic he also quits his job at travel agency citing reason that ticket booking orders that he was talking was not right as he would not like book tickets places where he himself has not gone saurabh shukla can be seen here guest role as baujis boss another good scene is when bauji tries argue with his brothers sons maths teacher discussion parallel lines meeting at infinity is cute funny this teacher later becomes baujis follower among many who later accompany him all his endeavors bauji takes more extreme steps even stops talking satya ki khooj madness goes all new level altogether there are any other incidents that happen later plot gets confusing me down line it gets dragged i started longing movie end i have written this many other movies too i wish movies were shorter duration so that even good movie is not tagged star less coz its length having said that i would also like tell you that i did not like ending but i would sure recommend it as good one time watch,0.43994835573782953,0.11733642819169135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,Fascinatingly awesome,I expected this movie to be on fun side from what I had guessed from trailers but this was awesome. Rajat Kapoor showed his class and Sanjay Mishra was fantastic. Very balanced movie with things which any one from India can relate to and feel for while watching movie. One of the best movie I have seen. I would have rated 10 but restricted myself to 9 because I cannot believe it is best until I know it is the best. I am not going to open up the details here but I can say it deals with mental thought process of human beings and how simple things can become complicated. This movie should be applauded for the story line which is not so common in Bollywood movies.,fascinatingly awesome,i expected this movie be fun side what i had guessed trailers but this was awesome rajat kapoor showed his class sanjay mishra was fantastic very balanced movie with things which any one india can relate feel while watching movie one best movie i have seen i would have rated 10 but restricted myself 9 because i cannot believe it is best until i know it is best i am not going open up details here but i can say it deals with mental thought process human beings how simple things can become complicated this movie should be applauded story line which is not so common bollywood movies,0.4904761904761904,0.32666666666666677,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.52, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.35}"
