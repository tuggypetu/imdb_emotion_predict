10,Soulful experience - Best of the best,"#96 squeezed my heart out.. heavy heart beats , cheek muscles were twitching coz I was trying to control myself from tearing up and somehow managed to not let them fall😅 It's a heart touching experience. Lots of 80s 90s memories refreshed. The screenplay is slow which I didn't find as a negative because that's how the director let's then situations and characters breathe in and make us feel how real this is. It's the beautiful memories and conversations between 2 ppl over a night. It takes guts to make a movie like this without comprising the original script by adding any unwanted commercial elements. I am in awe of Director Prem and his beautiful script. Loved his creation.Kaadhaley kaadhaley bgm with 96 title card brought goosebumps. Sounds of birds chirping , water flowing- Moments were lifted to another level by Govind Vasantha s music and Chinmayi s voice. If possible watch it without any disturbances without people around you joking or making comments. Memories of school days , love , lost love , past love and what not will pass through your mind. I loved it even more after second watch and still feel like watching it again that's the beauty of this film which is like poetry. Trisha and Vijay Sethupathi were fantastic. Trisha killed with her subtle and beautiful expressions , Vijay killed it with portraying an awkward shy guy. Excellent performances. They shared wonderful chemistry. Aadithya and Gowri as their childhood selves were fantastic woah! They build the foundation for the story. Again it takes guts and conviction to stay true to script and make a movie like this with just 2 main characters and their memories and conversations. I believe it's just Director Prem's reverence of love itself. Director Prem has created a classic.",soulful experience best best,squeezed my heart out heavy heart beats cheek muscles were twitching coz i was trying control myself tearing up somehow managed not let them fall its heart touching experience lots 80s 90s memories refreshed screenplay is slow which i didnt find as negative because thats how director lets then situations characters breathe make us feel how real this is its beautiful memories conversations between 2 ppl over night it takes guts make movie like this without comprising original script by adding any unwanted commercial elements i am awe director prem his beautiful script loved his creation kaadhaley kaadhaley bgm with 96 title card brought goosebumps sounds birds chirping water flowing moments were lifted another level by govind vasantha s music chinmayi s voice if possible watch it without any disturbances without people around you joking or making comments memories school days love lost love past love what not will pass through your mind i loved it even more after second watch still feel like watching it again thats beauty this film which is like poetry trisha vijay sethupathi were fantastic trisha killed with her subtle beautiful expressions vijay killed it with portraying awkward shy guy excellent performances they shared wonderful chemistry aadithya gowri as their childhood selves were fantastic woah they build foundation story again it takes guts conviction stay true script make movie like this with just 2 main characters their memories conversations i believe its just director prems reverence love itself director prem has created classic,0.5632352941176471,0.2977941176470588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.19}"

It is a journey to the past, and a journey within oneself, and will certainly overwhelm the gentle heart..I felt, and I'm sure countless others would've felt too, that elements of this journey were taken from a very personal portion of my life.
