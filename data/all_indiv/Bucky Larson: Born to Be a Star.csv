,A movie with absolutely no life whatsoever,"How does a movie like Bucky Larson get made? Here is a movie that appeals to no audience I can think of, and yet it is playing on thousands of screens. The only logical explanation I can come to for this movie's existence is that Mr. Sandler has some very incriminating photos of someone at Columbia Pictures.Our title hero, Bucky (played by comedian Nick Swardson), is a dweeb. Not a funny one, or a likable one, but a pathetic dweeb who seems to live in his own world. Bucky hails from a small Midwest farm town, where he works as a bag boy at a grocery store, until he's fired about two minutes after the opening movie credits. He goes to a friend's house, where they decide to cheer him up by showing him a classic porno film starring a pair of legendary porn stars named Rosie Bush and Jim Spraysium. Seconds into watching the film, Bucky recognizes the stars as being his parents. Rather than be horrified, he is entranced by the idea that his parents were once in movies. It's at that moment he decides that it's his destiny to be a star as well, and decides to head to California and make it in ""nude movies"".Bucky arrives in Hollywood with big dreams, but seemingly little common sense, as when he auditions for a mac and cheese commercial, and immediately drops his pants and starts jerking off in front of the horrified director and casting crew. Fortunately, the director on the commercial shoot used to work in the porn business, and directs Bucky to someone who can help him. The first person Bucky meets is the porn star Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff), who is currently the biggest thing in the movies (in more ways than one), and immediately shuns him. He's later introduced to Miles Deep (Don Johnson, looking particularly embarrassed here), a down on his luck porn director who is so desperate to make a movie, he's even willing to give Bucky a shot. The audition does not go well, as when Bucky drops his pants, his ""manhood"" is revealed to be literally microscopic. He also has a tendency to start screeching like a monkey whenever he sees a woman take her shirt off, and starts shooting off blasts of his ""man juice"" like a shotgun all over the room and ceiling.Let me stop this plot synopsis, and ask a simple question - Does this sound like a movie you would want to see? Does it even sound like a movie to begin with? I find myself returning to my original question, how does a movie like Bucky Larson get made? It holds absolutely no laughs, its lead character is an unlikable schmuck with an overbite and not a shred of knowledge of how to behave in social situations, and there's literally no plot to speak of. Just one situation after another for Bucky to humiliate himself. As the movie dragged on for nearly 100 interminable minutes, I came to realize that the entire screenplay revolves around three basic jokes. 1:) Bucky has buck teeth and talks funny. 2:) Bucky has a small dick. 3:) Bucky orgasms instantly every time he sees a woman take her shirt off. The movie repeats these same jokes many times, as if it thinks if it repeats them enough, it will wear down our defenses, and we'll eventually start laughing.Back to the plot - Bucky's disastrous audition winds up on the Internet, and becomes a sensation. This inspires Miles Deep to give the guy another chance, and come up with a new form of porn that is non-threatening to guys (because they know they're better than Bucky), and is reassuring to women, since they know they are sleeping with a better guy than Bucky. Somehow, this idea takes off, and Bucky becomes a major star in the porn industry. He even sweeps the porn film awards, which is hosted by Pauly Shore, who plays himself in a cameo. It also means that this is probably the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever appeared in. (And no, I'm not forgetting BioDome.) While all this is happening, Bucky also strikes up a relationship with a sweet young waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci). Kathy seems like a bright young woman, and Ricci plays her with charm. So, why is she hanging around Bucky to begin with? Looking back over my review, I see that I have left very little out. This literally is all there is to the movie. There's no real conflict, other than a very halfhearted falling out between Bucky and Kathy that exists solely because the movie was nearly 90 minutes old, and nothing had really happened so far. This is nothing more than a story of an insufferable schmuck who goes to Hollywood, gets a job in porn, and falls in love with a nice girl. That's all. There's a hint of a subplot concerning the jealous porn star, Dick Shadow, trying to ruin Bucky's career. But this is so unmemorable, it could be cut from the film without anyone noticing. Why did it take three people to write a movie where virtually nothing happens? A movie that's quite clearly dead.Yes, Bucky Larson is a dead movie. It shows no signs of life or inspiration. It doesn't even have the decency to be a lively or memorable bad movie. It just sort of lies there, not doing anything, and then asks us to leave 100 minutes later. Those who know me know that I never wish ill will upon anyone, but I seriously think that a movie like this could end careers. I hope that doesn't happen. I'm sure Nick Swardson is a nice and funny guy in real life. I'm also sure he'll be apologizing for this one for a long time to come.",movie with absolutely no life whatsoever,how does movie like bucky larson get made here is movie that appeals no audience i can think yet it is playing thousands screens only logical explanation i can come this movies existence is that mr sandler has some very incriminating photos someone at columbia pictures our title hero bucky played by comedian nick swardson is dweeb not funny one or likable one but pathetic dweeb who seems live his own world bucky hails small midwest farm town where he works as bag boy at grocery store until hes fired about two minutes after opening movie credits he goes friends house where they decide cheer him up by showing him classic porno film starring pair legendary porn stars named rosie bush jim spraysium seconds into watching film bucky recognizes stars as being his parents rather than be horrified he is entranced by idea that his parents were once movies its at that moment he decides that its his destiny be star as well decides head california make it nude movies bucky arrives hollywood with big dreams but seemingly little common sense as when he auditions mac cheese commercial immediately drops his pants starts jerking off front horrified director casting crew fortunately director commercial shoot used work porn business directs bucky someone who can help him first person bucky meets is porn star dick shadow stephen dorff who is currently biggest thing movies more ways than one immediately shuns him hes later introduced miles deep don johnson looking particularly embarrassed here down his luck porn director who is so desperate make movie hes even willing give bucky shot audition does not go well as when bucky drops his pants his manhood is revealed be literally microscopic he also has tendency start screeching like monkey whenever he sees woman take her shirt off starts shooting off blasts his man juice like shotgun all over room ceiling let me stop this plot synopsis ask simple question does this sound like movie you would want see does it even sound like movie begin with i find myself returning my original question how does movie like bucky larson get made it holds absolutely no laughs its lead character is unlikable schmuck with overbite not shred knowledge how behave social situations theres literally no plot speak just one situation after another bucky humiliate himself as movie dragged nearly 100 interminable minutes i came realize that entire screenplay revolves around three basic jokes 1 bucky has buck teeth talks funny 2 bucky has small dick 3 bucky orgasms instantly every time he sees woman take her shirt off movie repeats these same jokes many times as if it thinks if it repeats them enough it will wear down our defenses well eventually start laughing back plot buckys disastrous audition winds up internet becomes sensation this inspires miles deep give guy another chance come up with new form porn that is non threatening guys because they know theyre better than bucky is reassuring women since they know they are sleeping with better guy than bucky somehow this idea takes off bucky becomes major star porn industry he even sweeps porn film awards which is hosted by pauly shore who plays himself cameo it also means that this is probably worst movie pauly shore has ever appeared no im not forgetting biodome while all this is happening bucky also strikes up relationship with sweet young waitress named kathy christina ricci kathy seems like bright young woman ricci plays her with charm so why is she hanging around bucky begin with looking back over my review i see that i have left very little out this literally is all there is movie theres no real conflict other than very halfhearted falling out between bucky kathy that exists solely because movie was nearly 90 minutes old nothing had really happened so far this is nothing more than story insufferable schmuck who goes hollywood gets job porn falls love with nice girl thats all theres hint subplot concerning jealous porn star dick shadow trying ruin buckys career but this is so unmemorable it could be cut film without anyone noticing why did it take three people write movie where virtually nothing happens movie thats quite clearly dead yes bucky larson is dead movie it shows no signs life or inspiration it doesnt even have decency be lively or memorable bad movie it just sort lies there not doing anything then asks us leave 100 minutes later those who know me know that i never wish ill will upon anyone but i seriously think that movie like this could end careers i hope that doesnt happen im sure nick swardson is nice funny guy real life im also sure hell be apologizing this one long time come,0.5105761447224858,0.07745365237743286,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,One of the worst comedies ever released!!!,"I like Nick Swardson. His show ""Pretend time"" on Comedy Central is hilarious and he's usually good in supporting roles (""Grandma's boy"" & ""Just go with it""). But wow, did this movie suck. ""Bucky Larson"" is flat. The jokes aren't funny and the acting for the most part is uninspired. Don Johnson was the highlight of the film and Christina Ricci did what she could but there are no redeeming qualities in this film.I went in with low expectations because of the bad reviews and word of mouth, and yet I was still disappointed. This film deserves to be in the bottom 250 on IMDb. With the talent that was involved in the project and the premise of a porn comedy, ""Bucky Larson"" should have been funny. But instead I found myself wishing it was never made. I feel sorry for the chumps who paid $10 to see this garbage in theaters.",one worst comedies ever released,i like nick swardson his show pretend time comedy central is hilarious hes usually good supporting roles grandmas boy just go with it but wow did this movie suck bucky larson is flat jokes arent funny acting most part is uninspired don johnson was highlight film christina ricci did what she could but there are no redeeming qualities this film i went with low expectations because bad reviews word mouth yet i was still disappointed this film deserves be bottom 250 imdb with talent that was involved project premise porn comedy bucky larson should have been funny but instead i found myself wishing it was never made i feel sorry chumps who paid 10 see this garbage theaters,0.6436274509803921,-0.06911764705882352,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.22}"
1.0,Watching this movie literally made my jaw drop to the floor....,"...And not in a good way! I love movies, regardless of its age or genre. I love comedies and admire those with inspiration. When I saw Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star out of curiosity- though I did have reservations about seeing it starting with the trailer and Adam Sandler co-penning the script- online, I found next to nothing to love or admire about it.The film looks cheap for starters, more in the slapdash editing and cinematography and dull lighting than the scenery. The soundtrack didn't have anything I'd deem memorable. Then there is the direction. Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star has some of the worst direction I have seen in a movie in quite a while, as all the basic tools of direction like camera placement and continuity Brady seems to be ignoring here.Story-wise this just didn't engage. Some might say it is a predictable movie, in many ways yes it is. A movie that is predictable isn't bad as such, but for me it is when the film in question is not at all inspiring and just doesn't have any point to it. That for me is the case with Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star. Even worse is the writing, which is horrendous. It is not funny at all, just dumb, puerile and irritating, with no heart whatsoever.When it comes to the pace, the film has no life to it, because the dialogue and jokes are so bad(seriously the penis that was so small you could use a straw for a condom idea was incredibly stupid) and no effort is made in regards to the characters, who are little more than stiff caricatures at best. The acting is really poor, Nicky Swardson is just annoying and abrasive while Christina Ricci who I like actually is cute but bland. In fact only Don Johnson actually tries to do anything fresh with his character. As for comic timing, in regard to this film, why bother really, most of it is basically saying a line and standing around aimlessly waiting for someone to say their bit.Overall, irritating, woefully directed and pointless. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I think I now have my new contender for the worst of the bunch. 0/10 Bethany Cox",watching this movie literally made my jaw drop floor,not good way i love movies regardless its age or genre i love comedies admire those with inspiration when i saw bucky larson born be star out curiosity though i did have reservations about seeing it starting with trailer adam sandler co penning script online i found next nothing love or admire about it film looks cheap starters more slapdash editing cinematography dull lighting than scenery soundtrack didnt have anything id deem memorable then there is direction bucky larson born be star has some worst direction i have seen movie quite while as all basic tools direction like camera placement continuity brady seems be ignoring here story wise this just didnt engage some might say it is predictable movie many ways yes it is movie that is predictable isnt bad as such but me it is when film question is not at all inspiring just doesnt have any point it that me is case with bucky larson born be star even worse is writing which is horrendous it is not funny at all just dumb puerile irritating with no heart whatsoever when it comes pace film has no life it because dialogue jokes are so bad seriously penis that was so small you could use straw condom idea was incredibly stupid no effort is made regards characters who are little more than stiff caricatures at best acting is really poor nicky swardson is just annoying abrasive while christina ricci who i like actually is cute but bland fact only don johnson actually tries do anything fresh with his character as comic timing regard this film why bother really most it is basically saying line standing around aimlessly waiting someone say their bit overall irritating woefully directed pointless very hit miss year so far i think i now have my new contender worst bunch 0 10 bethany cox,0.5961016414141413,-0.03243934884559884,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.21}"
1.0,This should have NEVER been born.,"There is very little to say about Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star other than ""I hated it ... I hated ALL of it!"" The film is not funny and it is repellent.I cannot criticize it for being about porn because Boogie Nights was exclusively about the world of porn and I think it was one of the BEST film of the 1990's. Boogie Nights treated its characters as flawed human beings searching for acceptance and a feeling of belonging -- Bucky Larson's characters are all supposed to be laughed at and there are just too many times throughout the movie which had me wanting to rush to the bathroom to vomit as 89% of the film is stomach-churning.This should pretty-much END the career of anybody involved and I am actually surprised that Adam Sandler's name is attached as both a writer and a producer of this trash (Sandler also gave us Jack and Jill and Just Go With It this year -- the latter film is only saved b/c of the over-the-top performance of the unlikely physical comedienne Nicole Kidman -- so I question whether or not his days are numbered?).An unfunny-to-me Nick Swardson (Just Go With It, 30 Minutes or Less, Blades of Glory) -- who's career is mostly stand-up comedy -- stars as the grotesquely buck-toothed Bucky Larson (who must've been born with buck-teeth?) who believes he is destined for a glorious career in porn after discovering his parents were au natural (meaning: unshaven, un-waxed, un-spray-tanned, un-fit etc) porn stars of the 1970's. Bucky leaves behind an insulting-to-mid-westerners existence in Iowa (only found in the movies -- he didn't attend high school because his town didn't have one ... whatever), the RIDICULOUSLY-accented Bucky (that is NOT an Iowa accent ... but let's throw-out another stupid laugh at the expense of the heartland) heads to LA where his dreams can come true.Bucky luckily meets a nice, big-hearted waitress (Christina Ricci - Sleepy Hollow, Penelope, Monster ... and after this is it any wonder she seeked out employment on television as Pan-Am is Oscar-caliber compared to this!) at a random diner who befriends him, finds him a place to live (with crazy-jerk roommate Kevin Nealon - ""SNL"", ""Weeds"", Just Go With It) and sets him in the right direction of finding work. Don Johnson (Tin Cup, Machete ... who's short-lived career rebirth must be over) is porn director Miles Deep who sees something ""special"" in Bucky and decides to exploit the freak (it's explained in the film ... but I don't recommend watching this to figure out the ""freak-tag"" that has NOTHING to do with his teeth!) and Stephen Dorff (who's stellar ""comeback"" with the excellent film Somewhere must have been a fluke!!) plays a jealous porn-star rival.As vulgar and repulsive as this film is, there is surprisingly little flesh on display. It would be difficult to pick-out the worst part of this film as that would pretty-much be the whole thing. Just as impossible would be finding ""the best"" part. This film isn't bad because it is offensive -- we've had Bridesmaids and two Hangover films -- it is just terrible bad. What works with those 3 films is that they are ""equal-opportunity offenders"" ... this one -- NOT so much. It is rank and rancid and beyond mere words for criticism.

9.0,"They don't get it, recommended only for specialists","This is extremely heavy stuff, made for specialists in comedy. Most people will not get Tarkovsky's The Mirror and in the same way most people will not get Bucky Larson. There are few that get The Mirror and a few that get Bucky Larson and these two groups of people do not intersect easily. I rated The Mirror, 10/10, and Bucky Larson, I rate it 9/10, the same ratings I gave for Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Rear Window, Fanny and Alexander and Vertigo.I personally think that Bucky Larson is vastly superior to most comedies. Take another random comedy, House Bunny, that was a plain bad movie but this is much more than that, if you are able to get it, of course. One needs to be able to fully master the art of watching crappy comedies before trying this kind of stuff which was made for the specialists. I have already watched hundreds of bad comedies and about 20 Adam Sandler movies and this operates on another league of greatness. I would say that I got a lot of fun from watching this impressive work of art that defies convention and goes where no other movie has gone before. It was a ""bad movie"" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers. Just like the porn movies Bucky made in the movie, this is innovation and film critics, people who were brainwashed in film school to like 1940's stuff, cannot simply understand the genius of this film, as did the people on the porn business which were shown Bucky film's.My ratings would be:9/10 - Specialists 0/10 - Most peopleI wouldn't recommend this movie for regular people.

He has a team of friends around him who obviously get together over a few drinks and spin out some ideas that make them laugh. I like that about him. And I always get the impression that everybody making one of his movies has a real laugh doing it. And that's what I'm after when I'm watching one.

1.0,Worst Movie Ever,"Awful. Dreadful. Total waste of time and film. Do not see this movie. I work in a movie theater so I get to (have to) watch EVERY movie that comes out, and this is without a doubt the absolute worst movie I have seen in a long long long time. I could not find even one redeeming quality in this movie.

8.0,This was not as bad as everyone is saying it is,"I understand the movie is ridiculously stupid, but Nick Swardson is hilarious in this. I think it has to be his funniest performance hands down. I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw his face and the bucked teeth with bowl cut. Coming in to this movie you knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. If you can't handle comedies that are stupid and funny you should avoid them. I think the people giving Buck Larson a 1/10 were the same ones giving Warrior 10 and comparing it to Rocky, but let's stick to the review anyways. With Happy Madison movies it's either always a hit or miss. I think Sandler gave us another great dark comedy that will be loved by a small group of people, and hated by most. The dark humour in Bucky Larson is very dirty, so be prepared for that. I think it appeals to mostly men who are 18-35. If you saw Grandmas Boy that would be the best way I could describe the very dark humour of this movie. I was disappointed Allen Covert didn't have a bigger role in Bucky Larson but im sure Sandler has other plans for him. At the end of the day this was Swardson at his absolute best. Christina Ricci also did a great job with the role she was given. Stephen Dorff was good as always, but Kevin Nealon (bull dance guy from Happy Gilmore) had me in tears. I have never heard him swear before so when he goes off it's priceless and unexpected. I think Bucky Larson Born To Be A Star deserves an 8/10 and it's unfortunate that people these days can't handle a great comedy just because it's dirty. No dirty isn't the word for it, this movie is filthy. I am laughing again just thinking about the concept. At least Sandler gave us something really filthy for a change, finally back to his roots.",this was not as bad as everyone is saying it is,i understand movie is ridiculously stupid but nick swardson is hilarious this i think it has be his funniest performance hands down i couldnt stop laughing when i first saw his face bucked teeth with bowl cut coming this movie you knew it wasnt meant be taken seriously if you cant handle comedies that are stupid funny you should avoid them i think people giving buck larson 1 10 were same ones giving warrior 10 comparing it rocky but lets stick review anyways with happy madison movies its either always hit or miss i think sandler gave us another great dark comedy that will be loved by small group people hated by most dark humour bucky larson is very dirty so be prepared that i think it appeals mostly men who are 18 35 if you saw grandmas boy that would be best way i could describe very dark humour this movie i was disappointed allen covert didnt have bigger role bucky larson but im sure sandler has other plans him at end day this was swardson at his absolute best christina ricci also did great job with role she was given stephen dorff was good as always but kevin nealon bull dance guy happy gilmore had me tears i have never heard him swear before so when he goes off its priceless unexpected i think bucky larson born be star deserves 8 10 its unfortunate that people these days cant handle great comedy just because its dirty no dirty isnt word it this movie is filthy i am laughing again just thinking about concept at least sandler gave us something really filthy change finally back his roots,0.6791111111111112,0.060277777777777784,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,"Yeah, it's pretty bad","""Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star"" bombed big time when it was released to theaters. It may have been because it was released in the beginning of September, when there are few people going to movie theaters. It may have been because the movie is about the porn industry, which has never been a popular movie topic for mainstream moviegoers. It may have also been because the relentless television commercials for the movie were very annoying. But I think the main reason why it bombed was that the audience smelled it for the stinker that it was. There are no laughs anywhere to be found in the movie, for one thing. But it also has a weird tone, like it was written by a dirty-minded and mean-spirited eight year old. It's not very audience-friendly, to put it mildly. The cast is spirited, but they can do absolutely nothing with the terrible script.Oh, one more piece of evidence for its badness: The end credits for this 2011 release list a 2010 copyright, suggesting that Columbia Pictures didn't know what to do with the movie for quite some time.",yeah its pretty bad,bucky larson born be star bombed big time when it was released theaters it may have been because it was released beginning september when there are few people going movie theaters it may have been because movie is about porn industry which has never been popular movie topic mainstream moviegoers it may have also been because relentless television commercials movie were very annoying but i think main reason why it bombed was that audience smelled it stinker that it was there are no laughs anywhere be found movie one thing but it also has weird tone like it was written by dirty minded mean spirited eight year old its not very audience friendly put it mildly cast is spirited but they can do absolutely nothing with terrible script oh one more piece evidence its badness end credits this 2011 release list 2010 copyright suggesting that columbia pictures didnt know what do with movie quite some time,0.6327380952380952,-0.08035714285714286,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1.0,Buck This Porn Star,"I'm totally confused. I'm completely lost. Did the world famous ""Jack and Jill"" (co-writer) Adam Sandler and Going-Nowhere-Fast Nick Swardson INTENTIONALLY set out to make the world's worst comedy?Seriously. Think about it. The horribly clichéd and unoriginal Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star was so god-awful and incredibly offensive with its decades-old bad stereotypes it was flat-out unfunny. In fact, if you dare, watch it with the sound off and turn on the 24/7 Comedy IHEARTRADIO Station. At least you'll laugh for 90 minutes. It may even coincide with the scenes on the screen.I used to like Swardson, especially as Terry on Reno 911! But, damn, ever since then – Just Go With It, 30: Minutes or Less, Jack and Jill – c'mon now. Enough is enough. I understand most of his ""appearances"" take place because he's in bed with Adam Sandler and it's no secret I loathe that whiney little man, but this feature length, his first, I believe, is just a tragedy. That all said, the worst offender was Christina Ricci. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!Ah-hem, I'm calm now. Where was I? Bucky is a buck-toothed (ha, get it? Really?) son of two 70s porn stars and heads to Hollywood to become one himself. His only gift is that he makes other small-penis guys feel better about themselves. Oh, and an outrageously blind girl (Ricci) falls for him.The movie, which in reverse, wouldn't even work as a 5-minute SNL sketch. Hell, it doesn't work as a comedy, spoof, drama or a relevant piece of farce in 2011. I'm seriously considering adding a ""½ Star to 0 Stars"" to my rating board, if it weren't actually professionally shot. Sure, it wasn't amateurishly made, but that's like buying an old Ford Pinto and when people's eyes turn away, you say: ""Hey, it runs!""I don't normally focus on Box Office Receipts for movies, because they can go either way in regards to quality and money made – note: the Twilight series, but just for shits and giggles, I looked it up: $1.4 million opening weekend and $2.5 overall. That's a lot more than I imagined. And more than this is worthy of. (It did, however, open at #15 behind The Smurfs. Please, PLEASE, Adam & Nick, see this as a sign not everything you touch turns to gold.)One final note to end these rants: My prayer is that Adam Sandler is done soon. I know he'll dish 'em out as long as he has an audience dumb enough to pay his salary, but I do pray he has a Mel Gibson rant and disappears. He'll still have all the money he didn't deserve, but at least he'll go away. Nick, on the other hand, his days HAVE to be numbered. Even Adam isn't as stupid as to keep him under his wing.

1.0,Born to be a thought,"I admire Swardson's defense for this film because I imagine it was an unbelievable challenge to market. Here we have a character, unseen anywhere else, played by a second rate actor who hasn't quite made a household name yet. To market an unknown character with antics like the ones present in this movie isn't as much hard as it is devotion. To go through with a project of this magnitude means you must have a lot of faith in the material.In Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, there is no faith, hope, wit, soul, or even a sign that this was taken to a remote extent of seriousness. All the actors seem to be laughing at their own joke shamelessly - nearly all of them equally unfunny and sad. Adam Sandler hit a landmark year in 2011. Not only did he work on four movies this whole year, he starred in two of them. Out of the four released, Just Go With It, Zookeeper, Bucky Larson, and Jack and Jill, three of them you can simply look at the film's poster and decide if you want to pay to see it. They're films that almost don't even care that they're bad.I've seen four films where Nick Swardson plays one of the lead actors or a supporting actor. Three of them easily dismissible, and one that wouldn't be considered mediocre if he was carefully extracted from the film entirely. He simply is not funny. I think it's honestly the material that makes him unfunny. I've seen scattered clips of his standup and he is slightly funny. Maybe he works better when he writes his own lines. Yet, that can't be. This was co-written by Swardson himself, who I assume wrote most, if not, all of the dialog for his character. Maybe he works best with himself and himself only locked in a sound-proof room where he can be alone with his thoughts.Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison Productions company have now just given me one of the least ambitious comedies I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even feel like it's trying to be funny. It seems to be a series of cheap shots taken at a character that was made for that one purpose. Why not make a character who has some likability? Nope. Go straight to the drawing board and come up with a desperately unfunny character with no shining qualities, give him a desperately unforgiving plot to work with where he can get himself into lame, uninspired situations, and to top him all off, make him the most gullible, pathetic title character in the last few decades of film.The fact I'm using the phrase ""least ambitious"" for a comedy film reminds me of a group of films in the last years that have also stopped trying. Parody films. They have been drab, tiresome works of dreck, glazed with immaturity and held together by such a simple, lackluster plot it almost doesn't matter. It becomes a competition for how many pop culture references can we throw into one film.The same thing sort of occurs in Bucky Larson. It's a competition to see how many unconvincing gags we can put this pathetically embarrassing protagonist in. The story centers around a misfit with an annoying overbite named Bucky Larson (Swardson). Upon discovering his parents are ex-porn star legends, he travels to Hollywood, hoping that since he is the son (hopefully) of two icons he can make a living as one as well.Let me say there is nothing funny about a man-child who pulls down his pants in front of a camera, grunting, moaning, and screaming before ejaculating. Absolutely, positively nothing funny about that scenario. Yet the film does it three, if not four times within its ninety minute runtime. If it's not funny the first time, it definitely won't be the second, the third, or even the forth time around.Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star didn't upset me as much as some would think. It actually was rather typical of Happy Madison. We've seen this goofy, oddball style before. But that is no excuse for a terrible movie. The jokes are terribly flat, the lead character we are expected to sympathize with is wretched in his presentation, the setups are typical, the writing is labored, and we are offered nothing new in the terms of layout or formula. It's a movie experience of deplorable, unforgivable quality.Starring: Nick Swardson, Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, and Stephen Dorff.

The oddball lead character – who looks like the love child between Prince Valliant and a beaver -- is as annoying as nails on a chalkboard. The CIA should use outtakes of him for torturing confessions out of terrorists. The film's ongoing orgasm/ejaculation shtick is utterly tasteless and just makes you queasy. This is the most pathetic waste of celluloid I've seen in a very long time.This box office flop must have come straight out of one a Sandler's pubescent wet dreams.",nothing funny about this piece idiocy,scientists say that nature abhors vacuum but comedic vacuum has managed survive inside mind adam sandler his co creators this film doesnt stop at bottom barrel its sheer stupidity but lands about three floors below barrel it is miscatagorized as comedy because theres absolutely nothing funny about it oddball lead character who looks like love child between prince valliant beaver is as annoying as nails chalkboard cia should use outtakes him torturing confessions out terrorists films ongoing orgasm ejaculation shtick is utterly tasteless just makes you queasy this is most pathetic waste celluloid ive seen very long time this box office flop must have come straight out one sandlers pubescent wet dreams,0.6041176470588235,-0.10480392156862746,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.48}"
