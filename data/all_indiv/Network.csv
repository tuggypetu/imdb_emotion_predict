,"It Is More Than a Film, It Is Like a Crystal Ball","""Network"". If there was ever a film that foreshadowed to events of the future it would be ""Network"". Much like ""Midnight Cowboy"" seven years earlier, ""Network"" was hailed because it took risks and it was like nothing that the cinema had ever experienced before. Both films were great when they were initially released, but few great films become so much better with time like ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Network"". The fictional fourth network of 1976 is UBS. Ratings are bad and the network desperately needs some new show to give them a boost to challenge NBC, CBS, and ABC. Enter the network's national news anchorman (Peter Finch in his posthumous Oscar-winning role). He, like the network, is going through a crossroads. His wife has just passed away, he is about to be fired, and he is slowly losing his mind. The firing is imminent and he decides that he will announce to the world that he will commit suicide on his last evening news broadcast. Of course a national frenzy starts, but Finch surprises all by showing just how crazy he is. Instead of committing suicide, he goes on the air and becomes a modern-day Moses to some with crazed ravings and outlandish statements that really are just the ramblings of a man slowly spinning out-of-control. Faye Dunaway (Oscar-winning) and Robert Duvall are the key people at the network who find a way to market Finch and boost anemic ratings. Finch is given a variety show which could be best described as ""The Tonight Show"" gone stark-raving mad. He gets on stage and basically says whatever is on his mind and the crowds love it. Co-worker and close personal friend William Holden (Oscar-nominated) knows that Finch is out of control, but cannot do anything and eventually is let go due to his disapproval and interference. Holden though has fallen in love, or lust, with the unfeeling Dunaway. Wife Beatrice Straight (in an Oscar-winning performance in which she has less than 10 minutes of screen-time) learns of what is going on and more trouble ensues for Holden on the home-front. Finch meanwhile continues his ravings as he hears voices in his head telling him what he must do each time he is asked to perform. Soon his act grows stale as the public tires of his antics and the network must always defend speeches that they themselves do not really understand. Finch's ""15 minutes"" of fame eventually come to an end, but not in the conventional way that one may think. ""Network"" is a cinematic masterpiece because it is so strong in the major elements of the industry. The acting is exceptional. There were five performing nominations from this film (Ned Beatty was the fifth) and three wins. The only other film to accomplish that was ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" from 1951. Sidney Lumet was great before this film, but he became even greater afterwards. This is arguably his greatest directing job. The screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky is one of the smartest ever written. It is insightful and has a real depth to it. ""Network"" was looked upon as a sort of ""far-fetched black comedy"" in 1976. However, ""Network"" is a film that is all too realistic 25 years later. In many ways the fictional UBS station is much like the FOX station which came on the air in the late-1980s and stole audiences with wild shows that were quite different from the other three networks. Reality television, perverted talk shows, and other types of variety programming run wild today. ""Network"" did not have much to do with all this occurring, but it is like those who worked on the film had a crystal ball into the future. A great movie that becomes greater as time passes. 5 stars out of 5.",it is more than film it is like crystal ball,network if there was ever film that foreshadowed events future it would be network much like midnight cowboy seven years earlier network was hailed because it took risks it was like nothing that cinema had ever experienced before both films were great when they were initially released but few great films become so much better with time like midnight cowboy network fictional fourth network 1976 is ubs ratings are bad network desperately needs some new show give them boost challenge nbc cbs abc enter networks national news anchorman peter finch his posthumous oscar winning role he like network is going through crossroads his wife has just passed away he is about be fired he is slowly losing his mind firing is imminent he decides that he will announce world that he will commit suicide his last evening news broadcast course national frenzy starts but finch surprises all by showing just how crazy he is instead committing suicide he goes air becomes modern day moses some with crazed ravings outlandish statements that really are just ramblings man slowly spinning out control faye dunaway oscar winning robert duvall are key people at network who find way market finch boost anemic ratings finch is given variety show which could be best described as tonight show gone stark raving mad he gets stage basically says whatever is his mind crowds love it co worker close personal friend william holden oscar nominated knows that finch is out control but cannot do anything eventually is let go due his disapproval interference holden though has fallen love or lust with unfeeling dunaway wife beatrice straight oscar winning performance which she has less than 10 minutes screen time learns what is going more trouble ensues holden home front finch meanwhile continues his ravings as he hears voices his head telling him what he must do each time he is asked perform soon his act grows stale as public tires his antics network must always defend speeches that they themselves do not really understand finchs 15 minutes fame eventually come end but not conventional way that one may think network is cinematic masterpiece because it is so strong major elements industry acting is exceptional there were five performing nominations this film ned beatty was fifth three wins only other film accomplish that was streetcar named desire 1951 sidney lumet was great before this film but he became even greater afterwards this is arguably his greatest directing job screenplay by paddy chayefsky is one smartest ever written it is insightful has real depth it network was looked upon as sort far fetched black comedy 1976 however network is film that is all too realistic 25 years later many ways fictional ubs station is much like fox station which came air late 1980s stole audiences with wild shows that were quite different other three networks reality television perverted talk shows other types variety programming run wild today network did not have much do with all this occurring but it is like those who worked film had crystal ball into future great movie that becomes greater as time passes 5 stars out 5,0.46200514461384024,0.13882066001631213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,The Age of Network,"Thirty years after its release to public praise and multiple Oscar wins, Network is one of those films that instead of dating badly or becoming a product of its time has actually grown and become even more relevant today, and if it were re-released in 2006 for its actual thirtieth anniversary not on film but on national television right at the beginning of the fall season (complete with the most lurid reality TV shows and inane TV pleasers), it would only become more justified in its story.The story of the failing network that didn't have a show on the Nielsen Top 20 and resorted to extreme measures to ensure that this changed seems so today: we see how channels that once had failing ratings churned out shock television right smack in the daytime while still applying Standard and Practices to other ""prime-time"" shows that could be taken the ""wrong"" way. Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Rikki Lake, Oprah, Mark Burnett, MTV -- they're all here under different guises, all competing to have their voices heard on television, all eventually becoming as ratings-hungry and establishment-friendly as the CEOs running the show.Today we don't quite have Howard Beales ranting and raving about the ills of society on national TV (although they do ""tell"" us how we should feel, when we should laugh if we're too stupid to get the joke, who to vote for, the ""truth"" about the tobacco industry). Today media is all the rage and televises even a fart if it deems it interesting and guarantees more viewers. Today shows like ""20/20"" or ""60 Minutes"" bring us 'exclusives' even if it's at the cost of journalistic integrity. And now, with 'reality TV' still the dominating novel trend even in little-seen cable channels, creating stereotypes in leaps and bounds while claiming authenticity of the events depicted, there hasn't yet been a need to create a lunatic who could sermonize everything and make us Mad as Hell. On this aspect alone NETWORK has dated: the 70s were all about counterculture, anti-establishment, revolution, leftists, Patty Hearsts, Lennon and Yoko, ""Nova"", the Mansons, the hippies, the Earth-lovers, the militants. Nowadays, buff bodies parade themselves in shows containing outlandish competitions where eating the most grotesque concoctions are the norm, or enduring a barrage of extreme insults has become entertainment (i. e. ""American Idol"") and the very concept of dignity flies out the window. Of course, after signing an extensive release form in which they free the network of all responsibilities if something goes wrong because we all know networks can't be held liable for any faux pas. In short, nowadays people from all over try to become the next It person and outlast their 15 minutes of fame. Nowadays, everyone has their own reality TV show depicting their 24 hour day activities. I wonder if Diana Christensen isn't alive and well and exerting absolute control over the networks in general, bringing anything and everything that can garner a little bit of shock value (Boy Meets Boy, or any reality TV self-made ""villain/villainess"") and eventual ratings, taking over actual scripted shows with real actors.NETWORK is a powerful movie of which I can't praise enough about even if its screenplay, by Paddy Chayefsky is a little too verbose. No one talks the way he makes his characters talk, using impassioned speeches with big, even archaic, words, and more than once the script makes the characters go completely over the top but even then it makes its point. Of the actors, William Holden's quiet portrayal of a former television exec, Max Schumacher, who has a conscience, but still feels some attraction to danger and risks his own family to experience is who is at the heart of this crazy story who was ahead of its time. Peter Finch's Howard Beale never comes through enough as a real human being: just someone who was pushed too hard and decided to shut down for the remainder of his life. But Holden holds the moral glue of the story, and interestingly enough, is wise to know that his affair, perfectly scripted as he even states, will end on a high note -- he'll return to his sanity and his wife, and Diana Christensen will bask in her own executive madness, since this is all she knows and holds dear. In her last words -- ""Let's kill the son of a bitch."" -- she informs us this is all she is about without so much as batting an eye. Who comes, who goes, is irrelevant to her, as long as the network can be number one. And that is the inhuman reality of television -- a media directed to entertain humans.",age network,thirty years after its release public praise multiple oscar wins network is one those films that instead dating badly or becoming product its time has actually grown become even more relevant today if it were re released 2006 its actual thirtieth anniversary not film but national television right at beginning fall season complete with most lurid reality tv shows inane tv pleasers it would only become more justified its story story failing network that didnt have show nielsen top 20 resorted extreme measures ensure that this changed seems so today we see how channels that once had failing ratings churned out shock television right smack daytime while still applying standard practices other prime time shows that could be taken wrong way jerry springer maury povich rikki lake oprah mark burnett mtv theyre all here under different guises all competing have their voices heard television all eventually becoming as ratings hungry establishment friendly as ceos running show today we dont quite have howard beales ranting raving about ills society national tv although they do tell us how we should feel when we should laugh if were too stupid get joke who vote truth about tobacco industry today media is all rage televises even fart if it deems it interesting guarantees more viewers today shows like 20 20 or 60 minutes bring us exclusives even if its at cost journalistic integrity now with reality tv still dominating novel trend even little seen cable channels creating stereotypes leaps bounds while claiming authenticity events depicted there hasnt yet been need create lunatic who could sermonize everything make us mad as hell this aspect alone network has dated 70s were all about counterculture anti establishment revolution leftists patty hearsts lennon yoko nova mansons hippies earth lovers militants nowadays buff bodies parade themselves shows containing outlandish competitions where eating most grotesque concoctions are norm or enduring barrage extreme insults has become entertainment i e american idol very concept dignity flies out window course after signing extensive release form which they free network all responsibilities if something goes wrong because we all know networks cant be held liable any faux pas short nowadays people all over try become next it person outlast their 15 minutes fame nowadays everyone has their own reality tv show depicting their 24 hour day activities i wonder if diana christensen isnt alive well exerting absolute control over networks general bringing anything everything that can garner little bit shock value boy meets boy or any reality tv self made villain villainess eventual ratings taking over actual scripted shows with real actors network is powerful movie which i cant praise enough about even if its screenplay by paddy chayefsky is little too verbose no one talks way he makes his characters talk using impassioned speeches with big even archaic words more than once script makes characters go completely over top but even then it makes its point actors william holdens quiet portrayal former television exec max schumacher who has conscience but still feels some attraction danger risks his own family experience is who is at heart this crazy story who was ahead its time peter finchs howard beale never comes through enough as real human being just someone who was pushed too hard decided shut down remainder his life but holden holds moral glue story interestingly enough is wise know that his affair perfectly scripted as he even states will end high note hell return his sanity his wife diana christensen will bask her own executive madness since this is all she knows holds dear her last words lets kill son bitch she informs us this is all she is about without so much as batting eye who comes who goes is irrelevant her as long as network can be number one that is inhuman reality television media directed entertain humans,0.5212372254838008,0.10132474450967602,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,One of the best of all time.,"I can't put it more perfectly than Turner Classic Movies' Robert Osborne who said ""What was originally a satire is a stinging mirror of television news today."" I strain to think of a film that is a more brilliant take on society, and all of the flaws it has. It's obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.It couldn't be more related to today. Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become, but it stays on the air because people don't want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then, but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can't even tell they're acting. It feels like you're watching these people in their daily lives, interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time. I could write 20 more pages about it's brilliance, but I'll stop now to keep me from rating. I just have to say that it's so rare to find a film as incredibly flawless as this.",one best all time,i cant put it more perfectly than turner classic movies robert osborne who said what was originally satire is stinging mirror television news today i strain think film that is more brilliant take society all flaws it has its obedience entertainment by those who rebel no matter how insane they are exploitation those peril any kind economic profit fact that everything beale preaches is completely true completely bashes people who are producing him i was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing rant about how terrible people he works are fact that they just keep him air because they want ratings it couldnt be more related today turn news you see videos how horrific war terror is how horrific american society has become but it stays air because people dont want see good things life they care about bad corrupt people must have laughed it off back then but it was such foreshadow near future performances are just as brilliant as social commentary each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you cant even tell theyre acting it feels like youre watching these people their daily lives interacting becoming more more corrupt finch dunaway easily give two greatest performances all time i could write 20 more pages about its brilliance but ill stop now keep me rating i just have say that its so rare find film as incredibly flawless as this,0.5954365079365079,0.18115079365079362,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,"""The World Is A Business, Mr. Beale""","In 1976 when this film came out, there was no cable television, no internet, no cell phones. All that existed, apart from newspapers and radio, were three or four ""broadcast"" television channels. Since then, technology has exploded with a cornucopia of communication devices. Which renders the story in ""Network"" painfully dated. And yet ...The story's theme is as valid now as it was thirty-three years ago. The theme is that the ratings business has corrupted television, because ad revenue, and therefore profit, is tied to the ratings. Programs and events then, and now, get aired if, and only if, they are likely to result in high ratings. It's all very seamy, very dishonorable, very shabby, and very relevant to today's world of ten thousand channels.Though most of the characters in ""Network"" end up being corrupted by television, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is one who does not. His vision is pure. And he speaks the truth: ""... television is an ... amusement park ... a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of ... story tellers ... jugglers, sideshow freaks ... and football players ... You're never going to get any truth from us (television) ... We lie like hell ... We deal in illusions, none of it is true. But you people ... believe the illusions ... You do whatever the tube tells you ... you even think like the tube"". Worse yet, people elect their leaders based on how they look and sound, and how their words are interpreted by boob tube ""pundits"".""Network"" is a film wherein thematic import is conveyed almost entirely through dialogue. Some of the dialogue devolves into speechifying, which may come across to viewers as preachy. Still, the film's message was highly prophetic. Except for the film's climax, everything predicted in this film has already happened. And credit should go to script writer Paddy Chayefsky for his futuristic vision.Some parts of the film seem superfluous in retrospect, like the romance between two main characters. But the film has a sense of realism, helped along by the use of technical jargon and a general absence of background music. The film's technical elements, including direction, casting, acting, editing, and cinematography, are fine.As social commentary, ""Network"" is one of the best films ever made, despite a dated, time-bound, story. That ""there are no nations, only currency"" is becoming increasingly obvious, and as Ned Beatty's arrogant character explains in a frighteningly ominous tone: ""The world is a business, Mr. Beale"".",world is business mr beale,1976 when this film came out there was no cable television no internet no cell phones all that existed apart newspapers radio were three or four broadcast television channels since then technology has exploded with cornucopia communication devices which renders story network painfully dated yet storys theme is as valid now as it was thirty three years ago theme is that ratings business has corrupted television because ad revenue therefore profit is tied ratings programs events then now get aired if only if they are likely result high ratings its all very seamy very dishonorable very shabby very relevant todays world ten thousand channels though most characters network end up being corrupted by television howard beale peter finch is one who does not his vision is pure he speaks truth television is amusement park circus carnival traveling troupe story tellers jugglers sideshow freaks football players youre never going get any truth us television we lie like hell we deal illusions none it is true but you people believe illusions you do whatever tube tells you you even think like tube worse yet people elect their leaders based how they look sound how their words are interpreted by boob tube pundits network is film wherein thematic import is conveyed almost entirely through dialogue some dialogue devolves into speechifying which may come across viewers as preachy still films message was highly prophetic except films climax everything predicted this film has already happened credit should go script writer paddy chayefsky his futuristic vision some parts film seem superfluous retrospect like romance between two main characters but film has sense realism helped along by use technical jargon general absence background music films technical elements including direction casting acting editing cinematography are fine as social commentary network is one best films ever made despite dated time bound story that there are no nations only currency is becoming increasingly obvious as ned beattys arrogant character explains frighteningly ominous tone world is business mr beale,0.4940909090909091,0.12449855699855696,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.52}"
9.0,Prescient...,"It is the only word I can come up with to describe this masterfully savage satire, and IMHO, it's the only word that need be used.Once I had seen ALTERED STATES and read the novel, I was hungry to find out more about the late novelist/playwright/screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, and sought out this movie. It blew me away years ago, but I find it even more stunning now. Not just because of the writing, Sidney Lumet's taut direction or the Oscar-caliber performances by everyone involved, all of which are almost beyond being lauded with superlatives.But what knocks me out is how Chayefsky seemed less to be writing from the power of his imagination, than channeling Our Times Now. As if he was capable of some form of mental time travel; able to look into the Nineties and beyond to see the coming of SURVIVOR, or Maury Povich, Jerry Springer, Bill O'Reilly and Paris Hilton. Even HE probably didn't know how he knew, but he sure as hell felt it and wrote it down for us to marvel over today.Sure, there are political and cultural analogies throughout the picture that are dated. But the core of his vision remains startlingly clear and eerily prophetic. As for Howard Beale, there is not one single ""celebrity"" who mirrors that character today, but maybe he is a composite of several different personalities with whom we have become all too familiar in the world of ""news-fo-tainment."" Or maybe he simply hasn't materialized yet. Maybe that is just how far ahead of its time NETWORK really was.After all, being ""mad as hell"" nowadays has so many more layers of meaning than it did nearly thirty years ago...",prescient,it is only word i can come up with describe this masterfully savage satire imho its only word that need be used once i had seen altered states read novel i was hungry find out more about late novelist playwright screenwriter paddy chayefsky sought out this movie it blew me away years ago but i find it even more stunning now not just because writing sidney lumets taut direction or oscar caliber performances by everyone involved all which are almost beyond being lauded with superlatives but what knocks me out is how chayefsky seemed less be writing power his imagination than channeling our times now as if he was capable some form mental time travel able look into nineties beyond see coming survivor or maury povich jerry springer bill oreilly paris hilton even he probably didnt know how he knew but he sure as hell felt it wrote it down us marvel over today sure there are political cultural analogies throughout picture that are dated but core his vision remains startlingly clear eerily prophetic as howard beale there is not one single celebrity who mirrors that character today but maybe he is composite several different personalities with whom we have become all too familiar world news fo tainment or maybe he simply hasnt materialized yet maybe that is just how far ahead its time network really was after all being mad as hell nowadays has so many more layers meaning than it did nearly thirty years ago,0.5290391156462585,0.16986961451247165,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9.0,A Great Film About 20 Years After & Before It Was Needed,"This film though not noticed enough now, is one of the great films. Peter Finch put just about everything he has into Howard Biel. In fact he died of a heart attack after the film was released and he was out promoting it. Certain films have impact, and this one still does.In a way, this is a higher budget, bigger star update of the 1950's film ""A Face In The Crowd"" starring Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Howard Biel is very much the character Lonsome Rhodes was in that film. The difference is that while the earlier film went totally off the deep end, this one stops at just the right spot. The issue Howard Biel highlights here of Foreign Money and Big Corporations and Big Government taking over the world and screwing the little person- well let's fast forward to when it happened after the movie was made.When Government decided it had to tax Senior Citizens Social Security benefits for starters as this requires some Senior Citizens as high as in their 90's to have to file income taxes. Then they are paying taxes on top of benefits they earned that were already taxed.Then in the 1990's, Howard Biel would have come in handy when NAFTA passed by a corrupt Federal Government, which had started in 1986 to offshore jobs by changing the Federal Tax Code, the working man needed someone to stand up and say ""We're Mad As Hell and we're not going to take this anymore!"" Black people needed it when a huge Federal Program threw thousands of blacks in jail during the 1990's too. Then when the Big Banks talked a willingly corrupt government in the 1990's into deregulating them, removing restrictions FDR put in place to prevent the system from another 1929 meltdown, we needed Biel again.Then in the 2000's, when big drug companies bribed a government into passing a drug law that made them wealthy and then allowed them to put out dangerous new drugs like ""opoids"" without regard with what they do to the public? Of course then 2 political parties who have disregarded any chance of term limits and have made themselves rich by sucking the taxpayers dry like kittens do their mom-ma cat?Could a real Howard Biel have really done anything about that? Unfortunately the answer is no, because the big corporations, big money, mass media and corrupt governments appear to have won since this movie was made. Even though there are 2 great films warning us this could happen, we are at a point today where a whole lot of little people are no longer counted in a system that is rigged.Yes, we should be ""Mad as Hell"" about it, but the out of touch media and those kittens living in a glass bubble still have not woken up as reality is being more hidden today than it was in 1976.With William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and a huge cast, Sidney Lumet brings off a classic here that even has cameos from John Chancellor and Walter Cronkite. This movie portrays things as they are. Heed the warning, and educate yourselves as to what has happened since 1976. Even today's protesters need to watch this to really understand what they are doing, and why.",great film about 20 years after before it was needed,this film though not noticed enough now is one great films peter finch put just about everything he has into howard biel fact he died heart attack after film was released he was out promoting it certain films have impact this one still does way this is higher budget bigger star update 1950s film face crowd starring andy griffith patricia neal howard biel is very much character lonsome rhodes was that film difference is that while earlier film went totally off deep end this one stops at just right spot issue howard biel highlights here foreign money big corporations big government taking over world screwing little person well lets fast forward when it happened after movie was made when government decided it had tax senior citizens social security benefits starters as this requires some senior citizens as high as their 90s have file income taxes then they are paying taxes top benefits they earned that were already taxed then 1990s howard biel would have come handy when nafta passed by corrupt federal government which had started 1986 offshore jobs by changing federal tax code working man needed someone stand up say were mad as hell were not going take this anymore black people needed it when huge federal program threw thousands blacks jail during 1990s too then when big banks talked willingly corrupt government 1990s into deregulating them removing restrictions fdr put place prevent system another 1929 meltdown we needed biel again then 2000s when big drug companies bribed government into passing drug law that made them wealthy then allowed them put out dangerous new drugs like opoids without regard with what they do public course then 2 political parties who have disregarded any chance term limits have made themselves rich by sucking taxpayers dry like kittens do their mom ma cat could real howard biel have really done anything about that unfortunately answer is no because big corporations big money mass media corrupt governments appear have won since this movie was made even though there are 2 great films warning us this could happen we are at point today where whole lot little people are no longer counted system that is rigged yes we should be mad as hell about it but out touch media those kittens living glass bubble still have not woken up as reality is being more hidden today than it was 1976 with william holden faye dunaway huge cast sidney lumet brings off classic here that even has cameos john chancellor walter cronkite this movie portrays things as they are heed warning educate yourselves as what has happened since 1976 even todays protesters need watch this really understand what they are doing why,0.5060670995670996,0.06662727272727273,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,"We Have Seen the Future, And It Sucks","This movie came out when I was nine years old, and I saw it on network TV the following year, lured by the brouhaha that surrounded the use of the ""barnyard epithet"" during prime time. I loved this movie before I understood it, and I worship it now. Like ""Elmer Gantry"" or ""1984,"" it's a work of didactic art that only fails on an imaginative level -- Sinclair Lewis couldn't grasp how debased evangelism would become, Orwell couldn't foresee the excesses of Mao or Pol Pot, and Chayevsky couldn't envision the absolute decline of television from a vast wasteland to a malevolent sewer. Fox News, reality TV, even the OJ chase, ""Network"" anticipates every vile bit of it.Now, it's ridiculously overwritten -- NO ONE is as articulate as the characters in this film, and most certainly, no one who works in television is as literate as Diana Christensen (the Faye Dunaway character). I doubt that poet laureates or even Eminem could spew as witty an aside as ""muttering mutilated Marxism."" But damn if that isn't part of its charm. Plus, outside of Max Schumacher (William Holden), the characters are pretty much archetypes instead of real people (the Robert Duvall character might as well wear a black cape and top hat), but their two-dimensionality works as a good metaphor for Max's seduction into the ""shrieking nothingness"" or television. Plus the actors are so superb they make screeching caricatures into almost-sympathetic characters: Duvall is a credible and charismatic villain, Finch is a fine mad prophet and Faye Dunaway manages to make a shrill, manipulative, soulless neurotic so damn cute and sexy you'll want to leave your wife for her, too, just as long as she promises to keep sitting cross-legged on your desk and hitching up her skirt. (Therein lies the real eroticism, forget the intentionally mechanical, unerotic coupling later in the flick).

9.0,"""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" - Howard Beale","#1 Best Film of 1976'Network' is Paddy Chafesky's riveting and grim tale of the sleaze surrounding the American television industry. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, 'Network' is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and meaningful films ever made. One of the reasons 'Network' was so well received by both film critics and movie-going audiences was because it possessed a certain quality that most films unfortunately lack -- intricate and involving characters in realistic situations. 'Network' definitely makes my list of the top 10 films of the 70s, and it's an absolute shame it didn't pick up the well-deserved 'Best Picture' Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1976.The film follows a low-rated television network trying to keep it's head above water. The network, UBS, has decided to fire an aging veteran news anchor, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), in an act of desperation to boost ratings. Beale is given a two-week notice, and instead of going out with his tale between his legs, Beale announces on live television he was fired and is going to kill himself. This raises panic and chaos at UBS, until they get the memo that Beale's crazed rant just bumped the ratings significantly. The UBS execs, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) decide to give Beale his own show where he complains and screams bout the problems with the world, while Beale's best friend (William Holden) feels it's inappropriate for the network to take advantage of a mentally-ill man. Besides exploiting a mentally unstable man, the company execs also work out a weekly program with a anti-establishment African-American communist, Laureen Hobbs (Marlene Warfield) following political terrorists and their violent outbursts.The film also stars Beatrice Straight as Schumacher's boring wife, Conchetta Ferrell was an assistant working for the network and Ned Beatty who plays the sinister boss of the UBS television network who always gets what he wants.'Network' boasts one of the finest and most intricate screenplays ever written that rightfully earned Paddy Chafesky the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Sidney Lumet's directing is absolutely incendiary and the movie has an incredibly strong cast. Faye Dunaway gives what is perhaps her very best screen performance as the cutthroat Network executive, while Robert Duvall is just as brilliant as the ruthless Frank Hackett (which should have earned him an Oscar nomination, period!) Beatrice Straight is solid in her role (not quite Oscar-worthy if you ask me, though) and Marlene Warfield is just as great as the sassy pinko sistah (excuse me for that phrasing). The two performers who really steal the show however are William Holden and Peter Finch. Both nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards in 1977, Peter Finch gives a startling and powerful performance as the 'mad-as-hell' (not to mention crazy-as-hell) Howard Beale, while William Holden gives a subtle but none-the-less outstanding performance as the conflicted Max Schumacher. It's hard to say who was better, but if I absolutely had to decide I'd choose Holden's non-Oscar-winning performance slightly over Finch's sympathy Oscar-winning performance (he still was extraordinary,m though). I honestly believe if Finch hadn't died just after the film, Holden would have taken home the Oscar gold for Best Leading Actor, both were still magnificent though. The only player in the cast that I felt wasn't that great was Ned Beatty. In a role far-deserving from an Oscar nomination (which he for some odd reason received), Beatty plays the angry little man role he always does. Besides Beatty's performance and marginal pacing problems towards the middle (you are gonna get that in any 70s film that isn't a Kubrick film), the movie is utterly perfect.I can't recommend you seeing 'Network' highly enough. If you want a carefully made motion picture that makes you think and reflect on how cutthroat our society has become (especially TV broadcasting), 'Network' is a absolute must. What are you waiting for, go out and rent 'Network'! It might just alter your perspective on things.

9.0,"Only surprise is, it wasn't cynical enough","I recently rewatched this movie I've seen at least a dozen times and capture something new every time. It's a complete no holds barred hollowing out of the television industry, and, while television isn't the all looming force it once was (500 channels as opposed to around 7 including PBS and VHF and UHF at the time of this movie, depending on location), it still has much to say about the dissociation from reality that viewing things on a screen can create, especially when what you're witnessing is designed for the most craven response.Plot is quite simple: long time news anchor (Howard Beale) has breakdown after being fired and loses it on air, bigwigs (Diana Christensen) notice said breakdown brought in more ratings than ever before and nurture this tendency until a monster is created that is against their best interests ($$) and now must destroy this monster. All in the way this is portrayed is what makes it so much more.This is a deeply cynical movie, and quite prescient. A few years after this movie, the TV world was going to experience crudity on levels it had never imagined before. Morton Downey Jr. to Geraldo would usher in an age of the normalization of TV as spectacle, prurience and depravity we are very much still engaged in today. The kernel of the idea of capturing eyeballs with such content has simply been even more economically fine-tuned by other mediums, especially the Internet. Want to see beheadings, torture porn or video of people being shot to death? Sure you do. Diana predicted it. The natural progression of major character Diana's ideas are present for all to see. Only, it may not have been cynical enough in some ways. Could they have predicted reality TV? Or the endless line of meaninglessly competitive shows like Cupcake Wars? Jackass? At the beginning, it even toys with the idea of 'The Death Hour', filled with suicides and assassinations and car wrecks. We haven't seen anyone purposely killed on live TV to get ratings by a network, to my knowledge, but I doubt that is far away based on current trajectory.Not to mention the brilliant critique of business by Arthur Jensen's (Ned Beatty) epic speech to Howard Beale. We are all just a subsidiary to business interests, AS IT SHOULD BE. The richest 1% own half the world's wealth. This was not an accident or survival of the fittest in a meritocracy, this was planned from the inception.While the dialogue is brilliant, this dialogue is meant to convey ideas, not especially to capture how people really talk in various situations. It is more theatric than realistic. That brings us to probably the weakest part of the movie, the romantic aspect. It plays a parallel plot to the main one, and while it does serve to show that Diana is a 'Humanoid' in Beale's terms-seemingly human, but not really-it's also the weakest element. Hence, the lack of one star.A point must be made about Faye Dunaway. This is her greatest movie. Bonnie and Clyde may have opened the door, but this broke it down. She encapsulates the inherent cynicism and calculating nature of Diana Chirstensen (play on offspring of Christ?) with near perfection. Her sheer physical presence is something to behold as well. From her impossibly high cheekbones to her lithe figure wrapped in chic 70's elegance, she steals every scene she's in. Just do yourself a favor and don't look up her more recent pics, plastic surgery is not her friend.Will young people like this movie? Not if they want a fist bumping silly night, but if they sense they are being manipulated and want to know why, this is one place that was at ground zero.",only surprise is it wasnt cynical enough,i recently rewatched this movie ive seen at least dozen times capture something new every time its complete no holds barred hollowing out television industry while television isnt all looming force it once was 500 channels as opposed around 7 including pbs vhf uhf at time this movie depending location it still has much say about dissociation reality that viewing things screen can create especially when what youre witnessing is designed most craven response plot is quite simple long time news anchor howard beale has breakdown after being fired loses it air bigwigs diana christensen notice said breakdown brought more ratings than ever before nurture this tendency until monster is created that is against their best interests now must destroy this monster all way this is portrayed is what makes it so much more this is deeply cynical movie quite prescient few years after this movie tv world was going experience crudity levels it had never imagined before morton downey jr geraldo would usher age normalization tv as spectacle prurience depravity we are very much still engaged today kernel idea capturing eyeballs with such content has simply been even more economically fine tuned by other mediums especially internet want see beheadings torture porn or video people being shot death sure you do diana predicted it natural progression major character dianas ideas are present all see only it may not have been cynical enough some ways could they have predicted reality tv or endless line meaninglessly competitive shows like cupcake wars jackass at beginning it even toys with idea death hour filled with suicides assassinations car wrecks we havent seen anyone purposely killed live tv get ratings by network my knowledge but i doubt that is far away based current trajectory not mention brilliant critique business by arthur jensens ned beatty epic speech howard beale we are all just subsidiary business interests as it should be richest 1 own half worlds wealth this was not accident or survival fittest meritocracy this was planned inception while dialogue is brilliant this dialogue is meant convey ideas not especially capture how people really talk various situations it is more theatric than realistic that brings us probably weakest part movie romantic aspect it plays parallel plot main one while it does serve show that diana is humanoid beales terms seemingly human but not really its also weakest element hence lack one star point must be made about faye dunaway this is her greatest movie bonnie clyde may have opened door but this broke it down she encapsulates inherent cynicism calculating nature diana chirstensen play offspring christ with near perfection her sheer physical presence is something behold as well her impossibly high cheekbones her lithe figure wrapped chic 70s elegance she steals every scene shes just do yourself favor dont look up her more recent pics plastic surgery is not her friend will young people like this movie not if they want fist bumping silly night but if they sense they are being manipulated want know why this is one place that was at ground zero,0.5238302942848396,0.08459098561371291,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,A Prophet known as Paddy Chayefsky,"To think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 could only means two things: 1) Nothing has changed or 2) Paddy Chayefsky was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. I endorse the later of the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn't born yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature, etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives Chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb, superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man, the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent in her thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive, Beatrice Straight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable film from the 70's. Sidney Lumet proves once more that he's as good as his material.

10.0,A rare honest movie,"""Network"" is a fantastic movie that illustrates just how the ""mob"" and the media can exploit even the best intentions for mutual profit.Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an on-air personality that, after finding he is not bankable anymore, snaps and starts to speak his own uncensored, and highly inflammable commentary about the hypocrisy of modern life.In his mad-hatter routine, somehow he sparks his audience's interest, and in a twist of fame finds himself, the not bankable as prime market share for prime time television. And naturally, his bosses and those who stand to profit from his actions, use his fame to better their own cause.Beale's rise to stardom is only one facet of this intricate story about how the mob influences media. Throughout ""Network"" we as the audience are constantly shown, to nausea, how ruthless popularity and trend mold what we see as consumers of entertainment. Most of the main characters are in fact trapped in their roles - and powerless to the bottom line, which is that media relies on advertisement and ratings to generate revenue.In fact, I believe that is what the point of ""Network"" is - this movie shows us, that ""news"" is entertainment, and how we as viewers (whichever demographic you are) are willing to suspend all common sense, class, independence, honor, integrity for a few moments of triumph or more pragmatically, how we relish tragedy.""Network"" is too heavy for most people - it is meant for people who do not like TV, who think that product placement is ridiculous, and in general do not like to think of themselves as a ""market"". If you need your reality spoon fed to you, this movie is not for you.However, if you have had enough, and wish to feel for a moment like you are an empowered free thinker, i would humbly suggest that this movie is for you.",rare honest movie,network is fantastic movie that illustrates just how mob media can exploit even best intentions mutual profit howard beale peter finch is air personality that after finding he is not bankable anymore snaps starts speak his own uncensored highly inflammable commentary about hypocrisy modern life his mad hatter routine somehow he sparks his audiences interest twist fame finds himself not bankable as prime market share prime time television naturally his bosses those who stand profit his actions use his fame better their own cause beales rise stardom is only one facet this intricate story about how mob influences media throughout network we as audience are constantly shown nausea how ruthless popularity trend mold what we see as consumers entertainment most main characters are fact trapped their roles powerless bottom line which is that media relies advertisement ratings generate revenue fact i believe that is what point network is this movie shows us that news is entertainment how we as viewers whichever demographic you are are willing suspend all common sense class independence honor integrity few moments triumph or more pragmatically how we relish tragedy network is too heavy most people it is meant people who do not like tv who think that product placement is ridiculous general do not like think themselves as market if you need your reality spoon fed you this movie is not you however if you have had enough wish feel moment like you are empowered free thinker i would humbly suggest that this movie is you,0.6157471264367815,0.11270114942528733,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.54}"
10.0,Eerily prescient classic,"""I'M MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!""One of the most famous lines in film history is as impactful today as it was when it was first uttered by fictitious news anchor Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's (seemingly) parody of where TV and TV news is heading, 1976's NETWORK.The astonishing thing about this terrific motion picture is how prescient it is. News is now entertainment. Appeal to the disaffected masses. Drive our message to the viewers. Be provocative. The 6:00 news had ""less than 1 minute of hard news, the rest was sex, scandal, brutal crime sports, children with incurable diseases and lost puppies.""Sound familiar? This isn't from today, it came from this movie that was made 42 years ago as a cautionary tale of what might happen.Besides the social ramifications, how does this film hold up? Quite well, indeed. A rare 10 star BankofMarquis film. Starting with the great Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar winning Screenplay. This was the capper on a brilliant career from Chayefsky - who also won Oscar's for his screenplay for 1972's THE HOSPITAL (I'll have to check that one out) and 1956's MARTY.What does a terrific screenplay do? It attracts top-level talent clamoring to be in this - and they all deliver. Start with Faye Dunaway who won the Lead Actress Oscar for her role as Entertainment Head Diane Christensen - a driven, work hard, play hard individual who has the idea to make news ""entertainment"". Lost in the fog of time (and MOMMIE DEAREST) is the fact that in the mid-1970's, Dunaway was, perhaps, the greatest leading actress of the day and her skills are in sharp display in this film.Joining Dunaway in terrific supporting turns are Robert Duvall, following his turns as Tom Hagen in GODFATHER I and II, as network head, Frank Hackett, Ned Beatty as Ned Jennings, President of the company that owns the network - he has a speech towards the tail end of this film that is as good - both in performance and in the way that it is shot - as anything put upon the screen - it was masterful. Speaking of masterful, Beatrice Straight won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in one of the shortest performances to ever win. She is in this film for about 6 minutes in total - but she won her Oscar for a 5 minute scene that is, most definately Oscar-worthy.And then there are the leading men. William Holden gives one of the last great performances of his extraordinary career as the ""voice of reason in this film"". He is our everyman caught up in the bizarre, absurd circumstances that evolve around him. It is his effort to try to make sense of this insanity that jumps off the screen. Holden was, deservedly, nominated for a Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar, but lost (rightfully so) to Peter Finch's turn as crazed newsman turned prophet, Howard Beale. His maniacal (but not over the top) turn is one for the ages. If you do nothing else, see this film for his performance (but there is so, so much more to love here). Unfortunately, Finch passed away from a heart attack in between his Oscar nomination and win, and was the first posthumous winner in an acting role (sadly, Heath Ledger would join this ""club"" years later).Finally, enough cannot be said about Sidney Lumet's direction. A movie like this would not succeed without a sure, steady and seasoned hand at the helm - and this is how I would describe Lumet's direction. He lets the camera roll and lets the actors and the screenplay take center stage, not drawing attention away, but adding to the themes of the film throughout - especially in Beatty's speech at the end.NETWORK was nominated for (but did not win) the Oscar for Best Film of 1976. Did it lose out to other nominees ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or TAXI DRIVER? Nope, it lost to ROCKY.Let that sink in.If you get a chance to watch (or rewatch) this film, I highly recommend you do so. For me, it was GREAT to watch this on the big screen with an audience, one of the reasons I love - and will continue to attend - the SECRET CINEMA series of films.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",eerily prescient classic,im mad as hell im not going take it anymore one most famous lines film history is as impactful today as it was when it was first uttered by fictitious news anchor howard beale paddy chayefskys seemingly parody where tv tv news is heading 1976s network astonishing thing about this terrific motion picture is how prescient it is news is now entertainment appeal disaffected masses drive our message viewers be provocative 6 00 news had less than 1 minute hard news rest was sex scandal brutal crime sports children with incurable diseases lost puppies sound familiar this isnt today it came this movie that was made 42 years ago as cautionary tale what might happen besides social ramifications how does this film hold up quite well indeed rare 10 star bankofmarquis film starting with great paddy chayefskys oscar winning screenplay this was capper brilliant career chayefsky who also won oscars his screenplay 1972s hospital ill have check that one out 1956s marty what does terrific screenplay do it attracts top level talent clamoring be this they all deliver start with faye dunaway who won lead actress oscar her role as entertainment head diane christensen driven work hard play hard individual who has idea make news entertainment lost fog time mommie dearest is fact that mid 1970s dunaway was perhaps greatest leading actress day her skills are sharp display this film joining dunaway terrific supporting turns are robert duvall following his turns as tom hagen godfather i ii as network head frank hackett ned beatty as ned jennings president company that owns network he has speech towards tail end this film that is as good both performance way that it is shot as anything put upon screen it was masterful speaking masterful beatrice straight won oscar best supporting actress one shortest performances ever win she is this film about 6 minutes total but she won her oscar 5 minute scene that is most definately oscar worthy then there are leading men william holden gives one last great performances his extraordinary career as voice reason this film he is our everyman caught up bizarre absurd circumstances that evolve around him it is his effort try make sense this insanity that jumps off screen holden was deservedly nominated best actor leading role oscar but lost rightfully so peter finchs turn as crazed newsman turned prophet howard beale his maniacal but not over top turn is one ages if you do nothing else see this film his performance but there is so so much more love here unfortunately finch passed away heart attack between his oscar nomination win was first posthumous winner acting role sadly heath ledger would join this club years later finally enough cannot be said about sidney lumets direction movie like this would not succeed without sure steady seasoned hand at helm this is how i would describe lumets direction he lets camera roll lets actors screenplay take center stage not drawing attention away but adding themes film throughout especially beattys speech at end network was nominated but did not win oscar best film 1976 did it lose out other nominees all presidents men or taxi driver nope it lost rocky let that sink if you get chance watch or rewatch this film i highly recommend you do so me it was great watch this big screen with audience one reasons i love will continue attend secret cinema series films letter grade 10 out 10 stars you can take that bank ofmarquis,0.5716031746031746,0.21466666666666673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,perhaps the blackest black comedy ever,"When this movie came out in '76 I didn't bother seeing it because I rejected the premise as implausible; the very idea that a network anchor would go nuts on the air and become a hook for ratings seemed ridiculous on its face. Would that it were so.Today we have Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Howard Stern, etc. etc. etc. At the beginning of the movie a drunken Max Schumacher (William Holden) fantasizes about a show called ""the Death Hour"" comprised of films of car crashes, suicides, train wrecks, and so forth, to be put on Sunday night in prime time. ""It'll blow Disney outta the f------g water!"" he laughs. A few years back some network put exactly such a show - ""Eye Witness Videos"" - on the air. On Sunday night. In prime time. In short, as most everyone here has commented, ""Network""'s horrifying vision - brilliantly written by the incredibly prescient Paddy Chayevsky - has been truly and frighteningly prophetic, and rings absolutely true today.The movie is a veritable feast of tour-de-force acting from all involved. In particular William Holden's wrenching performance as the burned-out but still sensitive Max is drop-jaw stunning. I feel he, not Finch, should have gotten the Oscar, though Finch's work is not exactly chopped liver either. And what a brilliant device on Chayevsky's part to make the lunatic Howard Beale the only one of the bunch with clarity of vision. That the film is intended to be a satire and a comedy is clear from the narration, especially the final comment about Beale becoming the first man to be killed because of lousy ratings.

10.0,Superb film with one of the finest screenplays ever written,"Network is simply brilliant in every aspect. There is nothing actually here that I can fault. It is a compelling, brilliantly written, beautifully acted movie and more.The film does look great. The cinematography is excellent, while the scenery, locations and costumes are top notch. Sidney Lumet, a solid director a vast majority of the time does a exemplary job directing too, in fact Network is probably his best-directed film.Then there is the screenplay. I still stand by my thoughts that Network has one of the best screenplays ever, scathing yet daring and sophisticated and intelligent. And it is flawlessly delivered by William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall and Faye Dunnaway who in turn give wonderful performances and a stellar support cast.All in all, it is a superb film, and I'd say it is one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox",superb film with one finest screenplays ever written,network is simply brilliant every aspect there is nothing actually here that i can fault it is compelling brilliantly written beautifully acted movie more film does look great cinematography is excellent while scenery locations costumes are top notch sidney lumet solid director vast majority time does exemplary job directing too fact network is probably his best directed film then there is screenplay i still stand by my thoughts that network has one best screenplays ever scathing yet daring sophisticated intelligent it is flawlessly delivered by william holden peter finch robert duvall faye dunnaway who turn give wonderful performances stellar support cast all all it is superb film id say it is one best 70s 10 10 bethany cox,0.7090909090909092,0.6227272727272728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Guess What?..Everything is a Commodity!!,"Groundbreaking is the term for this movie...It is considered one of the hundred best movies ever made and for very good reason...Director Sidney Lummet has a reputation for the director of the non-conventional!!...A cogency for making the absolute truth a guileless villain, a rude awakening for television viewers, and a stubborn scripture for facts is what purports a film like Network as a masterpiece for the prolific and intellectual!! You could not ask for better acting!! The acting in this movie is second to none!! Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, Ned Beatty and a whole list of others...Perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever!! It starts with Howard Beale (Peter Finch) a victim of his own human pitfalls...Ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse, he becomes isolated, desultory ,morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning, he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko!!...At first!!..but guess what!! he's a hit!!...So the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him ""The Angry Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of Our Time""...As long as we've gone this far, let's break all of the rules...Bring on the terrorists, the soothsayers, the insurectionaries, the financial gurus, the faith healers, and the para military radicals, to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks!!! William Holden plays the old school business man with ""primal doubts"" about his life in general...""male menopause"" with ""defineable features"" He is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years, he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion...The woman with whom he gets involved, is callous not because she is vindictive, but because she is emotionless!! This woman (Faye Dunaway) is the ""Television Incarnate"" Ice Queen who reduces time and space to ""split seconds and instant replays"" the daily business of life is a ""corrupt comedy"" and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a ""radiant eruption of Democracy"" is that it gets a 32 share!!...This acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance I have ever seen...The type of person Dianna Christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly...The delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable....She was ideologically explosive yet person-ably obtuse. You knew why she wasn't the drinking type...she was too emotionally detached...In the thick of women's liberation, whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man, this movie portrayed how being just like a man had it's drawbacks!! ""Arousing quickly, consummating prematurely"" and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work, made Dianna Christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression!! Aggregately, she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning!! Director, Sidney Lummet, was insistent that Dianna Christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability!! Mr Hackett (Robert Duvall) played the hatchet man for the CCA...A rough around the edges errand boy for Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked ..Scruples were never an issue, and ratings were pending exchange!! Howard Beale (Peter Finch) the ""Angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time"" surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience!!! He was the UBS star-lighted ""Mad Prophet of the airways""...He could arouse anger and counter-culture overzealousness just by appearing crazy!!! One speech Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation!! Paddy Chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of Communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share!!!..The terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative!!!! The movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe...Give Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity!!! Howard Beale, the decrepit alcoholic, euphemistically transformed to the prescient paragon of intuitiveness, was alright so long as his innocuous chastisements did not disrupt worldwide pecuniary acquisitions!! Once they did, he was quelled, and thus deemed a total ratings chart disaster!! Ultimately, Howard Beale, the once disheveled dipsomania-cal curmudgeon, turned Messianic Savonarola, becomes the typification of the corporate guinea pig!!!!This movie is avant-garde in it's ability to convey the message of greed first democracy second, or third, depending on the sponsors of the Howard Beale Show... An incident was determined traumatic or not traumatic by it's lucrative marketability potential!! Terrorism is not terrorism if it means ratings!!! The character assassination of all the people in this movie was at the grass roots level!! Their avoidable flaws were entrenched as irreconcilable!! Any people with any conscience whatsoever (William Holden & his wife) were decimated by reveille with selfishness, now it is imperative that they pick up the pieces!! How many imitations of this movie have there been...thousands!! Network however was the first movie of it's kind to effectively portray the concept of ""dying Democracy and dehumanization"" probably the best movie of it's kind as well... This is an illustration of how heinous tragedy has to be stomached by the television audience, their response to clinical trauma transcends the impact suffered by the actual victims involved!! It is a proverbial case of ratings eclipsing reality!! The film ""Network"" resonates itself to a point whereby the American people are reduced to meager by-products of the Fortune 500!! I wish there could be a movie of this caliber made again!! I am angry that there has not been a sensationalistic masterpiece to come around for some time, and I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!!!",guess what everything is

10.0,"Not just the sharp-as-a-tack dialog, but the key performances and the look of the film are enduring","This is one of those works that is emblematic of what can be done with a director who knows his craft and chooses a style that is both controlled and not controlling, a writer who can let out some wild scenes and incredible exposition and make it practically believable (maybe more so today), and a cast that understand their creative forces at work. After seeing the film I was actually struck just as much, for example, by William Holden's performance as I was by Peter Finch, though the latter usually gets most of the credit (and rightfully so, in an Oscar-winning turn beating out De Niro in Taxi Driver if one can believe that). But then one has to take into account their different levels of skill in their performances, and how they both deliver even more than what is required. Holden, for me, is just as good here as he is in his best work (Sunset Blvd, The Wild Bunch), but in the role of the worn-out, dedicated professional who in his own way has had about as enough bs that can be taken as the main character. Yet Holden also knows his performance needs to be more reserved, and as his story gets more complicated he has to make some subtle choices as perhaps the only really sane person in the film. His work here is accomplished in the style of one sense, while Finch, who plays a character going back and forth between being totally nuts and knowing more than anyone else out there in TV land, takes his role with a heedless abandon.In short, this is one of the more fearless looks at the media ever presented on film, and it's even more relevant today perhaps than when it was first released. It's sad that not only did Lumet and Paddy Chayevsky think that what they were doing (aside from the ending) was all true, but that as the decades have passed since Regan's to-do with changing the rules of journalism, it's gotten worse. It was actually kind of shocking to see one or two of the revelations from Finch in some scenes, and the connection made in the 3rd act with Saudi Arabia is one of my favorite parts of the film (particularly the speech by Ned Beatty in one of the all-time great one-scene roles). News, basically, now is like everything else on TV, where you get what you pay for via the advertising, but not as it should really be with the news as it is. Howard Beale, basically, is like one of those ultra-symbollic (but relatable) characters in movies, in a demented way like Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, where the truth has to be spoken by someone, but who in America will listen (or, ironically, who won't if it's shelled out right in front of the cameras).In other words, this is one of those films that does ask a viewer to think about what is being shown- an 'informed' public (which is growing less and less as the media becomes smaller and more controlled via government and regulations)- while still providing acting that sticks and lines of dialog that are among the best in 70's films. Faye Dunaway is the female counterpart to her older male stars and is just as good, being like a very cold, typical businesswoman who only makes things feel like she does, as if something was lost in youth. Duvall is also good here, if maybe not at his very best, in a role as a TV exec. But there are bit parts that are really good too, like the black female militant member who complains at a meeting about the grosses of showing footage on TV. And in a small way, like the films of Brooks and Monty Python, Lumet understands how to film things very realistically (though the style appropriately changed from start to finish) so that the satire within can spring out. Even an over-the-top scene like Beale's first Mad-as-Hell speech works on this level.Overall, this is a really amazing film, with enoughs scathing, dark material mixed with the truth that should and isn't presented to those who rely solely on programming. ""Because you're on television, dummy"" are the last words Beatty says to Beale in their scene after Beale asks ""why me?"" By the end, as the film reaches its ultimate climax, one might wonder if his question is relatable to all TV, not just the news. Why is it what you say to people through this abstract medium important, or not? The answers, looking at how the news is run now, should be obvious. Maybe Lumet's best outside of his more 'urban' films (i.e. Serpico, The Pawnbroker, Dog Day Afternoon).",not just sharp as tack dialog but key performances look film are enduring,this is one those works that is emblematic what can be done with director who knows his craft chooses style that is both controlled not controlling writer who can let out some wild scenes incredible exposition make it practically believable maybe more so today cast that understand their creative forces at work after seeing film i was actually struck just as much example by william holdens performance as i was by peter finch though latter usually gets most credit rightfully so oscar winning turn beating out de niro taxi driver if one can believe that but then one has take into account their different levels skill their performances how they both deliver even more than what is required holden me is just as good here as he is his best work sunset blvd wild bunch but role worn out dedicated professional who his own way has had about as enough bs that can be taken as main character yet holden also knows his performance needs be more reserved as his story gets more complicated he has make some subtle choices as perhaps only really sane person film his work here is accomplished style one sense while finch who plays character going back forth between being totally nuts knowing more than anyone else out there tv land takes his role with heedless abandon short this is one more fearless looks at media ever presented film its even more relevant today perhaps than when it was first released its sad that not only did lumet paddy chayevsky think that what they were doing aside ending was all true but that as decades have passed since regans do with changing rules journalism its gotten worse it was actually kind shocking see one or two revelations finch some scenes connection made 3rd act with saudi arabia is one my favorite parts film particularly speech by ned beatty one all time great one scene roles news basically now is like everything else tv where you get what you pay via advertising but not as it should really be with news as it is howard beale basically is like one those ultra symbollic but relatable characters movies demented way like stewart mr smith goes washington where truth has be spoken by someone but who america will listen or ironically who wont if its shelled out right front cameras other words this is one those films that does ask viewer think about what is being shown informed public which is growing less less as media becomes smaller more controlled via government regulations while still providing acting that sticks lines dialog that are among best 70s films faye dunaway is female counterpart her older male stars is just as good being like very cold typical businesswoman who only makes things feel like she does as if something was lost youth duvall is also good here if maybe not at his very best role as tv exec but there are bit parts that are really good too like black female militant member who complains at meeting about grosses showing footage tv small way like films brooks monty python lumet understands how film things very realistically though style appropriately changed start finish so that satire within can spring out even over top scene like beales first mad as hell speech works this level overall this is really amazing film with enoughs scathing dark material mixed with truth that should isnt presented those who rely solely programming because youre television dummy are last words beatty says beale their scene after beale asks why me by end as film reaches its ultimate climax one might wonder if his question is relatable all tv not just news why is it what you say people through this abstract medium important or not answers looking at how news is run now should be obvious maybe lumets best outside his more urban films i e serpico pawnbroker dog day afternoon,0.4988717532467531,0.17875811688311688,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7.0,Doesn't fully fulfill its promising premise,"An interesting, ambitious, and somewhat entertaining satire of television, but one that pretty much fails for a number of reasons. It's difficult to believe almost everything that happens in it. Not one of the characters rings true. William Holden is as boring in 1976 as he was in 1955, and his cliché relationship with Faye Dunnaway is not at all believable, and not even that interesting. Their scenes together go on forever, and Holden's character carries the trite and obvious metaphor of Dunnaway as television personified, and their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary. Dunnaway herself puts an amazing amount of energy into her performance, and she didn't not deserve the Oscar she won, if you'll excuse my double negative. But her character really is only the metaphor that Holden attributes her, so what ground can she win with that? Beatrice Straight gives a performance that's most famous for being the shortest that ever won an Oscar, only three minutes. I didn't know who Beatrice Straight was, but it's obvious when she starts giving her big speech, so showy that she induced me to roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her Oscar is; that must be a record, too. Robert Duvall fares the best among the major cast members, although he hasn't much of a character either. Peter Finch's performance is interesting, but his ranting gets old quick. While Howard Beale's first couple of ravings would undoubtedly raise people's interest (the `I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore' scene is as great as it is famous), but I doubt the television show that is developed for him, which apparently airs five days a week and runs for many months before the film ends, would ever attract an audience of any kind, except maybe a small bit who have a taste for public access television, which is what it seems like. I think people, especially the kind of disenfranchised, cynical people to whom Beale's show is supposed to appeal, would be much more critical and suspicious of a man who does his show opposite a psychic and in front of stained glass window. People always refer to Network as `prophetic,' and then claim their proof is stuff like Jerry Springer, Hard Copy and reality television. As much as some of us may hate those kinds of television shows, only the deranged or stupid would ever believe that When Animals Attack is harmful to anybody other than those who are being attacked by animals. Does anybody really believe that anyone would ever air programs like The Ecumenical Liberation League or whatever that was? Some of the scenes focusing on this new show which the network is developing seem to want to be comedy, although the film is too heavy-seeming to ever succeed in being comic. Anyhow, in the world of reality, in which Holden's character keeps trying to convince Dunnaway and the film's audience that the story is really happening, the network's lawyers would have stopped them immediately. I will say that the film is prescient in only one way: Ned Beatty, who appears for one scene, has the most intriguing part, where he says, among other things: ""It is the international system of currency which determines the vitality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature! And you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today."" It comes out of right field in the film - well, kind of. The almighty dollar is the driving force of the film, and, the film realizes correctly, the world. But what Network does not understand is how television works to propagate this system, or perhaps how it would. It's too busy finding its subject, television, overtly evil when it misses the ways it can be more subtly evil. Not that I think all TV is evil or anything. Personally, I watch a lot of television and enjoy it immensely. I don't think it is particularly wicked, and I actually think that there's a lot of great art to be found on television (yes I do!). However, most of the evil I do see comes from the news. I wasn't around in 1976, so I can't say whether or not the news was as suspicious and creepy back then, but, if Network really had been prophetic, it would have at least got some of the satire right. 7/10.",doesnt fully fulfill its promising premise,interesting ambitious somewhat entertaining satire television but one that pretty much fails number reasons its difficult believe almost everything that happens it not one characters rings true william holden is as boring 1976 as he was 1955 his clich relationship with faye dunnaway is not at all believable not even that interesting their scenes together go forever holdens character carries trite obvious metaphor dunnaway as television personified their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary dunnaway herself puts amazing amount energy into her performance she didnt not deserve oscar she won if youll excuse my double negative but her character really is only metaphor that holden attributes her so what ground can she win with that beatrice straight gives performance thats most famous being shortest that ever won oscar only three minutes i didnt know who beatrice straight was but its obvious when she starts giving her big speech so showy that she induced me roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her oscar is that must be record too robert duvall fares best among major cast members although he hasnt much character either peter finchs performance is interesting but his ranting gets old quick while howard beales first couple ravings would undoubtedly raise peoples interest im as mad as hell im not going take this anymore scene is as great as it is famous but i doubt television show that is developed him which apparently airs five days week runs many months before film ends would ever attract audience any kind except maybe small bit who have taste public access television which is what it seems like i think people especially kind disenfranchised cynical people whom beales show is supposed appeal would be much more critical suspicious man who does his show opposite psychic front stained glass window people always refer network as prophetic then claim their proof is stuff like jerry springer hard copy reality television as much as some us may hate those kinds television shows only deranged or stupid would ever believe that when animals attack is harmful anybody other than those who are being attacked by animals does anybody really believe that anyone would ever air programs like ecumenical liberation league or whatever that was some scenes focusing this new show which network is developing seem want be comedy although film is too heavy seeming ever succeed being comic anyhow world reality which holdens character keeps trying convince dunnaway films audience that story is really happening networks lawyers would have stopped them immediately i will say that film is prescient only one way ned beatty who appears one scene has most intriguing part where he says among other things it is international system currency which determines vitality life this planet that is natural order things today that is atomic subatomic galactic structure things today you have meddled with primal forces nature you will atone am i getting through you mr beale you get up your little 21 inch screen howl about america democracy there is no america there is no democracy there is only ibm itt at t dupont dow union carbide exxon those are nations world today it comes out right field film well kind almighty dollar is driving force film film realizes correctly world but what network does not understand is how television works propagate this system or perhaps how it would its too busy finding its subject television overtly evil when it misses ways it can be more subtly evil not that i think all tv is evil or anything personally i watch lot television enjoy it immensely i dont think it is particularly wicked i actually think that theres lot great art be found television yes i do however most evil i do see comes news i wasnt around 1976 so i cant say whether or not news was as suspicious creepy back then but if network really had been prophetic it would have at least got some satire right 7 10,0.5653811928811929,0.08166065416065418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Paddy Chayefsky Gets Mad at the Media,"With his ratings in the toilet, and cancellation looming, veteran newscaster Peter Finch (as Howard Beale) decides to go out with a ""BANG!"" and announces he will commit suicide on his last broadcast. Boozy ""UBS"" network news chief William Holden (as Max Schumacher) decides to let his drinking buddy go before the camera one last time to apologize, and bow out with some dignity. Instead, Mr. Finch goes on another tirade. Of course, the ratings skyrocket, and Finch becomes a TV demagogue. Next, his popular news show is given to entertainment division executive Faye Dunaway (as Diana Christensen), who uses it to build a sensationalistic and successful schedule for the ""Network"". With uncanny direction from Sidney Lumet, ""Network"" is a bottomless pit of great performances, with Holden and Finch demonstrating the best use of vulgar language in at least a decade.Writer Paddy Chayefsky's award-winning warning was taken for satire in 1976, and is now considered a blueprint for success. Everything in this film was happening then, and continues on a larger scale. Mr. Chayefsky was a television original, and had a front row seat when he witnessed television's ""vast wasteland"" grow to unmanageable proportions. Perversely, the real networks responded to this film by turning their news coverage over to entertainment divisions (one rather blatantly, and famously). The end of the Fairness Doctrine helped insure a future of garbage, with no end in sight.

9.0,Exceptional but certainly NOT a picture you should let your kids see,"This is one of the most cynical films of all time, with a very dark and sometimes humorous look at the banality of television and the stupidity of the public. At the same time, since it's so cynical and dark, it features some exceptionally adult dialog that even today should exclude kids from watching it. Now I do understand why such rough language was used (after all, this is a harsh ""wrinkles and all"" look at television), but it's a shame really as the film COULD be an excellent civics lesson to our kids--especially teens. Watching the contempt that network programmers have for intelligence and decency is an important lesson and makes this an exceptional film.Just how far a network will go for ratings is the major thrust of the film? The evening news anchorman of UBS News (a great acronym) is losing his mind. However, when he actually has a nervous breakdown and announces he's going to kill himself on the air, even the soul-less people at the network are even initially upset--that is until the ratings come in for this an the following broadcast when the same announcer uses tons of profanity. Then, instead of disavowing themselves from it, they bathe in the horrible spectacle of a person losing his hold on reality! And, in turn, this sort of crap programming results in even more controversial and pointless shows--such as one that glorifies terrorists and encourages these killers to film their exploits so they can be shown on TV! The sickest and funniest aspect of this was the business meeting the network bigwigs had with the terrorists when it was becoming obvious that these Communist Radicals were actually becoming astute Capitalists and were concerned with profits and residuals!! There's a lot more to the film than this. In particular, there is a relationship between William Holden and Faye Dunaway that is actually intended as a representation of the shallowness of the media. In other words, Holden is seduced by Miss Dunaway--just like the public is often seduced by glitz without substance or depth. This parallel story is exceptional and Dunaway received an Oscar for her wonderful part. Oddly, while Holden was also exceptional in the film, the Oscar for Best Actor was given to Peter Finch (the insane anchor man) even though he is really more of a supporting character. Both he and Holden were up for the award. Beatrice Straight received the Best Supporting Actress for her very brief appearance in the film. While she WAS excellent, she was only on screen a tiny fraction of the film. So, choosing her and Finch as Oscar recipients both seem like odd choices in hindsight. Paddy Cheyevsky, not surprisingly, also garnered an Oscar for his insightful script.All in all, while not one of the very greatest films I have seen, it certainly is a must-see for film fans and a wonderful example of cynicism and dark humor.",exceptional but certainly not picture you should let your kids see,this is one most cynical films all time with very dark sometimes humorous look at banality television stupidity public at same time since its so cynical dark it features some exceptionally adult dialog that even today should exclude kids watching it now i do understand why such rough language was used after all this is harsh wrinkles all look at television but its shame really as film could be excellent civics lesson our kids especially teens watching contempt that network programmers have intelligence decency is important lesson makes this exceptional film just how far network will go ratings is major thrust film evening news anchorman ubs news great acronym is losing his mind however when he actually has nervous breakdown announces hes going kill himself air even soul less people at network are even initially upset that is until ratings come this following broadcast when same announcer uses tons profanity then instead disavowing themselves it they bathe horrible spectacle person losing his hold reality turn this sort crap programming results even more controversial pointless shows such as one that glorifies terrorists encourages these killers film their exploits so they can be shown tv sickest funniest aspect this was business meeting network bigwigs had with terrorists when it was becoming obvious that these communist radicals were actually becoming astute capitalists were concerned with profits residuals theres lot more film than this particular there is relationship between william holden faye dunaway that is actually intended as representation shallowness media other words holden is seduced by miss dunaway just like public is often seduced by glitz without substance or depth this parallel story is exceptional dunaway received oscar her wonderful part oddly while holden was also exceptional film oscar best actor was given peter finch insane anchor man even though he is really more supporting character both he holden were up award beatrice straight received best supporting actress her very brief appearance film while she was excellent she was only screen tiny fraction film so choosing her finch as oscar recipients both seem like odd choices hindsight paddy cheyevsky not surprisingly also garnered oscar his insightful script all all while not one very greatest films i have seen it certainly is must see film fans wonderful example cynicism dark humor,0.5777619047619047,0.15666117216117215,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,The mad prophet of the air,"In the world that author Paddy Chayefsky created for Network, there are in fact four television networks instead of the three that people from my generation grew up with. That fourth TV network is the United Broadcasting Systems or UBS for short. They are running a very poor fourth, especially in the news division. Their Walter Cronkite is one Howard Beale who's been slipping badly in the ratings. Beale played by Peter Finch is given the axe by his good friend, the director of the news division of UBS Max Schumacher who is played by William Holden.Beale who really has nothing else in his life, left a childless widower a few years earlier, but this program. He calmly announces that he's going to kill himself on the next broadcast.That sets in motion a chain of events in the network and in the company that owns the network and the holding company that owns the company that make Howard Beale the mad prophet of the air. Programmer Faye Dunaway decides to blend news and entertainment with a series of startling ideas. What hath Network wrought? In 1976 Network was considered clever way out satire. Now there's more truth in it than one would like to believe. Now we have television networks that are devoted to nothing but news, but strive for those all important ratings with blending entertainment with news.But Chayefsky missed the boat in two respects. He did not anticipate the rise of cable television. Whereas my generation grew up with three networks period, affordable cable has multiplied the networks into the hundreds. That in itself makes the four network reality of Network outdated. And of course Mr. Chayefsky did as so many others, not anticipate the Internet where so many people now get their information and it's even a source of entertainment. Bill Holden and Peter Finch were nominated for their performances in the Best Actor category. They probably would have split the vote which is what normally happens, but for Peter Finch's demise before the Oscar voting. Sad to say that probably clinched the Oscar for him, but it was still well deserved. An honest decent man who gets caught up in machinations that end in tragedy, you don't take your eyes off Finch for one second while he's on screen.Holden is caught up in the machinations as well. He gets a midlife crisis and starts an affair with Faye Dunaway, but their differences in not only age, but general outlook on life drive them apart. Holden's left his wife Beatrice Straight for Dunaway and she got a Best Supporting Actress award for her scenes telling off Mr. Holden. It's by no means certain what Holden's future is, but it is clear he has no place in the television industry as it was constituted in 1996.Nor I doubt he would have one today in 2006. I can see Holden's character, a man now in his mid 80s being a professor emeritus of journalism at some college or even running a newsblog today. Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, William Prince are all corporate types we find in various films about big business. The one character who stands out for me is Ned Beatty, the head of the conglomerate who bought the whole network. His scene with Peter Finch where he explains the facts of life to the now demented Howard Beale is the best in the film.Network is a great film, both entertaining and thought provoking.",mad prophet air,world that author paddy chayefsky created network there are fact four television networks instead three that people my generation grew up with that fourth tv network is united broadcasting systems or ubs short they are running very poor fourth especially news division their walter cronkite is one howard beale whos been slipping badly ratings beale played by peter finch is given axe by his good friend director news division ubs max schumacher who is played by william holden beale who really has nothing else his life left childless widower few years earlier but this program he calmly announces that hes going kill himself next broadcast that sets motion chain events network company that owns network holding company that owns company that make howard beale mad prophet air programmer faye dunaway decides blend news entertainment with series startling ideas what hath network wrought 1976 network was considered clever way out satire now theres more truth it than one would like believe now we have television networks that are devoted nothing but news but strive those all important ratings with blending entertainment with news but chayefsky missed boat two respects he did not anticipate rise cable television whereas my generation grew up with three networks period affordable cable has multiplied networks into hundreds that itself makes four network reality network outdated course mr chayefsky did as so many others not anticipate internet where so many people now get their information its even source entertainment bill holden peter finch were nominated their performances best actor category they probably would have split vote which is what normally happens but peter finchs demise before oscar voting sad say that probably clinched oscar him but it was still well deserved honest decent man who gets caught up machinations that end tragedy you dont take your eyes off finch one second while hes screen holden is caught up machinations as well he gets midlife crisis starts affair with faye dunaway but their differences not only age but general outlook life drive them apart holdens left his wife beatrice straight dunaway she got best supporting actress award her scenes telling off mr holden its by no means certain what holdens future is but it is clear he has no place television industry as it was constituted 1996 nor i doubt he would have one today 2006 i can see holdens character man now his mid 80s being professor emeritus journalism at some college or even running newsblog today robert duvall wesley addy william prince are all corporate types we find various films about big business one character who stands out me is ned beatty head conglomerate who bought whole network his scene with peter finch where he explains facts life now demented howard beale is best film network is great film both entertaining thought provoking,0.4621687370600414,0.11581780538302278,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.6}"
9.0,A Cynic's Dream,"This is one of those wonderful films where everything comes together. The acting and the writing is by far the most impressive elements of this film. William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.The true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message. The cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.This is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970's (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics. For those educators out there, GREAT film for classes on Media and Politics.",cynics dream,this is one those wonderful films where everything comes together acting writing is by far most impressive elements this film william holden peter finch should have both received oscars their performances instead just peter finch faye dunaway pulls most dynamic emotional characters she has ever played true brilliance this film is that all elements it fade appropriately behind actors their messages film is completely work storytelling at least writer stunning clarity message purpose political films come go but few remain annals film because their effectiveness at their own message cinematography editing sound costume design art direction production design are all quite simplistic some scenes film can be accused being almost ugly however this all lends back washing film so as allow message ring loudest my opinion sidney lumet took this just little too far thus i give it 9 instead 10 this is certainly film history books every connoisseur film should be exposed this movie at some point their life if you happen be cynical then you will love every minute this movie as its stark view life 1970s onward touches hard even hardest cynics those educators out there great film classes media politics,0.593920068027211,0.11732568027210886,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.39}"
