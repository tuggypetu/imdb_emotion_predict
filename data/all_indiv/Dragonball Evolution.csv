1,A contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series,"As bad as Inspector Gadget and The Last Airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to Dragonball Evolution. The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn't look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn't in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.Why do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don't impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn't help that some of them are half-baked.The film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.Overall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",contender worst live action film animated tv series,as bad as inspector gadget last airbender are they look like masterpieces compared dragonball evolution tv series was very very good movie was half baked bland only good thing was james marsters while he maynt look exactly like piccolo he at least tries capture essence character just shame he isnt enough movie elevate it even more why do i say that dragonball evolution is contender worst live action film animated tv series scenery costumes are nice look at but cinematography does nothing me editing is shoddy lighting is dull special effects dont impress either they do distract rather than enhance it doesnt help that some them are half baked film is also too rushed all honesty i was left bored by end nothing really interesting my view happens story is juvenile predictable dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due delivery very rarely ringing true direction is bland acting is nothing smile about goku yamuka especially are complete disasters show complete lack acting ability not only that characters here are treated most banal way possible are difficult like as result overall very poor movie 1 10 bethany cox,0.5508459979736575,-0.04730772773325965,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"
3,A Nutshell Review: Dragonball Evolution,"Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From ""Americanizing"" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.For the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.As far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.Speaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead.",nutshell review dragonball evolution,hollywood plundering japanese pop culture isnt something new americanizing television series kids power rangers ultraman adapting famed characters japanese film games manga frequent disastrous effect it still wouldnt stop studios going after one property after another this time round its long running dragonball series because assumption is that built fan base would translate instant dollars at box office not you have give filmmakers little bit credit though being either foolhardy or just plain ballsy its given that they cannot condense distill rich content into surprisingly less than 90 minute movie live hopes producing sequel or generate franchise i e dont leave cinema hall when end credits start roll but what they successfully do is super summarize entire mythos by throwing out everything except main gist entire manga making it extremely simplistic poor lazy man standards adaptation uninitiated film would serve as quick launchpad original manga those with wee bit knowledge what its about like myself film just treads along same lines doesnt offer you new information fanboys i guess youll only get some kicks at seeing some your favorite characters come alive only that they look more caucasian have head full hair when theyre not supposed someone forgot insist that contract thats all youre gonna get period as far as film making story telling techniques go you can see clich after clich being thrown at you with poorly cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation justin chatwins goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet be realized his frustration he gets treated by peers as loser geek he lives with his grandpa gohan randall duk kim stereotypical know it all like kung pu panda develops crush school hottie chi chi jamie chung gokus calling life is prevent apocalypse happening with return chief cardboard baddie lord piccolo instant shoo as one worst cinematic villains ever his temporary sidekick mai eriko tamura who attempt collect 7 dragonballs fulfill ancient myth course goku needs fellowship form irritating tech wizard bulma emmy rossum last seen sinker poseidon mercenary yum cha joon park who probably copied rains uninspiring cinematic turn speed racer t chow yun fat biggest name them all here trying his darnest best act cute as master roshi who imparts skills double quick time goku speaking time or lack thereof everything is compressed two weeks two days day blood moon shielding yellow sun ok so i made that up everything moves at so fast pace that all you get are cheesy lines dialog excuse paste some action sequences together james wong certainly cant direct action despite being at helm jet lis one which was course bland bad opting pay homage zack snyders slow mo technique midway changing style having camera being too close action dark coupled with quick mtv cuts that you dont get see thing rush job just doesnt stop at narrative or action special effects wise they look really cheap i wonder whether producer stephen chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his kung fu hustle done many years ago ayumi hamasakis contribution theme song rule sounded really bad as well i may get flak her fans i guess having some asian participation doesnt legitimize what is essentially poorly done movie not even chow yun fats star status could save this you wonder what figured when this is movie that he gave up red cliff this is basically movie that only children below age 5 will enjoy tremendously despite having see 6 half balls contributed courtesy 3 lead female characters being continuously flashed screen thanks some neck plunging wardrobe wheres that malfunction when you need one totally bland really uninteresting i would suggest sticking manga instead,0.5104439935064937,0.025323457792207793,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
1,A beyond Sub-par interpretation of Dragon Ball onto the big screens.,"This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing. The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line, meanwhile adding a ""modern"" spin on it (ie. chi chi's castle, and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters do not look like the cartoons (ie. Yamcha, Master Roshi), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience.",beyond sub par interpretation dragon ball onto big screens,this is total butchering what i had held great hopes seeing movies attempts follow dragon ball story line meanwhile adding modern spin it ie chi chis castle master roshi lives regular semi whats up with that what viewers want see is storyline that follows cartoon series without any changes additions overall plot is weak characters do not look like cartoons ie yamcha master roshi 2d cartoon series had better special effects than movie series had no special effects thats how terrible it was i created imdb account just comment how they butchered dragonball me i hope that hollywood is smarter next time as when they bring such strong fan based series onto big screens or they will only infuriate more audience,0.4751831501831502,0.07275910364145659,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"

1,Even those who aren't fans of the original cartoon will hate this.,"""Dragonball Evolution"" must be one of the most pathetic movies ever made. I wasn't expecting this to be like the anime series, I only was expecting this to be remotely good and yet even on this it fails miserably. ""Dragonball Evolution"" combines a lot of predictable clichés and stereotypes from every single fantasy movie from the recent years with terrible performances and horrible, really horrible special effects. No only none of the characters were remotely likable (If the idea was to attract a new audience changing the personality of the characters of the anime show, it fails mostly because this new vision of these ""original"" characters is based on the most uninspiring and bland kind of stereotypes) ""Dragonball Evolution"" is the perfect example of everything what is wrong with live action adaptations of cartoons: Neither the story or the characters have at least a slight resemblance to the source material, the visual effects are extremely poor, the script is incredibly stupid and childish. And the worst part is that not even remotely entertaining to watch, being one of the most boring, generic-looking movies I've seen in my entire life.""Dragonball Evolution"" is like a combination of the Power Rangers and High School Musical. It sucks. If you like the anime series ""Dragonball"", avoid this. And if you don't I still recommend you to avoid this horrible film because is boring, dumb and poorly made.0/10 (And I would rate with a negative score if I could)",even those who arent fans original cartoon will hate this,dragonball evolution must be one most pathetic movies ever made i wasnt expecting this be like anime series i only was expecting this be remotely good yet even this it fails miserably dragonball evolution combines lot predictable clich s stereotypes every single fantasy movie recent years with terrible performances horrible really horrible special effects no only none characters were remotely likable if idea was attract new audience changing personality characters anime show it fails mostly because this new vision these original characters is based most uninspiring bland kind stereotypes dragonball evolution is perfect example everything what is wrong with live action adaptations cartoons neither story or characters have at least slight resemblance source material visual effects are extremely poor script is incredibly stupid childish worst part is that not even remotely entertaining watch being one most boring generic looking movies ive seen my entire life dragonball evolution is like combination power rangers high school musical it sucks if you like anime series dragonball avoid this if you dont i still recommend you avoid this horrible film because is boring dumb poorly made 0 10 i would rate with negative score if i could,0.6206082692817387,-0.16129649262302323,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.42}"
2,Even the 7 Dragonballs Can't Save This Movie,"For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga/anime stories ever written. There is already an existing live action Dragonball movie called Dragonball: The Magic Begins (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122050/) made in Taiwan back in 1989. That movie tried really hard to stay as close as possible to the original story of Dragonball as written by Akira Toriyama, but it ended up being more of a comedy. The entire story also only went up to the Pilaf storyline, which was way before the first Piccolo appearance. This movie, although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story, was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value.Now, another live action Dragonball movie has come, called Dragonball: Evolution. When the first few pictures of this movie appeared on the internet, a lot of the fans already predicted that the movie would turn out horrible because the characters don't look like themselves. The characters were heavily changed and westernized too much, especially Piccolo, the main villain, who didn't look like the one from the manga and anime. Fast forward to a few weeks before the latest Dragonball movie was released, a trailer was leaked on the internet. That trailer spelled the certain doom of the movie to the fans of the show. Most of the comments described the movie as ""Not Dragonball, but another action movie"".This writer was fortunate enough to be invited to a private screening of the movie, and boy was I surprised! I was already expecting the movie to be bad and not a ""real"" Dragonball, but what I witnessed was something much more horrible! Granted that the movie was really different, but the way the movie progressed, the introduction of characters, the fight scenes, oh wow, you'd think it was a movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what Dragonball was about, except for the ""Kamehameha"" move and the 7 dragon balls, just with the financial backing of a millionaire. Everything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well, everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy, Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker, Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city (at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted), Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice, Mai (originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga) became a cold blooded, shape-shifting killer, Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair, and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character, except for the way he exits the movie early on.The fight scenes were lame. Dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained in one location. Characters would get punched through mountains, cities would be destroyed, the earth would rumble and split up due to the massive forces of the fighters. In this movie, everything seemed so lame. Even the Kamehameha attack was used to light some candles! Talk about total weakening!The only ""good"" things about the movie were the special effects, although the energy blasts seemed very weak.My advise is, if you're going to pay to watch this movie, DON'T DO IT. Listen to what almost everybody has been saying because they're right, the movie is worse than what you currently have in mind!",even 7 dragonballs cant save this movie,manga anime fans around world story dragonball has be at top or at least top 3 their most beloved manga anime stories ever written there is already existing live action dragonball movie called dragonball magic begins made taiwan back 1989 that movie tried really hard stay as close as possible original story dragonball as written by akira toriyama but it ended up being more comedy entire story also only went up pilaf storyline which was way before first piccolo appearance this movie although aged not exactly direct interpretation dragonball story was still appreciated by most fans due comedic entertainment value now another live action dragonball movie has come called dragonball evolution when first few pictures this movie appeared internet lot fans already predicted that movie would turn out horrible because characters dont look like themselves characters were heavily changed westernized too much especially piccolo main villain who didnt look like one manga anime fast forward few weeks before latest dragonball movie was released trailer was leaked internet that trailer spelled certain doom movie fans show most comments described movie as not dragonball but another action movie this writer was fortunate enough be invited private screening movie boy was i surprised i was already expecting movie be bad not real dragonball but what i witnessed was something much more horrible granted that movie was really different but way movie progressed introduction characters fight scenes oh wow youd think it was movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what dragonball was about except kamehameha move 7 dragon balls just with financial backing millionaire everything seemed rushed movie characters would just pop out nowhere decide join together beat piccolo love angle story seemed forced as well everybody was simply out character gokus powerful but lame school boy chi chis martial art school girl who cant even open her own locker master roshis some crazy dude living city at least he still wears hawaiian shirt seems little perverted bulma became lara croft rambo combined another body with bizarre voice mai originally one pilafs hilarious henchmen manga became cold blooded shape shifting killer yamcha became weird cross between desert bandit who cant fight hobo with unwashed hair piccolo became weird vampire whose outfit seems be inspired by matrix i think only grandpa gohan was close enough original character except way he exits movie early fight scenes were lame dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained one location characters would get punched through mountains cities would be destroyed earth would rumble split up due massive forces fighters this movie everything seemed so lame even kamehameha attack was used light some candles talk about total weakening only good things about movie were special effects although energy blasts seemed very weak my advise is if youre going pay watch this movie dont do it listen what almost everybody has been saying because theyre right movie is worse than what you currently have mind,0.5838138267355135,0.042829760600844945,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1,"So bad it's... well... bad, really","As you may or may not already know, Dragonball Evolution is officially leaked online. Directed by James Wong, the film was released a month early in Asia, and even watching the leaked version is even a waste of time. I watched the leaked version and even then I wanted my money back.So pretty much we see Goku on his 18th birthday, and he gets the dragonball. At school, he fantasizes about Chi Chi eating strawberries in science class (WTF???), opens every locker with his powers, and a whole bunch of other crap. At Chi Chi's party, he fights with these random guys and gets in, when Piccolo, who looks like a potato, destroys Goku's house and kills his Grandfather, and this leads Goku on some quest to get all 7 dragonballs.This movie is a pure suck-fest from beginning to end. Watch as Goku fantasizes about Chi Chi eating strawberries! Gawk at the lame performances from such lame stars as Justin Chatwin (who is ESPECIALLY bad), Chow-Yun Fat, and others! Laugh out loud at the bad dialog! Cringe at the cringe-inducing special effects! Watch as the writers get characters wrong! Or don't. Just spare yourself really.Apparently the official American version has 22 extra minutes of footage. But at this point I don't care, because this movie is already enough torture. What are the going to add? A Bulma/Goku sex scene? A scene where Goku masturbates with that Chi Chi fantasy in his head? A scene where Piccolo turns into a woman and gives birth to a ninja turtle???

1,A load of old Dragonballs,"It must be a real drag being a Jungian archetype. Aside from the inconvenience of possessing a thousand faces, imagine minding your own business, practicing judo with some wise and wily sage, when you're suddenly handed a magic sword or glowing swishy stick or cosmic catapult and tipped headlong into some damn-fool quest to go and rescue a princess and kill your dad - no, hang on, wrong shrink - or confront some Dark Lord (who may actually turn out to be your dad, bummer), while also confronting the darkness within your own soul (look harder, not using the recycling bin doesn't count). And the real bore of it all is, the thing that makes you want to stick your arms in a mincer, is that you know exactly what's going to happen next, which charming rogue you're going to meet on the road, which cuckolding temptress you're going to wind up married to for the next 100 years, and precisely which one of your battle-hungry, blood-crazed stepsons is going to do you in with a pillow when you're no longer fit to preside over a model railway set.The story is old, but it goes on. And it's always a pleasure when it's well told. But when plots and characters are as insultingly stock as they are in Dragonball Evolution, you start fervently praying for a bit of Jodorowsky-style subversion, possibly involving the heroine, the Dark Lord, a sackful of syringes and a malnourished donkey called Carlos. This resembles a fever dream you might have had after slipping into an E-number-aggravated blood sugar crash while watching The Star Wars Trilogy. Dragonball Evolution is so derivative, such a bare-faced rip-off of George Lucas' pension, that it actually seems completely pointless to pick holes in it. You might as well just attack the originals for their myriad faults and get two birds with one stone.""In an ancient time, Earth was nearly destroyed"" begins the ponderous voice-over.""Not by man, but by Gods from the sky..."" Most dramas smuggle their exposition in via the dialogue. This one just ram raids it out of the store. For what it's worth, the story involves a young hero called Goku, played by the Westerner Justin Chatwin (slightly creepily playing an 18 year-old at age 26) who embarks on a quest for the titular world-saving Dragon Balls after his martial artist grandpa Gohan is killed off by the evil Lord Piccolo (Marsters, resembling an over-sized Jawa with food poisoning). Will Goku manage to harness the powerful force called Ki and confront his own werewolf side? Find Master Roshi - who trained grandpa in turn? Defeat Piccolo - probably the only villain named after a small flute? And win the love of ass-kicking classmate Chi Chi? Seriously?There's probably a point to be made about the eternal exchange of cultural currency; Japan wresting back characters and plot lines from Lucas, then flogging them to the West again; Eastern aesthetics filtered through American sensibilities. But frankly, that's just the way the world works. The good news is this is only 84 minutes long.

3,Hollywood is ruining my childhood memories!,"This movie is just plain disappointing to say the least. I don't care if this is an adaptation of Dragonball. The only reason why I gave it a 3 out of 10 rating was for the special effects and production value which were semi-decent.

The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that don't know about Dragonball, kind of like how Watchmen did.

Meanwhile Goku falls in love with his school mate Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) .Dragon Ball are basically numerous spectacular fight-scenes with a tiny bit of plot movement, full of repetitive dialogue and flashy blasts of light and energy, but that hasn't prevented kids and teenagers from eating them up . It contains cartoon violence and minor sexual innuendo than anime series . Occasionally features stunted and disjointed action, as well as the hilarious but quite conventional characters fitting partially to animated series . The abundant computer generator images , which labor mightily to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look . These adventures can be good for novices and youngsters age 10 should drawn into the story but not for the established fans .

1,Don't you just hate Hollywood?,"From looking at some of the reviews on here, I will keep mine simple as people seem obsessed one way or another. I am reviewing this film on the credits.1. Relation to the original series. 2. Quality of script 3. quality of actors/actresses/acting 4. quality of effects 5. Final product.This film bears two relations to the original. The characters and the Dragonballs. There is nothing else to link the two. This is so sad when you consider how much they had to work with and all they could produce was this. The characters also bear little resemblance to their anime predecessors. None of them do what they are supposed to do, except Chi Chi, who didn't do much anyway. Where's Roshi's turtle shell. Why does Bulma carry several fully automatic weapons? And why is Yamcha now a ladies man? To their credit though, Roshi's behaviour soon after he appears is very accurate even if it is short lived.The script for this film is its downfall. It's just awful. The writers have tried to fit too much into a short period of time. This film needed to be 2.5 to 3 hours long to even come close to allowing all the characters to be fleshed out. Attention should have been paid to Transformers when they were making this film. If you want to make a film based on a TV series, as those who watched it, not a bunch of suits that are paid to watch it and come up with a story. Many people who enjoyed the show could have given suggestions throughout the whole movie making experience.AS bad as the film was, it doesn't take anything away from the actors themselves. They did the best they could with the tools they had. If you ask a builder to build you a house out of sticks, don't complain when it falls over.This film had all the effects of an 80's movie. Think of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and the scene where the Freddie battles the kid in the wheelchair. That's the level of effects in this film. And I will leave the dragon, Shenron, so you come to your own conclusions. I don't want to seem prejudiced.This film lands not just way off the mark for a spin off movie, it's in another continent. They should never have made it if it was going to be so lack lustred. It could have been done with a comedy element, which would have saved it, but no. They even try to throw in romance, but you have only seen the characters for an hour so who cares. Why so many inconsistencies from the original anime series? For example, Roshi does not live on an island. All these little details could have been included with another hour of film time. No one wants to watch an 88 minute film nowadays. Its just not value for money. Some may think that 1 out of 10 is harsh, but when they made such a hash of what could have been another Transformers, its all it deserves.",dont you just hate hollywood,looking at some reviews here i will keep mine simple as people seem obsessed one way or another i am reviewing this film credits 1 relation original series 2 quality script 3 quality actors actresses acting 4 quality effects 5 final product this film bears two relations original characters dragonballs there is nothing else link two this is so sad when you consider how much they had work with all they could produce was this characters also bear little resemblance their anime predecessors none them do what they are supposed do except chi chi who didnt do much anyway wheres roshis turtle shell why does bulma carry several fully automatic weapons why is yamcha now ladies man their credit though roshis behaviour soon after he appears is very accurate even if it is short lived script this film is its downfall its just awful writers have tried fit too much into short period time this film needed be 2 5 3 hours long even come close allowing all characters be fleshed out attention should have been paid transformers when they were making this film if you want make film based tv series as those who watched it not bunch suits that are paid watch it come up with story many people who enjoyed show could have given suggestions throughout whole movie making experience as bad as film was it doesnt take anything away actors themselves they did best they could with tools they had if you ask builder build you house out sticks dont complain when it falls over this film had all effects 80s movie think nightmare elm street 3 dream warriors scene where freddie battles kid wheelchair thats level effects this film i will leave dragon shenron so you come your own conclusions i dont want seem prejudiced this film lands not just way off mark spin off movie its another continent they should never have made it if it was going be so lack lustred it could have been done with comedy element which would have saved it but no they even try throw romance but you have only seen characters hour so who cares why so many inconsistencies original anime series example roshi does not live island all these little details could have been included with another hour film time no one wants watch 88 minute film nowadays its just not value money some may think that 1 out 10 is harsh but when they made such hash what could have been another transformers its all it deserves,0.5352100840336135,0.054465240641711245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.37}"

Or there wasn't any money from the beginning, and you're just using this movie as a money laundry? Copying Uwe Boll too much? Whoever gave the changes in this movie a green-light was damn stupid. The whole thing's cliché, and relies again on the ""Heroes Journey"". I'd really wish Joseph Campbell would have never done any research on myths and archetypes, because it's his fault now, that every movie is the same nowadays.This movie is really BAD. Even if you never knew anything about Dragonball (impossible) don't watch it, it'll still suck.

1,Dragonball Evolution - What a screw up!,"What is wrong with this picture man? Nothing personal to James as a director. I love his Final Destination series, but I think James is NOT the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. Why James is hired to direct this movie in the first place? It is a big mistakes. Like having Ang Lee directing the Hulk. Hiring an Asian to direct an Asian animation epic doesn't mean the movie will turn out great. The director must have a vision of the given materials. The entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. It is understandable that the film isn't exactly the same as the original comic, but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. From observing the promotion materials of Dragonball, it seems that Fox doesn't want to do this movie at all. The posters suck and the trailers suck. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies, look how successful those films had become. The studios should pay more respect and faith in Asian materials. To me this whole thing isn't making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe, and Dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than TWO decades. This is why I think 20th Century Fox was putting money into this project initially. Everyone is looking forward to see a Hollywood version of Dragonball. Soon as I saw the first teaser, I knew I shouldn't put up in any hope into this movie. Even though I went to see the movie without any expectation, the movie still suck! Despite the led down of the Dragonball fans, it creates negative impulses to those who is new to Dragonball.Dragonball is a hot cult in Asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. However, the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. Not to mention the screenplay, the production design of this film is not consistence at all. Wardrobes, props to makeup, nothing fits together! Not only nothing in this film resembles the original DB, it is a disgrace. No wonder they use the word ""Evolution"". But when they say evolution, I don't expect the studio turns something respectable like Dragonball into rubbish. I've seen a live action version of Dragonball shot by the Malaysian years ago. Although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. But the movie is far better than Dragonball Evolution. A lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie.",dragonball evolution what screw up,what is wrong with this picture man nothing personal james as director i love his final destination series but i think james is not right person direct this million plus dollars franchise why james is hired direct this movie first place it is big mistakes like having ang lee directing hulk hiring asian direct asian animation epic doesnt mean movie will turn out great director must have vision given materials entire outcome is disaster disappointment it is understandable that film isnt exactly same as original comic but characters plot just suck as film its own observing promotion materials dragonball it seems that fox doesnt want do this movie at all posters suck trailers suck studio spends lot money making marvels dc comics into movies look how successful those films had become studios should pay more respect faith asian materials me this whole thing isnt making any sense at all because there are established fans across globe dragonball comic cartoon itself has last more than two decades this is why i think 20th century fox was putting money into this project initially everyone is looking forward see hollywood version dragonball soon as i saw first teaser i knew i shouldnt put up any hope into this movie even though i went see movie without any expectation movie still suck despite led down dragonball fans it creates negative impulses those who is new dragonball dragonball is hot cult asia it hits western market because stylistic action fight sequences however martial arts choreography this movie is another led down not mention screenplay production design this film is not consistence at all wardrobes props makeup nothing fits together not only nothing this film resembles original db it is disgrace no wonder they use word evolution but when they say evolution i dont expect studio turns something respectable like dragonball into rubbish ive seen live action version dragonball shot by malaysian years ago although it is exact duplicate animation but movie is far better than dragonball evolution lot us are looking remake this movie,0.4348695925823586,0.12566508550551106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1,Stomped All Over My Childhood Hero & Fantasies..!!,"Dragonball Evolution was one of the films which I was terribly excited about. Goku had been one of my heroes all through my childhood. I used to hog the TV whenever it came and didn't even leave the TV for my parents to watch their favourite shows.Goku is humanity personified. He was never a boy who would go after the girl, rather he would go after the bad guys without a damn care in the world for his own safety. He was the reason why I stood up to the bullies in school and never backed down even when I would get beaten up by 4 guys at once. I always thought in my mind that if Goku could be honest, innocent and proud of his actions, so would I be. That was until my 17th year. Then the need to fit in and be cool with my peers when in college took over and all the ideals I had crashed down one by one. But, now I think back, just 4 years down the line, I am more proud of who I was rather than who I am now. That says a great deal about DRAGONBALL - the cartoon. It always stressed about the importance of love in friendships and not exclusively about love with the opposite sex. Of course, there was Master Roshi, the pervert, but it never played a part in how I grew up or how Goku developed. So, to see all my beliefs and ideals get destroyed in the film EVOLUTION, I was heart-broken. I literally wanted to strangle every damn person involved in this film (except for Emmy Rossum. She can do no wrong). The special effects are a joke. Seriously who would spend $100 million on this worthless piece of junk? I'm only glad that I didn't pay for this when it released. It was my friend's treat last year. I recently joined IMDb and had to write a review for this horrible movie.Goku never had teenage angst or crushes. It was fate that he got married to Chi Chi. I've said enough about Goku, there are his best friends Bulma and Krillin as well. In the movie (can I even call this 80 minute headache a movie??!!), Krillin wasn't even there and Bulma was the only one who got close to the actual character. Of course, in the anime also she falls for Yamcha immediately, but in the film, Yamcha's character was dumb. Chi Chi was a joke. Literal translation of Chi Chi is milk or breasts. The whole film looked like it was aimed at kids below the age of 15 and the people more than that age who have not matured past staring at the different breasts at display here. Goku's fantasy of Chi Chi eating a strawberry looked like a sex fantasy. It was disgusting. The story and some characters aren't even in the 400 episode long saga, which is divided into 3 sub-parts..!! The Kamehameha blast was ridiculous. It stomped on my childhood hero and fantasies. I wish they would re-do the whole thing. This is a hateful, irritable movie. Why couldn't they make this like the Batman, Ironman, The Hulk or Spiderman?!! This deserves -100 on 10.. But what to do IMDb doesn't let us give less than 1. So, a 1 on 10 for the actors. They couldn't do much with the terrible script here.1/10",stomped all over my childhood hero fantasies,dragonball evolution was one films which i was terribly excited about goku had been one my heroes all through my childhood i used hog tv whenever it came didnt even leave tv my parents watch their favourite shows goku is humanity personified he was never boy who would go after girl rather he would go after bad guys without damn care world his own safety he was reason why i stood up bullies school never backed down even when i would get beaten up by 4 guys at once i always thought my mind that if goku could be honest innocent proud his actions so would i be that was until my 17th year then need fit be cool with my peers when college took over all ideals i had crashed down one by one but now i think back just 4 years down line i am more proud who i was rather than who i am now that says great deal about dragonball cartoon it always stressed about importance love friendships not exclusively about love with opposite sex course there was master roshi pervert but it never played part how i grew up or how goku developed so see all my beliefs ideals get destroyed film evolution i was heart broken i literally wanted strangle every damn person involved this film except emmy rossum she can do no wrong special effects are joke seriously who would spend 100 million this worthless piece junk im only glad that i didnt pay this when it released it was my friends treat last year i recently joined imdb had write review this horrible movie goku never had teenage angst or crushes it was fate that he got married chi chi ive said enough about goku there are his best friends bulma krillin as well movie can i even call this 80 minute headache movie krillin wasnt even there bulma was only one who got close actual character course anime also she falls yamcha immediately but film yamchas character was dumb chi chi was joke literal translation chi chi is milk or breasts whole film looked like it was aimed at kids below age 15 people more than that age who have not matured past staring at different breasts at display here gokus fantasy chi chi eating strawberry looked like sex fantasy it was disgusting story some characters arent even 400 episode long saga which is divided into 3 sub parts kamehameha blast was ridiculous it stomped my childhood hero fantasies i wish they would re do whole thing this is hateful irritable movie why couldnt they make this like batman ironman hulk or spiderman this deserves 100 10 but what do imdb doesnt let us give less than 1 so 1 10 actors they couldnt do much with terrible script here 1 10,0.5511651469098278,0.07249240121580548,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
2,"Manages to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of the series","Take a childhood memory; a movie, a toy, a song, or most appropriately here, a television show. Now imagine everything you loved about that nostalgic pastime and then envision a lucky break where you were asked to direct a brand new movie adaptation of that piece of your history. And finally, ask yourself, so you think it possible to remove every single aspect that made that memory so special? Could you do it? Would you, as a fan, be literally capable? Well the people behind Dragonball Evolution certainly managed too, as they manage to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of a much loved series.Back when I was young I always found a great deal of fun to be found in the anime import Dragonball Z. I was by no means a die-hard fan; I watched only the first few seasons and even as a grade-schooler I could pick out consistent pace issues and gaps in logic. But yet, it was goofy, bloody, wildly inappropriate fun. It would stand to reason a director could draw at least some of the spirit of the Dragonball universe by simply watching the shows or reading the sources material and yet James Wong (who also directed The One and Final Destination 1 and 3) manages to do just that; change fun into camp, over-the-top violence into PG rubbish and alter any of the interesting back-story and lore of the series into an unwatchable tedious origin story.Perhaps I am missing the mark hugely, but vibe of the film is all off, and I assure you I am not an adaptation Nazi, nihilistically picking out every detail not identical to the source material but I just kept uttering under my breath ""What IS this?!?!"" To that end I am not sure who this film will impress. It will surely not draw in new fans, and as you may have gathered, I am of the impression fans will not be too thrilled either. The opening half of the film is droning, tedious schlock, which then gives way to ridiculous camp, which finally falls into an at least half-successful final act. There is also the possibility that Dragonball will simply never work as a live action adaptation, the anime medium just suits the feel and bizarre pleasure of the story and characters.The plot (a term I use loosely) is beyond excusable and consists merely of young warrior Goku (the fresh faced Justin Chatwin), his master Roshi (a mildly entertaining Chow Yun-Fat who must be strapped for cash) a feisty gun-slinger named Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and a creepy hippie conman named Yamcha (Joon Park). Joining forces, they seek to collect 7 mystical Dragonballs, which when brought together grant their holder one wish. But on their trail is the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) and an assassin (Enriko Tamura). The plot suffers further from the bit part from Piccolo which leaves the story with barely a central antagonist, and the plodding pace, unforgivable dialogue and general lack of momentum compile into just a pile of rubbish.The final battle finally brings out the style of fighting most fans are accustomed too, but it's too little to late and an insane twist involving Goku is beyond cringe-worthy. The only thing Dragonball Evolution is good for curing is a leg cramp, because 10 minutes of this film and your legs will be involuntarily shuffling out of the theatre.Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",manages drain every iota fun charm or wit out series,take childhood memory movie toy song or most appropriately here television show now imagine everything you loved about that nostalgic pastime then envision lucky break where you were asked direct brand new movie adaptation that piece your history finally ask yourself so you think it possible remove every single aspect that made that memory so special could you do it would you as fan be literally capable well people behind dragonball evolution certainly managed too as they manage drain every iota fun charm or wit out much loved series back when i was young i always found great deal fun be found anime import dragonball z i was by no means die hard fan i watched only first few seasons even as grade schooler i could pick out consistent pace issues gaps logic but yet it was goofy bloody wildly inappropriate fun it would stand reason director could draw at least some spirit dragonball universe by simply watching shows or reading sources material yet james wong who also directed one final destination 1 3 manages do just that change fun into camp over top violence into pg rubbish alter any interesting back story lore series into unwatchable tedious origin story perhaps i am missing mark hugely but vibe film is all off i assure you i am not adaptation nazi nihilistically picking out every detail not identical source material but i just kept uttering under my breath what is this that end i am not sure who this film will impress it will surely not draw new fans as you may have gathered i am impression fans will not be too thrilled either opening half film is droning tedious schlock which then gives way ridiculous camp which finally falls into at least half successful final act there is also possibility that dragonball will simply never work as live action adaptation anime medium just suits feel bizarre pleasure story characters plot term i use loosely is beyond excusable consists merely young warrior goku fresh faced justin chatwin his master roshi mildly entertaining chow yun fat who must be strapped cash feisty gun slinger named bulma emmy rossum creepy hippie conman named yamcha joon park joining forces they seek collect 7 mystical dragonballs which when brought together grant their holder one wish but their trail is evil lord piccolo james marsters assassin enriko tamura plot suffers further bit part piccolo which leaves story with barely central antagonist plodding pace unforgivable dialogue general lack momentum compile into just pile rubbish final battle finally brings out style fighting most fans are accustomed too but its too little late insane twist involving goku is beyond cringe worthy only thing dragonball evolution is good curing is leg cramp because 10 minutes this film your legs will be involuntarily shuffling out theatre read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies blogspot com,0.5910420354499303,0.05332896270396271,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"

The multi-million dollar budget has amounted to a teen drama mixed with power rangers. The final product is insulting, to say the least.The creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.To finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga's, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.If you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don't skip it, then at least don't pay for this thing.

Emmy Rossum once showed promise as PHANTOM OF THE OPERA's Christine, but this type of movie is NOT a good career move. As for Justin Chatwin's lead, well, he's just a spiky-haired prat. Elsewhere, there's an endless combination of leaden dialogue and terribly OTT fight scenes between mutating monsters and humans with superhuman powers.

2,The perfect movie for anyone who hates Dragonball Z,"Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.For one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the ""bullies"" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.I could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask ""Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for?"" This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.As a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls.",perfect movie anyone who hates dragonball z,watching dbe i can immediately tell directors everyone else involved have not watched more than few episodes entire dragonball series characters are only similar name story feels like they chewed it up spit it out whatever stuck storyboard they went with i wont ruin story but its nothing like anime as i said before characters are only similar anime by name it almost seems like they wanted make this movie as bad as far away original story as they could only time actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about master roshi yamcha one most action packed animes around they sure did opposite with movie i can count number fight scenes with one hand count how long they lasted with two hands its pretty pathetic when first fight scene with goku bullies is best he never threw even threw punch big screen debut kamehameha is sad pathetic all ki blasts look like different color fire balls they dont look pure energy like they are anime but just like slow motion fire i could go hours about what they did wrong if you have never seen anime series dont watch movie story is probably too confusing anyone who doesnt know entire back story anime movie only gives you who what but no why fact i think why sums up entire movie why did they do this why did they do that is all i was thinking during entire movie at end movie all i could do was ask why did they make this movie who did they make this movie this is not movie fans or anyone who has never seen anime it feels like they made this movie people who hate anime as fan series i will award this no points may god have mercy their souls,0.6028528528528528,-0.0038931788931788913,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1,10 Reasons Why you shouldn't watch this movie...,"This movie is not bad, it's awful. The acting is mediocre at best. The direction is bad, the special effects are not very good. You would think that a movie with a big budget would have at least have good special effects, but alas this is not the case. The thing that really bothers me is that this movie had some potential, but unfortunately the bad casting, the overall plot, the dialogue and the acting just weren't there. Here's ten reasons why you shouldn't watch this movie: 1. Bad casting - I don't know who thought it was a good idea casting Justin Chatwin as Goku or Emmy Rossum as Bulma. I think Emmy is a great actress but she is definitely not the right choice to play Bulma.2. Dubious setting - Where does this story take place. It's like some urban/desert place. The setting is way off, and they never do tell you where the story is taking place.3. Bad acting - I have nothing against Justin Chatwin, but it wasn't even like he was trying to act. The only one that I think did a tolerable job was James Masters, and even he wasn't performing to the best of his abilities.4. BAD special effects - Okay the special effects in this flick where laughable and completely not believable. I dare anyone to keep a straight face when Goku transforms into Oozaru. There were people giggling behind me, giggling...Need I say more.5. It's PG - Now there is nothing wrong with PG movies, but when the original material is violent, outrageous and bloody there's definitely something wrong. They took everything that was cool about Dragonball and erased it. They tried to make the movie so family friendly that it lost everything that made it Dragonball.6. Bad adaptation - They got the casting wrong, the characters are all wrong, the actors don't act like their counterparts. The costumes are wrong. Where's Bulma's blue hair? Where's Yamcha's scar? Nowhere near this movie that's where.7. The direction is all wrong - Did anyone really think that James Wong was ready to undertake a project this big? Now I'm not dissing James Wong as a director, I'm just saying that clearly he wasn't ready to direct and helm a big budget blockbuster.8. God-awful script - A script determines whether a movie is gonna be gold or whether is gonna be trash. The dialogue is gag worthy, it's cheesy, stereotypical, and downright lame. Some of the films important plot elements aren't fully explained, and the storyline is all over the place.9. Score - The score is actually tolerable, but it just doesn't fit the storyline, or the mood of the characters.10. Too short - I found the film's length to be too short. Why because there's too much information being cramped in. It's only 84 minutes long, which is not good for a film with so much complex story plot points. The film's length might be why it falls short.I can only conclude that this film is not worth spending ten dollars. If you're still curious go ahead watch it, but know that not only are you wasting money, but valuable time as well.",10 reasons why you shouldnt watch this movie,this movie is not bad its awful acting is mediocre at best direction is bad special effects are not very good you would think that movie with big budget would have at least have good special effects but alas this is not case thing that really bothers me is that this movie had some potential but unfortunately bad casting overall plot dialogue acting just werent there heres ten reasons why you shouldnt watch this movie 1 bad casting i dont know who thought it was good idea casting justin chatwin as goku or emmy rossum as bulma i think emmy is great actress but she is definitely not right choice play bulma 2 dubious setting where does this story take place its like some urban desert place setting is way off they never do tell you where story is taking place 3 bad acting i have nothing against justin chatwin but it wasnt even like he was trying act only one that i think did tolerable job was james masters even he wasnt performing best his abilities 4 bad special effects okay special effects this flick where laughable completely not believable i dare anyone keep straight face when goku transforms into oozaru there were people giggling behind me giggling need i say more 5 its pg now there is nothing wrong with pg movies but when original material is violent outrageous bloody theres definitely something wrong they took everything that was cool about dragonball erased it they tried make movie so family friendly that it lost everything that made it dragonball 6 bad adaptation they got casting wrong characters are all wrong actors dont act like their counterparts costumes are wrong wheres bulmas blue hair wheres yamchas scar nowhere near this movie thats where 7 direction is all wrong did anyone really think that james wong was ready undertake project this big now im not dissing james wong as director im just saying that clearly he wasnt ready direct helm big budget blockbuster 8 god awful script script determines whether movie is gonna be gold or whether is gonna be trash dialogue is gag worthy its cheesy stereotypical downright lame some films important plot elements arent fully explained storyline is all over place 9 score score is actually tolerable but it just doesnt fit storyline or mood characters 10 too short i found films length be too short why because theres too much information being cramped its only 84 minutes long which is not good film with so much complex story plot points films length might be why it falls short i can only conclude that this film is not worth spending ten dollars if youre still curious go ahead watch it but know that not only are you wasting money but valuable time as well,0.5683082349749015,-0.07778003889114998,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.22}"

1,Garbage!!!,"This movie is worst than I expected. They changed all the mythology of Dragonball series: 1) the kame-ha-me isn't done like in the series 2) the special effects suck, especially Shenlong 3) to summon Shenlong you must go to a special place, put the dragon balls in some kind of a rock with holes and summon it during the high point of the eclipse (but then Goku summons it after the eclipse!) 4) the sense of time is all wrong: in the beginning we are 2 weeks away from the eclipse but, in the next scene, we're just 4 days away 5) Oozaru appears, not because it's full moon, but because of the eclipse; it is 7 ft tall, it stays with Goku clothes on, and it have no tail!!! And another thing: Goku reversed the transformation like it was the simple thing to do.The only thing I saw that looks like the original series is Master Roshi personality and the way Goku kills Piccolo.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in may entire life. 1/10",garbage,this movie is worst than i expected they changed all mythology dragonball series 1 kame ha me isnt done like series 2 special effects suck especially shenlong 3 summon shenlong you must go special place put dragon balls some kind rock with holes summon it during high point eclipse but then goku summons it after eclipse 4 sense time is all wrong beginning we are 2 weeks away eclipse but next scene were just 4 days away 5 oozaru appears not because its full moon but because eclipse it is 7 ft tall it stays with goku clothes it have no tail another thing goku reversed transformation like it was simple thing do only thing i saw that looks like original series is master roshi personality way goku kills piccolo this is one worst movies ive ever seen may entire life 1 10,0.6776666666666666,-0.02671428571428572,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2,The Sharknado of martial art films,"Reading the reviews, it's possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fan-base for the original. For instance, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good film, but thanks to a small group of noisy 'fans' a lot of the reviews online are negative. This is not the case here. I have never seen/read the original, and I still found this to be a bad film. The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original, the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen, and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If you enjoy bad films like I do, it's worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is. 2/10",sharknado martial art films,reading reviews its possible think that this is regarded as bad purely because vocal fan base original instance star wars last jedi is good film but thanks small group noisy fans lot reviews online are negative this is not case here i have never seen read original i still found this be bad film cg effects look like something syfy original acting at times is reminiscent neil breen whole thing comes across as goofy mess trying desperately look like crouching tiger hidden dragon if you enjoy bad films like i do its worth watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is 2 10,0.507371794871795,-0.04432234432234429,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.17}"
1,Easily the worst anime adaptation I've ever seen,"Jesus, what a turd of a film.In the first place, it was probably a mistake for an American director to make this movie because nobody outside of Japan is apparently capable of treating manga/anime stories with the proper respect or fidelity. Beyond being a complete mess as an adaptation (I don't have enough fingers or toes to count what makes this movie anything BUT dragonball-related) it's such a bad, bad, bad, bad movie that it's painful to discuss.The plot (I think) has something to do with Piccolo coming to Earth after a long imprisonment(never mind why/how he got out) to try and find the dragonballs, seven mystical orbs which remain unexplained in origin. He sends his minions to find the dragonballs (never mind that he's apparently capable of leveling cities with a flick of the hand) in an awful, comical version of the Power Rangers. Then, enter Goku, the stupid turd of an excuse for a hero, who is (yes, believe me) a teenage kid in high school. I can't even begin to explain how stupid that is. Never mind his origins as a Saiyan. Never mind his training SINCE BIRTH. Never mind that he's got no backstory beyond the fetid, rotting, and stereotypical ""geeky boy in high school who has the hots for the girl who hangs around the jocks"" storyline. Oh, and Bulma is basically a Lara Croft-esquire Tomb Raider. I want to know what drugs they were taking when desiging (read: maligning) the characters for this movie.The rest of the movie involves random, stupid fight scenes which are both completely out of whack with the style that you would normally see in Dragonball and/or DBZ and also inconsistent and useless. You have some chick named ""Mai"" who is apparently Piccolo's evil henchwoman, and then out of NOWHERE, Chichi turns up in some martial arts tournament. I'm not even sure what happened up to this point. Then, they fall into a bloody ditch, meet Yamcha, and waste a good 15 minutes of the movie screwing around (this was, incidentally, one of the few actual events from the manga). The rest of the movie makes so little sense it's unbearably hard to talk about.Seriously, what the hell were they thinking while making this? Were they TRYING to turn out an awful product, or did James Wong have a checklist of ""stereotypical BS to stick into a mediocre movie""? I feel like my eyes need to be cauterized after watching that bilge. Don't waste your money or time on this. PLEASE.",easily worst anime adaptation ive ever seen,jesus what turd film first place it was probably mistake american director make this movie because nobody outside japan is apparently capable treating manga anime stories with proper respect or fidelity beyond being complete mess as adaptation i dont have enough fingers or toes count what makes this movie anything but dragonball related its such bad bad bad bad movie that its painful discuss plot i think has something do with piccolo coming earth after long imprisonment never mind why how he got out try find dragonballs seven mystical orbs which remain unexplained origin he sends his minions find dragonballs never mind that hes apparently capable leveling cities with flick hand awful comical version power rangers then enter goku stupid turd excuse hero who is yes believe me teenage kid high school i cant even begin explain how stupid that is never mind his origins as saiyan never mind his training since birth never mind that hes got no backstory beyond fetid rotting stereotypical geeky boy high school who has hots girl who hangs around jocks storyline oh bulma is basically lara croft esquire tomb raider i want know what drugs they were taking when desiging read maligning characters this movie rest movie involves random stupid fight scenes which are both completely out whack with style that you would normally see dragonball or dbz also inconsistent useless you have some chick named mai who is apparently piccolos evil henchwoman then out nowhere chichi turns up some martial arts tournament im not even sure what happened up this point then they fall into bloody ditch meet yamcha waste good 15 minutes movie screwing around this was incidentally one few actual events manga rest movie makes so little sense its unbearably hard talk about seriously what hell were they thinking while making this were they trying turn out awful product or did james wong have checklist stereotypical bs stick into mediocre movie i feel like my eyes need be cauterized after watching that bilge dont waste your money or time this please,0.5255555555555557,-0.24219387755102034,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1,How did this come to Theatres? And who signed off on it?,"Okay, let me start by saying. At age 8 I found out about Dragonball, I watched the entire season, all the way into the uncut fully Japanese airing of Dragon Ball Z, and then segued into GT. I am 23 now and have long stopped caring about anything ANIME. However, when I caught wind of this, I ignored all the e-chiming in my forums and IM's and immediately located the trailer. Needless to say I laughed and thought it was another Prank (like the Zelda trailer back in 07).So, with that said, know, this is coming from someone who nerded out to Dragonball series for years, and have long since grown out of that liking into almost disliking the entire thing. However I was drawn to check it out anyways.This movie, is probably the worst series -> movie ever made. This movie is good to use to make other movies grand. Ever want to push through a horrible movie just to say you watched it? Well kill two with one stone, watch this one, then go watch the other and you'll have such a biased stance on films in that moment you'll love it. Dragonball Evolution fails on every point.So before I dismantle this movie, I will note one good thing about it. It had: Emmy Rossum. Granted, her role wasn't classy like her other ones, but she is a nice actress to come across, and she brought back sexiness combined with duel wielding pistols.So for the non-nerd people who may go see this for any other reason than ""being a fan (or old fan) of the show(s)"". This movie fails at being anything worth a fighting or action movie. There is one cool fight scene, and I promise you, you can save time and just go watch the clip of The Forbidden Kingdom fight of JC and JL.Sorry, but watching a pasty white boy doing karate is actually insulting to my own eyes. I almost gave up on modern American Kung Fu movies when I saw Forbidden Kingdom, but after watching that weaselly looking Gokou, I have officially given up. We can only hope that Stephen Chow makes another movie soon to give us hope that China is still in the race to make Kung Fu movies.The graphics of this movie reminded me of the bulky techno special effects from Super Mario Brothers. Yea, the one with John John Leguizamo. The energy fights were anything but spectacular. Want an idea of what they looked like? Go watch that Covenant Movie (yes, the one about male witches being cool, right?). Remember the end to that movie with the energy ball fight? Well add blue and red to those balls and there you have it. But dare I say - THE COVENANT MAGICAL FIGHT was more intense, and better done than the DRAGONBALL ENERGY FIGHT.Also, when the characters would produce intelligence on the plot and foreground to background of the history of this world they live on, it sounded worst than your 10th grade history teacher teaching you about Sumatra. It was as if the actors were holding their scripts in their own hands and reading right off of it. Luckily, Rossum, didn't do any explaining, so her image is at least not so tarnished from this movie.Finally, for those wondering, isn't Dragonball from Asia, and don't all the characters from the first and second series have Japanese related names. (I say first and second as Pan and Bra don't really fit). However in this movie, there's only 4 Asian characters. The rest of the characters look like they got lost on their way to the MEAN GIRLS 2 set. (No, there isn't going to be another one. Sorry.) As for old school fans of the Anime. As you can read, this movie lacks anything cool for any outsiders view. The fighting is horrible, the graphics are lame, the acting is atrocious. As for comparing it to the show? They got the characters names right, and that's about it.Just watch the trailers and teasers. You'll be able to see. Even the profound KamehameHa move sounds like it is done by a pubescent teenager.Avoid this movie, at all costs.Note the director's name, avoid that as well.",how did this come theatres who signed off it,okay let me start by saying at age 8 i found out about dragonball i watched entire season all way into uncut fully japanese airing dragon ball z then segued into gt i am 23 now have long stopped caring about anything anime however when i caught wind this i ignored all e chiming my forums ims immediately located trailer needless say i laughed thought it was another prank like zelda trailer back 07 so with that said know this is coming someone who nerded out dragonball series years have long since grown out that liking into almost disliking entire thing however i was drawn check it out anyways this movie is probably worst series movie ever made this movie is good use make other movies grand ever want push through horrible movie just say you watched it well kill two with one stone watch this one then go watch other youll have such biased stance films that moment youll love it dragonball evolution fails every point so before i dismantle this movie i will note one good thing about it it had emmy rossum granted her role wasnt classy like her other ones but she is nice actress come across she brought back sexiness combined with duel wielding pistols so non nerd people who may go see this any other reason than being fan or old fan show s this movie fails at being anything worth fighting or action movie there is one cool fight scene i promise you you can save time just go watch clip forbidden kingdom fight jc jl sorry but watching pasty white boy doing karate is actually insulting my own eyes i almost gave up modern american kung fu movies when i saw forbidden kingdom but after watching that weaselly looking gokou i have officially given up we can only hope that stephen chow makes another movie soon give us hope that china is still race make kung fu movies graphics this movie reminded me bulky techno special effects super mario brothers yea one with john john leguizamo energy fights were anything but spectacular want idea what they looked like go watch that covenant movie yes one about male witches being cool right remember end that movie with energy ball fight well add blue red those balls there you have it but dare i say covenant magical fight was more intense better done than dragonball energy fight also when characters would produce intelligence plot foreground background history this world they live it sounded worst than your 10th grade history teacher teaching you about sumatra it was as if actors were holding their scripts their own hands reading right off it luckily rossum didnt do any explaining so her image is at least not so tarnished this movie finally those wondering isnt dragonball asia dont all characters first second series have japanese related names i say first second as pan bra dont really fit however this movie theres only 4 asian characters rest characters look like they got lost their way mean girls 2 set no there isnt going be another one sorry as old school fans anime as you can read this movie lacks anything cool any outsiders view fighting is horrible graphics are lame acting is atrocious as comparing it show they got characters names right thats about it just watch trailers teasers youll be able see even profound kamehameha move sounds like it is done by pubescent teenager avoid this movie at all costs note directors name avoid that as well,0.5382597117794485,0.03602828092959673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"
