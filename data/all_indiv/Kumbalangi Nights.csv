9,A real cracker of a film! [+86%],"Kumbalangi Nights is, without a doubt, a simple yet magical tale that the ever-dependable Syam Pushkaran has penned and Madhu C Narayanan has directed. Why I mention these two names before everyone else's is because I wish to emphasize how the former's effortlessly brilliant writing and the latter's craft are integral to the success of this film. There is a sense of conviction in each of the scenes that Pushkaran has written and they've been rendered scintillatingly fresh by Narayanan. Supported greatly by the marvellous cinematography by Shyju Khalid and the hauntingly relaxing musical score by Sushin Shyam, Kumbalangi Nights ensures that it was meant to be 2019's first gem. I cannot even find the right superlatives to describe the performances put in by members of the cast; be it the four brothers - Bobby (Shane Nigam), Saji (Soubin Shahir), Boney (Sreenath Bhasi), and Franky (Mathew Thomas), or the womenfolk who enter the men's lives - Babymol (Anna Ben), Nylah (Jasmine Metivier), and Sathy (Sheela Rajkumar); of course, what rounds off the cast is the cleverly underwritten antagonist Shammy (Fahadh Faasil).It is an islet universe than Syam and Madhu take us to, in Kumbalangi Nights, and a beautiful one indeed. The layers attributed to each character in this universe that they've built is what makes the film so utterly grounded, situationally funny, and shockingly disturbing at the same time. The dialogues of the movie clearly portray how skilful a writer Syam Pushkaran is; he knows his characters and their surroundings inside out. Right from Franky's trophies, Bobby's Bluetooth speakers, Saji's smoke-free kitchen, and Boney's moonwalk, the protagonists have been given the sort of texture that is difficult to replicate. They are flawed individuals who haven't got a clue about adulting and still get into brawls over the silliest of matters, yet have an unspoken sense of affection for each other which is hard to ignore and wish to make things better for themselves. Shammy, on the other hand, is a mystery throughout. He carries the kind of smirk that comes across as innocent and affable at times and the absolute creepiest at others.An uncanny masterstroke setting the story in ravishing rural Kochi where one household tries to get its familial foundation back together and the other ultimately crumbling into little fragments, I cannot imagine Kumbalangi Nights taking place anywhere else. Right from the use of fishing nets as a picnic bed for the lovers to the astonishingly charming moonlit nights, Kumbalangi is indeed its own character in the movie. The romantic angles in the movie have their share of cute 'aww' moments even when they stay completely in touch with everything that happens in the film. Anna Ben's character Babymol is, in a way, pivotal to pushing the storyline forward. She is the connecting link between the two families (one that's visibly worn out and trying hard to stitch itself back together and one that's doing pretty fine in the conventional sense of it, but is inching towards imminent doom) and together with her sister Simi (Grace Antony, who gets to shine in a scene right before the climax), and buddy Sumisha (Riya Saira), fortunately, gift the viewers sensible, memorable female characters. In another film, the character of Sathy wouldn't have even been an afterthought. But in Kumbalangi Nights, her character is as essential to the plot just as the rest of them are.There's no shortage of praise for the men either - Shane adds a youthful dazzle to 'freak machan' Bobby; Soubin, in one of his career-best performances, proves he's one of the finest character actors of our times when he portrays the good-for-nothing but overly emotional Saji; Sreenath Bhasi is admirable as the mute Boney; Mathew Thomas, as Franky, conveys the transition from sadness to happiness in the Napolean household pretty well. Fahadh Faasil, as we all know, is in a league of his own, and as Shammy, the man delivers nothing short of a stunner. Believe me when I say that the climax has a fantastic surprise in store as well. I guess I can keep raving about Kumbalangi Nights till I see Syam Pushkaran come up with something even more brilliant; until then, this is the benchmark that Malayalam cinema needs to look up to. This is exactly how you tell an engaging story even when the plot is ridiculously simple. The people of Kumbalangi really do enjoy little things - like their fishy curry, their music, their little romantic moments, and of course, the virtue of humanity and the power of healing. These little (yet not-so-little) things make Kumbalangi Nights one of the best films in recent memory. Three cheers and two thumbs up!",real cracker film,kumbalangi nights is without doubt simple yet magical tale that ever dependable syam pushkaran has penned madhu c narayanan has directed why i mention these two names before everyone elses is because i wish emphasize how formers effortlessly brilliant writing latters craft are integral success this film there is sense conviction each scenes that pushkaran has written theyve been rendered scintillatingly fresh by narayanan supported greatly by marvellous cinematography by shyju khalid hauntingly relaxing musical score by sushin shyam kumbalangi nights ensures that it was meant be 2019s first gem i cannot even find right superlatives describe performances put by members cast be it four brothers bobby shane nigam saji soubin shahir boney sreenath bhasi franky mathew thomas or womenfolk who enter mens lives babymol anna ben nylah jasmine metivier sathy sheela rajkumar course what rounds off cast is cleverly underwritten antagonist shammy fahadh faasil it is islet universe than syam madhu take us kumbalangi nights beautiful one indeed layers attributed each character this universe that theyve built is what makes film so utterly grounded situationally funny shockingly disturbing at same time dialogues movie clearly portray how skilful writer syam pushkaran is he knows his characters their surroundings inside out right frankys trophies bobbys bluetooth speakers sajis smoke free kitchen boneys moonwalk protagonists have been given sort texture that is difficult replicate they are flawed individuals who havent got clue about adulting still get into brawls over silliest matters yet have unspoken sense affection each other which is hard ignore wish make things better themselves shammy other hand is mystery throughout he carries kind smirk that comes across as innocent affable at times absolute creepiest at others uncanny masterstroke setting story ravishing rural kochi where one household tries get its familial foundation back together other ultimately crumbling into little fragments i cannot imagine kumbalangi nights taking place anywhere else right use fishing nets as picnic bed lovers astonishingly charming moonlit nights kumbalangi is indeed its own character movie romantic angles movie have their share cute aww moments even when they stay completely touch with everything that happens film anna bens character babymol is way pivotal pushing storyline forward she is connecting link between two families one thats visibly worn out trying hard stitch itself back together one thats doing pretty fine conventional sense it but is inching towards imminent doom together with her sister simi grace antony who gets shine scene right before climax buddy sumisha riya saira fortunately gift viewers sensible memorable female characters another film character sathy wouldnt have even been afterthought but kumbalangi nights her character is as essential plot just as rest them are theres no shortage praise men either shane adds youthful dazzle freak machan bobby soubin one his career best performances proves hes one finest character actors our times when he portrays good nothing but overly emotional saji sreenath bhasi is admirable as mute boney mathew thomas as franky conveys transition sadness happiness napolean household pretty well fahadh faasil as we all know is league his own as shammy man delivers nothing short stunner believe me when i say that climax has fantastic surprise store as well i guess i can keep raving about kumbalangi nights till i see syam pushkaran come up with something even more brilliant until then this is benchmark that malayalam cinema needs look up this is exactly how you tell engaging story even when plot is ridiculously simple people kumbalangi really do enjoy little things like their fishy curry their music their little romantic moments course virtue humanity power healing these little yet not so little things make kumbalangi nights one best films recent memory three cheers two thumbs up,0.5715238095238094,0.2238333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10,Human poetry,"Beauty of Kumbalangi mesmerisingly cinematographed by Shyju Khalid would easily evoke yearning for the beautiful homeland in any non-resident keralite. Kumbalangi nights specifically is captured exceptionally beautifully.Soubin's character of Saji has been brilliantly conceived and Soubin has played Saji to perfection. Soubin has plenty of challenging scenes, all challenges won with flying colors.Characterization of Shammy has been just as outstanding - hats off to Shyam Pushkaran for such unique and fresh conceptions. Fahadh has played Shammy to perfection as well. Expectation from Fahadh has indeed taken a very big leap and perfect portrayals do not seem to merit particular mention any more. He is the Messi of acting!The song ""Cherathukal' is so soulful and captivating. However,it felt wasted in the movie as it was not blended in well. Music actually was pretty good. Background music felt even better. ""Silent Cat"" and ""Cherathukal"" were awesome songs - some of the other songs did not match Bijibal's finesse in Thondimuthalum/Maheshinte Prathikaram. The script keeps navigating the viewer into banks of rich realism. While this journey was enjoyable, towards the end, was wondering if the movie would end on one of those banks. Instead, the movie delivers serious punch towards the end before signing off almost nonchalantly.Subtitles of the movie were below par. Did not match the vibe/spirit of the conversations.Everyone has acted well. Kumbalangi nights is beautiful - as a movie and as seen through Shyju Khalid's eyes. Direction is excellent.

And that's where lies the beauty of the film and the talent of the filmmaker. He creates a world so real, emotions so raw, that you cannot but feel for the characters. Soubin has delivered a performance which is par excellence & his scene with the psychiatrist is a cathartic experience not just for him but for the audience as well. Under any other actor Shammy would have been a caricature, but Fahad is brilliant & original as usual. Anna Ben is impressive & Shane Nigam is charming.

9,There are actors and then there are actors and then there is Fahadh.,"Watching the movie I was thinking.....this is Fahadh....he played Mahesh Bhavana....it is not possible that he is the villain....in the end it will turn out that he was a good guy all along. That was just phenomenally good acting. It's mind boggling how versatile he is. Fahadh is to Kumbalangi Nights what Dulquer was to Parava. I don't think we should wait for the year to end to give out the Malayalam movie awards. Might as well give it already to Fahadh for Best Supporting Actor and Best Villain.The movie itself is a coming of age drama focussing on the four children of Napoleon and his wife. The girl who plays Baby is really beautiful and she can also act which was good to see. Soubin is brilliant as usual. For someone who doesn't watch many Malayalam movies ,surprisingly I have watched both Eeda and Kismath and it was good to see Shane Nigam get a non- depressing part for once. Even though every actor in the movie has done a commendable job it is Fahadh who steals the show. If you have to compare him to a present day actor I would say that he is as good as Jake Gyllenhaal if not better. No one even comes close. I hope they make Nightcrawler in Malayalam with Fahadh as the lead. That would be something.The new year has started on a good note for the Malayalam film industry and let's hope that they continue to roll out good movies.Shammi hero aada...hero.",there are actors then there are actors then there is fahadh,watching movie i was thinking this is fahadh he played mahesh bhavana it is not possible that he is villain end it will turn out that he was good guy all along that was just phenomenally good acting its mind boggling how versatile he is fahadh is kumbalangi nights what dulquer was parava i dont think we should wait year end give out malayalam movie awards might as well give it already fahadh best supporting actor best villain movie itself is coming age drama focussing four children napoleon his wife girl who plays baby is really beautiful she can also act which was good see soubin is brilliant as usual someone who doesnt watch many malayalam movies surprisingly i have watched both eeda kismath it was good see shane nigam get non depressing part once even though every actor movie has done commendable job it is fahadh who steals show if you have compare him present day actor i would say that he is as good as jake gyllenhaal if not better no one even comes close i hope they make nightcrawler malayalam with fahadh as lead that would be something new year has started good note malayalam film industry lets hope that they continue roll out good movies shammi hero aada hero,0.5311688311688312,0.4350649350649351,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.2}"

Their relationship progresses to another level when Saji, Boney, and Franky decide to help Bobby stand by his love. . . 👨‍⚖️ Review : Not every now and then comes a film which dazzles you with its frames, music, and beauty of its characters but this movie bends that notion. Kumbalangi Night is one beautifully framed tale of brotherhood, love and way of life. Sushin Shyam's music warms your heart and Shyju Khalid's splendid work bebind the camera makes this one of the best Malayalam movies of recent times. Beautiful Backdrops of Kumbalangi and Magical Music elevates the brilliance of the script.Story of 4 brothers Shaji (Soubin), Bonny(Sreenath), Bobby (Shane) and Frankie (Mathew) where all lead a messed up life because of their arrogrance, disagreements and differences with each other. When Bobby falls in love with Baby (Anna Ben) , things slowly fall in place until Shammy (Fahadh Faasil), Baby's Brother in Law comes into the picture. Bobby(Shane) and Baby(Anna Ben) are amazing and brilliantly add the elements of romance into this movie. The Charactizations of Shammy and Shaji are the highlights of the movie and probably the actors have given their career best for these two roles. Fahadh Faasil as the antagonist dazzles the audience with a never before avatar. Soubin as Shaji has given a superlative performance of man who has nothing good to expect.Director Madhu C Narayanan charactization and Shyam Puskaran 's writing is beyond words.

9,Kumbalangi Nights is probably one of the most heartfelt movies that you can come across this year,"I'm not understating that headline.Kumbalangi Nights is perhaps the most beautiful theatre experience i had in recent times and there was never a moment that i had to take my eye off the screen and that itself shows how much the film manages to encapsulate you into the ways and lives of Kumbalangi. The biggest plus and the film's biggest advantage is the splendid cast itself. Nobody has done a below par job here. And with all my might, i can say that Kumbalangi Nights can make you drool for a second watch.Fahadh delivered yet again a standout performance that could have been amiss if it was handled by anyone other than him. Shammi was the character that hints a cloud of weirdness to the film. And nobody perfect to play Shammi than Fahadh himself.The art department deserves a special mention namely because of the gorgeous frames that can leave a strong and mighty impression on you.Kumbalangi is probably more of a film that can be categorised into the sigh - drama category. It can be exhausting at times ; the long takes, the more pressing characters getting a lot more attention than they should and more. But the pros totally eclipses the cons, and you might never notice those.This film is what the industry needs among the landfill of 'realistic' movies where the protagonist takes a dump and categorise it realistic and poignant, Kumbalangi Nights stand out from the busy crowd and earns a spot so high it can applaud for itself.",kumbalangi nights is probably one most heartfelt movies that you can come across this year,im not understating that headline kumbalangi nights is perhaps most beautiful theatre experience i had recent times there was never moment that i had take my eye off screen that itself shows how much film manages encapsulate you into ways lives kumbalangi biggest plus films biggest advantage is splendid cast itself nobody has done below par job here with all my might i can say that kumbalangi nights can make you drool second watch fahadh delivered yet again standout performance that could have been amiss if it was handled by anyone other than him shammi was character that hints cloud weirdness film nobody perfect play shammi than fahadh himself art department deserves special mention namely because gorgeous frames that can leave strong mighty impression you kumbalangi is probably more film that can be categorised into sigh drama category it can be exhausting at times long takes more pressing characters getting lot more attention than they should more but pros totally eclipses cons you might never notice those this film is what industry needs among landfill realistic movies where protagonist takes dump categorise it realistic poignant kumbalangi nights stand out busy crowd earns spot so high it can applaud itself,0.5610164835164836,0.29969780219780223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9,PHENOMENAL!,"Easily my favourite Malayalam film in the recent years. The hype for this film had set a damn high expectation and still the film was way better than expected. The cinematography, direction, script, performances everything was top notch. As cherry on top references and homages including The Beatles and The Shining to the much more close to home Maayanadhi and Varathan and a lot more. This film deserves to be discussed again and again and cross examined for its nuances. The portrayal and deconstruction of traditional masculinity and the ending which went on an unexpected direction and shows what is the true inner self of such people who have been portrayed as heroes for decades in Malayalam cinema.",phenomenal,easily my favourite malayalam film recent years hype this film had set damn high expectation still film was way better than expected cinematography direction script performances everything was top notch as cherry top references homages including beatles shining much more close home maayanadhi varathan lot more this film deserves be discussed again again cross examined its nuances portrayal deconstruction traditional masculinity ending which went unexpected direction shows what is true inner self such people who have been portrayed as heroes decades malayalam cinema,0.505625,0.24645833333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10,Story about social structure of right and wrong,"Straight to the point, ""What makes this story special?"" The answer lies in the fact that over the time human's conscience has started questioning the rights and wrongs of our society. There is no absolute right or wrong in our lifetime here. This law is applicable to every scenario we face in this world. The one consistent thing we shall ensure to have a peaceful lifetime is to make sure we embrace love close to our heart. And this idea makes the story special! Director Madhu C Narayanan is largely successful in displaying this thought at the same time incorporating all the good and not so good elements of our society. The story is soft and light hearted while exploring the emotions of every characters but the BGM plays crucial role in evoking the feeling of viewers. Every character has put their heart out while playing their part especially Soubin Shahir with his acting skills has made eyes wet at many instances. Fahad Fasil once again proves his immense talent with character Shammy who is grey shaded but leaves a strong impression. The cinematography, art direction, location selection and BGM have been accurate. The narrative is new and refreshing which takes time for us to get immersed to their lives almost till end of first half but story turns unkind and leaves us guessing what's up next in second half. The strong point of script is all the character's emotions are well connected to their past and secondly the movie is really funny and unpredictable at times. The only weak point of the movie is that at many instance the audibility falls below par and leaves the audience guessing.Viewer rating: 5/5 Critic point of view: 4/5",story about social structure right wrong,straight point what makes this story special answer lies fact that over time humans conscience has started questioning rights wrongs our society there is no absolute right or wrong our lifetime here this law is applicable every scenario we face this world one consistent thing we shall ensure have peaceful lifetime is make sure we embrace love close our heart this idea makes story special director madhu c narayanan is largely successful displaying this thought at same time incorporating all good not so good elements our society story is soft light hearted while exploring emotions every characters but bgm plays crucial role evoking feeling viewers every character has put their heart out while playing their part especially soubin shahir with his acting skills has made eyes wet at many instances fahad fasil once again proves his immense talent with character shammy who is grey shaded but leaves strong impression cinematography art direction location selection bgm have been accurate narrative is new refreshing which takes time us get immersed their lives almost till end first half but story turns unkind leaves us guessing whats up next second half strong point script is all characters emotions are well connected their past secondly movie is really funny unpredictable at times only weak point movie is that at many instance audibility falls below par leaves audience guessing viewer rating 5 5 critic point view 4 5,0.5350239407057589,0.15902449822904371,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,GEM of a Movie!!!!,"Thanks to this lockdown quarantine period, had a privilege of seeing this beautiful film. It's a story of 4 brothers, who stay in a lovely serene village. All are in loggerheads initially and how they unfold together and bond strongly is the basic premise.The way the movie transcends and shows the family bond is shot aesthetically. The shift in the genre of this film, is the highlight and it was brilliant. The way the characters are established, the way the lovely surrounding, nature and serene village was established makes us to connect with the movie to core. Now coming to the performance, all the 4 brothers portrayed by Soubin shahir, Shane nigam, Sreenath bhasi and Mathew Thomas was outstanding. And all the other supporting cast provided complete justice to their characters.Now the scene stealer is the man 'Fahadh Faasil'!!! OMG, is just got chills with his mind blowing performance especially in the climax. Without exaggerating it was quite equal to Jack Nicholson's performance in 'Shining' and Heath ledgers performance in 'Dark knight'. Just see the movie to witness it. Easily one of the best actor from India!!!Would strongly recommend this film, to be watched especially during a Friday night!!! The fine human connection which is sprinkled all over the movie, gives a whiff of fresh air!! This movie is a connoisseur of different genre such as drama, comedy, romance and thriller!!

Also my first movie of Fahadh Fazil, I'll be searching you up bud to see what other characters you have in you. Every actors in this movie were my first on viewing. I always stick to the classic Malyalam movie to see the era of the 90's when I left Kerala to the 🇺🇸 when I was 9yrs old, there's more to that but This movie was refreshing.
