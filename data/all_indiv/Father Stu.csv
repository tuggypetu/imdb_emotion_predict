8.0,Father Stu(2022),".""I am calling it right now Wahlberg is getting an Oscar nomination for his role as Father Stu ."" For six years, Wahlberg had been so driven to tell the story of Father Stu that he self-financed the movie. He said he spent ""millions and millions of dollars"" to get it made.Wahlberg gained 30 pounds for his new movie ""Father Stu."" To gain weight, the actor started with an initial two-week 7,000-calorie-a-day diet plan. Then during the last four weeks, he upped his intake to 11,000 calories a day.""A dozen eggs, dozen pieces of bacon, two bowls of white rice, a cup of olive oil to start the morning,"" he said. ""More eggs, a porterhouse steak. That's seven to eight meals a day of this.""The weight gain was one aspect of the performance, but Wahlberg noted that he felt it was the only way to show the audience just how much Long had changed by the end of his life. ""Everything about Stu was predicated on his physicality. To see him lose that but to gain the strength of a thousand men spiritually, it was unbelievable. I wanted the audience to see that and understand it,"" he explained.Mark Wahlberg looks unrecognizable.Based on a true story, Father Stu is an unflinchingly honest, funny and ultimately uplifting drama about a lost soul who finds his purpose in a most unexpected place. When an injury ends his amateur boxing career, Stuart Long (Mark Wahlberg) moves to L. A. dreaming of stardom. While scraping by as a supermarket clerk, he meets Carmen (Teresa Ruiz), a Catholic Sunday school teacher who seems immune to his bad-boy charm. Determined to win her over, the longtime agnostic starts going to church to impress her. But surviving a terrible motorcycle accident leaves him wondering if he can use his second chance to help others find their way, leading to the surprising realization that he is meant to be a Catholic priest. Despite a devastating health crisis and the skepticism of Church officials and his estranged parents (Mel Gibson and Jacki Weaver), Stu pursues his vocation with courage and compassion, inspiring not only those closest to him but countless others along the way.",father stu 2022,i am calling it right now wahlberg is getting oscar nomination his role as father stu six years wahlberg had been so driven tell story father stu that he self financed movie he said he spent millions millions dollars get it made wahlberg gained 30 pounds his new movie father stu gain weight actor started with initial two week 7 000 calorie day diet plan then during last four weeks he upped his intake 11 000 calories day dozen eggs dozen pieces bacon two bowls white rice cup olive oil start morning he said more eggs porterhouse steak thats seven eight meals day this weight gain was one aspect performance but wahlberg noted that he felt it was only way show audience just how much long had changed by end his life everything about stu was predicated his physicality see him lose that but gain strength thousand men spiritually it was unbelievable i wanted audience see that understand it he explained mark wahlberg looks unrecognizable based true story father stu is unflinchingly honest funny ultimately uplifting drama about lost soul who finds his purpose most unexpected place when injury ends his amateur boxing career stuart long mark wahlberg moves l dreaming stardom while scraping by as supermarket clerk he meets carmen teresa ruiz catholic sunday school teacher who seems immune his bad boy charm determined win her over longtime agnostic starts going church impress her but surviving terrible motorcycle accident leaves him wondering if he can use his second chance help others find their way leading surprising realization that he is meant be catholic priest despite devastating health crisis skepticism church officials his estranged parents mel gibson jacki weaver stu pursues his vocation with courage compassion inspiring not only those closest him but countless others along way,0.5385642135642137,0.04406926406926408,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Absolutely moving,"Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson star in this unbelievable true story that will have you sobbing in tears when the lights turn on. From the opening scene to the end of the credits it's like your in the room watching them film this.Father Stu is not your ordinary faith base movie it is rated R for language throughout and to be honest this movie probably needed it. This in my opinion was probably one of Mark's better movies in years and same with Mel one of his best in years. They are great actors on their own, but every movie that they do together is a masterpiece.Like I said this is rated R so don't go in to this thinking it's a family film and I guess it is in the fact that it's a faith film, but just with tons of language. I highly recommend seeing Father Stu.",absolutely moving,mark wahlberg mel gibson star this unbelievable true story that will have you sobbing tears when lights turn opening scene end credits its like your room watching them film this father stu is not your ordinary faith base movie it is rated r language throughout be honest this movie probably needed it this my opinion was probably one marks better movies years same with mel one his best years they are great actors their own but every movie that they do together is masterpiece like i said this is rated r so dont go this thinking its family film i guess it is fact that its faith film but just with tons language i highly recommend seeing father stu,0.6804166666666666,0.24250000000000005,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.54, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8.0,Good thing the movie was based on a real person,"Truth is stranger than fiction. I enjoyed the film but wish there had been subtitles. Sometimes some of the characters mumbled so much that even though there were extreme close ups with no distractions, many times I was unable to understand what was being said. I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my ability to follow the movie until afterward when I went in the restroom, I heard everyone in there saying the same thing. Probably some of the problem might have had to do with unfamiliar slang but most of it was the way the words were enunciated. Don't let that stop you from seeing it though. It is still worth seeing.",good thing movie was based real person,truth is stranger than fiction i enjoyed film but wish there had been subtitles sometimes some characters mumbled so much that even though there were extreme close ups with no distractions many times i was unable understand what was being said i began wonder if there was something wrong with my ability follow movie until afterward when i went restroom i heard everyone there saying same thing probably some problem might have had do with unfamiliar slang but most it was way words were enunciated dont let that stop you seeing it though it is still worth seeing,0.49318181818181817,0.16136363636363635,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,A story of conversion!,"Being Catholic I have been taught about Lent and conversion. Father Stu is a story of conversion. Stu has let's say a colorful life. A boxer, anger towards God, and a broken family which anger is about Stu's brothers death. Fresh and a new story; I never seen a film quite like Father Stu. There is a reality, which the viewer can relate with. Wahlberg had a great role, but Gibson outshines everyone in a supporting role of the troubled dad.. Wahlberg's conversion starts with the end of a boxing career, (maybe the start of an illness) and a chance meeting with a girl. The conversion process slowly starts. There is the question of do we build faith in our weakness, and sufferings. A priest once mentioned this mystery to me once. Father Stu gives answers to such faith questions. But Father Stu has many more questions. Was it Jesus, or a saint at the bar? Was there vision Marry? There is a mystery we the viewer are not told. Threw Stu's term oil, and illness the viewer experience a conversion and God's plan. Stu threw others, there is a conversion experience with others. Father Stu will bother you because of the rawness with the movie. Many reasons to be resentful with anger, and one reason to be happy? A hard life, which reflects hard questions. Well acted and directed! 9 stars.",story conversion,being catholic i have been taught about lent conversion father stu is story conversion stu has lets say colorful life boxer anger towards god broken family which anger is about stus brothers death fresh new story i never seen film quite like father stu there is reality which viewer can relate with wahlberg had great role but gibson outshines everyone supporting role troubled dad wahlbergs conversion starts with end boxing career maybe start illness chance meeting with girl conversion process slowly starts there is question do we build faith our weakness sufferings priest once mentioned this mystery me once father stu gives answers such faith questions but father stu has many more questions was it jesus or saint at bar was there vision marry there is mystery we viewer are not told threw stus term oil illness viewer experience conversion gods plan stu threw others there is conversion experience with others father stu will bother you because rawness with movie many reasons be resentful with anger one reason be happy hard life which reflects hard questions well acted directed 9 stars,0.47041467304625195,0.010685805422647538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,You WILL laugh and you WILL cry,"IN A NUTSHELL: After surviving a motorcycle accident, a former boxer and longtime agnostic starts to wonder if he can use his second chance to help others, leading to the surprising realization that he's meant to be a Catholic priest.The film was written and directed by first-time filmmaker Rosalind Ross, Mel Gibson's girlfriend.THINGS I LIKED: I love Oscar Nominee Mark Wahlberg in everything he does. He's equally convincing in dramas and comedies. In this movie, he even sings! He funded this film himself after being turned down by several movie studios. He gained about 30 pounds for this role, eating up to 11,000 calories a day to prepare before filming the scenes in Act 3! It's quite a transformation. He and Mel Gibson are said to both be devout Catholics.Academy Award winner Mel Gibson is fantastic in this. He's in a relationship with the writer/director, and his daughter-in-law, Annet Mahendru, also appears in the movie as the Virgin Mary in a vision.Another cast member who is an Oscar nominee is Jacki Weaver.Other cast members include Teresa Ruiz and Niko Nicotera.We get to see the real Father Stu during the closing credits! We see pictures, as well as video clips of his life. We also see a picture of his parents.About midway through the rolling credits at the end, there's a funny clip of Stuart giving advice to a child actress when he was trying to become a star in Hollywood.I loved the meaningful soundtrack.There are so many inspirational quotes and wisdom.Lots of humor and moving insights. You WILL laugh and you WILL cry. The movie is incredibly inspiring, but even more so because it's based on a true story.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: I can't really think of anything I didn't like. I really enjoyed this film, and I'm not even Catholic. I am Christian, however, and admire the faith and determination Father Stu demonstrated in his life.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Tons of profanity, including many F-bombs Violence Weapons You see Stuart in his terrible motorcycle accident.You can see the full review on the Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",you will laugh you will cry,nutshell after surviving motorcycle accident former boxer longtime agnostic starts wonder if he can use his second chance help others leading surprising realization that hes meant be catholic priest film was written directed by first time filmmaker rosalind ross mel gibsons girlfriend things i liked i love oscar nominee mark wahlberg everything he does hes equally convincing dramas comedies this movie he even sings he funded this film himself after being turned down by several movie studios he gained about 30 pounds this role eating up 11 000 calories day prepare before filming scenes act 3 its quite transformation he mel gibson are said both be devout catholics academy award winner mel gibson is fantastic this hes relationship with writer director his daughter law annet mahendru also appears movie as virgin mary vision another cast member who is oscar nominee is jacki weaver other cast members include teresa ruiz niko nicotera we get see real father stu during closing credits we see pictures as well as video clips his life we also see picture his parents about midway through rolling credits at end theres funny clip stuart giving advice child actress when he was trying become star hollywood i loved meaningful soundtrack there are so many inspirational quotes wisdom lots humor moving insights you will laugh you will cry movie is incredibly inspiring but even more so because its based true story things i didnt like i cant really think anything i didnt like i really enjoyed this film im not even catholic i am christian however admire faith determination father stu demonstrated his life tips parents tons profanity including many f bombs violence weapons you see stuart his terrible motorcycle accident you can see full review movie review mom youtube channel,0.47990740740740734,0.26064814814814813,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,Oscar Worthy Performances!,"Stuart Long was the kind of man you had to make a movie about and who better to play him than the great Mark Wahlberg. I'll be honest I was blown away with the weight gain Wahlberg went through for this movie as well as the raw emotions shown within it.

7.0,Really good story of religion and humanity,"I very much enjoyed this film and don't understand why it is rated as low as it is by critics. It is definitely Wahlberg's best performance of the films I've seen. The other performance I liked was Gibson. He plays his father and is a alcoholic due to the loss of his youngest son and drinks the trauma away. He plays the role so well and I really sympathised with him, cared deeply for his character and wanted him to rekindle his connection with his son Stu. His performance reminds me of Nick Nolte in Warrior who also plays a broken and drunken father. The overall plot was engaging and never felt dragged out, this was due to there being a decent amount of screen time of each major part of his life. This for me made the changes he goes through feel even more powerful because as soon as you understand more about this character a life changing event happens to Stu and he progresses as a character even further. The cinematography was pretty standard with some nice shots here and there but for the most part it was what you would expect for a Hollywood film.I think everyone would enjoy this film especially since it's based on a true story which always hooks me in a whole lot more for a film of this theme.",really good story religion humanity,i very much enjoyed this film dont understand why it is rated as low as it is by critics it is definitely wahlbergs best performance films ive seen other performance i liked was gibson he plays his father is alcoholic due loss his youngest son drinks trauma away he plays role so well i really sympathised with him cared deeply his character wanted him rekindle his connection with his son stu his performance reminds me nick nolte warrior who also plays broken drunken father overall plot was engaging never felt dragged out this was due there being decent amount screen time each major part his life this me made changes he goes through feel even more powerful because as soon as you understand more about this character life changing event happens stu he progresses as character even further cinematography was pretty standard with some nice shots here there but most part it was what you would expect hollywood film i think everyone would enjoy this film especially since its based true story which always hooks me whole lot more film this theme,0.5247222222222223,0.2234722222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"

7.0,I'm Not Even Religious And Saw This,"This movie is funnier than the ads will have you believe.The story is of a amateur (to put it kindly) boxer who is scrappy in life. He's told often that he can't do something or that life gives him hardship and his stubborn streak kicks in. To a lot of people, his persistence is read as silly and frustrating. To a lot of people he should be beaten to death in an alley somewhere in some small rural town he hails from. Until a fateful night which puts a lot of his life in perspective. Unfortunately, I don't feel that moment is enough to generate the turn of the cheek. But, writer/director Rosalind Ross was smart enough to show how little Stuart actually changes. He instead uses his blue-collar nastiness for good rather than evil. Funny to me, to say the least. I wish they would've played more in that world. Where people expect him to be pious and uptight but ends up being a thug in a collar. There may have been extra chuckles to be mined there, ala Harrison Ford getting ice cream on his face in ""Witness.""Well, the structure itself isn't anything new. And if you've seen a redemption story, you know what follows. But Mark Wahlberg does an exceptional job getting into the attitude of Stu. In a wild universe, he is Dirk Diggler grown up and trying to find salvation. Mirroring him is Mel Gibson, who plays his father who has his own moment of goodness. It's not much, but it is enough.Yes, there are a few moments that get heavy handed. That's not to say, these things didn't occur in real life. Stu is brash, and edgy and punch-drunk dumb. He goes with the theory that he doesn't know until someone tells him it's wrong, then he doubles down. His logic is that if Christ wanted him alive, it must be that he wants him to double down for him.I've no doubt that director Ross, whom is in a relationship with Mel Gibson, tapped the lighter side of the situation. In different hands, this plays as a broad parody. This was reigned in enough for it to hit where it needs to. Speaking of which...Jackie Weaver is such a blessing to watch. She embraces dialogue that would fall flat coming out of most actors' mouths and hits the right beats. Completely nails the humor beats without knowing she is funny. She is the quintessential White trash mom with a kind heart. She has a lot of darkness in her, but they do such a brilliant thing...and not make that the centralized burden to her life. She presses forward and referees two bulls. Though she is separated from her husband Mel, she harbors the right degree of resentment to a former relationship. The dynamics of their family are very clear.Any way, this is a surprisingly funny flick. I found myself laughing many times at some of the absurdity that occurs. Special shout-out to Teresa Ruiz who plays the love interest. She is warm, kind and when things go wrong, does exhibit the proper reaction and emotions. She is fantastic in this!Go check it out.

It shows a family split because of loss and alcohol coming together & healing because of Stu's transformation.What might be seen as preachy is Stu showed that the rough & gruff people can start their path to healing when one gets out of their own way & allows a bit of humility in.

10.0,Wahlberg and Gibson rock,"I have always had a lot of admiration for Mark Wahlberg since I saw him in The Departed. He played an unlikeable, foul mouthed police officer but he was very entertaining to watch. He plays a similar character here, at least in the beginning. He is a former boxer who never made it to the big time and has fallen on hard times after his last beating. He has a strained relationship with both of his parents especially his alkie father. He moves to Hollywood to try to make it in tinseltown but realizes he is but a minnow in an ocean. He strikes up a relationship with a decent woman but she refuses to see him unless he is baptized. He goes through the ritual and it becomes a real ephinany for him until he is severely injured in a car wreck and then finds out he has a rare incurable disease that will leave him crippled in body with a year to live. This is pretty depressing stuff but Mark really pulls it off well especially the scene where he breaks down in church.

8.0,Really satisfying film based on a true story....,"When I saw the trailer for this movie it looked interesting. But I saw the score from critics and it was pretty bad. This film is being called a faith based film. That is code for it must suck because it's made for Christians. Critics and Hollywood for that matter hate those films don't they? I am not Christian but I think it's so condescending to create a stigma around a film because it's subject matter may not appeal to some because it's about faith. Oh the horror!!! I'm not Christian or even that religious but that bothers me.This film is based on the true story of Father Stuart Long. Long us played but Mark Wahlberg. Stu is an ameteur boxer that is told he dlneeds to quit because a medical condition. We learn that Stu lost a brother when he was young and that he came from a broken home. Virtually no relationship with his father Bill played really well by a weathered and gruff Mel Gibson. He eventually meets Carmen, a latina Catholic girl named Carmen played by Teresa Ruiz which he immediately falls for. She is very Catholic so she rebuffs his advances because he has charm but comes of as a snake oil salesman. He starts going to church to win her over and eventually does. She falls for him and all seems well but then Stuart has a life changing event that convinces him that his mission is to become a priest. The film put a good amount of emphasis on the people that surround Stuart in his journey and all are uniformly good. For instance Jacki Weaver plays Stuarts mother really well. She loves Stu but the loss of her other son and ty he loss her marriage left her deeply scarred and she didn't seem Stuart the attention he deserved growing up. Mel Gibson is great as Bill. It's a perfect role for him because we all know that he's had some problems in the public eye that make his character more believable. The relationship between Stu and Bill doesn't dominate the film but Wahlberg and Gibson have some good chemistry as father and son. Being that true stories sometimes have a TV movie of the weak feel but the central performance by Wahlberg prevents that. I have always thought he was a serviceable actor but this performance is the best he's ever given. It's Oscar worthy but he'll probably be ignored I feel.because of the type of role he plays.This is an affecting, funny, tragic film that never gets to preachy or overdramatic but it will ilicit tears in some.I really liked it.Grade: B+",really satisfying film based true story,when i saw trailer this movie it looked interesting but i saw score critics it was pretty bad this film is being called faith based film that is code it must suck because its made christians critics hollywood that matter hate those films dont they i am not christian but i think its so condescending create stigma around film because its subject matter may not appeal some because its about faith oh horror im not christian or even that religious but that bothers me this film is based true story father stuart long long us played but mark wahlberg stu is ameteur boxer that is told he dlneeds quit because medical condition we learn that stu lost brother when he was young that he came broken home virtually no relationship with his father bill played really well by weathered gruff mel gibson he eventually meets carmen latina catholic girl named carmen played by teresa ruiz which he immediately falls she is very catholic so she rebuffs his advances because he has charm but comes as snake oil salesman he starts going church win her over eventually does she falls him all seems well but then stuart has life changing event that convinces him that his mission is become priest film put good amount emphasis people that surround stuart his journey all are uniformly good instance jacki weaver plays stuarts mother really well she loves stu but loss her other son ty he loss her marriage left her deeply scarred she didnt seem stuart attention he deserved growing up mel gibson is great as bill its perfect role him because we all know that hes had some problems public eye that make his character more believable relationship between stu bill doesnt dominate film but wahlberg gibson have some good chemistry as father son being that true stories sometimes have tv movie weak feel but central performance by wahlberg prevents that i have always thought he was serviceable actor but this performance is best hes ever given its oscar worthy but hell probably be ignored i feel because type role he plays this is affecting funny tragic film that never gets preachy or overdramatic but it will ilicit tears some i really liked it grade b,0.47918699186991875,0.17235772357723575,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.27}"
6.0,redemption,"Greetings again from the darkness. Well, if you are going to make a movie about redemption and bettering one's self, who better to cast than Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson? Both men are stars who on multiple occasions have needed redeeming. Writer-director Rosalind Ross' first feature film is based on the true story of Stuart Long, and Mr. Wahlberg was so committed to the project that he funded production when others chose not to.OK, so maybe it's a bit of a stretch having Mr. Wahlberg play the guy who becomes a priest, but that's why they call it, ""the magic of Hollywood."" Stuart Long was a real person and his story is compelling and worth sharing. Wahlberg so believed this that he self-funded the production, and clearly gave his all in the performance. My advice to anyone watching the movie is to stay seated. Things move extremely fast ... and it's that expeditious approach to storytelling that gives this a bit of a movie-of-the-week feel. Here's what I mean by fast: We see Stu (Wahlberg) as a boxer. His parents are long-divorced, and after an injury, Stu decides to head to California to be an actor. He falls in love with a girl who convinces him to get baptized, and the experience inspires him to become a Catholic priest. Severe health issues ensue, yet he persists. That's a whole lot to cover in two hours, and it explains why each piece skims only the surface and feels rushed ... and this is only a partial list!The pedigree here is beyond question. Wahlberg has twice been Oscar nominated. Two-time Oscar winner Mel Gibson plays his father, while 2-time Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver is Stu's mother. Screen legend Malcolm McDowell plays the local monsignor who finds himself in a pickle, and the always-great Colleen Camp has a brief appearance as a seen-it-all motel clerk. Teresa Ruiz is terrific as Carmen, Stu's reluctant love interest who first think she understands him, then learns she doesn't, and then ultimately respects what he's made of himself.Catholicism plays a big role here, and there is plenty of guilt to go around. Wahlberg leans heavily into his charm to help us relate to Stu, but he and Gibson both have cringe-inducing moments for those familiar with some of their off-screen activities. Gibson's 'Hitler' crack seems to walk an especially fine line. On the other hand, Gibson delivers a couple of memorable lines: one early on when he's watching young Stu dance, and another later on when the two are re-connecting as grown men. Filmmaker Ross includes some actual Stuart Long audio recordings, photographs, and video over the closing credits.Opens in theaters April 13, 2022.",redemption,greetings again darkness well if you are going make movie about redemption bettering ones self who better cast than mark wahlberg mel gibson both men are stars who multiple occasions have needed redeeming writer director rosalind ross first feature film is based true story stuart long mr wahlberg was so committed project that he funded production when others chose not ok so maybe its bit stretch having mr wahlberg play guy who becomes priest but thats why they call it magic hollywood stuart long was real person his story is compelling worth sharing wahlberg so believed this that he self funded production clearly gave his all performance my advice anyone watching movie is stay seated things move extremely fast its that expeditious approach storytelling that gives this bit movie week feel heres what i mean by fast we see stu wahlberg as boxer his parents are long divorced after injury stu decides head california be actor he falls love with girl who convinces him get baptized experience inspires him become catholic priest severe health issues ensue yet he persists thats whole lot cover two hours it explains why each piece skims only surface feels rushed this is only partial list pedigree here is beyond question wahlberg has twice been oscar nominated two time oscar winner mel gibson plays his father while 2 time oscar nominee jacki weaver is stus mother screen legend malcolm mcdowell plays local monsignor who finds himself pickle always great colleen camp has brief appearance as seen it all motel clerk teresa ruiz is terrific as carmen stus reluctant love interest who first think she understands him then learns she doesnt then ultimately respects what hes made himself catholicism plays big role here there is plenty guilt go around wahlberg leans heavily into his charm help us relate stu but he gibson both have cringe inducing moments those familiar with some their off screen activities gibsons hitler crack seems walk especially fine line other hand gibson delivers couple memorable lines one early when hes watching young stu dance another later when two are re connecting as grown men filmmaker ross includes some actual stuart long audio recordings photographs video over closing credits opens theaters april 13 2022,0.4889227642276422,0.1553861788617886,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.48}"

5.0,This fighter should've taken a knee....,"5.8/10The story itself was pretty inspirational with the whole fighting for what you believe in and going for something that you set your heart to, but the depiction falls short. Further, the religious aspect isn't overly pushy and works well as intended, but I can tell this film won't be everyone's cup of tea, like Stu's father in the movie.Mark Wahlberg is only convincing to a certain extent, but he didn't seem to fit the role all too well. Certain aspects came out stronger than others such as when he reaches a point of desperation, but he fails to capture the cockiness that he's shown in previous films.The cinematography is pretty good and captures the visuals essence quite well. The score was enjoyable too and made some points throughout more emotional. However, it took too long to get to the emotional points and caused me to lose interest very quickly.Overall, the film won't be to everyone's taste. It's a great story with a great moral, but the film depiction falls short to capture that essence. Marky Mark doesn't fit the role all to well, but he does have his moments.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time....

Mark plays Stuart, a passionate man that gives everything his best shot. Mel is his father that left home when Mark was young and doesn't associate with Mark that much-there are hard feelings from both. Teresa is a Catholic girl that Mark falls for. He even starts going to church just to be around her. Malcolm is the Monsignor at the church. Mark has it rough when he decides to become a priest, mostly with his health-he has a disease-but he continues against odds to try to accomplish his goals. It's a testament to his faith and during the end credits, you see the real Stuart talking and learn what happened after the events shown in the movie.It's rated R for language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.It's an inspirational story but not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough.

Father Stu deeply touched my heart and Spirit, brought tears to my eyes several times, and left me almost speechless.I chose to Glorify God through the experience.
