10,an-NO-END,"What an outstanding movie!! I have heard all the prior generation people rave about this movie, so, I decided to check this movie out myself. I only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this in the theater. The other reason why I decided to check this out was a Super-bowl half-time debate on whether Amitabh was better than Rajesh Khanna. I could not participate in this debate for two reasons: first, I was eagerly awaiting another ""wardrobe malfunction"" for one of the cheerleaders and secondly, I only had memories of one Rajesh Khanna movie, Haathi Mere Saathi. I remember having enjoyed it very much as a child. But that alone was not enough to quantify anything. The more recent performances of AB were fresh in my mind, but after having seen this movie, I decided that Rajesh had a class of his own. His chirpy performance in this movie is really unparalleled! What an amazing performance! Amitabh, being more junior, has not equaled Rajesh, but has done his share very well. Thus, even after watching this movie, the debate will continue.What's New? What can possibly be new in an old movie? Guess what? there is plenty for the younger generation to take away! There is no education in the movies these days, whatsoever, except perhaps bedroom or bar sequences. The inadequacies in the field of medicine are so nicely brought forward by this movie, which is certainly over 30 years old! Now, I can understand why Munnabhai MBBS was such a hit. It had so beautifully adapted from this movie to match the present generation. Kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Sanjay Dutt (& Kamal Hassan too) for carrying this forward.Noticeable: ""BaaabuMushaai"", the nick name for Amitabh, as heard from Rajesh throughout the movie, will ring in your ears even hours after you have seen the six letters ""The End"" on the screen. There really is no end to such people! Some sequences were simply amazing. Those that stood apart in my mind were the last scene, with a tape that had a significant pause in between; the moun-vrath guru, who so symbolically said that there is so much more than the decaying body to Anand's soul; then of course the Munirbhai sequences and the eventual backfiring of this strategy and so many more! The songs were so gentle and heart warming! The comic timing of Rajesh Khanna was simply amazing! Verdict Present day filmmakers really need to rework their brains and start thinking much much better! There is much more to Hindi cinema than just skin-show and catchy item number songs. This is a MUST-WATCH movie! I did not think so when others told me, but having experienced it myself, I believe them! I am gonna check out the other MUST-WATCH movies prescribed by the previous generation.",no end,what outstanding movie i have heard all prior generation people rave about this movie so i decided check this movie out myself i only have faint memories having watched parts this movie my moms lap when she dad were watching this theater other reason why i decided check this out was super bowl half time debate whether amitabh was better than rajesh khanna i could not participate this debate two reasons first i was eagerly awaiting another wardrobe malfunction one cheerleaders secondly i only had memories one rajesh khanna movie haathi mere saathi i remember having enjoyed it very much as child but that alone was not enough quantify anything more recent performances ab were fresh my mind but after having seen this movie i decided that rajesh had class his own his chirpy performance this movie is really unparalleled what amazing performance amitabh being more junior has not equaled rajesh but has done his share very well thus even after watching this movie debate will continue whats new what can possibly be new old movie guess what there is plenty younger generation take away there is no education movies these days whatsoever except perhaps bedroom or bar sequences inadequacies field medicine are so nicely brought forward by this movie which is certainly over 30 years old now i can understand why munnabhai mbbs was such hit it had so beautifully adapted this movie match present generation kudos vidhu vinod chopra sanjay dutt kamal hassan too carrying this forward noticeable baaabumushaai nick name amitabh as heard rajesh throughout movie will ring your ears even hours after you have seen six letters end screen there really is no end such people some sequences were simply amazing those that stood apart my mind were last scene with tape that had significant pause between moun vrath guru who so symbolically said that there is so much more than decaying body anands soul then course munirbhai sequences eventual backfiring this strategy so many more songs were so gentle heart warming comic timing rajesh khanna was simply amazing verdict present day filmmakers really need rework their brains start thinking much much better there is much more hindi cinema than just skin show catchy item number songs this is must watch movie i did not think so when others told me but having experienced it myself i believe them i am gonna check out other must watch movies prescribed by previous generation,0.5058103896103895,0.22444025974025972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10,Excellent Melodrama !,"Rajesh Khanna had always won acclaim and registered his credits in the box office hits, whenever he portrayed a sentimental, morally strong and emotionally focused role. He also did a great job in SAFAR, wherein he portrayed a similar role of a cancer stricken patient.Nevertheless, he is not well at portraying the roles of ""an angry man"", ""a fighting sequence"", ""an overly volatile role"" and ""clownish comedy roles"" that can all be performed in a masterly manner by his arch rival, Amitabh Bachan.However, Rajesh Khanna's personification of a lively, vivacious, death defying and winsome portrayal of a cancer stricken man was stupendously performed. His person consummately excels in mimicking soft, romantic, sad, morose and boisterously exuberant roles.Many people contend that Amitabh would had done a better characterization if he had been offered an author backed role instead of Rajesh Khanna in ANAND. Here it may be kept in mind that Amitabh could not match a stunning performance in MILLI, where his real life spouse Jaya Bahaduri outperformed him. The bullock cart scene immediately followed by the song ""Kaheen door jab din dhal Jaye"" in ANAND speaks volumes of the excellently crafted direction of Hirsihkish Mukherjee and has enlisted his name among all time great directors. This song and the one ""Zindagi Kaisi he Paheli"" touch the latent strings of sublime imagination with poignant originality, which cannot even remotely be identified anywhere, among the fast, untamed, crazy and meaningless songs of this age of Indian Cinema ......which seems to be overly swamped by the temporal, vulgar and money minting mentality of the producers, directors and actors.That is to say, there is nothing worthwhile in contemporary cinema, which happens to be laden with tawdry vulgarity and incompetent intellectual standing, vis-a-vis the cerebral and in-depth creativity of movie makers of erstwhile days.",excellent melodrama,rajesh khanna had always won acclaim registered his credits box office hits whenever he portrayed sentimental morally strong emotionally focused role he also did great job safar wherein he portrayed similar role cancer stricken patient nevertheless he is not well at portraying roles angry man fighting sequence overly volatile role clownish comedy roles that can all be performed masterly manner by his arch rival amitabh bachan however rajesh khannas personification lively vivacious death defying winsome portrayal cancer stricken man was stupendously performed his person consummately excels mimicking soft romantic sad morose boisterously exuberant roles many people contend that amitabh would had done better characterization if he had been offered author backed role instead rajesh khanna anand here it may be kept mind that amitabh could not match stunning performance milli where his real life spouse jaya bahaduri outperformed him bullock cart scene immediately followed by song kaheen door jab din dhal jaye anand speaks volumes excellently crafted direction hirsihkish mukherjee has enlisted his name among all time great directors this song one zindagi kaisi he paheli touch latent strings sublime imagination with poignant originality which cannot even remotely be identified anywhere among fast untamed crazy meaningless songs this age indian cinema which seems be overly swamped by temporal vulgar money minting mentality producers directors actors that is say there is nothing worthwhile contemporary cinema which happens be laden with tawdry vulgarity incompetent intellectual standing vis vis cerebral depth creativity movie makers erstwhile days,0.6311827956989249,0.1398826979472141,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,One of the best Hindi movies ever made.,"It is very rare for guys to shed tears after watching a movie, this movie does make you shed tears for Anand, the main protagonist played by the superstar of the 70's Rajesh Khanna.The movie has everything going for it. Acting, direction, story, music, dialogues etc... everything is fabulous. It has drama, humor, emotions in dollops. It is a story a dying man who looks at life with a positive attitude and enjoys his time knowing fully well his disease is incurable and that he is going to die soon.Rajesh Khanna as Anand is absolutely brilliant, this is his career-best performance , notwithstanding movies like Kati Patang, Roti, Aradhana, Amar Prem etc. You cannot think of any other actor in this role and to think Rajesh Khanna was not the original choice(Shashi Kapoor was). He makes you laugh and cry. He causes anxiety and goose bumps. Simply superb.Amitabh Bachchan is fantastic as babumoshai( a name with which Raj Kapoor used to address the film's director Hrishikesh Mukherjee). He showed the world that the next superstar was coming, though he really ""arrived"" a couple of years later. The rest of the supporting cast is also brilliant be it Johhny Walker(stands out) or Ramesh Deo or Seema or Sumitra. Everyone is wonderful.Music is the hallmark of all great hindi movies and this one has music ranking right up there, on the top. Be it ""Kahin door jab din dhal jaye"" or "" Maine tere liye hi saath rang"" or ""Zindagi kaisi hai paheli"". Maverick composer Salil Chowdury comes up with an absolutely fantastic score and singers Mukhesh and Manna Dey do complete justice to his tunes.About the director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, what can one say, he is one of the best directors ever in the Indian film history. A guy with a complete repertoire,a complete entertainer (though people consider other directors to be more entertaining, but real movie buffs will agree with me). All his movies, he has been directing movies since 1957 are worth a watch. Some are brilliant and others watchable. None of his movies can be rated as unwatchable(except maybe Jooth bole Kauwa kaate and Jhooti).Simply put, this is one of the best Hindi movies ever made.",one best hindi movies ever made,it is very rare guys shed tears after watching movie this movie does make you shed tears anand main protagonist played by superstar 70s rajesh khanna movie has everything going it acting direction story music dialogues etc everything is fabulous it has drama humor emotions dollops it is story dying man who looks at life with positive attitude enjoys his time knowing fully well his disease is incurable that he is going die soon rajesh khanna as anand is absolutely brilliant this is his career best performance notwithstanding movies like kati patang roti aradhana amar prem etc you cannot think any other actor this role think rajesh khanna was not original choice shashi kapoor was he makes you laugh cry he causes anxiety goose bumps simply superb amitabh bachchan is fantastic as babumoshai name with which raj kapoor used address films director hrishikesh mukherjee he showed world that next superstar was coming though he really arrived couple years later rest supporting cast is also brilliant be it johhny walker stands out or ramesh deo or seema or sumitra everyone is wonderful music is hallmark all great hindi movies this one has music ranking right up there top be it kahin door jab din dhal jaye or maine tere liye hi saath rang or zindagi kaisi hai paheli maverick composer salil chowdury comes up with absolutely fantastic score singers mukhesh manna dey do complete justice his tunes about director hrishikesh mukherjee what can one say he is one best directors ever indian film history guy with complete repertoire complete entertainer though people consider other directors be more entertaining but real movie buffs will agree with me all his movies he has been directing movies since 1957 are worth watch some are brilliant others watchable none his movies can be rated as unwatchable except maybe jooth bole kauwa kaate jhooti simply put this is one best hindi movies ever made,0.5131012506012508,0.38561537999038004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8,zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahin (life should be big not long),"In 1970, Rajesh Khanna was the biggest star and was shooting for multiple movies along with Anand. But it seems he would take some time out from his other schedules would come to Hrishi da and ask him if he could shoot the next scene from Anand. That's how eager and dedicated he was to Anand. Probably he knew that this was the movie that he would be remembered for.The movie narrates like the pages of a diary of one Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee and his relationship with Anand Sehgal who he treated for cancer. Despite of such a heavy theme the movie is high spirited just like Anand Sehgal who likes to laugh in the face of death. Special mention should be made for attention given to each character in the movie. All the characters are well etched and everyone has given a truly inspired performance.The last sequence must be the most dramatic sequence that I have seen in any movie. Music by Salil Chaudhary and lyrics by Yogesh and Gulzar are apt and wonderful. Definitely one of the best movies made in India.",zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahin life should be big not long,1970 rajesh khanna was biggest star was shooting multiple movies along with anand but it seems he would take some time out his other schedules would come hrishi da ask him if he could shoot next scene anand thats how eager dedicated he was anand probably he knew that this was movie that he would be remembered movie narrates like pages diary one dr bhaskar bannerjee his relationship with anand sehgal who he treated cancer despite such heavy theme movie is high spirited just like anand sehgal who likes laugh face death special mention should be made attention given each character movie all characters are well etched everyone has given truly inspired performance last sequence must be most dramatic sequence that i have seen any movie music by salil chaudhary lyrics by yogesh gulzar are apt wonderful definitely one best movies made india,0.4473941798941799,0.20465608465608465,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.56}"
10,Hrishikesh Mukherjee's best work...,"Hrishikesh Mukherjee has enriched Hindi cinema with such masterpieces as Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Mili, Abhimaan, Bawarchi, Khubsoorat. All of them relatively low on budget and high in quality. To think of it that he was directing at the breakneck speed of more than two movies a year. Mukherjee's movies were light hearted comic dramas, Anand too is comical at times. His other movies featured people struggling to keep a job, or fancying a marriage to film star, or struggling to keep up with a practical joke, Anand on the other hand is about struggling to live the short life you have.Anand is without doubt the best (and most popular) of Mukherjee's works. Rajesh Khanna's role as Anand, a patient with 'Lymphosarcoma (cancer) of the intestine' is probably his best acting ever. How Anand fights cancer brings tears to your eyes, even if you see this movie for the umpteenth. You laugh with Anand, you cry with him, you sing with him, you live the life he lives. Amitabh Bachchan's (Dr Banerjee) role of his square faced Bengali doctor, in a role so different from the roles that made him a superstar, (Bachchan was voted the greatest actor ever in the online BBC pole, though he played it down saying - this proves Indians do not have much to do on Internet) Amitabh does a wonderful job. Being a Bollywood movie that it is, there are some beautiful songs. I wonder - a Hollywood movie with songs is called a musical and all Bollywood movies are characterised as song and dance sequences. This is a stereotype that a lot of Hindi Movies won't fit into (then there are a lot that will). Anand for one has no dance sequence. Lot of beautiful songs though, that help the narrative and in character development like acting can't.For example you never see Anand unhappy for a second. You think he has no sorrows. Even the name of his illness is something to enjoy. Lymphosarcoma of the intestine is quite a name to have for a disease, Anand says in his ever cheerful voice (the word Anand means pleasure btw). Deep inside Anand knows he has limited time in the world and he wants to fill every life that he touches with happiness. In the process he starts growing closer to you. He talks to a complete stranger on the street like he knew him forever. He shares the sorrows of people he meets, gives them reason to smile. But never will let you into his own sad past. It is only through a song (a sort of soliloquy) he sings that you get a bit of information about his sad past - he himself wont share it with you.The movie won the 1972 Filmfare Award.

9,Poetry in Motion,"I saw this movie at the tender age of 13, the era, when Shammi Kapoor was rollicking on the slopes of Kashmir screaming yahoo! Yes, this word was invented by Shammi Kapoor! who I hear is a computer buff, I wonder if he has Yahoo email..yahoo@yahoo.com! When you can remember when and where you saw a movie it says something about the impact it made on you. A haunting melody, an exuberant performance, or a damsel actress that you had a secret crush on (I should confess that it was Asha Parekh!) So the scene that was struck in my young mind was, Rajesh Khanna, singing ""Kahin Door Jab Din Dhal Jaaye""...a haunting melody by any standards. So, when I wanted to watch a movie in solitude, one of my few choices was ""Anand"". I wanted the nostalgia that only a good movie can bring. Yes, the movie not only brought nostalgia, but also brought tears, melancholy and sadness, at which time, I realized, that a great director has worked me over. No one could have done justice to portraying a cancer stricken patient as Rajesh Khanna did in this classic. Khanna, was an upcoming actor at that time, and somehow the films he starred had some enchanting melodies and hummable tunes. ""Anand"", is one of the rare movies you enjoy watching because there is this silence afterwords, where words spoken would be a nuisance. The performance is subtle as compared to some of the garish over acting that we see by the imbecile Khans in the latter year movies so much so you hope there is never be a remake of this. This is one of the best performance by an actor, wherever this profession is practiced. Like any good movie, this was an amalgamation of talent, like the direction of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, music of Salil Chaudhry and a fine supporting cast that included Amitab Bachchan, who, incidentally, is subdued. That leaves me wondering if he was watching and learning from a great fellow actor at work.

10,A very touching movie.,"Excellent performances by Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan. Both showed maturity and depth in their role. This movie is about a person (rajesh Khanna) who is dying of a dreaded disease but lives every moment of his life to fullest. He entertains others and brings happiness to their life.

He exceed expectations. A versatile actor this is one of his many movies where he plays a role of serious, angry young man who hardly smiles.

6,A bit too non-serious considering it deals with death,"If you pull a prank on an unknown person going down your street, what are the chances that he would appreciate it. I don't think he would like it unless you act truly humble and sweet. Anand pulls such pranks, and one person Issabhai(Johnny Walker) liked it so much that he cried when Anand died. Similarly, a nurse D'souza created a similar affection for him in just a few meetings. All characters are too emotional to be called humans.Rajesh Khanna knew how to play two or three characters. And in his whole career, he just kept working on such roles, that made him the biggest superstar ever. His acting, like always, is nothing short of convincing, but nothing exceptional either.Music is heart of the film. The person who wrote the lyrics, sorry, I forgot his name, never worked again. That's really surprising as this is easily among the top 30 -40 music albums I know.Anand wants to live a happy life, of which a little is remaining and so always keeps smiling.

Amitabh as Dr. Bhaskar with wells of life just under his brooding exterior, was a giveaway at such an early stage of his career that he was destined for a place much beyond the ordinary.Hrishikesh Mukherjee crafted it to perfection.

7,Life changing experience...,"""Anand"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a very ill man living his last months to the fullest. His life was changed first by his illness and after by the advice of a friend of his but he will also change the lives of other people too.I liked this movie because it is a life lesson for many people since it presents very well a difficult subject and how people face it from a different perspective. The interpretations of both Amitabh Bachchan who played as Dr. Bhaskar K. Bannerjee / Babu Moshai and Rajesh Khanna who played as Anand Saigal were simply outstanding. The direction which was made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on it because he succeeded on making us not only understand the feelings of his main characters but also to relate with them. Lastly, I have to say that ""Anand"" is a beautiful movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",life changing experience,anand is drama movie which we watch very ill man living his last months fullest his life was changed first by his illness after by advice friend his but he will also change lives other people too i liked this movie because it is life lesson many people since it presents very well difficult subject how people face it different perspective interpretations both amitabh bachchan who played as dr bhaskar k bannerjee babu moshai rajesh khanna who played as anand saigal were simply outstanding direction which was made by hrishikesh mukherjee it was very good i believe that he did excellent job it because he succeeded making us not only understand feelings his main characters but also relate with them lastly i have say that anand is beautiful movie i strongly recommend everyone watch it,0.6164814814814814,0.22046296296296294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10,Hrishikesh Mukherjee Special,"""Babu Moshai, Zindagi Aur Maut ke Khel Mein Hum Sab Katputhli Hain"" An immortal piece of dialog from an immortal movie Anand. Many a Hindi movie starts of well,but falters pretty badly in the climax. Anand was one of the few movies which grips you from start to end. Its one of the few movies which has an unforgettable climax.Consider this the eponymous character Anand(Rajesh Khanna) lies on the bed dying. Babu Moshai(Amitabh Bachan) enters the room. He cannot bear to see his friend lying still on death bed. He holds him and shakes him up weeping uncomfortably""Tum Mujhe Aisa Chod Ke Nahin Ja Saakte""""20 mahine se mein tera bak bak sun raha hoon""""Baate Karo Mujhshe"" And then as if on cue, the tape recorder plays ""Babu Moshai, Babu Moshai, Zindagi aur Maut Ki Khel Mein Hum Sab Katputhli Hain, Yahan kya hote hai, na tum jaane na main Sab Upar Wale ki Haath Meiin"" The ghostly way in which the voice appears and the equally eerie laughter, creates such a haunting impact, that a shiver runs down my spine every time i watch this scene. It's as if Anand is speaking through his spirit, and even after death he still continues to live.Anand is a masterpiece of the first order by Hrishida and one of my all time fav movies. Now an interesting thing regarding the dedication of Anand. It wad dedicated to Raj Kapoor and the city of Mumbai.The Raj Kapoor connection was easy to make out, as he was Hrishida's best buddy in real life. Hrishida got his first commercial success with Raj Kapoor's Anari and Raj Kapoor got the best actor award for the movie. They were as different as chalk and cheese. While Raj Kapoor was the typical loud Punjabi extrovert,,Hrishida was the very epitome of the Bengali Babu with his sober intellectual demeanour. Also Hrishida's movies were aimed at the common man, and pretty sober and minimalist in nature, while RK was a showman par excellence with his penchant for larger than life canvas and huge settings. Hrishida himself admitted that Anand's character was based on RK's and he didn't cast RK as he couldn't bear to see his friend die on screen also. For his part Anand was a movie always close to RK's heart.Regarding the Mumbai connection, i feel the story of Anand is somewhat linked to that of Mumbai. One could be that Hrishida made his career in Mumbai and i guess this was his way of saying thank you to the city which made him. Most of Hrishida's best movies have been Mumbai centric ""Anand"", ""Mili"",""Abhimaan"",""Gol Maal"" to name a few. Also like Anand, Mumbai is a city which though beset with innumerable problems like slums, crime, pollution, overcrowding still manages to survive and live every day. Life is not easy for an average Mumbaikar, what with all those overcrowded trains, high prices, crime rate but he/she still has a zeal for life, which is rarely found anywhere else. Its a city which gets back to normal life even after a couple of bomb blasts have destroyed large chunks. Its a city where dreams are made and realized. Its a city where people face a daily struggle and yet have an inexhaustible zest for life,much like Anand, who knows he will die but takes death head on as he says ""Babu Moshai, zindag Badi Hone chahiye, Lambi nahin"". Mumbai is a city that dies a thousand deaths daily, but never loses its love for life. Anand is a man who knows he is to die, but makes the best of his limited life.",hrishikesh mukherjee special,babu moshai zindagi aur maut ke khel mein hum sab katputhli hain immortal piece dialog immortal movie anand many hindi movie starts well but falters pretty badly climax anand was one few movies which grips you start end its one few movies which has unforgettable climax consider this eponymous character anand rajesh khanna lies bed dying babu moshai amitabh bachan enters room he cannot bear see his friend lying still death bed he holds him shakes him up weeping uncomfortably tum mujhe aisa chod ke nahin ja saakte 20 mahine se mein tera bak bak sun raha hoon baate karo mujhshe then as if cue tape recorder plays babu moshai babu moshai zindagi aur maut ki khel mein hum sab katputhli hain yahan kya hote hai na tum jaane na main sab upar wale ki haath meiin ghostly way which voice appears equally eerie laughter creates such haunting impact that shiver runs down my spine every time i watch this scene its as if anand is speaking through his spirit even after death he still continues live anand is masterpiece first order by hrishida one my all time fav movies now interesting thing regarding dedication anand it wad dedicated raj kapoor city mumbai raj kapoor connection was easy make out as he was hrishidas best buddy real life hrishida got his first commercial success with raj kapoors anari raj kapoor got best actor award movie they were as different as chalk cheese while raj kapoor was typical loud punjabi extrovert hrishida was very epitome bengali babu with his sober intellectual demeanour also hrishidas movies were aimed at common man pretty sober minimalist nature while rk was showman par excellence with his penchant larger than life canvas huge settings hrishida himself admitted that anands character was based rks he didnt cast rk as he couldnt bear see his friend die screen also his part anand was movie always close rks heart regarding mumbai connection i feel story anand is somewhat linked that mumbai one could be that hrishida made his career mumbai i guess this was his way saying thank you city which made him most hrishidas best movies have been mumbai centric anand mili abhimaan gol maal name few also like anand mumbai is city which though beset with innumerable problems like slums crime pollution overcrowding still manages survive live every day life is not easy average mumbaikar what with all those overcrowded trains high prices crime rate but he she still has zeal life which is rarely found anywhere else its city which gets back normal life even after couple bomb blasts have destroyed large chunks its city where dreams are made realized its city where people face daily struggle yet have inexhaustible zest life much like anand who knows he will die but takes death head as he says babu moshai zindag badi hone chahiye lambi nahin mumbai is city that dies thousand deaths daily but never loses its love life anand is man who knows he is die but makes best his limited life,0.4414438339438339,0.16430458430458433,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"

7,overrated remake of akira kurosawa's 'ikiru',"overrated, yes, but this is still a good film... maybe even a great film... but one cannot escape the fact that a MUCH greater film could have been made. 'anand' is clearly based on legendary Japanese director akira kurosawa's classic 'ikiru', which is simply one of the greatest films ever made. it tells a real story, without singing, dancing and jokes, and confronts death directly, rather than dancing around the issue until the last 20 minutes.'anand' simply misses the point. the first two-thirds of the film serve to introduce YET ANOTHER fast-talking, happy-go-lucky, smiling young man (a horribly clichéd and overused character, who must appear in just about every bollywood film) who is so annoying that you can't wait to see him die. this is the primary weakness of this film - you cannot stand the main character! at least in 'ikiru', we witness the transformation of a quiet, morose soul into a great man. but in this film, no such change occurs and no point is made. it's just about a guy who dies.if you're going to make a movie about death, there should be at least a SOME discussion about it, not covering it up with songs and jokes. this is cheating the audience, who are watching to see a story about a certain theme and are instead tricked into yet another tearjerking bollywood melodrama. what was the point of trying to get bhaskar married? what was the point of anand joining a theatre group? these were wasted moments that could have been used to explore death, but of course, a mainstream Indian film will NEVER be so serious, so we're given what Indian audiences REALLY want: weddings, songs, cheap sentimentality and silly jokes.however, the performances are quite good and the storyline, although a wasted opportunity, is still far away from the formula of most mainstream Hindi films. if you enjoyed the themes of this film, but want a deeper exploration, drop what you're doing right now and watch akira kurosawa's 'ikiru'.... no weddings, no jokes, no happy-go-lucky annoying guys running around, and only one unforgettable song....",overrated remake akira kurosawas ikiru,overrated yes but this is still good film maybe even great film but one cannot escape fact that much greater film could have been made anand is clearly based legendary japanese director akira kurosawas classic ikiru which is simply one greatest films ever made it tells real story without singing dancing jokes confronts death directly rather than dancing around issue until last 20 minutes anand simply misses point first two thirds film serve introduce yet another fast talking happy go lucky smiling young man horribly clich d overused character who must appear just about every bollywood film who is so annoying that you cant wait see him die this is primary weakness this film you cannot stand main character at least ikiru we witness transformation quiet morose soul into great man but this film no such change occurs no point is made its just about guy who dies if youre going make movie about death there should be at least some discussion about it not covering it up with songs jokes this is cheating audience who are watching see story about certain theme are instead tricked into yet another tearjerking bollywood melodrama what was point trying get bhaskar married what was point anand joining theatre group these were wasted moments that could have been used explore death but course mainstream indian film will never be so serious so were given what indian audiences really want weddings songs cheap sentimentality silly jokes however performances are quite good storyline although wasted opportunity is still far away formula most mainstream hindi films if you enjoyed themes this film but want deeper exploration drop what youre doing right now watch akira kurosawas ikiru no weddings no jokes no happy go lucky annoying guys running around only one unforgettable song,0.5586180124223602,0.1471014492753623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"

7,Must see for any Bollywood watcher,"This movie has so much heart and great moments. From technical and cinematic points of view it hasn't aged as good, but every Indian cinema or Bollywood interested person will get a lot of joy out this movie.Rajesh Khanna is the star of the movie and ""sells"" the titular character from the beginning.The film is over before you realize it with just over 2 hours runtime. And not everything is perfect: The story is sometimes a bit over the place which some very short scenes and some characters and interactions that definitely could have done with more development. It purely speak to the fact that you want to see more of everyone. Another point is blurry screens en editing where the screen flicks in a distracting way. It is an older movie, but most of it contemporaries had a bit more flow in it. It might make you wonder if this is one of the few Hindi golden era movies where a reimagining would do it well. (who would fill those shoes of Rajesh). Having so many icons together will make many people happy. Ramesh Deo does a very good job as Dr Prakash. And although Amitabh doesn't shine as much as Rajesh does: it's still warming to have them in a movie together. Knowing the actors, Mumbai cinema and understanding the songs will add to experience. For western audiences it might be a big dramatic and unrealistic, but for people who get the culture there will be more dept. this is one of the few movie that moved people regardless of gender.The songs by Mukesh and Manna Dey are outstanding and are blended in with the film nicely.

8,A rare film that dares to deal with death.,"""Anand"" is an Indian film that stars two of the very biggest Indian stars of all time, Rajesh Khanna (who plays the title character) and Amitabh Bachchan (Dr. Bannerjee). It's considered a classic and I appreciate how the film deals with death, as few films really address this in any meaningful way.The movie begins with Dr. Bannerjee receiving an award for his book. However, while folks think the story is fiction, he addresses them about the story of his friend and patient, Anand. It seems that Anand was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he has no family nor friends*. Instead of being miserable, he is very vivacious and takes a very positive attitude. He's not in denial--he just wants to make the most of his time left. He also wants to leave something positive for those around him--and he decides, in particular, to help his new friend, Dr. Bannerjee.What makes this film interesting is that through the course of the film, you notice that Anand is okay with death. After all, he can't avoid it. It's everyone around him (particularly Dr. Bannerjee) who cannot accept it. Plus, how many films REALLY address death and dying in a meaningful way? Certainly not many. This alone makes the film well worth seeing. However, a minor quibble I have is about the DVD producer. They didn't bother captioning ANY of the songs--so you really have no idea what Anand is singing about throughout the film! Jerks!*First, it's interesting that a year ago, Khanna actually DID die from cancer. Second, the one problem I saw with the film was the notion of Anand coming to the big city because he had no family. However, he is SO likable and wonderful, you can't really expect that he wouldn't have TONS of friends where he lived--so why come to a new city?",rare film that dares deal with death,anand is indian film that stars two very biggest indian stars all time rajesh khanna who plays title character amitabh bachchan dr bannerjee its considered classic i appreciate how film deals with death as few films really address this any meaningful way movie begins with dr bannerjee receiving award his book however while folks think story is fiction he addresses them about story his friend patient anand it seems that anand was diagnosed with terminal cancer he has no family nor friends instead being miserable he is very vivacious takes very positive attitude hes not denial he just wants make most his time left he also wants leave something positive those around him he decides particular help his new friend dr bannerjee what makes this film interesting is that through course film you notice that anand is okay with death after all he cant avoid it its everyone around him particularly dr bannerjee who cannot accept it plus how many films really address death dying meaningful way certainly not many this alone makes film well worth seeing however minor quibble i have is about dvd producer they didnt bother captioning any songs so you really have no idea what anand is singing about throughout film jerks first its interesting that year ago khanna actually did die cancer second one problem i saw with film was notion anand coming big city because he had no family however he is so likable wonderful you cant really expect that he wouldnt have tons friends where he lived so why come new city,0.3694372294372293,0.20701298701298704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
