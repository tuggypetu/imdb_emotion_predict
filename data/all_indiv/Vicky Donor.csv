10,Vicky Donor (U/A)--------------------Rating: 5/5,"wow...fantastic movie with the heavy n strong concept...... the movie contains about raw usage of script and more comedy with beautiful songs.... A must watch film.... Very difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the concept...A man is brought in by an infertility doctor to supply him with his sperm, where he becomes the biggest sperm donor for his clinic. Vicky Donor is a light hearted comedy that takes a look at the taboo attached to infertility and artificial insemination.The Story .. of courseDr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi, that guarantees a high quality and specialized sperm for the purpose. Unfortunately he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy, high performing donor is the need of the hour. Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurrana), a young, good-looking, Punjabi boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and of no financial support to Dolly, a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home.As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr Chaddha and Vicky, face to face, where Chaddha, concludes that Vicky could be THAT donor he has been looking for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a Bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor. With a brief emotional roller coaster ride, Vicky Donor is a light-hearted take on the subject of sperm donation.What to look out forSparkled with exceptional performance by Annu Kapoor as Dr. Chadda and the wonderful debut by Ayushmann Khurrana as Vicky Arora.. Vicky Donor is a fertile entertainer with focus to tell an endearing love story centered round sperm donation glory..John Abraham deserves a special pat for not following bollywood trends as a producer and opting for a out of the box subject on sperm donations for his debut as producer and not using his stardom and making way for a newcomer for a wonderful debut.. highly remarkable..Shoojit Sircar grows immensely as a story teller and shows vast improvement from Yahan (2005) to Vicky Donor. With the all round support of his writer Juhi Chaturvedi he captures the mood of Delhi in light, funny and tangy first half then giving us those genuinely stirring moments rather late in the game and ending up with a sweet note.All this wouldn't have been possible without the active support of Yami Gautam who makes a beautiful debut.. Watching her is treat to your eye and the girl delivers a sparkling performance.Dolly Ahluwalia is excellent as mom and Kamlesh Gill as the grand ma is outstanding.. Whenever she appears on screen she eats up other actor's presence. Jayanta Das as Yami's father is adequate.Music and dialogues are in sync with the film. Pani da song is the pick of the lot.. editing is sharp and other technicalities are fine. Production values are up to markWhat NotVery difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the conceptConclusion: Vicky Donor is avant grade cinema that is fertile at the Box Office. Those who complain Bollywood for running out of ideas..

7,Donates Genuineness in Peculiar Small Films,"Blood Donation is an old theme nowadays. Why not sperm? Fertilization has been shown previously in movies like I AM, The Tree Of Life and more. But Vicky Donor bring an aspect of Comedy involving fertilization in the movie. That's a different and peculiar attempt introduced in Bollywood movie. A fresh theme with fresh stars featured in a feature film - Vicky Donor.John Abraham, The new boy in Producer Town does an earnest effort here and deals with a fresh theme based on a totally out-of-the-box concept. John after acting on 'masala maardhaar' movies now starts investing money on offbeat movies - that's strange but is smart also as the promos of Vicky Donor has a youth appeal also keeping beside the sperm oriented theme. Some in the town thinks Vicky Donor is somehow sex-oriented and disgusting in theme as it deals with such vulgar things like sperm donation and fertilization. Anyhow still Vicky Donor makes its individual impact in Bollywood and its pretty good.In an environment where the job pressures are high and couples lead an erratic and unhealthy lifestyle, Dr. Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well-qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, New Delhi. Unfortunately, he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy, high-performing donor is the need of the hour.Vicky Arora (Ayushymann Khurrana), a young, good looking Punjabi guy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and of no financial support to his mother Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia), a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home. As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr. Chaddha and Vicky face to face, where Chaddha concludes that Vicky could be that donor he has been looking for. From here on, Dr. Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in.Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor.Vicky Donor is a special mixture of Youth, Romance, Sperm Donation type offbeat concept and Comedy. So, compilation like this is hard to find in recent movies and there's where VD wins the race for its individuality. Even being a small budget film, VD gives you the feel of the same amount of humor, romance and consciousness about the concept used in a big budget film. It enlightens, then entertains and then wins.Shoojit Sircar, after giving such a serious movie like YAHAAN (2005), it was very unlike to see a comic movie from him after 7 years. Anyway he deals very well with Vicky Donor and gives justice to the concept. Story, Dialogue and Script by Juhi Chaturvedi was very neat, sophisticated and came to a very good conclusion as the two parts of the movie was capably balance. Cinematography was not such a big deal for the movie but still good work done by Kamaljeet Negi. Editing by Shekhar Prajapati was good. The soundtrack of the movie is mediocre but still tracks like PANI DA RANG (sung, written and composed by the lead actor of the movie Ayushmann Khurrana), MAR JAIYAAN & RUM WHISKY work perfectly. These three songs are worth listen for many times. Background scores also by the music director duo Abhishek-Akshay duo are perfect for the movie.Shoojit Sircar, I must say has chosen the actors for the movie very aptly. The very famous face from the Television Ayushmann Khurrana is good-looking, humorous and a very good performer. The naturalism in his expression and act was fascinating and profound. Another fresh face from Television Yami Gautam was strikingly beautiful, sensible and a good performer. Her presence and charm in various sequences adds value to them. Annu Kapoor aka Dr. Chadda is an anomaly. His humorous acts, sensitive acting adds the movie a new aspect.Dolly Ahluwalia (Vicky's Mom) was very well as well as Kamlesh Gill (Vicky's grand-mom). Jayanta Das (Ashima's father) was fine. John Abraham makes a stunning impact on viewers by appearing in the song ""RUM & WHISKY"".Finally, Vicky Donor is just like sperms, tiny but very effective and gives birth to a new idea in entertainment. With genuineness in script and rigorous performances by leading actors, Vicky Donor is successful in making a strong ascendancy in small budget films. Try not to miss this one.",donates genuineness peculiar small films,blood donation is old theme nowadays why not sperm fertilization has been shown previously movies like i am tree life more but vicky donor bring aspect comedy involving fertilization movie thats different peculiar attempt introduced bollywood movie fresh theme with fresh stars featured feature film vicky donor john abraham new boy producer town does earnest effort here deals with fresh theme based totally out box concept john after acting masala maardhaar movies now starts investing money offbeat movies thats strange but is smart also as promos vicky donor has youth appeal also keeping beside sperm oriented theme some town thinks vicky donor is somehow sex oriented disgusting theme as it deals with such vulgar things like sperm donation fertilization anyhow still vicky donor makes its individual impact bollywood its pretty good environment where job pressures are high couples lead erratic unhealthy lifestyle dr baldev chaddha annu kapoor well qualified fertility expert runs fertility clinic sperm bank daryaganj new delhi unfortunately he has more failed cases his credit than successes healthy high performing donor is need hour vicky arora ayushymann khurrana young good looking punjabi guy lajpat nagar is only son no financial support his mother dolly dolly ahluwalia widow who runs small beauty parlor home as luck would have it small brawl colony brings dr chaddha vicky face face where chaddha concludes that vicky could be that donor he has been looking here dr chaddhas days nights are spent convincing vicky become donor till he finally gives vicky finds his love interest ashima roy yami gautam pretty bengali girl who works bank but soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because vickys past as donor vicky donor is special mixture youth romance sperm donation type offbeat concept comedy so compilation like this is hard find recent movies theres where vd wins race its individuality even being small budget film vd gives you feel same amount humor romance consciousness about concept used big budget film it enlightens then entertains then wins shoojit sircar after giving such serious movie like yahaan 2005 it was very unlike see comic movie him after 7 years anyway he deals very well with vicky donor gives justice concept story dialogue script by juhi chaturvedi was very neat sophisticated came very good conclusion as two parts movie was capably balance cinematography was not such big deal movie but still good work done by kamaljeet negi editing by shekhar prajapati was good soundtrack movie is mediocre but still tracks like pani da rang sung written composed by lead actor movie ayushmann khurrana mar jaiyaan rum whisky work perfectly these three songs are worth listen many times background scores also by music director duo abhishek akshay duo are perfect movie shoojit sircar i must say has chosen actors movie very aptly very famous face television ayushmann khurrana is good looking humorous very good performer naturalism his expression act was fascinating profound another fresh face television yami gautam was strikingly beautiful sensible good performer her presence charm various sequences adds value them annu kapoor aka dr chadda is anomaly his humorous acts sensitive acting adds movie new aspect dolly ahluwalia vickys mom was very well as well as kamlesh gill vickys grand mom jayanta das ashimas father was fine john abraham makes stunning impact viewers by appearing song rum whisky finally vicky donor is just like sperms tiny but very effective gives birth new idea entertainment with genuineness script rigorous performances by leading actors vicky donor is successful making strong ascendancy small budget films try not miss this one,0.567684836071933,0.1782042390106906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9,Perfect Entertainer....Light Comedy with Heavy Topic,"It turned out to be pleasant surprize form Vicky Donor. While I waited for one week for the reviews before confirming if the movie is watchable, the movie stood tall in all aspects. Anu Kapoor is back with a bang with some impressive performances by Ayushman and Yami. The movie provided the right perspective to look at sperm donation and its importance. Though the conservatives with frown at such issues, even from the entertainment point of view, the movie provides everything that audience expects from a movie. The punches are spot on in terms of timing as well as dialogs. While a majority of the dialogs are in Punjabi (which might repel certain set of audiences), it just improves the originality of the plot. Music has been another highlight of the movie with the song ""Paani Da Rang"" being the masterpiece. Overall, a good 2-3 times watch.",perfect entertainer light comedy with heavy topic,it turned out be pleasant surprize form vicky donor while i waited one week reviews before confirming if movie is watchable movie stood tall all aspects anu kapoor is back with bang with some impressive performances by ayushman yami movie provided right perspective look at sperm donation its importance though conservatives with frown at such issues even entertainment point view movie provides everything that audience expects movie punches are spot terms timing as well as dialogs while majority dialogs are punjabi which might repel certain set audiences it just improves originality plot music has been another highlight movie with song paani da rang being masterpiece overall good 2 3 times watch,0.5794372294372294,0.37575757575757573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6,Vicky Donor: Better than I expected,"I don't like Bollywood cinema, it has just never appealed to me and therefore I tend to avoid such movies like anything with Tom Cruise.I found myself watching Vicky Donor as it's supposed to be an Indian remake of the excellent French Canadian movie Starbuck (2011). I'll say right off the bat, it's not............it really really isn't and they need to stop making that claim.A very high rated Indian movie it tells the story of a lovable loser type who reluctantly begins donating sperm. He hides it from his family and the woman he loves because for some reason it would bring great shame.That's it, so again this is not Starbucks plot at all despite being advertised as such.It has most of the Bollywood tropes but thankfully no sudden dance numbers, I really couldn't have sat through it if there had been. There is however a heavy soundtrack and in this guys view it damaged the film.The soundtrack grinds, the characters certainly could have been more likeable and much of the film feels like a melodrama more than anything else.However on the flipside some of the writing is excellent, the plot though simple is handled well and the finale really saved the movie.Vicky Donor is not Starbuck but it has it's own identity and for a guy who hates Bollywood I can't deny that it certainly has its moments.Vicky Donor is an enjoyable affair despite its flaws.The Good:Yami GautamSome of the script is exceptionalGreat finaleThe Bad:Randomly shifting back and forth between languages mid conversationFrustrating soundtrackNot even remotely the Starbuck storyJokes tend to miss their markThings I Learnt From This Movie:When a movie starts with the fact it was created by the ""Eros"" network it makes a person pause and recheck they have the right film!Indians talk so fast it can make subtitles a chore at timesIf ""God"" wanted you to have a child surely you wouldn't be infertileShaking hands with someone after they've made a sperm donation seems like a bad callThe word ""Coming"" was used a suspicious amount in this film, intentional?!Banks allow their employees to go in after hours to mope dramaticallyA person who refers to everyone as sperm would likely not be on my speed dial",vicky donor better than i expected,i dont like bollywood cinema it has just never appealed me therefore i tend avoid such movies like anything with tom cruise i found myself watching vicky donor as its supposed be indian remake excellent french canadian movie starbuck 2011 ill say right off bat its not it really really isnt they need stop making that claim very high rated indian movie it tells story lovable loser type who reluctantly begins donating sperm he hides it his family woman he loves because some reason it would bring great shame thats it so again this is not starbucks plot at all despite being advertised as such it has most bollywood tropes but thankfully no sudden dance numbers i really couldnt have sat through it if there had been there is however heavy soundtrack this guys view it damaged film soundtrack grinds characters certainly could have been more likeable much film feels like melodrama more than anything else however flipside some writing is excellent plot though simple is handled well finale really saved movie vicky donor is not starbuck but it has its own identity guy who hates bollywood i cant deny that it certainly has its moments vicky donor is enjoyable affair despite its flaws good yami gautamsome script is exceptionalgreat finalethe bad randomly shifting back forth between languages mid conversationfrustrating soundtracknot even remotely starbuck storyjokes tend miss their markthings i learnt this movie when movie starts with fact it was created by eros network it makes person pause recheck they have right film indians talk so fast it can make subtitles chore at timesif god wanted you have child surely you wouldnt be infertileshaking hands with someone after theyve made sperm donation seems like bad callthe word coming was used suspicious amount this film intentional banks allow their employees go after hours mope dramaticallya person who refers everyone as sperm would likely not be my speed dial,0.5169908103592313,0.1765263157894737,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10,"The most pleasant surprise of the year... a really witty, feel-good joyride!","""The best things in life come in small packages.."" This adage came to my mind when I stepped out after watching 'Vicky Donor'.. Easily the best socially relevant comedy made in recent times, this one needs to be appreciated for its natural wit & intelligence in dealing with a sensitive issue in a non-preachy way. The movie manages to entertain as well as enlighten, & thats' a rare feat in context of Hindi Cinema. The movie succeeds in driving home its point in a subtle manner. Newcomer ""Ayush-Man"" is a complete natural in his roguishly charming Delhi guy act, while fellow débutante Yaami Gautam has extremely likable screen presence & is a competent performer as well. As a pair, both of them have a great on-screen chemistry, & their romantic track blends well with the story. On the other hand, every member of the supporting cast is an absolute delight to watch, especially Anu Kapoor as ""Doctor Fertility"". The music is also quite good, with ""Paani Da Rang..."" being the best pick with its soothing composition. There is some emotional drama in the 2nd half & the culmination is arguably convenient, yet it suits the ""feel-good"" tone of the film. Overall, this is a crisply entertaining movie with a BIG heart. Highly recommended for lovers of good cinema, & a welcome break from all the crude slapstick ""comedies"" that are regularly dished out at the Indian Box Office in the name of entertainment.

7,Donate Some Time To Vicky Donor - Worth It :),"Very Recently I had an argument with a friend when i asked him that out of the two movies released this Friday which would be given preference bu him. He said and I'd quote that ""(It's a)disgrace that people can actually watch this"".No offence but Vicky Donor would be like a slap on the face for such people. It is fresh, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.Starring Ayushmann Khurrana as the Punjabi munda Vicky who doesn't have a job of his own and is constantly nagged by his mother played by Dolly Alluwalia. His grandma, on the other hand as Vicky himself says pretty modern and very supportive. All's not well for him until Dr.Baldev Chadda played by Annu Kapoor finds out that Vicky can be an excellent sperm donor. Midway he falls in love with Ashima Roy(Yami Gautam) and the story carries on further.The interesting part about Vicky Donor is that although the film preaches the topic of sperm donation at no point does the film uses vulgarity or cheap humour to carry it along. The music is very catchy at the least and songs like 'Paani da' and 'Rum whisky' really help to keep up the tempo of the movie.The screenplay by Juhi Chaturvedi is apt and even the 2 hr 15 min doesn't seem too long.Yes the dialogues are a bit repetitive, the story a bit sluggish in parts but the good acting performances by the entire cast hide the negatives more or less. Annu Kapoor, Dolly and her mother-in-law impress in particular. Ayushmann has very good screen presence and Yami looks superb.It's a definite thumbs up from my side for Shoojit Sircar's Vicky Donor. You should not give this a miss if possible.3/5",donate some time vicky donor worth it,very recently i had argument with friend when i asked him that out two movies released this friday which would be given preference bu him he said id quote that its disgrace that people can actually watch this no offence but vicky donor would be like slap face such people it is fresh entertaining thoroughly enjoyable starring ayushmann khurrana as punjabi munda vicky who doesnt have job his own is constantly nagged by his mother played by dolly alluwalia his grandma other hand as vicky himself says pretty modern very supportive alls not well him until dr baldev chadda played by annu kapoor finds out that vicky can be excellent sperm donor midway he falls love with ashima roy yami gautam story carries further interesting part about vicky donor is that although film preaches topic sperm donation at no point does film uses vulgarity or cheap humour carry it along music is very catchy at least songs like paani da rum whisky really help keep up tempo movie screenplay by juhi chaturvedi is apt even 2 hr 15 min doesnt seem too long yes dialogues are bit repetitive story bit sluggish parts but good acting performances by entire cast hide negatives more or less annu kapoor dolly her mother law impress particular ayushmann has very good screen presence yami looks superb its definite thumbs up my side shoojit sircars vicky donor you should not give this miss if possible 3 5,0.5320098039215686,0.2672058823529412,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"

With VD, I was not sure. So I went anyways. Thank God I did. From the first scene to the last, it was worth it.A great script dealing with masturbation indirectly yet without any vulgarity in words or scenes. It will easily pass off as a 'modern' family entertainer. It is not easy to bring out the film in such a great script and kudos to the director and editors for sending out a altogether new message and getting it out from the actors. All the actors were spot on. But a special mention to the mom and her in-law, and their on screen chemistry. The leads have also done well, but Annu kapoor is the class act. Then final scene in which he breaks- down laughing, makes him in the list of my great actors in India. No unnecessary songs,long shots, close-ups, drama etc,. it was all just about perfect. There were some pit falls on the acting in some scenes of Anshuman and Yaani, but come'on the made up for it later.

8,7.5/10 - Delightfully deft!,"The chief concerns of a 25 year old? Money, a job, a girlfriend and some respect from his family. Vicky Donor injects a new age career (if you may call it) of donating sperms in to the life of a happy, cricket loving, 25 but jobless Delhi boy Vicky (Ayushmann Khurrana). After Dr. Baldev Chaddha, (Annu Kapoor) an infertility specialist overtly chases Vicky for this covert job; he begins to enjoy the perks that come along with the job. However with great perks come great pains. Great perks – money, job, girlfriend (incidental to the job) and respect from his family. Great Pains – Not being able to tell his family and girlfriend about his career. So do the perks outweigh the pains? Or life is beyond such naive comparisons? For the answers, watch the movie!While you are at it, you will be treated to some delightful real life characters, Kamlesh Gill as Vicky's alcohol-loving, forward-thinking grandma, Dolly Ahluwalia as Vicky's alcohol-loving, loud and dutiful mother, Annu Kapoor the singularly focused Dr. Baldev Chaddha, the beautiful Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam) and her oh-so Bengali family. The banter between Kamlesh Gill and Dolly Ahluwalia, Annu Kapoor's character who sees life through the lens of sperms will keep you chuckling through the movie. You will want to cheer the celebration of differences and the eventual mingling between the Punjabis and the Bengalis, brought to the fore in the wedding sequence.Is this Ayushmaan's debut? Wow! Doesn't seem like that! He comes across as completely natural and never seems anything besides Vicky! He is absolutely lovable as the boy next door. Annu Kapoor is scintillating. He amuses you and makes you laugh. Kamlesh Gill and Dolly Ahluwalia are uncontainable. Debutant Yami Gautam looks delectable and performs well. Juhi Chaturvedi's very believable story has a thoroughly enjoyable screenplay where witty one-liners are the order of the day. Kamaljit Negi's cinematography is good. Shekhar Prajapati's snips ensure the movie never slows down. Abhishek-Akshay's music carries the narration forward while Rum Whiskey will be a party smasher!Director Shoojit Sircar after a hiatus of 7 years (Yahaan 2005) deftly blends in a topical story with some endearing characters and real life sequences to dish out a delightful slice of life film!

8,A refreshing surprise!,"To people who would like to believe that this movie is vulgar, I would suggest, go along with your kids! It's a refreshing surprise from director Sircar, and is 2 hours 15 minutes of pure fun. Anu Kapoor stands out for his once in a lifetime portrayal of an infertility specialist. His props, clinic and the hand gesture (just loved it) are just amazing! I am forced to wonder why is he not more visible on screen! Ayushman is a complete natural as a punjabi boy. Not for one moment would you even feel this is his debut in bollywood. Yami Gautam is gorgeous and appears very soothing to the eye.

8,Revival of the old glory days,"What a lovely story this film is. It starts off a little bland - we see a rather aimless guy who we don't immediately sympathise with and the entire sperm donation track is too quick to ring true. Indeed, it takes time to pick up, but when it does, it does so with unusual panache, humour and heart, and there's no looking back. The love story between the male lead and his love interest turns out much more affecting that one would imagine given the light tone that precedes it.Vicky Donor is one of those films which revive an old middle-of-the-road style, very reminiscent of the style of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee classics, by bringing back a much-missed energy of simplicity to mainstream Hindi cinema, very real and authentic, with great dialogue, lifelike situations, smart comedy based on the tiniest nuances, and above all, celebration of the Indian culture and lifestyle, particularly among middle-class families.One of the film's most entertaining sequences happens when the lead pair decide to get married. Cultural and communal differences soon arise among their Punjabi and Bengali families in the form of vocal recycling of the most familiar of ethnic stereotypes by each sectorial group against the other. This part of the film is written with such wit and affection for each community that it becomes much more than just a comic commentary on prejudice.This part is greatly played by the wonderful character actors. Obviously, Dolly Ahluwalia is stupendous throughout, bringing layers and credibility to what could have been a caricature. The same is true of Kamlesh Gill, who is amazingly authentic as the playful grandmother, who might be the oldest in the house but by far the worldliest and less bigoted. In smaller parts, Jayant Das is hilarious as the Bengali father and Swaroopa Ghosh is effective as his sister.The film naturally belongs to the brilliant Ayushmann Khurrana, who was a promising new find then, and today it's clear to what extent. Yami Gautam is luminous. Her delicate, angelic beauty along with her radiant screen presence make her a most convincing love interest even if acting-wise she could have been a little better. Doubtlessly, the driving force of this film is Annu Kapoor as the fertility expert in a wonderfully transformative comic act.The film's seemingly main theme of sperm donation is revealed to be no more than a nice gimmick or, at most, a recurring comic motif which infuses the film with symbolic heft. What lies at the heart of this film though is the romance, which culminates in a phenomenal musical number, ""Pani Da Rang"", sung beautifully by Khurrana himself. Sadly, there are flaws, including some poor dubbing and predictable moments. But Vicky Donor remains fresh and interesting.",revival old glory days,what lovely story this film is it starts off little bland we see rather aimless guy who we dont immediately sympathise with entire sperm donation track is too quick ring true indeed it takes time pick up but when it does it does so with unusual panache humour heart theres no looking back love story between male lead his love interest turns out much more affecting that one would imagine given light tone that precedes it vicky donor is one those films which revive old middle road style very reminiscent style hrishikesh mukherjee basu chatterjee classics by bringing back much missed energy simplicity mainstream hindi cinema very real authentic with great dialogue lifelike situations smart comedy based tiniest nuances above all celebration indian culture lifestyle particularly among middle class families one films most entertaining sequences happens when lead pair decide get married cultural communal differences soon arise among their punjabi bengali families form vocal recycling most familiar ethnic stereotypes by each sectorial group against other this part film is written with such wit affection each community that it becomes much more than just comic commentary prejudice this part is greatly played by wonderful character actors obviously dolly ahluwalia is stupendous throughout bringing layers credibility what could have been caricature same is true kamlesh gill who is amazingly authentic as playful grandmother who might be oldest house but by far worldliest less bigoted smaller parts jayant das is hilarious as bengali father swaroopa ghosh is effective as his sister film naturally belongs brilliant ayushmann khurrana who was promising new find then today its clear what extent yami gautam is luminous her delicate angelic beauty along with her radiant screen presence make her most convincing love interest even if acting wise she could have been little better doubtlessly driving force this film is annu kapoor as fertility expert wonderfully transformative comic act films seemingly main theme sperm donation is revealed be no more than nice gimmick or at most recurring comic motif which infuses film with symbolic heft what lies at heart this film though is romance which culminates phenomenal musical number pani da rang sung beautifully by khurrana himself sadly there are flaws including some poor dubbing predictable moments but vicky donor remains fresh interesting,0.5356320346320346,0.2574531024531025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9,A different sperm rates this movie to be spectacular!,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is how a doctor in an infertility clinic finds someone (Vicky) to donate high quality sperm for people who cannot conceive. Vicky further gets married to Ashima and it's found that she cannot conceive. Later one things lead to other and Ashima gets to know about Vickys donating secret. They tend to grow apart but that does not happen thanks to Doctors last stunt.The two elements that hold this movie are humorous Science and humane emotions.

9,Its not only a fine comedy but one of the best romantic movies from Bollywood with a loving message.,"First of all I would like to congratulate John Abraham to back & produce a film on such an off-track subject which is usually not supported by the producer community. I have always believed that after becoming hugely successful in your own field, it's the duty of a person to support some good & meaningful projects which otherwise don't get any approval from the fearful Industry. And with VICKY DONOR, John fulfills his duty in an impressive manner, without featuring in it in the lead role and giving a much deserving chance to the talented cast.Secondly (as said earlier in a review), the film once again proves that 'An Enjoyable, Must See Movie' solely depends upon Writing, Writing & Writing alone. So the next set of wishes goes to both the director Shoojit Sircar and the screenplay-dialogue writer Juhi Chaturvedi for making a thoroughly enjoyable film offering many hilarious and thoughtful sequences with many well written lines right till the end. They both not only convert a serious subject of artificial insemination into an entertaining comic one but at the same time also retain the optimistic feel of the issue in a splendid manner. Moreover they also meet another requisite of Good Cinema in which movies should both entertain and enlighten the viewers about some rare issues of the society. And VICKY DONOR being a comic take will surely enlighten many more viewers of the country about this available medical technique, who might not be aware of it till now with a clear vision.Third are the fabulous performances in the movie from its entire talented start cast interacting beautifully. Actually the magic behind their great acts lies in the notable characterizations of their respective roles written realistically by Juhi. Ayushmann will surprise many in the industry with his completely natural, confident and captivating performance in the lead role of a sperm donor. And he really bowled me over with the way he speaks Punjabi in the film in a flawless style. Frankly there has to be someone behind that undoubtedly.Annu Kapoor once again proves the exceptional talent he has in his outstanding portrayal of an Artificial Insemination Specialist Doctor operating from a small office in Daryaganj. His act readily proves that he is unarguably one of the most under-rated & under-utilised veteran actors of Bollywood till date. Yami Gautam acts well and looks stunning on the screen as never before. In fact after a long time I felt like witnessing a character on the screen with whom the viewer can easily fall in love instantly. She adds both glamour as well as sensitivity to the project impressively and this is sure going to fetch her many more reputed projects soon.Jayanta Das as Yami's father and the actress playing her aunt suit their roles perfectly. But one of the major appealing points of the film remain Dolly Ahluwalia and Kamlesh Gill who play Ayushmann's mother and grandmother respectively. The two ladies are truly the scene-stealers here with their funky dialogues and great face expressions. Especially when they both are talking about their past experiences in a drunkard state and while dancing in the marriage sequences. The viewers are positively going to talk about them first while walking out of the hall before any other actor.Musically VICKY DONOR gets ample support from two fine tracks played repeatedly in the film namely, ""Rum Whiskey"" and ""Pani Da Rang"". John makes a friendly experience in ""Rum Whiskey"" played in the end credits and ""Pani Da Rang"" gels well with the story progression on the screen which is composed, written and sung by the lead hero Ayushmaan himself. The background score supports the comic feel of the film perfectly and cinematography is fine capturing the Delhi ambiance in a realistic mode once again.Besides, taking a clue from its promotional campaign on various channels, VICKY DONOR might appear to you as a rare comedy made on an off-beat sexual subject. But clearing this misconception I would like to reveal that along with being a hilarious take on the serious subject in its first half, VD is a great romantic film with heartfelt emotions in its later part. In true words, I would like to rate it amongst the best romantic films made in Bollywood which not only talks about an inter- caste marriage between a Punjabi & Bengali but which also revolves around a thoughtful subject of artificial insemination written brilliantly with some great comic touches and a fantastic climax.VICKY DONOR also goes into the list of those well made successful movies which take huge support from Punjabi language and Delhi's famous Punjabi Mohalla vibes for its entertaining script. Though frankly I don't support the way the makers show the Punjabi ladies abusing and drinking heavily as if that's a part of their daily routine. But still taking the reference on a lighter note, I would strongly like to recommend VICKY DONOR to all my readers here who wish to see something fresh coming from our own loving Bollywood. Especially the friends coming from Bengali and Punjabi origin, as they would all surely enjoy watching this thoughtful realistic comedy more than anybody else.Ending with a strange question, which was also pointed out in a scene in the film, I would like to ask that if all the Palmists (the palm-lines readers) can tell how many children one has by looking at the lines on the palm, then how will they come to know about the children of a Sperm Donor whose sperm has been used by so many families?",its not only fine comedy but one best romantic movies bollywood with loving message,first all i would like congratulate john abraham back produce film such off track subject which is usually not supported by producer community i have always believed that after becoming hugely successful your own field its duty person support some good meaningful projects which otherwise dont get any approval fearful industry with vicky donor john fulfills his duty impressive manner without featuring it lead

6,This Donor generous with laughs and heart...,"This afternoon I watched ""Vicky Donor"" and was unexpectedly enchanted by it. The title and the recent spate of unfunny sex ""comedies"" had made me apprehensive, but this sweet film disarmed me completely. Of course, it is about a sperm donor, but it so cleverly involves the viewer in the lives of said donor and the people in his world, that one gets emotionally invested in their destinies instead of staying a Peeping Tom voyeur. Rather than titillating and going for cheap laughs, the tale of the donor and his circumstances is unspooled deftly to the point that he emerges as a kind of selfless do-gooder. The laughs that arise are from situational humor rather than the tacky nudge-nudge-wink-wink variety. Although not totally new, the dialogue is laugh-out loud funny. We've already been introduced to the outlandish vernacular in ""Band Baaja Baaraat"", ""Do Dooni Chaar"" ""Ladies v/s Ricky Bahl"" and other films set in that peculiar Punjabi Delhi milieu. In fact, a new film genre was spawned in the past few years: the middle class Delhi family comedy.The cast is first rate, and again a director shrewdly deploys the best of Delhi's theatre talents in the service of an off-beat film. Most of these actors would be unknown to Hindi filmgoers who would think them to be overnight sensations; the fact is most of them paid their dues and honed their craft on the stages of Delhi and Calcutta for decades. Kamlesh Gill, as the titular donor's grandmother is a scene stealer with her progressive views, uncharacteristic knowledge of electronic gadgets and nightly peg or two. At one point, her movie grandson remarks admiringly that Delhi has only two truly modern things: the newly-built Metro and his grandmother. Ms. Gill has been active in theatre since 1957! In the film, her drinking partner is her widowed daughter-in-law, Vicky's mother, played with feisty brio by another theatre professional and National Award-winning costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia Tewari.Spectacularly beautiful and talented TV actress Yami Gautam is Vicky's love interest Ashima Roy, while her widower father and spinster aunt are played appealingly, once again, by longtime theatre veterans: Jayant Das and Swaroopa Ghosh. With this wealth of combined acting expertise, it's no surprise that they succeed brilliantly in creating the compellingly real world of Vicky, Ashima, their families, and the man who upends their happy, orderly lives: the infertility expert Dr. Baldev Chaddha, played to perfection by Annu Kapoor. Dr. Chaddha has long been on a quest for the ideal sperm donor, and when he comes across carefree cricket-mad Vicky, he sizes him up and then pretty much stalks him until the young man becomes his star performer.The title role is played by a TV anchor/VJ Ayushmaan Khurana, who understands that Vicky has to be an everyday schmo with nothing heroic to distinguish him from the hordes of similar unemployed slacker youths that populate present-day Delhi. Only Dr. Chaddha spots his potential, such as it is, and launches Vicky's fruitful if, um, single-handed success. These two and their humorous bickering mutual need-and-greed relationship are at the centre of the film. Chaddha is a cunning combination of fast-talking hustler, shameless (hence, very funny) mercenary, and ultimately, unlikely altruist, and the gifted Annu Kapoor makes him amusingly disreputable, but never sleazy. Chaddha genuinely sees Vicky as a walking-talking, revenue generating sperm bank, and after each encounter with the young man muses to himself ""Confused sperm!"", ""Unpredictable sperm!"" or ""Pain in the sperm!"" depending on the outcome of each exchange. It is excellent that Annu Kapoor has returned to Hindi cinema after a long self-imposed exile. He was a hoot in last year's ""7 Khoon Maaf"", and pulls off a funny yet heart-warming turn in this film.When Vicky and Ashima decide to make a life together, it brings into hilarious play a Punjabi-Bengali culture clash. In the initial meetings, each side has catty put downs of the other, yet when all is said and done, they are so large-hearted and accepting that they promptly settle into an amiable harmony, complete with affectionate leg-pulling. The wedding with mix-and-match Punjabi and Bengali rituals and customs is an inspired piece of business: the Punjabis are spooked by a posse of loudly ululating Bengali matrons, but only for an instant. They give the well-behaved ladies an impromptu Bhangra lesson and have them all balle-balle-ing with new-found abandon. Vicky's grandma and mom get Ashima's teetotal dad drunk, but the real intoxication is from pure joy.Alas, the truth will and does out, and Ashima goes ballistic when she discovers Vicky's donor past. Will they be able to settle differences and overcome what Ashima perceives as a colossal breach of trust? I am going to stay mum on this - for you really should find out for yourselves.I'm impressed that John Abraham had the acumen to spot the potential in this unconventional project and made it his first producing effort. Kudos to Juhi Chaturvedi who penned a highly original story, screenplay and dialogue, and got the flavours and nuances of Punjabi-centric Delhi and Anglophile Calcutta just right. Shoojit Sircar directs with a light, but ever observant touch, and makes his large cast people you care about. Ayushmaan Khurana doesn't possess movie-star looks but his delightful, ingratiating personality and confidence should compensate abundantly. Yami Gautam is a classic Indian beauty and manages to takes one's breath away in simple every-day clothing - I can't wait to see the results when Manish Malhotra gets his designing hands on her in the Yash Raj extravaganzas that are bound to follow - and she's a good actress, to boot. This intelligent, generous, warm-hearted take on sperm donation does indeed, as its tagline naughtily promises, make every drop count!",this donor generous with laughs heart,this afternoon i watched

7,A nice movie!,"With the passage of time audience have seen that the cinema has changed. I would call it a 360 degree change. There were times when action flicks used to be the talk of the town. There used to be an angry young man beating up the goons either for the sake of vengeance or for proving his macho character. Then there were times when love stories were liked by budding lovers and college sweet-hearts, those movies used to have some great music compositions which were instantly liked and loved by the listeners (of that time). Now weird (for some people) and interesting (for other viewers) movies are made. At some circles slapstick comedies are encouraged and on the other hand people are also appreciating thought provoking cinema. This particular movie, ""Vicky Donor"" is a combination of both.The movie might not get success, on the basis of its topic, screenplay and concept, if it would have been released in 90's or even in 2000's. Audience is much more ready to accept things nowadays. The movie is tale of a Punjabi boy named Vicky Arora (Ayushman) whose great grandfather had 19 children. This story also revolves around a (not so successful) middle aged Doctor Baldev Chadda (Annu Kapoor) who specializes in infertility operations and he runs a fertility clinic and looking for a sperm donor. Last but not the least, this movie also revolves around the love of a Punjabi guy with a Bengali girl Ashima Roy (Yaami Gautam) and their trust and understanding.The theme of the movie is really interesting yet controversial, for some. Dr. Chadda convinces Vicky to donate his sperm so that he can give happiness to those parents who are not blessed with their biological kids. For this he quotes some factual yet hilarious examples to Vicky, regarding Mahabhaarat's time. Finally Dr. Chadda convinces Vicky and he starts to donate sperms. The sequence between Annu Kapoor (as Dr. Chadda) and Ayushmaan (as Vicky) are amazingly hilarious and here definitely Annu Kapoor being a veteran actor takes the audience to the heights of laughter. It is not easy to share the screen with Annu Kapoor but Ayushmaan makes his presence noticed strongly. They both complement each other in almost every scene be it be dramatic or funny. Those who know the roles portrayed by Annu Kapoor in his career will never doubt that he has a caliber that is not shared by many actors. Be it his ""Gali Gali Chor hai"" or ""7 Khoon Maaf"" both roles portrays huge contrast. For those who really want to see his amazing performance must watch ""Ek Ruka hua faisla"" (21 years old young Annu Kapoor portraying a 59 years old lawyer).On the other hand (débutant) Ayushman is also full of surprises. He performs extremely nice as a funky, easy going and smart ass boy at one place, whereas he astonishes audience in climax (I don't want to spoil the experience – watch it yourself). Be it a serious thing or comical the young talent has the potential to get noticed. Yaami Gautam is a well known name of Indian TV Channels but she debuts in this movie and guys will love her charms and sweetness. She does not portray an ""Oh So Sexy"" role but even then am sure guys will smile after watching her and noticing her simplicity. She can go a long way provided she chooses right roles.There are other characters that shine in this movie, including, Vicky's mom (Dolly Ahluwalia) and grand mom (Kamlesh Gill). Jayanta Das, portraying the father of Yaami Gautam, excels brilliantly.On the whole, John Abraham has managed to produce a great piece of funny and witty cinema. The movie shares a nice plot line, if we can save a dying man by donating our blood, why can't we grant our sperms to grant a whole life to someone who does not even exists in the world. The good things about this movie are that it has freshness, good humor, some great performances and a nice handling. Only drawback – it lacks star power (which these days is a must for many movie goers).Music is average, dialogues are hilarious and direction is promising.",nice movie,with passage time audience have seen that cinema has changed i would call it 360 degree change there were times when action flicks used be talk town there used be angry young man beating up goons either sake vengeance or proving his macho character then there were times when love stories were liked by budding lovers college sweet hearts those movies used have some great music compositions which were instantly liked loved by listeners that time now weird some people interesting other viewers movies are made at some circles slapstick comedies are encouraged other hand people are also appreciating thought provoking cinema this particular movie vicky donor is combination both movie might not get success basis its topic screenplay concept if it would have been released 90s or even 2000s audience is much more ready accept things nowadays movie is tale punjabi boy named vicky arora ayushman whose great grandfather had 19 children this story also revolves around not so successful middle aged doctor baldev chadda annu kapoor who specializes infertility operations he runs fertility clinic looking sperm donor last but not least this movie also revolves around love punjabi guy with bengali girl ashima roy yaami gautam their trust understanding theme movie is really interesting yet controversial some dr chadda convinces vicky donate his sperm so that he can give happiness those parents who are not blessed with their biological kids this he quotes some factual yet hilarious examples vicky regarding mahabhaarats time finally dr chadda convinces vicky he starts donate sperms sequence between annu kapoor as dr chadda ayushmaan as vicky are amazingly hilarious here definitely annu kapoor being veteran actor takes audience heights laughter it is not easy share screen with annu kapoor but ayushmaan makes his presence noticed strongly they both complement each other almost every scene be it be dramatic or funny those who know roles portrayed by annu kapoor his career will never doubt that he has caliber that is not shared by many actors be it his gali gali chor hai or 7 khoon maaf both roles portrays huge contrast those who really want see his amazing performance must watch ek ruka hua faisla 21 years old young annu kapoor portraying 59 years old lawyer other hand d butant ayushman is also full surprises he performs extremely nice as funky easy going smart ass boy at one place whereas he astonishes audience climax i dont want spoil experience watch it yourself be it serious thing or comical young talent has potential get noticed yaami gautam is well known name indian tv channels but she debuts this movie guys will love her charms sweetness she does not portray oh so sexy role but even then am sure guys will smile after watching her noticing her simplicity she can go long way provided she chooses right roles there are other characters that shine this movie including vickys mom dolly ahluwalia grand mom kamlesh gill jayanta das portraying father yaami gautam excels brilliantly whole john abraham has managed produce great piece funny witty cinema movie shares nice plot line if we can save dying man by donating our blood why cant we grant our sperms grant whole life someone who does not even exists world good things about this movie are that it has freshness good humor some great performances nice handling only drawback it lacks star power which these days is must many movie goers music is average dialogues are hilarious direction is promising,0.6167836792836792,0.2842948717948718,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8,"If there can be blood donors to save life , why can't there be sperm donors to give new lease of life !!!","Vicky Donor was a complete different movie with a beautiful message .Dr.Baldev Chadda has a fertility chamber in the midst of New Delhi where he helps infertile parents to have their own child with help of sperm donors. However, he is running out business as his clients are not satisfied with his sperm donors. Dr. must find a healthy donor with good family history to run the show. Enter Vicky Arora, a street-smart, smooth-talker chap who has no job and is dependent on income from his mother's beauty parlor. Dr. Baldev Chadda is impressed with his ancestral background and must convince him to donate sperms in order to save his business and Vicky must find a good way to earn some bucks. Shoojit Sircar (Yahaan) goes a complete different way and chunks out a very hard hitting yet very delightful movie with a lovely message in the end. It takes guts to direct a film of this stature and at the same time make it entertaining. Hats off to the director for trying out something out of box and give us a heart-warming and touching movie. The script holds your attention right from the beginning till the end. The story is superb considering to be one of its kind in Bollywood. Coming to performances, Annu Kapoor steals the thunder. The actor is superb in the role of Dr. Baldev Chaddha. One of the hilarious scene is where he explains the process of formation of egg in a female body. Ayushmann Khuranna is amazing as a first time actor. The actor plays the role of Vicky with conviction. Special mention for his tuneful compilation of the song ""Panni Da rang "" which he has sung and written as well. Yami Gautam surprises with her acting. She gets the ample scope to display her talent in the 2nd half. Dolly Ahluwalia and Kamlesh Gill are outstanding as the mother and grandmother of Vicky. Vicky Donor promises and delivers the way it was shown in the trailer – hilarious. I am happy with the way Bollywood directors are doing things differently and thinking out of the box.

6,A good low budget movie..,"Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurana) is an aimless and jobless Delhi boy. He is persuaded by Dr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), an infertility clinic owner to become a sperm donor that could help childless couples. After much resistance, he finally agrees to the act to earn some easy money. Soon he makes a fortune out of his potent attribute. He also marries the love of his life Ashima (Yaami Gautam) but things take a drastic turn when she comes to know about his covert contributions to the sperm bank.Vicky Donor comes with a fresh story. Call it a love story on the backdrop of sperm donation or a film about sperm donation with a love story within - the writing by Juhi Chaturvedi seamlessly integrates the two elements to come up with a wholesome entertainer. Further director Shoojit Sircar flawlessly catches the pulse of Delhi and the drama in the narrative.While the film lightly touches on the theme of the shortage of sperm donors and the social stigma attached to the act (unlike blood or organ donations), it intentionally refrains from being an issue-based cinema. Vicky's initial opposition to the idea aptly brings out the average apprehensions and his consequent consent reveals the monetary motives behind the act.The love story between the lead pair that starts off on a flirtatious note but soon translates into an amiable affair, brings a sublime smile on your face throughout. The romance is refreshing and the chemistry between the couple is hot-n-happening. Soon the love affair of the cross-cultural couple gets into the 'Two States' zone. The film takes an unapologetic look at the culture characteristics (or call it clichés) of the Punjabi boy and Bengali girl and the divergent divide expressed in the sequence of scenes that lead to their matrimony is absolutely uproarious.But beyond having a splendid sense of humour, the film also has a very poignant side to it. The fact that Vicky's fervent fertility isn't of any productive use to himself is where the film defines a strong contrasting conflict in the narrative. Since the couple's camaraderie was so sizzling, you feel the pinch as they part ways. Further Sircar successfully defines and distinguishes emotions, elucidating how the point of marital discord between the couple is not merely mistrust but insecurity. The climax comes across as convenient though isn't unconvincing.The pacing is fast and the multiple-montage crisp editing never lets you lose the narrative. The dialogues vary from the quirky to the well- worded conversations and contribute immensely to the humour quotient. The music is peppy and goes smoothly with the flow of the film.Vicky Donor is what it is primarily for the livewire energy of Vicky played by Ayushmann Khurana. The actor is so natural that it never seems he's acting but rather gliding through the role. He is a pro at both the comedy and emotional scenes. Given the right roles, Ayushmann has the potential to be the next big thing in Bollywood. Yaami Gautam is absolutely ravishing and captivates with her unending charm. The beauty also reflects in her performance. The supporting cast is blessed with quirky yet relatable characterizations. Annu Kapoor as the desperate doctor is brilliant and incites most laughs. Dolly Ahluwalia as the hyperactive Punjabi mother is superlative and such a pleasant change from the regular prototypes. Kamlesh Gill as the modern grandma who shares a drink with her daughter-in-law and aspires for iphones and LED TVs is another fabulous characterization and a fantabulous actor. Jayanta Das as the girl's Bengali father is as much amusing.",good low budget movie,vicky arora ayushmann khurana is aimless jobless delhi boy he is persuaded by dr baldev chaddha annu kapoor infertility clinic owner become sperm donor that could help childless couples after much resistance he finally agrees act earn some easy money soon he makes fortune out his potent attribute he also marries love his life ashima yaami gautam but things take drastic turn when she comes know about his covert contributions sperm bank vicky donor comes with fresh story call it love story backdrop sperm donation or film about sperm donation with love story within writing by juhi chaturvedi seamlessly integrates two elements come up with wholesome entertainer further director shoojit sircar flawlessly catches pulse delhi drama narrative while film lightly touches theme shortage sperm donors social stigma attached act unlike blood or organ donations it intentionally refrains being issue based cinema vickys initial opposition idea aptly brings out average apprehensions his consequent consent reveals monetary motives behind act love story between lead pair that starts off flirtatious note but soon translates into amiable affair brings sublime smile your face throughout romance is refreshing chemistry between couple is hot n happening soon love affair cross cultural couple gets into two states zone film takes unapologetic look at culture characteristics or call it clich s punjabi boy bengali girl divergent divide expressed sequence scenes that lead their matrimony is absolutely uproarious but beyond having splendid sense humour film also has very poignant side it fact that vickys fervent fertility isnt any productive use himself is where film defines strong contrasting conflict narrative since couples camaraderie was so sizzling you feel pinch as they part ways further sircar successfully defines distinguishes emotions elucidating how point marital discord between couple is not merely mistrust but insecurity climax comes across as convenient though isnt unconvincing pacing is fast multiple montage crisp editing never lets you lose narrative dialogues vary quirky well worded conversations contribute immensely humour quotient music is peppy goes smoothly with flow film vicky donor is what it is primarily livewire energy vicky played by ayushmann khurana actor is so natural that it never seems hes acting but rather gliding through role he is pro at both comedy emotional scenes given right roles ayushmann has potential be next big thing bollywood yaami gautam is absolutely ravishing captivates with her unending charm beauty also reflects her performance supporting cast is blessed with quirky yet relatable characterizations annu kapoor as desperate doctor is brilliant incites most laughs dolly ahluwalia as hyperactive punjabi mother is superlative such pleasant change regular prototypes kamlesh gill as modern grandma who shares drink with her daughter law aspires iphones led tvs is another fabulous characterization fantabulous actor jayanta das as girls bengali father is as much amusing,0.574225492022102,0.24834543987086355,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.22}"
6,a refreshing romantic comedy on a social problem.... but a bit glib,"""Vicky Donor"" highlights a relevant subject concerning modern society. Due to the stressful and career oriented modern life, many couples are having problems to conceive and have babies. For the problem, sperm donation has been shown as an alternative in this witty romantic comedy. Still our society isn't ready for sperm donation which is seen as a taboo. There is no harm in such practice and is a boon to the couples who are unable to conceive.The protagonist of the film is a jobless youth, who pressurized by a doctor in the infertility clinic, starts to secretly donate his sperm for raising money. The revelation of the truth brings turmoil in his family and love life which is resolved by the doctor of the infertility clinic himself. Undoubtedly, the subject of the film is novel and deserves a big applaud which suggests a solution for a social problem. However, the light treatment of the subject, slack narrative, and glibness with which things are resolved don't leave much of the impact.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",refreshing romantic comedy social problem but bit glib,vicky donor highlights relevant subject concerning modern society due stressful career oriented modern life many couples are having problems conceive have babies problem sperm donation has been shown as alternative this witty romantic comedy still our society isnt ready sperm donation which is seen as taboo there is no harm such practice is boon couples who are unable conceive protagonist film is jobless youth who pressurized by doctor infertility clinic starts secretly donate his sperm raising money revelation truth brings turmoil his family love life which is resolved by doctor infertility clinic himself undoubtedly subject film is novel deserves big applaud which suggests solution social problem however light treatment subject slack narrative glibness with which things are resolved dont leave much impact rating 2 stars out 4,0.46856060606060607,0.09734848484848486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.59}"
10,Why 8 or 9 out of 10????!!!!!,"As I am writing this, about 5000 people have rated this film; 25% of them have rated it a 10. 50% of them have rated it a 9 or 8 and the remaining 25% have rated it a 7 or less. I am not going to even bother with the bottom 25% - they exist to make life interesting and adventurous. The top 25%: glad you got it. The remaining 50% who rated it 8 or 9 - I ask you this humbly and earnestly: Why? Lets look at the film as objectively as in my opinion, I can. The script of the film is excellent; no major glitches, hardly any minor ones, respect for the audience's intelligence, very authentic (if you happen to be familiar with the Delhi milieu, you will surely agree), multi-dimensional characters, 3 complete acts, extremely good dialogues. Technically, as in cinematography, production design, art direction, sound, sfx, it has limited scope due to the script, but within that limited scope, very competent. The editing could perhaps have chopped off about 1-2 minutes in the pre-climax when there is a conflict in the protagonists' lives. The music is very apt for the tone and flow of the film, Paani Da Rang being my personal favourite. Very ably directed by Soojit Sircar. He had a fantastic script to work with and his genius was in adhering to it. He has also done a brilliant job in his choice of actors. Ayushman Khurana, Anu Kapoor, Yami Gautam and Dolly Ahluwalia are the principal characters who have all done a fabulous job. But the diligence of Sircar lies in his choice of his supporting cast. There are at least another 20 speaking characters in the film and their competent characterization in writing and performing lends tremendous credibility to the film. From a financial standpoint, the film was made on a very reasonable budget (Rs. 5 crore as per wikipedia) and marketed appropriately earning over 9 times the cost (again as per wikipedia). So the producers have done justice to their investors as well as distributors. Great balance of art and commerce.Now, moving on to the heart from the brain, this film in my opinion is phenomenal. It is a great comedy not just for its laugh-off-your-chair moments, but for its numerous bring-a-smile-to-your-face moments and touch-your-heart moments. In the world of films, most of us love categorization as per genres and this would fall into the feel-good comedies section at your DVD store or your online streaming website. And we are unfortunately programmed to think that feel-good is not worthy of a 10. There should be some larger-than-life greatness or a very grand idea about how to make the world a better place for a movie to be rated a 10. I will just say this: (aside from the fact that as a healthy father married to the healthy mother of our healthy 8 month old grace from God baby girl, I balled my eyes out at the end of this 2 hour joyful bliss) Hrishikesh Mukherjee would have been very proud of Shoojit Sircar. Definitely the best of 2012 thus far.",why 8 or 9 out 10,as i am writing this about 5000 people have rated this film 25 them have rated it 10 50 them have rated it 9 or 8 remaining 25 have rated it 7 or less i am not going even bother with bottom 25 they exist make life interesting adventurous top 25 glad you got it remaining 50 who rated it 8 or 9 i ask you this humbly earnestly why lets look at film as objectively as my opinion i can script film is excellent no major glitches hardly any minor ones respect audiences intelligence very authentic if you happen be familiar with delhi milieu you will surely agree multi dimensional characters 3 complete acts extremely good dialogues technically as cinematography production design art direction sound sfx it has limited scope due script but within that limited scope very competent editing could perhaps have chopped off about 1 2 minutes pre climax when there is conflict protagonists lives music is very apt tone flow film paani da rang being my personal favourite very ably directed by soojit sircar he had fantastic script work with his genius was adhering it he has also done brilliant job his choice actors ayushman khurana anu kapoor yami gautam dolly ahluwalia are principal characters who have all done fabulous job but diligence sircar lies his choice his supporting cast there are at least another 20 speaking characters film their competent characterization writing performing lends tremendous credibility film financial standpoint film was made very reasonable budget rs 5 crore as per wikipedia marketed appropriately earning over 9 times cost again as per wikipedia so producers have done justice their investors as well as distributors great balance art commerce now moving heart brain this film my opinion is phenomenal it is great comedy not just its laugh off your chair moments but its numerous bring smile your face moments touch your heart moments world films most us love categorization as per genres this would fall into feel good comedies section at your dvd store or your online streaming website we are unfortunately programmed think that feel good is not worthy 10 there should be some larger than life greatness or very grand idea about how make world better place movie be rated 10 i will just say this aside fact that as healthy father married healthy mother our healthy 8 month old grace god baby girl i balled my eyes out at end this 2 hour joyful bliss hrishikesh mukherjee would have been very proud shoojit sircar definitely best 2012 thus far,0.5682546524356872,0.3374866584564861,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9,Vicky Donor : Clinging on to Reality,"A month ago when I first saw the trailer of Vicky Donor, I was outright shocked - had the limit of vulgarity been crossed that Bollywood was now making movies on sperm donors!! Finally when I decided to see it post hearing some rave reviews I had difficulty telling my folks that I am going for a film like Vicky Donor - obviously a crude Punjabi sex comedy.Except I couldn't have been more wrong and pleasantly surprised by what might just not be the best film this year but a landmark film in general. Just about everything in the film was not just good it was damn perfect.So, as the story goes Vicky Arora (Anshuman Khurana) is your average Punjabi Delhi boy (a character type way too visible in almost every next film these days) His paths cross with a desperate Dr. Chaddha (Annu Kapoor) – a fertility specialist who is obsessed with good quality sperm. Dr. Chaddha's clinic is under threat as most of the sperms in his sperm bank are not up to the mark and can't deliver the ""goods"".The first half of the film is primarily driven by Dr. Chaddha trying to convince Vicky to become a paid donor as his sperms result showcase him as having the highest fertility and motility rates. At the same time, Vicky is also trying to woo a hot Bengali banker Ashima in his typical Delhi Punjabi Boy style. There are also other interesting characters like Vicky's mother Dolly who runs a beauty parlour and Ashima's English speaking stereotypical ""bong"" father.It is unsaid there are three things that work flawlessly for the film – the first is the screen writing. From the story to the dialogues to the way this difficult topic is laid out – it is an almost perfect script. Juhi Chaturvedi the writer has to be for Vicky Donor what Amit Trivedi was to Dev D. Without her writing this would never have been the film it turns out. It would have been tempting to convert this story into a long series of sex jokes what with the central topic being sperm. As a matter of fact, in the hands of commercialized Bolllywood it would have become just that (one can imagine a Sajid khan overfilling it with sex jokes and laughing himself the loudest)Except that the screenplay just does not allow that. There is hardly a joke in the film which would qualify as toiler humor – a masterstroke as it not only makes the story credible but also allows it to have a smart social message. The credit goes to the dialogues and situations. From the Bengali – North Indian wedding which was so apt (since I myself underwent one recently) to the second half where the protagonists face a personal challenge - the script is plain brilliant!! The second point which stands out and practically runs Vicky donor are the performances. Annu Kapoor has always been an exceptional actor from his Tezaab days but in Vicky Donor he is touching a new high. You know he hits home when one ends up understanding his frustration of trying to explain to people that sperm donation is not a dirty profession but the need of the hour almost like a social service. The other standout performance is of Anshuman Khurana as Vicky. The cheesy oneliners he uses to woo Ashima would have been PJs in the hands of any other actor but Anshuman delivers them with the perfect tilt of head. Not to mention his well handled moments of poignancy in the second half of the film.Again Dolly Ahluwalia as the cribbing mom and Kamlesh Gill as her super cool mom in law / Vicky's grandmother stand out. One actually looks forward to their scenes in the films. In one particular scene - 50 yr + traditionally clad mother and mom in law are having their daily drinks – in the midst of it all - the mother in law gets emotional about Dolly not getting any dowry. This hilarious and continuous check on reality makes this film a pleasure to watch.The third point that stands out is the editing - at exactly 2 hours, Vicky Donor makes for an enjoyable 120 minutes, no time is wasted on anything which does not add value to the script. Even a romantic evening out for the couple ends in a revelation which is that check of reality the film keeps subtlety bringing about.The slice of life comedy with an emotional social message genre has seen the Munnabhai movies and 3 idiots as the best entries so far. Vicky Donor is a wonderful addition to this genre and makes it all the more relevant and believable.Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to watch entertaining cinema and yet not leave their brains at home. So do go out watch this film and don't forget to tell your parents that you are going for Vicky Donor – a comedy about sperm donation.",vicky donor clinging reality,month ago when i first saw trailer vicky donor i was outright shocked had limit vulgarity been crossed that bollywood was now making movies sperm donors finally when i decided see it post hearing some rave reviews i had difficulty telling my folks that i am going film like vicky donor obviously crude punjabi sex comedy except i couldnt have been more wrong pleasantly surprised by what might just not be best film this year but landmark film general just about everything film was not just good it was damn perfect so as story goes vicky arora anshuman khurana is your average punjabi delhi boy character type way too visible almost every next film these days his paths cross with desperate dr chaddha annu kapoor fertility specialist who is obsessed with good quality sperm dr chaddhas clinic is under threat as most sperms his sperm bank are not up mark cant deliver goods first half film is primarily driven by dr chaddha trying convince vicky become paid donor as his sperms result showcase him as having highest fertility motility rates at same time vicky is also trying woo hot bengali banker ashima his typical delhi punjabi boy style there are also other interesting characters like vickys mother dolly who runs beauty parlour ashimas english speaking stereotypical bong father it is unsaid there are three things that work flawlessly film first is screen writing story dialogues way this difficult topic is laid out it is almost perfect script juhi chaturvedi writer has be vicky donor what amit trivedi was dev d without her writing this would never have been film it turns out it would have been tempting convert this story into long series sex jokes what with central topic being sperm as matter fact hands commercialized bolllywood it would have become just that one can imagine sajid khan overfilling it with sex jokes laughing himself loudest except that screenplay just does not allow that there is hardly joke film which would qualify as toiler humor masterstroke as it not only makes story credible but also allows it have smart social message credit goes dialogues situations bengali north indian wedding which was so apt since i myself underwent one recently second half where protagonists face personal challenge script is plain brilliant second point which stands out practically runs vicky donor are performances annu kapoor has always been exceptional actor his tezaab days but vicky donor he is touching new high you know he hits home when one ends up understanding his frustration trying explain people that sperm donation is not dirty profession but need hour almost like social service other standout performance is anshuman khurana as vicky cheesy oneliners he uses woo ashima would have been pjs hands any other actor but anshuman delivers them with perfect tilt head not mention his well handled moments poignancy second half film again dolly ahluwalia as cribbing mom kamlesh gill as her super cool mom law vickys grandmother stand out one actually looks forward their scenes films one particular scene 50 yr traditionally clad mother mom law are having their daily drinks midst it all mother law gets emotional about dolly not getting any dowry this hilarious continuous check reality makes this film pleasure watch third point that stands out is editing at exactly 2 hours vicky donor makes enjoyable 120 minutes no time is wasted anything which does not add value script even romantic evening out couple ends revelation which is that check reality film keeps subtlety bringing about slice life comedy with emotional social message genre has seen munnabhai movies 3 idiots as best entries so far vicky donor is wonderful addition this genre makes it all more relevant believable overall i would recommend this film anyone who likes watch entertaining cinema yet not leave their brains at home so do go out watch this film dont forget tell your parents that you are going vicky donor comedy about sperm donation,0.5321489283074649,0.14975240206947524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10,A game changer for Indian Film Industry - must watch!!,"Vicky Donor: Bollywood correction Indian Film Industry has grown up..it may have taken 100 years for this but wo kehte hain na 'Der Aaye Durust Aaye'. A very different topic first of all for the movie - a very brave one considering the Indian audience - so all credit to producers. Then for making a superb light comedy out of such a topic credit should go to Sujit Sarkar, the director. Performances of Ayushmaan and Yami have been really great. Ayushmaan has been there on small screen for sometime and he continues his charm on the big screen as well. Yami has looked ravishing throughout - seems her fair and lovely expense is paying off ;). Anu Kapoor shows his maturity in his role. The duo of Dolly and her in-law has been rib-tickling throughout.

6,"Once you get past the unbearable first half, it's actually a good movie.","Seeing Vicky coming to the bank just to talk to her, even after she repeatedly saying no, I wondered why she didn't get a restriction order, and get the crap over with? Then I realised I have been watching too many sensible Hollywood movies, and this kind of romance (read borderline stalking/harassment) is the backbone of Indian cinema romance. And of course yes any jobless shmoe could get a beautiful educated lady to fall for him. Please don't ask any questions. That's how it is. And of course a lady with a bank job would never ask her boyfriend more about his job, than ""business"" and how he has got so much sparetime. Now if we wipe all that dirt away, the picture beneath is really beautiful. I enjoyed the movie from the point where Vicky admits he is a sperm donor. I would never have expected Bollywood cinema to make movies like Vicky Donor and Badhaai ho. It's a definite improvement and I love it. Though still quite far away from including sex education in the syllabus, mass media of course is the first step. Aside from cheesy dialogs like ""without ashima ghar is not ghar"", ""i can't live without her"" etc Ayushmann's performance was really good. I loved the character of Ashima's father. They've taken care not to make characters too one-dimensional. Mr. Chadda's genuine care for Vicky, Ashima's understandable insecurity and Vicky's change of behaviour, to a higher level of maturity is all heartwarming. The final scene is gold. I rated it a 6, because although a foray in terms of theme/story, for Bollywood, it seems incapable for them to free from certain shackles of illogical, conventional story arcs. Something, movies like Andhadhun and Kaabil could acheive, starring both actors.",once you get past unbearable first half its actually good movie,seeing vicky coming bank just talk her even after she repeatedly saying no i wondered why she didnt get restriction order get crap over with then i realised i have been watching too many sensible hollywood movies this kind romance read borderline stalking harassment is backbone indian cinema romance course yes any jobless shmoe could get beautiful educated lady fall him please dont ask any questions thats how it is course lady with bank job would never ask her boyfriend more about his job than business how he has got so much sparetime now if we wipe all that dirt away picture beneath is really beautiful i enjoyed movie point where vicky admits he is sperm donor i would never have expected bollywood cinema make movies like vicky donor badhaai ho its definite improvement i love it though still quite far away including sex education syllabus mass media course is first step aside cheesy dialogs like without ashima ghar is not ghar i cant live without her etc ayushmanns performance was really good i loved character ashimas father theyve taken care not make characters too one dimensional mr chaddas genuine care vicky ashimas understandable insecurity vickys change behaviour higher level maturity is all heartwarming final scene is gold i rated it 6 because although foray terms theme story bollywood it seems incapable them free certain shackles illogical conventional story arcs something movies like andhadhun kaabil could acheive starring both actors,0.6078483245149913,0.24596761263427933,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
