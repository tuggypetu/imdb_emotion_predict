10.0,Are you watching closely?,"The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet ""The Great Danton"" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name ""The Professor"" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of ""The Transported Man"" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of ""The Transported Man"", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: ""Are you watching closely?"" A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10",are you watching closely,prestige adapted award winning novel same name by christopher priest is intricate tale passion intrigue deceit obsession about two illusionists whose morbid covetousness absolute supremacy their profession engenders fierce rivalry that turns internecine ultimately consumes them alfred borden christian bale robert angier hugh jackman at start their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting elderly illusionist named milton bordens incessant longing innovation leads accidental death angiers wife borden marries sarah his apparent happiness further aggravates sense revulsion angiers heart angiers vindictive intervention during bullet catch trick causes borden lose his two fingers though these events sowed seeds implacable hatred but it is unremitting yearning their perpetually insatiable egos outperform each other that eventually drives them perdition angier starts performing with sobriquet great danton with cutter michael caine as his illusion engineer while borden with stage name professor with fellon as his engineer angier is adept showman but lacks technical prowess contrary borden is highly skillful but lacks taste grandeur showmanship each regards other as his only obstacle owing their bitterly intertwined past this starts series events which each tries stymie other by any means possible sabotage abduction incrimination even killings awed by apparent genuineness bordens version transported man inveigled by bordens deliberate misdirection angier travels miles spends fortune approach ingenious scientist named nikola tesla david bowie order cajole him into building machine him machine that could help him outperform borden nikola tesla is apostle alternating current rightly thinks it be superior direct current is under immense pressure imparted by thomas edison ruthless advocator direct current his men who are after tesla as edisons men close him tesla runs out time hence funds his research is forced oblige angier who is his very last client tesla flees scene shortly after fulfilling his promise angier not without leaving him strong note caution against use his invention whose ever increasing skepticism tesla is placated by efficacy his masterful invention using teslas machine angier introduces his own version transported man which becomes instant success but lieu terrible self sacrifice that angier has make every night while performing as story culminates viewer is startled with many revelations including mental physical torments that bordens complex character undergoes owing his total devotion towards his art success act illusion solely depends upon deftness with which its three parts viz pledge turn prestige are performed similarly movie be success its three main aspects i e screenplay direction acting are ought be top notch christopher nolan incredibly manages strike all right cords with prestige his riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize brilliance movie ten fold nolan succeeds having dream assemblage actors with almost everyone giving memorable performance christian bale hugh jackman are superb their lead roles michael caine shines his low key portrayal cutter ordinary part made appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance vintage caine david bowie as nikola tesla andy serkis gollum lotr as alley teslas assistant are stupendous their cameos scarlet johansson also manages give scintillating portrayal as bordens paramour olivia movie is roller coaster ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots masterful time switching which makes it one kind ultimate masterpiece uncanny feat nolan manifest motion picture which forays realms mystery thrill sci fi fantasy is truly exemplary makes movie contemporary classic movie is tapestry twists turns which evinces its overwhelming potential bewitch masses satiate even most esoteric viewers questions that it incessantly asks viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings with each viewing seeking utmost attention viewer only question that i would ask viewer is are you watching closely must watch anyone who has nothing against giving his mind rigorous exercise his body adrenaline rush 10 10,0.5525952380952379,0.16341369047619045,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Fantastic.,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+"".",fantastic,i wont say its underrated movie but it has somewhat been buried by legacy other popular nolan movies with this movie nolan shows his ability make metacinematic film yet again this is obviously my most favorite christopher nolan movie along with memento 2000 just like you can relate theme memories interpretations shown story memento with actual experience we had while watching movie we can relate three acts magic trick narrated within story with movie itself as movie says final reveal magic trick is most thrilling experience so is that this movie fact whole movie can be weirdly related magic trick it is one those movies which feel quite ordinary until major twist makes it great speaking cinematic experience it is typical nolan styled movie it has broken timelines enhance storytelling but unlike most his movies these are done more artistically than just thrilling reveal this is perhaps movie where nolans broken timelines have enhanced storytelling most brilliant way like most movies he dwells single theme here its obsession obsession robert angier is what drives plot movie is well established doesnt even feel forced there is protagonist antagonist this movie character development is done so smoothly that we see protagonist become antagonist while antagonist remains somewhat same though we dont get full interchange between antagonist protagonist as movie progresses protagonist feels more wrong than antagonist thats quite difficult thing that it pulls off alfred bordon is one most complex characters i have ever seen he feels like some kind prick throughout movie there are lot scenes establish it viewers thats until we get know his character third act it doesnt make him right his wrong doings but he gets respect his dedication as magician whole tesla plotline might feel like convenient plot device but tesla is scientist who is rumoured travel through time so that is quite justifiable hugh jackman has given solid performance this must go down as his best performances with those prisoners 2013 logan 2017 he is completely out his public persona wolverine he is best possible choice wolverine imo but reminder wolverine every time he appears screen isnt so adorable he didnt remind me wolverine at all this movie but major highlight movie would be christian bale he has given terrific performance you dont even get hint at complexity character he is portraying its after reveal fact second viewing that you start noticing actual stuffs actual interpretations particular scene is be given all all its fantastic movie way obsession play out be main theme way broken timelines are used storytelling way final twist is revealed simply excellent it gets special 10 10,0.5498992189468379,0.19019904257999493,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,A Nutshell Review: The Prestige,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no wrong. Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy) cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist. The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession, revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can sometimes be used as tools for deceit. What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience, somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be detrimental to any leaks of secrets. And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn between the rivals added a little gravitas. The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian scientist!  I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in, without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours, you don't feel its length at all. At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection - what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none other. P.S.

8.0,So glad this movie did not stay an illusion...,"In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"".The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long ""The Prestige"". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie.",so glad this movie did not stay illusion,filmmakers minds instead it became one finest films year 2006 prestige is perfect example what movie should be like if it does not rely you liking cheering central characters neither angier jackman nor borden bale are likable characters at all yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes this may be bit subjective take as i quite like hugh jackman find bale joy watch most time as well johansson hall are among my favorite actresses as well but its not only cast that makes it so much worth watching its also visual side art direction set decoration cinematography costumes are top notch even rare special effects are pretty nice film managed two academy award nominations its visual side both them very deserved i actually would not have minded if it had won one these over pans labyrinth films director is christopher nolan he also wrote movie together with his brother after first batman film he also cast some actors his superhero trilogy including bale caine only one who didnt do that much me now back nolans script i think this is probably heart soul film such love detail so much suspense so many surprises all these great scenes like doppelg nger parts or suicide halls character room with all birds which were actually way how he met her when he talked her nephew very very smart screenplay all all best thing about it however is how he wrote two protagonists their egos constantly clashing with each other maybe because they werent so different after all course jackman bale give great performances too that is why it worked so well but still you cannot appreciate nolans effort enough his brothers lets not forget about him people say nolan has problems when it comes directing writing realistic female characters but i disagree he managed this film without doubt he also managed others when two magicians fight each other or i should probably say get their hands dirty literally everybody else this film is constantly affected their women their assistants their set creators accidental death one characters wife sets off deadly spiral which results murder end or does it really nothing this film is what it seems we do not only get one major plot twist end but two apart that progress terms inventions electricity also brings completely new dimension progress profession magician actually life general everybody so we also get some interesting references nikola tesla thomas edison i also liked how nolan revealed some tricks but not all them so movie itself stays bit mystery still this was second time i watched this film it was as good as first i highly recommend watching almost 10 year old 120 minute long prestige its possibly my favorite christopher nolan movie,0.4865793271056428,0.23265341383762436,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.32}"

Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me.

9.0,Webby meshwork of magic and mystery,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years.

8.0,Storytelling at its best!,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.",storytelling at its best,prestige is masterful exercise storytelling with superb direction powerful performances by grand ensemble cast set production design cinematography script presentation christopher nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one film worlds brightest up coming directors prestige only helps solidify his standing as one landmark directors his generation told narrative that jumps between various points along its time line playing out like magic act itself story is that two magicians rise their careers first played by christian bale is expert understanding fundamentals any trick but lacks showmanship second played by hugh jackman is master showman who is more entertaining than technical tragic series events pits two performers against each other battle wits that spirals further further out control consuming both them everything everyone they care about with story that requires actors with great deal emotive range nolan has assembled what could be described as dream cast both bale jackman suit their respective roles perfectly pitting these two performers against each other was stroke casting genius michael caine takes what could have been forgettable role by any lesser actor elevates it with his demanding screen presence probably most surprising performance comes david bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist nikola tesla absolutely shines add andy serkis mix what is assembled is group performers who know how fully engage audience prestige is hard pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks fine line between mystery drama suspense fantasy that story becomes never ending stream wonder mind one can never tell exactly where story is going lead next becoming more more as time goes this gives christopher nolan ample opportunity play play he does with narration by several characters each adding their own viewpoint events with direction that moves between time mystify distract end result is climax that itself is series puzzles that each unravel beautifully only major criticisms that can be leveled at prestige are confusing play with seasons during teslas introduction winter suddenly becomes spring summer back again strange choice music closing credits pop song at end film such as this seems tacky however neither is significant enough problem warrant any need avoid film at all end prestige is fantastic display what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent it is certainly worth price admission as good as any magic show you are come across,0.5542452830188679,0.25212264150943386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,A Film with Intellect,"I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again.

10.0,Give This Film Time to Sink In...,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"".

8.0,"A Stylish, Uniquely Twisted Period Piece","What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.",stylish uniquely twisted period piece,what prestige does very well is recreate period show business history near turn century which competition between magicians was serious intense workings complicated illusions are gorgeously brought life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate actual mechanics victorian legerdemain much film rings very true such as all consuming obsessions lead characters be best outdo all others its easy step accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory as rival magicians suave rupert angier riveting performance by hugh jackman audacious alfred borden christian bale effortlessly playing brooding lower class brit each seek wreak continuing revenge upon other story though adapted novel feels like perfect fit director nolans sensibilities as machinations two men become increasingly convoluted during back forth tug wits that keeps you guessing style nolans memento as game grows increasingly deadly threatens consume all they love film becomes fascinating study single mindedness work is epic sweep beautifully filmed strongly acted only odd note casting is david bowie as nikola tesla he looks nothing like actual tesla if you care about these sort things his appearance calls attention itself as superstar casting often does but mr bowie holds his own solid performances are all around with michael caine adding dignity depth as old master scarlett johanssen as as lovely stage assistant who becomes third point twisted love triangle even andy serkis gollum memorable supporting role introduction tesla adds yet another twist as film shifts real but possible stage illusion steam punkish sci fi this transition is hard note pull off since beginning film doesnt quite suggest such direction but if youre willing let nolan lead you journey into increasingly fantastic realms narrative rewards you with thought provoking moral dramatic exploration issues raised truly entertaining movie original unusual dark ride well worth seeing theater its grand scope vision,0.5808646616541355,0.17500417710944025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"

8.0,Batman and Alfred (outside Gotham) meet Wolverine,"In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).",batman alfred outside gotham meet wolverine,between batman movies christopher nolan cast christian bale michael caine prestige it tells story magicians alfred borden bale robert angier hugh jackman initially partners they had falling out became rivals there movie becomes battle wits showing how men have no aim except destroy other caine plays john cutter state engineer who works angier i notice similarities between this movie some nolans others theres non linear plot like memento one upmanship like insomnia question morality like dark knight but what impressed me more than anything was all stuff about magic tricks how characters use tricks against each other how they both use olivia wenscombe scarlett johansson angiers bordens rivalry mirrors nikola teslas david bowie rivalry with thomas edison all all i recommend this movie its both look into world magic tricks also dangers obsession with revenge also starring andy serkis gollum lotr movies ricky jay real life magician ps other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are illusionist scoop also starring hugh jackman scarlett johansson,0.45535714285714285,0.1767857142857143,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"A Great Tale of Rivalry, Obsession, Revenge and Sacrifice","In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")",great tale rivalry obsession revenge sacrifice,end nineteenth century london robert angier hugh jackman his beloved wife julia mccullough piper perabo alfred borden christian bale are friends assistants magician when julia accidentally dies during performance robert blames alfred her death they become enemies both become famous rival magicians sabotaging performance other stage when alfred performs successful trick robert becomes obsessed trying disclose secret his competitor with tragic consequences prestige is great tale rivalry obsession revenge sacrifice unpredictable screenplay has many twists disclosing unusual situations hooking attention viewer until very last scene christopher nolan after masterpiece memento offers another excellent movie cinema lovers better better than oscar winner departed amazing dispute between outstanding christian bale hugh jackman is supported by extraordinary michael caine wonderful cinematography my vote is nine title brazil o grande truque great trick,0.6827777777777778,0.31840277777777776,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.25}"
8.0,"""It is very rare to see... real magic.""","Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion.",it is very rare see real magic,oh man this one had me right up part with transporter duplicator machine until then it was compelling complex tale dealing murder mystery intrigue with clever backdrop magicians attempting outdo each other with grandest illusion all time what im not going do is go back watch this three times row like i did with memento because when all is said done i wont be any better off way i felt cheated that 1880s era film would bring fictional sci fi element way it did it seems me story could have gotten around that contrivance come up with more realistic resolution that confined itself existing science techniques illusion then when borden christian bale had his final showdown with angier hugh jackman he could have caught bullet end picture more promising note i dont really mean sound so harsh film because like i said up tesla part this story was going great guns maybe because guy portraying tesla looked so much like david bowie it kept me off stride while as well then it turned out be bowie when credits rolled i was back thinking about that business with cats hats maybe whole thing was illusion,0.49847308488612835,0.19224120082815735,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film.",does anybody look better top hat tails than hugh jackman,but i guess that is really beside point christian bale hugh jackman play two young british magicians alfred borden robert angier trying learn tricks trade somewhat even allied at first borden is common londoner but angier is manor born using alias his magic work so as not embarrass his rich victorian family pursuit more fantastic trick terrible accident occurs angier loses somebody close him vowing revenge against borden whom he holds responsible these two are both roadrunner wiley coyote one another each one tries sabotage learn others tricks make each other look ridiculous etc angier is more dangerous two because he is truly intent killing borden when he infiltrates his catch bullet act early film instead maims him rivalry ratchets up increasingly dangerous proportions it is ultimately fine piece drama as how far these two are willing go their obsession their art with them both ultimately living tragic miserable lives process so much sacrifice what most people would consider trivial pastime it is madness beyond obsession this is very entertaining thought provoking film there is plenty foreshadowing watch closely watch it twice i honestly dont think christopher nolan would be capable linear storytelling if his life depended it but he is master this adapted material at end i could only go brilliant scarlett johannson plays angiers lover who has pivotal role how final act plays out rebecca hall is sarah bordens wife who cant figure out why her husband seems only love her some days david bowie lends real air mystery his portrayal nikola tesla but who else but bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning yes tesla edison feud gets incorporated into film even sci fi angle is thrown into plot michael caine as jackmans magician mentor seems be playing his alfred character dark knight he has supporting role but watch him carefully he has some most important lines film his final decision do you think it was correct did two wrongs make right this unique situation i wish i could tell you more but i would give away plot if i did this is truly one better films made 21st century i largely dont like films made after 1960 highly recommended real head scratcher especially given last line film,0.6094611528822055,0.13453216374269006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Fantastic!,The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.,fantastic,final reveal magic trick is most thrilling experience so is that this movie prestige is masterful exercise storytelling with superb direction powerful performances i was floored by deftness how nolan weaved juxtaposed non linear narrative so flawlessly what makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed movie about magicians or illusionists it is also complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with sideline love story sci fi twist very unique,0.85,0.42410714285714285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,This movie fills the screen and your mind.,"I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one, you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten.

10.0,(Magic) Layers,"I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary!
