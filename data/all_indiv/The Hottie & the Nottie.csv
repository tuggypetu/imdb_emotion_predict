1.0,So ridiculously bad,"OK, I'm not going to bash this film based on Paris Hilton, I admit, I don't like the girl, but I'm not going to base my comment on that alone, I think it's unfair. A lot of people are giving this movie a one just because of Paris without even seeing the movie, it gets a bit annoying. But I don't know why, I think I was just in a mood for one of those awful films that just leave a bad taste in your mouth, I think every once in a while, we need to see something like that. Now the problem with The Hottie and the Nottie, besides it's stupid title? The story, beyond predictable and hypocritical, along with the acting... it's like they just took people off the street who had no credibility to be in a film. I love how Paris Hilton isn't even the main character and yet she is first billed, you know that she paid good money for that or wouldn't be in it, big woop, her as an innocent charity loving girl, that's believable.Nate Cooper is a man that just can't seem to move on in life, after 20 years he returns to his home town looking for his first grade crush, Cristabel. She's still around making men drool, but she won't go for him unless he can hook her ugly friend, June, up with a guy as well. June has bad teeth, bad skin, bad nails, bad hair, just all in all, it's bad, so Nate does everything he can to get June a guy, but it's more difficult than he could ever expect, until he finds out that love isn't everything he thought it might be.The script is predictable, stupid, could've been written by a teenager and was very hypocritical, which you will see what I mean if you watch this movie. Now I know that they were just trying to get a big name, but come on... Paris Hilton? I actually had an open mind and just thought to give the movie a shot, but she just is such a horrible actress, like beyond horrible, I'm not just saying that because of who she is, just I know you'll believe me. This is a movie that really shouldn't have been made or if Hollywood wanted it so much, get different people, please, before they do something like cast Paris... never mind. Stay away from this movie at any costs.1/10",so ridiculously bad,ok im not going bash this film based paris hilton i admit i dont like girl but im not going base my comment that alone i think its unfair lot people are giving this movie one just because paris without even seeing movie it gets bit annoying but i dont know why i think i was just mood one those awful films that just leave bad taste your mouth i think every once while we need see something like that now problem with hottie nottie besides its stupid title story beyond predictable hypocritical along with acting its like they just took people off street who had no credibility be film i love how paris hilton isnt even main character yet she is first billed you know that she paid good money that or wouldnt be it big woop her as innocent charity loving girl thats believable nate cooper is man that just cant seem move life after 20 years he returns his home town looking his first grade crush cristabel shes still around making men drool but she wont go him unless he can hook her ugly friend june up with guy as well june has bad teeth bad skin bad nails bad hair just all all its bad so nate does everything he can get june guy but its more difficult than he could ever expect until he finds out that love isnt everything he thought it might be script is predictable stupid couldve been written by teenager was very hypocritical which you will see what i mean if you watch this movie now i know that they were just trying get big name but come paris hilton i actually had open mind just thought give movie shot but she just is such horrible actress like beyond horrible im not just saying that because who she is just i know youll believe me this is movie that really shouldnt have been made or if hollywood wanted it so much get different people please before they do something like cast paris never mind stay away this movie at any costs 1 10,0.604979674796748,-0.19380081300813004,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.22}"
1.0,Garbage,"The video store was completely out of all the major movie titles, so I'm looking around and land on The Hottie and The Nottie. At first I didn't really want to rent it, but since there really wasn't much else I just went ahead with it. This movie was absolutely horrible from start to finish. This movie has no plot, terrible acting, among other things that make this movie terrible. It is honestly an unwatchable movie. I literally had to turn it off 45 minutes into it because I was bored and Paris Hilton's acting made me lose braincells. So please stay away from this movie it will rot your brain and bore you to death. 1/10",garbage,video store was completely out all major movie titles so im looking around land hottie nottie at first i didnt really want rent it but since there really wasnt much else i just went ahead with it this movie was absolutely horrible start finish this movie has no plot terrible acting among other things that make this movie terrible it is honestly unwatchable movie i literally had turn it off 45 minutes into it because i was bored paris hiltons acting made me lose braincells so please stay away this movie it will rot your brain bore you death 1 10,0.5077380952380952,-0.14375,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,"As stupid and vein as it is disgusting, and this movie is nearly vomit inducing.","It's obvious a movie that's sole claim to fame is that it stars Paris Hilton is not going to be a masterpiece. In fact, it seems every movie Paris Hilton stars in ends up being a horrible mess, and this is no exception. The Hottie and the Nottie...let's just think about what a stupid and conceited title that is. When Paris Hilton was offered the role as ""The Hottie"" she should have turned it down, not just because the script felt like it was written by a 10 year old, but because she is playing ""The Hottie"". That sounds so conceited, especially since Paris Hilton isn't all she seems to think she is. The title is also stupid, and sounds about as mature as the actual script is, which is the maturity you might find in an elementary school bathroom.Nate Cooper (Joel Moore, who seems to be a mixture of John Heder and Mike White) is dumped by his girlfriend and decides to go to Los Angeles to find and date Christabelle Abbot (Paris Hilton), the girl he was attracted to in the first grade. Christabelle is apparently so attractive that every time she goes jogging, all males stop their activities to stare at her mouth agape. He ends up becoming friends again with her, but she can't go out with him because she made a pact with her not so attractive best friend June Phigg (Christina Lakin). Nate tries to set up guys with June to get with Christabelle. As June begins to get procedures done to her to make her less ugly, Nate begins to become more attracted to her.I believe earlier I said that June Phigg was not so attractive. Well that's an understatement. The make-up people made the normally attractive Christina Lakin as nasty looking as possible, with black and green teeth stubs, a balding head, and a terrible case of halitosis. Several times I had to turn away from the screen when they would base the humor around June's hideousness, because I felt like I was going to throw up.The script is bad, unfunny, and along with that shows no development in character whatsoever. Nate begins to fall for June, but not until after she becomes pretty. Before that, he shows no interest in her at all. He didn't even like her personality, he cares simply about looks, so if any of the female characters were like him, they would be running for the hills from this doofy looking guy. In a romantic comedy (I guess you can call this that, despite the lack of romance or humor), you'd expect there to be someone looking for their true love, but not here. It's all about looks in this superficial waste of time. Also Nate is always lying to make himself seem hipper, and ends up seeming like an unfunny version of Seinfeld's George Costanza, mixed with a lobotomized Napolean Dynamite. The plot also makes little sense. This guy had a crush on this girl in the first grade, then moved. Who the heck keeps a crush on a girl he only knew for less than a year, that barely even knew him. He thinks back to his time in elementary school and really wants to see her...she was a little girl. It's almost pedophilic.The acting is all around bad. Joel Moore is by far the best actor, and he doesn't even deserve to play extras in community theater. Paris Hilton has an annoying flirtatious delivery of each line, and I don't think that she was told to act this way, this is just her natural acting abilities. Christina Lakin also has very poor acting abilities, but also didn't really need any. Her role is to be there and look as nasty as possible, then later to look pretty. She has few lines in comparison to the two untalented leads, especially Joel who spouts out stupid lines every 2 seconds. The back-up cast is also terrible, including one guy, who plays Nate's stupid friend, who thinks he is so cool, he's credited as The Greg Wilson, after all it's super cool to put a ""The"" in front of your name.I watched this movie, because I thought it might be one of those ""So bad it's funny"" experiences that you enjoy laughing about later with friends. This is not one of those movies. It's just bad, no wait, it's just terrible. The movie's sense of the humor is so bad, it actually almost made me feel sorry for the writer. If she thought what she was writing was good at all, then she is either completely delusional, or she might have a mental problem. I hope Heidi Ferrer, writer of this film, along with a few episodes of Dawson's Creek, will write a masterpiece and just leave this as a blemish on her booming career, but in the future not force contrived slop on the viewing public with any more screenplays like this.Now, onto the positives. The camera direction wasn't bad. It was kind of flashy and nice looking at times. The beach this was shot at looked like it would be nice to go for a dip at. I guess that counts as a positive. Paris Hilton plays a terrible character, but at least she's a kind hearted one. And that's all I can think of.If you can't tell, I hated this movie with a passion, and from it's current ranking of number 10 in the bottom 100, I can tell other people share my views on this cinematic massacre.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 88 mins.

,But why'd they have to make her so ugly?,"First off, the whole movie might just hit a Razzies grand slam for 2008. This film easily achieves Worst ""Actress"" for Paris Hilton, but the horrible support of the main actor Joel Moore on her side, the no-brainer screenplay, the childish script (if you look in the quotes section, see if it feels like the way ACTUAL human beings would normally talk), and the horribly wrong direction is not helping her out. It's horrible to see that this movie was accepted to be taken on to be a movie.The Premise is simple: A guy (Moore) chases the girl of his dreams from kindergarten (Hilton), and finds her just as stunning, and single, as he could have ever dreamed. Well, not entirely single, as she still has the same friend from kindergarten (Larkin), who is hideously ugly. Hideously. Disgustingly. Hell-Hole. Frigging. Ugly! Jesus! All the money it must have took to make 100% sure that Larkin was going to be the most vomit inducing creature must have been half the cost of the movie. The other half must have been Hilton's salary, as, there is nothing else that possibly could have cost money, as the movie really has nothing to offer. Don't get me wrong, though, Paris Hilton's ""Acting"" doesn't even deserve the time and energy it takes to pull out a check. Before I get off on a tangent (or is it too late), it sickens me to see that hideous creature co-starring this mess.Well anyway, as it turns out, Moore has to find a guy to go out with Larkin, because Hilton swore that she wouldn't ever date again until her friend has a date too. And, oh-so surprisingly, Moore starts to develop feelings for Larkin despite the ugliness(!!!!!) of her skin. Don't blame me for the horrible predictable screenplay, as anyone with eyes could see that something like this would happen. Of course, normally a moral is at least enough from saving a movie to be a 2 instead of a 1, but the true showing of Moore's character's true liking for the ""Nottie"" is after her surgery and transformation. It implies to all young girls that they NEED to be that perfect ten in order to be looked gracefully upon society. That is a horrible thing to engrave into a girls mind.AND THEY HAD TO MAKE HER SO FREAKING UGLY! It's torture staring at the screen with that freakish wreak up there. And half the movie is gross out gags making fun of her. It isn't even like Norbit's make-up department, which made a black man believably Asian. Instead, it enhances unbelievability, as no one would ever be that ugly. Normally, I look for ANYTHING to give in order to prevent a 1 star vote. This includes Acting, Special Effects, Costumes, Dialog, even one fresh joke. But this movie deserves what I give it, the worst possible grade ever. I wish there was a Zero out of Ten, as this movie gives me and my eyes nothing but pain.",but whyd they have make her so ugly,first off whole movie might just hit razzies grand slam 2008 this film easily achieves worst actress paris hilton but horrible support main actor joel moore her side no brainer screenplay childish script if you look quotes section see if it feels like way actual human beings would normally talk horribly wrong direction is not helping her out its horrible see that this movie was accepted be taken be movie premise is simple guy moore chases girl his dreams kindergarten hilton finds her just as stunning single as he could have ever dreamed well not entirely single as she still has same friend kindergarten larkin who is hideously ugly hideously disgustingly hell hole frigging ugly jesus all money it must have took make 100 sure that larkin was going be most vomit inducing creature must have been half cost movie other half must have been hiltons salary as there is nothing else that possibly could have cost money as movie really has nothing offer dont get me wrong though paris hiltons acting doesnt even deserve time energy it takes pull out check before i get off tangent or is it too late it sickens me see that hideous creature co starring this mess well anyway as it turns out moore has find guy go out with larkin because hilton swore that she wouldnt ever date again until her friend has date too oh so surprisingly moore starts develop feelings larkin despite ugliness her skin dont blame me horrible predictable screenplay as anyone with eyes could see that something like this would happen course normally moral is at least enough saving movie be 2 instead 1 but true showing moores characters true liking nottie is after her surgery transformation it implies all young girls that they need be that perfect ten order be looked gracefully upon society that is horrible thing engrave into girls mind they had make her so freaking ugly its torture staring at screen with that freakish wreak up there half movie is gross out gags making fun her it isnt even like norbits make up department which made black man believably asian instead it enhances unbelievability as no one would ever be that ugly normally i look anything give order prevent 1 star vote this includes acting special effects costumes dialog even one fresh joke but this movie deserves what i give it worst possible grade ever i wish there was zero out ten as this movie gives me my eyes nothing but pain,0.5517394179894178,-0.11325396825396829,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"

1.0,This Is So Not Hot,"The Hottie and the Nottie is somewhat of a conundrum; it is a romantic comedy that is neither moving nor funny. It attempts moments of gross-out humor, but holds back from going for an R rating. And for having a target audience of teenage girls, it lacks characters that most girls that age will be able to identify with.The last two films that Paris Hilton has appeared in have received some of the lowest ratings in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Pledge This! received a user rating of 1.6, ranking it at #7 in IMDb's Bottom 100, while Bottoms Up was rated 1.9 and rang in at #22 in the Bottom 100. It appears as though Hilton is lined up for a hat trick with The Hottie and the Nottie, having managed to hammer out three terrible films in a row.This is not to say all the blame should be placed on Hilton. She does a decent job with what she had to work with. But scriptwriter Heidi Ferrer manages to cram more teen movie clichés and unfunny moments into ninety minutes than any reasonable person could.The film begins with Nate Cooper (Joel David Moore) remembering first grade and his first experience of love, with Cristabelle Abbott (Hilton). Then the film flashes forward twenty years to an older, sadder version of Nate, accompanied by unnecessary character narration  a sure red flag for a bad movie.After his girlfriend leaves him, Nate decides to move from Maine to California to find his first-grade crush. Somehow he is in touch with Arno Blout (The Greg Wilson), from first grade, a disgusting mess who lives with his mom. In less than 20 seconds, Arno quickly fills Nate in on all that he's missed in the past twenty years; Cristabelle is hot and single, but that is only because she lives with her ugly friend, June Phigg (Christine Lakin), also from first grade! OMG! So begins Nate's quest to conquer Cristabelle, aided by Arno's stalker file, which tracks her every move. After their lives literally collide, it doesn't take long for Nate to find out what a nice girl Cristabelle is and how she creepily remembers him, too. Of course they cannot be together because that would be a fifteen-minute movie, so she confides that she will not go out with anyone until June gets a boyfriend. Nate vows to find June someone so he can cozy up to Cristabelle.From here, the film devolves into a banal take on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" as Nate tries to find someone who will go out with the ugly duckling of a friend, only to find himself suddenly in love with her the instant she gets a makeover.

Money DOES NOT equate talent (or common sense in the case of Hilton).This movie has little plot and Hilton's zombie-like ""acting"" puts the deep freeze on anything you might want to get out of the film.

3.0,Even though 99% of the people voting on this movie haven't even seen it...,"Uhmmm.... well, I wanted to make a witty remark, but I can't think of anything. Blah.Yes, I saw the movie. I have certain masochist tendencies I'm not too proud of. I love watching bad cinema. To be quite honest, I did enjoy this movie in a certain level - it's like watching Jerry Springer, or reading the National Enquirer. I'm not ashamed to admit I watch and read both. So take this review as you will.First, the bad things. The main problem I could find is that there must be some sort of connection between a movie and reality, however feeble it may be. As long as we can sort of identify with the main characters or the situations they are in, we'll play along with the plot, however idiotic it may be. But there's nobody to identify yourself with. Unless you are extremely weird. If you are, I apologize for insulting you.The movie is basically a copy of ""Ugly Betty"" and the Latin American originals. Except that in those series, the ugly chick is kinda nice. Here, she is obnoxious, dumb, and a bit annoying. Is it a surprise that Paris' Hilton character is desired by 99.9999999% of the people in this movie, and is the nicest, most beautiful person inside and out of them all? I hope not, because if you were surprised, then once again, I apologize for insulting you.The movie had an interesting hint which I'll share with you; the main characters spend the entire movie drinking alcohol. It's not that I'm disgusted by it, but hey, there are other things in life. Maybe water, Coke, whatever? Every time a character is facing a difficult task (going out with the ugly chick, trying to have sex), he gets drunk. Way to go! Maybe that should be a pre-requisite for watching the movie, actually. I suggest a DVD tie-in: 2 liters of Bacardi Blanco when you buy the Special Edition.The movie itself isn't that bad. I mean, it was entertaining. That's more that I can say of... uhm... ""The Phantom Menace"", for example. I go to movies to be entertained, and I don't care about anything else. Think about a carwreck on the other side of the highway. Do you stop and stare, and then feel all guilty inside, yet strangely satisfied? I rest my case.Don't expect any morality lessons here, though. The movie was far too busy making Paris look like the hottest woman on earth to care about any sort of message whatsoever. Which, I suppose, is a good thing, since most of the people who will watch this thing are too dumb to know what a morality lesson is, anyway (I include myself in this select, elite group). I think it had something to do with ""if you are ugly, then you need to find a guy willing to have sex with you in exchange for dntal work. Then you get all pretty and everyone wants to have sex with you, so you can dump the dentist"". Or something.My spoiler: Want to know the best laugh of the whole movie? Paris Hilton is supposed to work for a charity organization. There, I said it. Since you weren't going to watch this movie anyway, I really don't feel guilty at all.Enjoy!",even though 99 people voting this movie havent even seen it,uhmmm well i wanted make witty remark but i cant think anything blah yes i saw movie i have certain masochist tendencies im not too proud i love watching bad cinema be quite honest i did enjoy this movie certain level its like watching jerry springer or reading national enquirer im not ashamed admit i watch read both so take this review as you will first bad things main problem i could find is that there must be some sort connection between movie reality however feeble it may be as long as we can sort identify with main characters or situations they are well play along with plot however idiotic it may be but theres nobody identify yourself with unless you are extremely weird if you are i apologize insulting you movie is basically copy ugly betty latin american originals except that those series ugly chick is kinda nice here she is obnoxious dumb bit annoying is it surprise that paris hilton character is desired by 99 9999999 people this movie is nicest most beautiful person inside out them all i hope not because if you were surprised then once again i apologize insulting you movie had interesting hint which ill share with you main characters spend entire movie drinking alcohol its not that im disgusted by it but hey there are other things life maybe water coke whatever every time character is facing difficult task going out with ugly chick trying have sex he gets drunk way go maybe that should be pre requisite watching movie actually i suggest dvd tie 2 liters bacardi blanco when you buy special edition movie itself isnt that bad i mean it was entertaining thats more that i can say uhm phantom menace example i go movies be entertained i dont care about anything else think about carwreck other side highway do you stop stare then feel all guilty inside yet strangely satisfied i rest my case dont expect any morality lessons here though movie was far too busy making paris look like hottest woman earth care about any sort message whatsoever which i suppose is good thing since most people who will watch this thing are too dumb know what morality lesson is anyway i include myself this select elite group i think it had something do with if you are ugly then you need find guy willing have sex with you exchange dntal work then you get all pretty everyone wants have sex with you so you can dump dentist or something my spoiler want know best laugh whole movie paris hilton is supposed work charity organization there i said it since you werent going watch this movie anyway i really dont feel guilty at all enjoy,0.669890873015873,-0.027390873015873018,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
4.0,"More ""Not"" than ""Hot""","""The Hottie and the Nottie"" is one of those hypocritical films that pretends to make the case that beauty is only skin deep - only to turn right around and prove the opposite.Cribbing at least a portion of its story from ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" the movie stars Paris Hilton as Cristobel, a drop-dead gorgeous ""hottie"" who has put her own love life on hold until her grotesquely unattractive best friend, June (""the nottie""), can get some guy to go out with her. This is bad news for Nate Cooper, a first class dweeb who's had a major crush on Cristobel ever since the day she sauntered into his class in the first grade and ignited his passion. When he finally finds her again after all these years, he's stuck with having to come up with a guy who'll be willing to date the nottie - that is, if Nate is to have any chance at all of making it with the hottie.I suspect that ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" was originally designed as some sort of bizarre vanity project for Ms. Hilton, showcasing just how much better looking she is than the rest of the human race by placing her side by side with the most unattractive woman the filmmakers could possibly come up with. But I believe there's something more insidious at work here, in that, in the end, the movie endorses the very thing it is supposedly arguing against. Through all sorts of unlikely cosmetic alterations, the ""nottie"" is miraculously transformed into a ""hottie,"" making her at last an acceptable object for love - thereby assuring that all is indeed right with the universe. The movie also labors under the double standard of requiring that the women all be beautiful and sexy while the men are allowed to look as dowdy and disheveled as they please and not be judged for it.Still, there's probably no point in over-thinking a movie that's as featherweight and insignificant as this one is. And bad as it is, there are a few genuinely funny moments when Nate finds himself competing with an impossibly handsome, blonde, granite-jawed, muscle-bound ""doctors without borders"" dentist for Cristobel's affections. Nate gets a bit of his own back in these scenes and they are well-played and clever, at least compared to the rest of the movie. Hilton doesn't exactly disgrace herself in the role of the hottie - she actually has a certain innate sweetness that is rather disarming at times - but her acting has yet to go much beyond simple posturing and posing. Joel Moore, Christine Lakin and Johann Urb can't be blamed for the material they've been handed, so we can be generous in our assessment of their performances and simply note that all three have their moments of likability and charm.

No. But it is a watchable, nice film, and she isn't bad at all in her role.It is actually a story about a guy who loves a hot girl (Hilton), and then gets slowly involved with her unattractive friend (Christine Lakin). It is a story of surpassing the physical stuff and loving someone for their inner personality. And it is not original, nor genius, but it is a warm and funny film.

1.0,Mental illness is not funny.,"Let's be honest: rom-coms frequently celebrate really questionable values and champion behavior that would land you a restraining order in real life. If this movie had had a little bit more self-awareness, it could have been a pretty good parody of the genre, but it takes itself way too seriously for that.It starts out by stretching the ""lovable loser"" trope way past the breaking point. Our ""hero"", Nate, had a crush on a girl named Cristabel in the first grade, then his family moved across the country and he never saw her again. Now an ""adult"" (in years anyway), he's never gotten over this. He can't stay in a relationship, or even hold a job, because he can't get Cristabel off his mind. Rather than see a therapist, he decides he has seek her out. Since Google doesn't exist in this universe, he hops in his car (which definitely couldn't have made the trip) and drives across the country to find his first grade friend, Arno. It turns out Arno has also been obsessed with Cristabel since the first grade (what are the odds?). In fact, he's been stalking her his entire life, and has compiled a full dossier with the help of his mother, with whom he lives and has a very creepy relationship. Like Nate, he appears not to have a job. In spite of his lifelong obsession, he seems to have no personal interest in Cristabel, and has apparently just been waiting around for Nate to return so he can help him win her over.He re-introduces himself to Cristabel, the eponymous ""hottie"", by tackling her while she's jogging. Rather than macing him like any sane person, she somehow charmed by him and says the only reason she won't date him is not that he's unattractive, broke, and generally has nothing going for him, but rather that she has to find someone for her ""nottie"" friend, June, who has also been around since the first grade, and the stakes are set.In their quest to solve this problem, Nate and Arno will establish themselves to be truly loathsome individuals, but we're meant to ignore that because of the inherent nobility of first grade crushes.If you've ever seen a rom-com, it won't be a spoiler to tell you that Nate encounters a rival who is everything he isn't: good looking, wealthy, athletic, charming, and talented. The thing is, this guy is also at least a good a person as Nate, probably better.Anyway, yada, yada, you see the end coming a mile away, and we learn some valuable lessons about how important it is for women to be as attractive as possible if they ever want to be happy, and how important it is for men to, um...., have a pulse, I guess.",mental illness is not funny,lets be honest rom coms frequently celebrate really questionable values champion behavior that would land you restraining order real life if this movie had had little bit more self awareness it could have been pretty good parody genre but it takes itself way too seriously that it starts out by stretching lovable loser trope way past breaking point our hero nate had crush girl named cristabel first grade then his family moved across country he never saw her again now adult years anyway hes never gotten over this he cant stay relationship or even hold job because he cant get cristabel off his mind rather than see therapist he decides he has seek her out since google doesnt exist this universe he hops his car which definitely couldnt have made trip drives across country find his first grade friend arno it turns out arno has also been obsessed with cristabel since first grade what are odds fact hes been stalking her his entire life has compiled full dossier with help his mother with whom he lives has very creepy relationship like nate he appears not have job spite his lifelong obsession he seems have no personal interest cristabel has apparently just been waiting around nate return so he can help him win her over he re introduces himself cristabel eponymous hottie by tackling her while shes jogging rather than macing him like any sane person she somehow charmed by him says only reason she wont date him is not that hes unattractive broke generally has nothing going him but rather that she has find someone her nottie friend june who has also been around since first grade stakes are set their quest solve this problem nate arno will establish themselves be truly loathsome individuals but were meant ignore that because inherent nobility first grade crushes if youve ever seen rom com it wont be spoiler tell you that nate encounters rival who is everything he isnt good looking wealthy athletic charming talented thing is this guy is also at least good person as nate probably better anyway yada yada you see end coming mile away we learn some valuable lessons about how important it is women be as attractive as possible if they ever want be happy how important it is men um have pulse i guess,0.6311507936507937,0.20486111111111113,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"
1.0,This movie is so hot...NOT!!!,"Hey, I like to indulge in a bad movie just as much as the next person but I have yet to see a bad comedy that doesn't cause physical and mental pain when watching it and this movie is about as painful as they come.Premise: Christabel(played by Paris Hilton)took a vow of celibacy but after meeting up with her high school heartthrob, Nate(played by Joel David Moore) she plans to break that vow. The problem is her Rumplestiltskin looking friend June(played by Christine Lakin) tends to chase away any man Christabel's life. So Christabel promises Nate a romp in the sack if he can find June a man. Later on Nate falls for June as he realizes that she was a hottie after all.Opinion: This ugly duckling turned beautiful swan story falls flat on its face. I wont waste time saying that this is the worst movie of all time because I'm sure you heard that from EVERY reviewer on IMDb. I'll just tell you what stinks about it. The plot(if you can call it that) is a joke and the acting is terrible. Paris can't act(she cant sing either but that's another story) and seeing her in The House Of Wax, National Lampoons's Pledge This and The Simple Life is strong evidence of that statement. She is basically a female version of Butthead(of Beavis and Butthead). She cant take full blame for this movie being abysmal. Joel David Moore and Christine Lakin cant act either and the scriptwriter needs to lay off the LSD. This movie goes through great lengths to get laughs and it comes off as mere desperation. Like all the things Nate does to help June change her appearance to get a man or Nate mistakenly smelling June's funky feet while trying to sniff(?) Christabel's butt(PLEASE don't ask) or a mentally handicapped albino stalker thrown in the picture for good measure. Plus the idea of Paris being a hottie is laughable. She looks like a cracked out Fabio in drag. In closing this movie is the pits. Don't let curiosity overwhelm you enough to see how bad this movie is because it's not worth it. You'd rather watch Mr Magoo(the movie) till you turn blind then sit through this. This movie has been out for a while and its still remains in the Bottom 100.

,You may think I'm crazy for saying this but...........,"First of all, I must provide a little background information for you to get the full scope of this review. I am a b-movie fan, when I have some free time (usually during summers) I will try and watch the worst movies (aside from art-house films) that I can find. I mean it. I've seen almost every Seltzer & Friedberg spoof, The Room, and lots of cult movies. I am oddly curious, for some reason, just how bad bad movies are. I bought a copy of this thing at a flea market for $1.50. I don't like to spend much on bad movies (I'm a broke college student anyway) but when I saw this at the store, I thought I had really outdone myself. Everything about this movie, aesthetically speaking, called out to me that it was especially awful. I mean, it stars a celebrity without an acting background (unless you count reality TV), it has the words ""hottie"" and ""nottie"" in the title, and it is squarely in the bottom 100 on this website. So I popped this thing in, and I watched it for a while. The first 20 minutes are pretty horrible. The next twenty minutes are even worse. (I mean, she dates a guy that physically ran out on her twice, the sight gags are lame, the humor is pretty awful, etc. At about 0:45 minutes I thought that it had beaten the record for worst movie I had ever seen. Then, in the next twenty minutes something strange happened. The movie got strangely charming and a little bit deep. I was no longer watching the clock closely (as is my custom when I watch something truly awful)and I started paying attention because I wanted to, as strange as that sounds. I could actually kind of relate to the main character a bit and, as June transformed, the acting from whoever played her got a lot better. I really starting to be amazed by what I was seeing, and how ""not awful"" it was. Sure, the first 40 minutes of it suck (which disqualifies about 90% of people) but the ending is good, the music is kind of catchy, and, overall I really did not hate this movie. Granted, maybe my tastes are a bit tainted from watching turkeys like Meet the Spartans and The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, but I thought that the last 20 minutes made up for the first 40 minutes. I actually believe this movie gets kind of deep at moments. Granted, there are numerous problems, such as the fact that June dates a guy that physically runs out on her two times in a row. The whole Johan thing is kind of sketchy too, but overall, I didn't think it was horrible. Maybe it still deserves to be in the bottom 100 but, it's not on the level of like Date Movie , which actually has a better rating than this thing. If you're tough or bored enough, you may want to watch this thing. It gets better after a while, and the music is alright. I can't say that for stuff like Epic Movie, that type of thing is only for people who like to endure bad movies like I do. I give it a 5/10 for that reason.

7.0,An actual review of the movie (NOT the star!),"There's a certain thrill that comes with seeing films that meet with universal derision. I guess it's the hope that amidst the rubble of bad buzz, something halfway decent may emerge. I didn't take ANY hope of that happening with The Hottie and the Nottie. Didn't even plan on seeing it in theaters until a perfect storm of events came to pass. 1) The movie had a historically low turnout on opening weekend. 2) It reached the ""top"" on IMDb's bottom 100. 3) I had a friend who wanted to see the movie because she thought the trailer looked GOOD(!). How could I pass up the opportunity to be amongst the select few to say I saw this in theaters (I think more people have won lotteries). As a bonus I figured on getting some laughs out of every abysmal joke that would make my easily amused friend laugh. With this in mind, no one was more shocked than I to find myself laughing at what was on screen. What most of the negative reviews fail to grasp is that the star of the movie is not Paris Hilton but the male lead, Joel Moore. The Nate character is that rarity in films, a dorky underdog who is nonetheless confident in his conviction of what he wants. Too often we are subjected to the put upon dweeb who blossoms (think Jason Biggs), or the part gets cast with a good looking guy like Dane Cook/Ryan Reynolds since confidence is only a trait of the pretty (I'd try to make a distinction between these two, but there is none when we're talking about this level of unfunny). Joel Moore looks and acts the part perfectly and is even able to wring new layers of laughs out of a sitcom level scene that has him trying to make up a name for a fictional friend who might be interested in dating the Nottie (the ""Cole Slawsen"" scene was where I finally gave in to the slapdash charms of this movie).Paris Hilton isn't even the main female character. Christine Lakin as the Nottie really works in one of the most thankless roles I've ever seen. She has a good chemistry with Joel Moore and tackles the part fearlessly, somehow making you care about the Nottie's fate. Lakin's almost too good as the dignity and awareness she brings only makes me wish the filmmakers had gone for something a little less ridiculous in conceiving the hideous physical flaws of one June Phigg (that infected toenail bit belongs in American Pie) and put more effort into the strange relationship she has with Hilton's Hottie character. The premise of the movie is that every beautiful girl has a less than beautiful friend, so why not explore the darker aspects of that? As for the notorious Paris Hilton, the truth is she didn't bug me here. The part is made with her limitations in mind and is akin to Bo Derek's in 10. Her main contribution is that her name was enough to get a movie made which stars unknown talents like Moore and Lakin as romantic leads. So there it is, a good review of the worst movie of all time. I'd be shocked to see of anyone who finds this review ""useful"" based on the comments I've read so far. Let's see how that theory holds up.",actual review movie not star,theres certain thrill that comes with seeing films that meet with universal derision i guess its hope that amidst rubble bad buzz something halfway decent may emerge i didnt take any hope that happening with hottie nottie didnt even plan seeing it theaters until perfect storm events came pass 1 movie had historically low turnout opening weekend 2 it reached top imdbs bottom 100 3 i had friend who wanted see movie because she thought trailer looked good how could i pass up opportunity be amongst select few say i saw this theaters i think more people have won lotteries as bonus i figured getting some laughs out every abysmal joke that would make my easily amused friend laugh with this mind no one was more shocked than i find myself laughing at what was screen what most negative reviews fail grasp is that star movie is not paris hilton but male lead joel moore nate character is that rarity films dorky underdog who is nonetheless confident his conviction what he wants too often we are subjected put upon dweeb who blossoms think jason biggs or part gets cast with good looking guy like dane cook ryan reynolds since confidence is only trait pretty id try make distinction between these two but there is none when were talking about this level unfunny joel moore looks acts part perfectly is even able wring new layers laughs out sitcom level scene that has him trying make up name fictional friend who might be interested dating nottie cole slawsen scene was where i finally gave slapdash charms this movie paris hilton isnt even main female character christine lakin as nottie really works one most thankless roles ive ever seen she has good chemistry with joel moore tackles part fearlessly somehow making you care about notties fate lakins almost too good as dignity awareness she brings only makes me wish filmmakers had gone something little less ridiculous conceiving hideous physical flaws one june phigg that infected toenail bit belongs american pie put more effort into strange relationship she has with hiltons hottie character premise movie is that every beautiful girl has less than beautiful friend so why not explore darker aspects that as notorious paris hilton truth is she didnt bug me here part is made with her limitations mind is akin bo dereks 10 her main contribution is that her name was enough get movie made which stars unknown talents like moore lakin as romantic leads so there it is good review worst movie all time id be shocked see anyone who finds this review useful based comments ive read so far lets see how that theory holds up,0.5189374613481756,0.16035385745207179,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6.0,"A not-terrible lighthearted, brainless, and somewhat enjoyably trashy B-movie romp","This movie has joined the list of movies Considered The Worst Ever.To me a movie is bad if it is unengaging and without worth.I have seen WAY WORSE films.Paris Hilton is something of a guilty pleasure for me. I think she's matured from a tabloid It Girl heiress to a mature young woman who knows the value of her name, and is focused on building her brand. She is every bit the businesswoman that Kim Kardashian-West only wishes she could be. This movie is an artifact of that transitioning period.I therefore consider myself to be more unprejudiced and open-minded than others here. (Hindsight may also be a factor; I am reviewing this in 2018.)What we have here is a lighthearted, brainless adolescent romp. Joel David Moore is terrific as the lead. And Paris' acting isn't terrible, it's just fine in fact (a significant improvement over her Bottoms Up performance). An enjoyably trashy B-movie. It was after all shot in 5 weeks with a $9million budget and produced by Paris Hilton Entertainment.At worst it's corny and very average; at best it has a little heart and charm. It is definitely nowhere near ""one of the worst films of all time"". Not even close.",not terrible lighthearted brainless somewhat enjoyably trashy b movie romp,this movie has joined list movies considered worst ever me movie is bad if it is unengaging without worth i have seen way worse films paris hilton is something guilty pleasure me i think shes matured tabloid it girl heiress mature young woman who knows value her name is focused building her brand she is every bit businesswoman that kim kardashian west only wishes she could be this movie is artifact that transitioning period i therefore consider myself be more unprejudiced open minded than others here hindsight may also be factor i am reviewing this 2018 what we have here is lighthearted brainless adolescent romp joel david moore is terrific as lead paris acting isnt terrible its just fine fact significant improvement over her bottoms up performance enjoyably trashy b movie it was after all shot 5 weeks with 9million budget produced by paris hilton entertainment at worst its corny very average at best it has little heart charm it is definitely nowhere near one worst films all time not even close,0.6100641025641026,-0.06887820512820511,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1.0,Summer: Hottie. This Film: Nottie.,"You want to know something? Personally I believe that if I were to be able to remake this film some 40 years for now on an epic movie scale in the vein of Michael Bay or Steven Spielberg, for everyone to see, this is how I would do it. Without a doubt, Paris Hilton would be, and should have played, the role of Nottie if this movie was going to garner any sort of attention in the mass media. That's the kind of roles she should be getting since she thinks everyone should take her seriously as both actress and a Hilton. But obviously, Paris doesn't seem to actually want to get good roles and just continue to play the part of the silly dumb bimbo who somehow plays a major role in movies as lame as this. Did National Lampoon make this movie? It almost feels like it, or all those lame American Pie continuations. Paris instead yucks it up with a bunch of other actors who really did this for a quick couple of dollars to pay the rent, perhaps. I certainly didn't find this movie any funny, nor interesting, and it was my younger sister who rented it to see how messed up it really is.After sitting through halfway, it got so much waves of quiet awkwardness and scorn from everyone that we ultimately returned it pretending it was scratched and unplayable on our DVD - replacing it with a movie, actually, no, instead we got a DVD containing a collection of 20 random infamous fight scenes from movies over the years: Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Brad Pitt, Rowdy Roddy Piper (""PUT ON THE GLASSES!""). It definitely soothed the soul and made us forget we ever watched a film like this ever. It's not as eyebleedingly bad as Uwe Boll, but it certainly ranks among next to it.Unless you like cruelty to people who aren't as distinguished as you are, or stress the fact that ""Girls, if you want to look good for your Boy, surgery is the best way to go,"" which is terrible to even consider even as a moral, then go ahead and see this movie.But if you're smart, go see Star Wars or something again.",summer hottie this film nottie,you want know something personally i believe that if i were be able remake this film some 40 years now epic movie scale vein michael bay or steven spielberg everyone see this is how i would do it without doubt paris hilton would be should have played role nottie if this movie was going garner any sort attention mass media thats kind roles she should be getting since she thinks everyone should take her seriously as both actress hilton but obviously paris doesnt seem actually want get good roles just continue play part silly dumb bimbo who somehow plays major role movies as lame as this did national lampoon make this movie it almost feels like it or all those lame american pie continuations paris instead yucks it up with bunch other actors who really did this quick couple dollars pay rent perhaps i certainly didnt find this movie any funny nor interesting it was my younger sister who rented it see how messed up it really is after sitting through halfway it got so much waves quiet awkwardness scorn everyone that we ultimately returned it pretending it was scratched unplayable our dvd replacing it with movie actually no instead we got dvd containing collection 20 random infamous fight scenes movies over years jackie chan bruce lee brad pitt rowdy roddy piper put glasses it definitely soothed soul made us forget we ever watched film like this ever its not as eyebleedingly bad as uwe boll but it certainly ranks among next it unless you like cruelty people who arent as distinguished as you are or stress fact that girls if you want look good your boy surgery is best way go which is terrible even consider even as moral then go ahead see this movie but if youre smart go see star wars or something again,0.5046679197994987,0.014614661654135335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,Deserves everything bad that has been said about it,"I don't mean to sound opinionated here, but The Hottie and the Nottie is nothing short of abysmal. Nothing whatsoever is good about it, it is lazy, mean-spirited and unfunny and many other things. It looks alright though, some of the scenery is nice but the camera work is rushed and there are times when it doesn't feel like a movie. The music is awful, it is enough to make you want to cover your ears because it is sheer torture, while the direction is non existent. The script is one of The Hottie and the Nottie's worst assets, it is terrible. I didn't laugh once, actually I was groaning most of the time, while the story(basically an ugly duckling turned beautiful twist) is completely predictable and badly developed so you didn't care for the characters and their situations. I almost forgot to mention how hypocritical this movie is, I thought I'd seen the last of hypocrisy with The Hannah Montana movie, but the hypocrisy here makes the hypocrisy in that film seem subtle. The acting is a joke. As dire as Paris Hilton was, she cannot act if her life depended on it, she isn't entirely to blame, none of her co-stars were any good either. All in all, terrible and dare I say embarrassing. 1/10 Bethany Cox",deserves everything bad that has been said about it,i dont mean sound opinionated here but hottie nottie is nothing short abysmal nothing whatsoever is good about it it is lazy mean spirited unfunny many other things it looks alright though some scenery is nice but camera work is rushed there are times when it doesnt feel like movie music is awful it is enough make you want cover your ears because it is sheer torture while direction is non existent script is one hottie notties worst assets it is terrible i didnt laugh once actually i was groaning most time while story basically ugly duckling turned beautiful twist is completely predictable badly developed so you didnt care characters their situations i almost forgot mention how hypocritical this movie is i thought id seen last hypocrisy with hannah montana movie but hypocrisy here makes hypocrisy that film seem subtle acting is joke as dire as paris hilton was she cannot act if her life depended it she isnt entirely blame none her co stars were any good either all all terrible dare i say embarrassing 1 10 bethany cox,0.6123563218390804,-0.06149425287356321,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
