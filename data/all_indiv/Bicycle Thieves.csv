,Quiet Desperation---Italian Style.,"In post-World War II Italy poverty is a dire reality for a large portion of the population. Work is scarce and the opportunities for employment are few and far between. ""Ladri Di Biciclette"" (translated ""The Bicycle Thief"") is quietly one of the finest films ever produced. It follows one economically distraught man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town, but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes immediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help, believing the bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. ""The Bicycle Thief"" was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film the following year (the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949). It is still a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances and mental anguish perfectly. ""The Bicycle Thief"" is an excellent production that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5.",quiet desperation italian style,post world war ii italy poverty is dire reality large portion population work is scarce opportunities employment are few far between ladri di biciclette translated bicycle thief is quietly one finest films ever produced it follows one economically distraught man lamberto maggiorani who is heading down desperate path fast things look up when he gets job putting posters walls town but he must sell what few meager possessions he his family have buy bicycle uphold his end business bargain naturally tragedy strikes immediately as title character shows up very first day maggiorani is job police are little help believing bicycle is not as important as it really is thus maggiorani young son enzo staiola take it upon themselves look all over town try find bicycle bring thief justice bicycle thief was originally released 1948 won honorary academy award best foreign language film following year movie was not released u s until 1949 it is still production that strikes deep even today lengths desperate measures that some go through is very evident here director vittorio de sica crafts film that is much deeper than it appears surface it examines human condition questions society family law enforcement alliances mental anguish perfectly bicycle thief is excellent production that has aged well allows viewer think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths 5 stars out 5,0.4769841269841269,0.06827147525676937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,No small thing.,"This movie changed my life. It changed it in the sense that after seeing it I developed a life-long passion for Italian films after first seeing it in 1955 when it appeared at a local movie theatre in a revival five years or so after its original appearance. I was only 13 at the time and somewhat of a precocious chooser of what films to go see. I have seen THE BICYCLE THIEF (""Bicycle Thieves"" in England and plural as well in its original Italian title) hundreds of times since and never tire of it. The fact that the film has almost never been out of circulation since its making and is constantly shown in revivals, festivals and film classes attests to its endurance. Martin Scorsese does a glorious appreciation of it in his documentary on the Italian cinema, IL MIO VIAGGIO IN ITALIA. What makes it so enduring? What is so damn great about the movie? It is not its trenchant portrayal of post-war Italian poverty and misery. Lots of films did that even better. It is not in any sense of real drama, which is very schematic. Nor even the unforgettably truthful acting, that iconic face of pint-sized Enzo Staiola. We get truthful acting and iconic faces all over the place. It is, I believe, its sense of compassion, its sense of poetry. Those are rarer qualities. The movie is compassionate poetry. I don't know if writer Cesare Zavattini or director Vittorio De Sica would have appreciated that phrase. I feel they might have. I feel it is exactly the truth they were after. To be sure, the film is a story of father and little-boy in search of what is lost, a necessity yes, but also a lost dream. The endangered hope for a better life to come challenges this paternal/filial relationship. In that sense, this is a film-poem, God help me, about Everyfather and Everylittleboy. The most chilling moment in the poem occurs when little Bruno sees his father steal, and a tearful horror glazes his face as a god seems to collapse. The most redemptive moment comes shortly thereafter when the boy slips his hand into his father's. That forgiveness is not cheap or facile. It is unassailable and all-comforting. It is a forgiving embrace of Virgilian dignity. For a magnificent instant the father, Antonio, has become the son; Bruno, the son, has become the father. At the end, when they walk off into the Roman crowd, they are as one. I have written many thoughts about this film over the years, including an extended exegesis for a local newspaper. I have programmed it in film series, shown it to film classes, Italian classes. I know the movie. Friends, the movie is not about stolen bicycles, indifferent police, bicycle chop-shop gargoyles, mouth-foaming lowlife, desperate actions by the desperate, or mere journalistic human interest that is gone with tomorrow's edition. Its worth resides in its lyric portrayal of the eternal curative power of love. No small thing.Two addenda: the song being rehearsed at the workers' club Antonio visits to see his friend is called ""Ciccio Formaggio."" The song being sung and played by the restaurant musicians when Antonio and his son eat together is ""Tummuriata nera,"" about the mulatto offspring of an Italian woman and a black soldier. The lyrics for both songs, in Neapolitan dialect, can be found by Googling the titles. Recordings by Roberto Murolo of both songs are available.",no small thing,this movie changed my life it changed it sense that after seeing it i developed life long passion italian films after first seeing it 1955 when it appeared at local movie theatre revival five years or so after its original appearance i was only 13 at time somewhat precocious chooser what films go see i have seen bicycle thief bicycle thieves england plural as well its original italian title hundreds times since never tire it fact that film has almost never been out circulation since its making is constantly shown revivals festivals film classes attests its endurance martin scorsese does glorious appreciation it his documentary italian cinema il mio viaggio italia what makes it so enduring what is so damn great about movie it is not its trenchant portrayal post war italian poverty misery lots films did that even better it is not any sense real drama which is very schematic nor even unforgettably truthful acting that iconic face pint sized enzo staiola we get truthful acting iconic faces all over place it is i believe its sense compassion its sense poetry those are rarer qualities movie is compassionate poetry i dont know if writer cesare zavattini or director vittorio de sica would have appreciated that phrase i feel they might have i feel it is exactly truth they were after be sure film is story father little boy search what is lost necessity yes but also lost dream endangered hope better life come challenges this paternal filial relationship that sense this is film poem god help me about everyfather everylittleboy most chilling moment poem occurs when little bruno sees his father steal tearful horror glazes his face as god seems collapse most redemptive moment comes shortly thereafter when boy slips his hand into his fathers that forgiveness is not cheap or facile it is unassailable all comforting it is forgiving embrace virgilian dignity magnificent instant father antonio has become son bruno son has become father at end when they walk off into roman crowd they are as one i have written many thoughts about this film over years including extended exegesis local newspaper i have programmed it film series shown it film classes italian classes i know movie friends movie is not about stolen bicycles indifferent police bicycle chop shop gargoyles mouth foaming lowlife desperate actions by desperate or mere journalistic human interest that is gone with tomorrows edition its worth resides its lyric portrayal eternal curative power love no small thing two addenda song being rehearsed at workers club antonio visits see his friend is called ciccio formaggio song being sung played by restaurant musicians when antonio his son eat together is tummuriata nera about mulatto offspring italian woman black soldier lyrics both songs neapolitan dialect can be found by googling titles recordings by roberto murolo both songs are available,0.4138344226579521,0.14624183006535948,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Another one to add to my top 50- a delicate study of desperation in post war Italy,"Vittorio De Sica's ground/heartbreaking motion picture, The Bicycle Thief, is based on a very simple ideal for a story- man against the elements. In this case the elements are of a society that is often cruel and unforgiving, and that a job in post-war Rome is looked on as the luckiest of good luck charms.Such a man as presented by De Sica is Maggiorani (an actor who really is the type of actor right off the street), a father of a little boy who gets a job putting up movie posters along some walls in Rome. To do this he needs a bicycle, or the job will be lost, and he gets one following a pawning of linen sheets. Very soon though, the bicycle is stolen, and from there a sad downward spiral unravels for the man and his son as they scour the streets for the bicycle. While the score adds basic dramatic tension, everything else on the screen is done to such a pitch of neo-realism it's at times shattering, joyful (scene in the pizzeria the most note-worthy), and with a feeling of day-to-day resonance to those who may have not even felt at or below the poverty level in their lives. Credit due to all parties involved, though I don't think the boy Bruno, played by Staiola, gets nearly enough considering his role as a minor coming of age (that moment after the father and son leave the church nearly brought tears to my eyes).

8.0,Powerful and dramatic,"It is post-war Rome and much of the city's residents are impoverished and desperate for work. One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job. The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family. Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief', Vittorio de Sica's gritty study in realism. Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work. de Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs. The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true. The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again. `The Bicycle Thief' personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life. While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important. `The Bicycle Thief' has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason. It is a must-see film for any cinephile.--Shelly",powerful dramatic,it is post war rome much citys residents are impoverished desperate work one man named ricci who haunts job lines day after day provide his wife two children when suddenly his name is called well paying city job only catch is that he needs bicycle job he has just pawned his bicycle order feed his family thus begins bicycle thief vittorio de sicas gritty study realism ricci his wife sell sheets off their beds get bicycle back only have bicycle stolen his first day job order keep job he his young son walk around rome desperate find thief more importantly bicycle before his next day work de sica chose non actors portray characters film favoring further realistic vision by casting amateurs result is remarkable because pain emotions conveyed are so true relationship between father son is also compelling endearing that most part ricci treats his son as equal letting him his innermost thoughts fears until end when particular event causes him be ashamed roles become defined once again bicycle thief personifies refreshing fact that european cinema was more daring also true their reaction post war life while america was trying paint heavy coat rosy paint times by churning out saccharine mgm musicals by dozen europe was showing that effects war fought their home turf did not inspire moments spontaneously breaking into song or choreographed dance number rather life pretty much sucked but survival as difficult ugly as it can be is most important bicycle thief has been critical favorite decades good reason it is must see film any cinephile shelly,0.63125,0.13625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,A Heartbreaking Masterpiece of the Italian Neo-Realism,"In the post-war Rome, after more than two-year unemployment, the family man Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) finally finds a disputed job position putting up posters that requires having a bicycle. However, he needs to retrieve his bicycle in the pawn shop but he does not have money. His wife Maria (Lianella Carell) pawns their bed sheets and uses the money to recover the precious bicycle. Antonio envisions a better life for his family with his salary, overtime and benefits. Unfortunately, his bicycle is stolen on the first working day. Antonio and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) spend the Sunday chasing the bicycle and the thief on the streets of Rome.""Ladri di Biciclette"" is a heartbreaking masterpiece of the Italian Neo- Realism and one of the best movies of cinema history ever. This is the third time that I watch this unforgettable film that makes me sad with the desperation of Antonio and his lack of perspective in the end. There are memorable touching scenes, like Bruno eating pizza in the restaurant wearing a torn coat and contrasting with the wealthy family; or the happiness of the clumsy Antonio putting up the poster of Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda""; or the indecision of Bruno between a dish of soup in the church or chasing the old man with his father; or the shame of Antonio in the end. The DVD released in Brazil by Spectra Nova has good quality of image, subtitles in yellow but no Extras. The DVD released by Versátil uses the same matrix of Spectra Nova but with subtitles in white, and it is difficult the reading by the viewer. However, there are many Extras.

8.0,Heartfelt Drama of Post WWII Poverty a Must-See...,"The Italian neo-realist film movement began around the end of WWII with Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY in 1946. It is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by Vittorio De Sica. THE BICYCLE THIEF is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that Europeans, specifically Italians, went through after the death and destruction of the war. The economy was horrible, and the towns and cities were half-destroyed and decaying. Rome is the location for THE BICYCLE THIEF and De Sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with non-professional actors to get a simple, yet unbearingly emotional point across. A simple thing such as a bike can be someone's entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.The lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor. He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically. Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome. He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him. Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the ""title"" character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary. A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent. It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live. The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son. Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film's climax.There is a lot of THE BICYCLE THIEF in Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the father-son relationship. They are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess. What is different about THIEF is the level of intensity maintained throughout. I felt the key element was the music by Alessandro Cicognini, a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture. What De Sica does here, as well as other neo-realist directors (Rossellini, Fellini), is create for American audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to. An honest, non-corporate portrait of the struggle for life and self-respect. THE BICYCLE THIEF is one of the finest films ever made.RATING: 10 of 10",heartfelt drama post wwii poverty must see,italian neo realist film movement began around end wwii with roberto rossellinis open city 1946 it is defined encapsulated by this striking film directed by vittorio de sica bicycle thief is best group films that depicted hardship despair that europeans specifically italians went through after death destruction war economy was horrible towns cities were half destroyed decaying rome is location bicycle thief de sica shoots city grainy black white with non professional actors get simple yet unbearingly emotional point across simple thing such as bike can be someones entire world at that time losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary lead film is played by lamberto maggiorani who seems be very good actor he is not actor however maybe this is why film hits its mark so well comes across so realistically maggiorani is this difficult world his brooding face is clear indication this his job is plaster film posters up walls buildings all over rome he even hangs picture that symbolizes absolute opposite misery surrounding him rita hayworth gilda is walls all over city sign joy some representation their own lowly status others when bicycle is actually stolen title character is sought after by maggiorani his young son enzo staiola little kid with so much acting ability you swear this must be documentary grueling search throughout rome has essential parts movie because we see up close actual people places neo realist film movement came represent it is small sad world they live bike has be found so that they can live father is put ultimate test front his son will he do honorable thing or will he do what his mind heart know is only possible these are tense moments films climax there is lot bicycle thief benignis life is beautiful some obvious comparisons have been drawn because father son relationship they are worthy comparison have equal artistic prowess what is different about thief is level intensity maintained throughout i felt key element was music by alessandro cicognini simple horn that plays so tragically that it is main character picture what de sica does here as well as other neo realist directors rossellini fellini is create american audiences powerful counterpoint what we are used honest non corporate portrait struggle life self respect bicycle thief is one finest films ever made rating 10 10,0.5314734950584007,0.07428101772441395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,Real,"Even if you are merely a moderate fan of cinema you will have at least heard of this film. It has been hailed as a masterpiece for just short of sixty years and has been routinely studied in film classes everywhere. In a sense, it is one of the recognized masterpieces of cinema. And yet, this is not a film in which to pick up obviously great shots like the 360 degree shot in the hotel room in ""Vertigo"" or cuts as good as the jump cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with which Kubrick transports you from prehistoric ages to an age in which space travel is common in barely a second. This is a subtle, realistic film, and though it looks terrific, it is not flashy. It exists not to excel technically or tell the story of humanity, but simply to tell a story. A simple story which may say more about human nature than any other film in existence.""Bicycle Thieves"" is about a man in economically depressed post-World War II Italy who is lucky enough to find a job which requires him to use a bicycle as transportation while putting up posters around the city. It's relatively well-paying and almost too good to believe for his family. While on the job his bicycle is stolen, and the rest of the movie tells the story of him and his son attempting to recover the bicycle. In the magnificent final scene Antonio Ricci (the lead character) finds himself tempted to steal a bicycle in order to be able to perform his job. Here we have our 'hero' thinking about doing to someone else what was done to him. There is no black and white in the world, no good and evil. This film does a great job of stating that fact without moralizing and preaching like so many modern films do. This film does not insult your intelligence and I pity those who wanted a third act, or those who wanted more explanation. This film is beautiful and brilliant because it is completely understated. It's realistic. We feel Ricci's desperation and are transported into 1940's Rome as he makes his way through the city's crowded streets, alleyways, churches and brothels.I have no idea how much this film cost to make, but I would be surprised if it was made on a low budget. The location shooting throughout the city is impressive, as is the (again) understated cinematography. De Sica cast non-actors in the lead roles, and I find their performances to be among the most realistic and effective I've ever seen. Alessandro Cigognini's score is a highlight of the film, and I consider the melancholy main theme one of the greatest musical cues I've heard in any film.I enjoy theatricality as much as anyone and I certainly don't dislike Hollywood gloss, but ""Bicycle Thieves"" serves as a jarring reminder of how great a medium film can be. The jarring effect the film had on audiences upon its release (in particular American audiences) is easy to understand viewing the film in 2007 and it escapes my comprehension how anyone can't be completely captivated and enthralled by this masterwork.****/4",real,even if you are merely moderate fan cinema you will have at least heard this film it has been hailed as masterpiece just short sixty years has been routinely studied film classes everywhere sense it is one recognized masterpieces cinema yet this is not film which pick up obviously great shots like 360 degree shot hotel room vertigo or cuts as good as jump cut 2001 space odyssey with which kubrick transports you prehistoric ages age which space travel is common barely second this is subtle realistic film though it looks terrific it is not flashy it exists not excel technically or tell story humanity but simply tell story simple story which may say more about human nature than any other film existence bicycle thieves is about man economically depressed post world war ii italy who is lucky enough find job which requires him use bicycle as transportation while putting up posters around city its relatively well paying almost too good believe his family while job his bicycle is stolen rest movie tells story him his son attempting recover bicycle magnificent final scene antonio ricci lead character finds himself tempted steal bicycle order be able perform his job here we have our hero thinking about doing someone else what was done him there is no black white world no good evil this film does great job stating that fact without moralizing preaching like so many modern films do this film does not insult your intelligence i pity those who wanted third act or those who wanted more explanation this film is beautiful brilliant because it is completely understated its realistic we feel riccis desperation are transported into 1940s rome as he makes his way through citys crowded streets alleyways churches brothels i have no idea how much this film cost make but i would be surprised if it was made low budget location shooting throughout city is impressive as is again understated cinematography de sica cast non actors lead roles i find their performances be among most realistic effective ive ever seen alessandro cigogninis score is highlight film i consider melancholy main theme one greatest musical cues ive heard any film i enjoy theatricality as much as anyone i certainly dont dislike hollywood gloss but bicycle thieves serves as jarring reminder how great medium film can be jarring effect film had audiences upon its release particular american audiences is easy understand viewing film 2007 it escapes my comprehension how anyone cant be completely captivated enthralled by this masterwork 4,0.5000403551251007,0.21676755447941887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,"Simple, Powerful Film Survives","There's not much that can be said about ""The Bicycle Thief"" that hasn't already been expressed. It is considered a great work of the Italian cinema, and looking at it in its 1999 release version, one can see why. Structurally, it's a theme and variations, with such a simple, clearly stated main motif that one can identify and follow its mutations with no effort. DeSica is clearly the fine craftsman here, directing every scene with a beautiful sense of control and balance. His work with young Enzo Staiola (as Bruno) is especially commendable, and he allows then nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani (as Antonio) and Lianella Carell (as Marie) to act in a model of naturalism. Carlo Montuori's photography is brilliant, and Antonio Traverso's production design is pungent and atmospheric. Like most ""masterpieces,"" a film-classic score provides emotional depth in a subliminal way: here it's a romantic, Italianesque original composition by Aessandro Cicognini wraps up the entire production.DeSica's career is most impressive, being involved in nealy 200 films, 165 of them as an actor. This film remains one of his greatest achievements. It seems to be standing the test of time very nicely, too. It's been criticized, sometimes quite severely, and just continues to bounce back, winning new admirers with each reissue. The public just won't let ""The Bicycle Thief"" fade away. That alone tends to override any negative factors. It looks like this film is going to be around for quite a while. ###",simple powerful film survives,theres not much that can be said about bicycle thief that hasnt already been expressed it is considered great work italian cinema looking at it its 1999 release version one can see why structurally its theme variations with such simple clearly stated main motif that one can identify follow its mutations with no effort desica is clearly fine craftsman here directing every scene with beautiful sense control balance his work with young enzo staiola as bruno is especially commendable he allows then nonprofessionals lamberto maggiorani as antonio lianella carell as marie act model naturalism carlo montuoris photography is brilliant antonio traversos production design is pungent atmospheric like most masterpieces film classic score provides emotional depth subliminal way here its romantic italianesque original composition by aessandro cicognini wraps up entire production desicas career is most impressive being involved nealy 200 films 165 them as actor this film remains one his greatest achievements it seems be standing test time very nicely too its been criticized sometimes quite severely just continues bounce back winning new admirers with each reissue public just wont let bicycle thief fade away that alone tends override any negative factors it looks like this film is going be around quite while,0.5381277056277056,0.27304545454545454,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Vintage Neorrealist film about a working-class man whose bicycle is robbed and he and his child set out in pursuit the thief,"This is a mercilessly bleak studio about poorness and miserable life in post WWII Italy . Set in post war Italy , this is a Classy Italian movie of great importance in the developing of the Neorrealist movement . The film deals with a father , Lamberto Maggiorani , and his child , Enzo Staiola. Then , being robbed his bicycle, and both of them set out to find the robber . Along the way they encounter various egoistic characters , stealers , religious people , but also good people .The picture is well paced , focusing on the relation between the desperado dad and his son , as the despair they suffer along the way , while attempt to discover the true thief who took his bicycle. It is a heart-rending and heart-breaking studio of poverty in postwar Italy which won special Academy Awards , before the foreign film category was officially established .The film is like a documentary , with a great crowd as extras , untrained people , old neighborhoods , a lot of street vendors , passengers and priests waiting for bus and many other things . It shows an evocative post war Rome , ruined and with depressed economy , ba great deal of working class men , unemployed people looking for work and a destroyed city , too. Here De Sica reveals unsuspected depths , and an extraordinary sensitive with actors , especially the little boy . Two main actors are frankly well , Lamberto Maggiorani as the ill-fated father and Enzo Staiola as the agreeable son with sweet laughter. Both of whom are pretty good , though all players are amateurs , as filmmaker De Sica and screenwriter Zavattini decided not to use professional actors . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Vittorio de Sica , and including Sergio Leone as director assistant .

10.0,Powerful.,"Some films try to explain multiple aspects of a story or a character by showing several episodes from the character's life. Vittorio De Sica's masterful The Bicycle Thief relies on the power of simplicity to drive home its point. It is a very simple film, relying on film making at its basics. There are no professional actors for us to identify with, but there are plot lines, emotions, and thoughts that no one can help but relate to. Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) has been waiting for a job, but when one finally arrives, he must obtain a bicycle in order to be able to accept the position. His loving and caring wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), hocks the bed sheets in order to be able to afford a bicycle for Antonio. He reports to work as a poster hanger, but while on the job for only a short time, the bike is stolen by a young thief (Vittorio Antonucci). Desperate to get the vehicle back, Antonio seeks the aid of his friend, Baiocco (Gino Saltamerenda), and also receives the help of his devoted son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola). Bruno stays by Antonio's side, no matter what, determined to help his father get back the stolen property. It is a frustrating journey for the father and son, as they receive no help, except that of Baiocco. It seems that no matter what they do, Antonio is left with a fateful decision (shown in one of the most brutally honest scenes in any movie I've ever seen). He must ask himself just how far would he go to put food on the table for his family that he loves so much? There has been controversy over the ending of the film, which I am not going to go into, because it would be cheating you out of a brilliant ending to an extraordinary picture. However, I will say this much - When viewing The Bicycle Thief, ask yourself what you would do in Antonio's situation. What choices would you make? Some of the questions that rise from this film are some of the questions that help us to define ourselves as people, and the fact that this film provides such a clear and honest representation of so many facts of life is what makes it an undeniable masterpiece! This is a film to be cherished!",powerful,some films try explain multiple aspects story or character by showing several episodes characters life vittorio de sicas masterful bicycle thief relies power simplicity drive home its point it is very simple film relying film making at its basics there are no professional actors us identify with but there are plot lines emotions thoughts that no one can help but relate antonio ricci lamberto maggiorani has been waiting job but when one finally arrives he must obtain bicycle order be able accept position his loving caring wife maria lianella carell hocks bed sheets order be able afford bicycle antonio he reports work as poster hanger but while job only short time bike is stolen by young thief vittorio antonucci desperate get vehicle back antonio seeks aid his friend baiocco gino saltamerenda also receives help his devoted son bruno enzo staiola bruno stays by antonios side no matter what determined help his father get back stolen property it is frustrating journey father son as they receive no help except that baiocco it seems that no matter what they do antonio is left with fateful decision shown one most brutally honest scenes any movie ive ever seen he must ask himself just how far would he go put food table his family that he loves so much there has been controversy over ending film which i am not going go into because it would be cheating you out brilliant ending extraordinary picture however i will say this much when viewing bicycle thief ask yourself what you would do antonios situation what choices would you make some questions that rise this film are some questions that help us define ourselves as people fact that this film provides such clear honest representation so many facts life is what makes it undeniable masterpiece this is film be cherished,0.5671592775041051,0.20632183908045978,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,The greatest neorealism film ever made,"The Bicycle Thief is without a doubt De Sica's masterpiece of Italian neorealism filmmaking. It is a true landmark in cinema history.A man who has been unemployed for months is finally given a chance at a job putting up posters. He and his family have been living in poverty for months, and are very exited to hear the news. The only requirement for the job is a bicycle. His wife pawns the sheets off of their own bed in order to buy the bicycle. And, as you can tell from the title, it is stolen on his first day of work. Now, without it, he and his son search the crowded streets of Rome for the only thing that can give him back his dignity as a man.This is a simple, but very powerful film and I found the relationship between Bruno and his father especially touching. The final scene is a true captivating moment as Bruno witnesses the true nature of man and the world we have created for ourselves.Don't miss this film, to call it a classic would be an understatement.",greatest neorealism film ever made,bicycle thief is without doubt de sicas masterpiece italian neorealism filmmaking it is true landmark cinema history man who has been unemployed months is finally given chance at job putting up posters he his family have been living poverty months are very exited hear news only requirement job is bicycle his wife pawns sheets off their own bed order buy bicycle as you can tell title it is stolen his first day work now without it he his son search crowded streets rome only thing that can give him back his dignity as man this is simple but very powerful film i found relationship between bruno his father especially touching final scene is true captivating moment as bruno witnesses true nature man world we have created ourselves dont miss this film call it classic would be understatement,0.6726190476190476,0.28648148148148145,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.52}"
9.0,Lord of the Rings fanatics should all watch this movie,"Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Lord of the Rings and I respect people's right to obsess over whatever they wish. Nonetheless, it does often irritate the cynic in me that we're teaching a generation of kids that there is a distinct borderline between 'good' and 'evil', between 'justice' and 'injustice', that there exists such a thing as a 'hero', when in reality there is actually nothing of the sort.Ladri di Biciclette is a shining example of a film that demonstrates this fact. There is no distinction between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys'. At times we support one character, or the others. But there is never a line drawn between one side or the other because in reality, the only people we see here are simply human - flawed, corruptible and in this case, all suffering the same tragic fate. Our central character Antonio is obviously the protagonist, and he is obviously portrayed in such a way that our sympathies lie with him, but he is far from being a hero. He is simply used as the representation of the tragic misfortune that can befall mankind. This misfortune, also, is not depicted in any black-and-white sense. Antonio and his family's plight is not the only, or even necessarily the most desperate, in this film. In fact, with the exception of the family in the restaurant scene, practically every single character, major or minor, is portrayed as suffering in some way at the hands of capitalism.Therefore, as obviously tragic as Antonio's story is, the only real reason we side with him is because his particular tragedy is centrally focused. But, as has been discussed so often previously, he is an Everyman character. The bicycle in the film is simply used as an analogy for the loss, or lack of any essential element of life that leads to poverty and suffering. In very simple terms, the film's message is essentially that at some stage in life, we are all shouting ""Give me back my bicycle!"" But I digress. This simplistic and amateurish film is far more real and far more true-to-life than practically anything that Hollywood has churned out in the past fifty years. For that reason, the realist in me believes that all those dreamers, people who believe in a happy ending or ideal status quo, could do with the sort of down-to-earth lesson that this film represents.Yes, it's a distressing and bleak vision. But nevertheless, an utterly profound one.",lord rings fanatics should all watch this movie,dont get me wrong i have nothing against lord rings i respect peoples right obsess over whatever they wish nonetheless it does often irritate cynic me that were teaching generation kids that there is distinct borderline between good evil between justice injustice that there exists such thing as hero when reality there is actually nothing sort ladri di biciclette is shining example film that demonstrates this fact there is no distinction between good guys bad guys at times we support one character or others but there is never line drawn between one side or other because reality only people we see here are simply human flawed corruptible this case all suffering same tragic fate our central character antonio is obviously protagonist he is obviously portrayed such way that our sympathies lie with him but he is far being hero he is simply used as representation tragic misfortune that can befall mankind this misfortune also is not depicted any black white sense antonio his familys plight is not only or even necessarily most desperate this film fact with exception family restaurant scene practically every single character major or minor is portrayed as suffering some way at hands capitalism therefore as obviously tragic as antonios story is only real reason we side with him is because his particular tragedy is centrally focused but as has been discussed so often previously he is everyman character bicycle film is simply used as analogy loss or lack any essential element life that leads poverty suffering very simple terms films message is essentially that at some stage life we are all shouting give me back my bicycle but i digress this simplistic amateurish film is far more real far more true life than practically anything that hollywood has churned out past fifty years that reason realist me believes that all those dreamers people who believe happy ending or ideal status quo could do with sort down earth lesson that this film represents yes its distressing bleak vision but nevertheless utterly profound one,0.5521356421356421,-0.047947330447330454,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6.0,To Catch a Bicycle,"Many films that were made more than 40-50 years ago are difficult to watch at times. Not because they are low-quality, but because the storytelling techniques were different, and in this case, the subject matter was just an overall downer. Now, I have adapted to watching foreign films. There was a time when I didn't like the subtitles side to those films, but I've seen so many now that I don't really even think about it. So my opinions on the film reflect nothing to do with the fact that it's a foreign film, or old for that matter. But I have to say, I didn't really think Bicycle Thieves was as good as the critics have rated it, or good enough to be on one of the all-time greatest films list.There's nothing bad about the film though, it's a unique story about a family in war-time Italy and the struggles that everyone went through in finding a job at that time. These people had no choice but to work, and they had to work jobs that they may not have been pleased with. I liked that part of the movie. They did a great job at making believe that this was a place where a bicycle could get stolen just like that. But to be honest I never found the full story to be all that interesting. The kid tries to throw in some comedic relief and dramatic depth to the role but some of it falls pretty flat. But I did get a little bit of that Life is Beautiful vibe from their relationship at times, that much I liked.The problem with the film is that I didn't care enough about the characters to feel something when the going got rough. For the most part, our lead character is pretty unlikable and doesn't do enough to make himself appealing anyway. The acting is fine, the film looks fine, and the directing is fine, but that's not good enough.

10.0,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The path to eternal salvation becomes obvious only through true understanding of human emotions,"Semantically speaking, self-realization is a probable prelude to catharsis, but at a much higher echelon of cognition the two become virtually inseparable as attaining the former would automatically yield the latter. At this threshold of enlightenment, human spirit attains a sense of ephemeral divinity that would either drive the human crazy or would lead him to salvation. This enlightenment can seldom be attained through vicarious means. Even cinema, with its unparalleled potential to stimulate and satiate, mostly falls short of being cathartic, and only in the rarest of the rare cases does it manage to accomplish the incredible and the extraordinary. Undoubtedly, Bicycle Thieves is one such rare moment of triumph, wherein cinema becomes not only the tool but also the medium for the viewer to attain eternal salvation. Bicycle Thieves is an Italian neo-realist film by Vittorio De Sica. Neo- realism, a naturalistic movement in Italian cinema of the 1940s, aimed at giving cinema a new degree of realism, which promoted the use of an amateur cast vis-à-vis a professionally trained one and advocated shooting at real locations instead of the custom-built sets & studios. Keeping up with the spirit of the movement, Vittorio De Sica chose a factory fitter who had brought his son along for an audition as his male lead. His lead actress was a journalist who had approached him for an interview, while the young boy was filled by a child spotted in the crowd watching the filming. Bicycle Thieves tells the story of a poor worker searching the streets of Rome for his stolen bicycle, which he needs to keep his job intact. The movie is an amalgam of contrasting human feelings of hope & despair, sacrifice & gratification, euphoria & melancholy, love & detestation, and malice & benevolence. Bicycle Thieves performs the central function of art, which is to discover the meaning of life. The movie brilliantly handles with utmost care and precision the tender and often painful relationship that universally exists between a father and a son. The later half of the movie presents cinema at its most vivid, vituperative and volatile culminating in one of the most impactful, melancholic and brutally humanistic finales ever filmed in cinematic history, the agony of which would keep the viewer contemplating for weeks, months, or even years. The screenplay is simplistic, thought-provoking and at times nakedly brutal, while the cinematography is so effortless and magnificently beautiful that it appears as though a soul of a man has been filmed, and its true essence has been captured and preserved. The poignancy of the background score casts such a sustained spell that the movie experience is enhanced beyond imagination. American playwright Arthur Miller called it a lyrical masterpiece as it examines openly the destructive and draconian world man has made for himself. Marlon Brando once said, ""Bicycle Thieves is the perfect example of what can be done in front of the motion picture camera and is so rarely done"". Academy winner, Henry Fonda was so moved by the movie that he was tempted to write Vittorio De Sica a fan letter. The film is frequently on critics' and directors' lists of the best films ever made. It has captured every honor that the world of film can bestow including an Academy Honorary Award in 1950.All these accolades and the ubiquitous acclaim cannot describe the actual experience of seeing this film and becoming a part of its emotional impact. It makes the viewer laugh, cry and experience a rainbow of emotions. Bicycle Thieves has withstood the test of time for over six decades, and is a film for anyone and everyone.PS. It is a cinematic magnum opus, which accentuates the true might of cinema, and is a must for everyone, irrespective of cast, color, creed or gender. It's an ageless cinema for people of all age groups. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review path eternal salvation becomes obvious only through true understanding human emotions,semantically speaking self realization is probable prelude catharsis but at much higher echelon cognition two become virtually inseparable as attaining former would automatically yield latter at this threshold enlightenment human spirit attains sense ephemeral divinity that would either drive human crazy or would lead him salvation this enlightenment can seldom be attained through vicarious means even cinema with its unparalleled potential stimulate satiate mostly falls short being cathartic only rarest rare cases does it manage accomplish incredible extraordinary undoubtedly bicycle thieves is one such rare moment triumph wherein cinema becomes not only tool but also medium viewer attain eternal salvation bicycle thieves is italian neo realist film by vittorio de sica neo realism naturalistic movement italian cinema 1940s aimed at giving cinema new degree realism which promoted use amateur cast vis vis professionally trained one advocated shooting at real locations instead custom built sets studios keeping up with spirit movement vittorio de sica chose factory fitter who had brought his son along audition as his male lead his lead actress was journalist who had approached him interview while young boy was filled by child spotted crowd watching filming bicycle thieves tells story poor worker searching streets rome his stolen bicycle which he needs keep his job intact movie is amalgam contrasting human feelings hope despair sacrifice gratification euphoria melancholy love detestation malice benevolence bicycle thieves performs central function art which is discover meaning life movie brilliantly handles with utmost care precision tender often painful relationship that universally exists between father son later half movie presents cinema at its most vivid vituperative volatile culminating one most impactful melancholic brutally humanistic finales ever filmed cinematic history agony which would keep viewer contemplating weeks months or even years screenplay is simplistic thought provoking at times nakedly brutal while cinematography is so effortless magnificently beautiful that it appears as though soul man has been filmed its true essence has been captured preserved poignancy background score casts such sustained spell that movie experience is enhanced beyond imagination american playwright arthur miller called it lyrical masterpiece as it examines openly destructive draconian world man has made himself marlon brando once said bicycle thieves is perfect example what can be done front motion picture camera is so rarely done academy winner henry fonda was so moved by movie that he was tempted write vittorio de sica fan letter film is frequently critics directors lists best films ever made it has captured every honor that world film can bestow including academy honorary award 1950 all these accolades ubiquitous acclaim cannot describe actual experience seeing this film becoming part its emotional impact it makes viewer laugh cry experience rainbow emotions bicycle thieves has withstood test time over six decades is film anyone everyone ps it is cinematic magnum opus which accentuates true might cinema is must everyone irrespective cast color creed or gender its ageless cinema people all age groups 10 10,0.5052657724788873,0.1070168902136115,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Brilliant and haunting,"The grim reality of post-war Italian life is immediately apparent in this film, as a group of unemployed men all crowd around in the morning, desperate to have their name called out for possible job opportunities. One man is lucky enough to get one putting up advertising posters, but his fortunes are soon reversed when his bike is stolen, thus setting off a desperate search around Rome with his son.So much of this man's pain - the humiliation of the situation he's in and the fear for his family's future - is amplified because of the presence of his son, which was a brilliant part of the story. He's needed to pawn items to feed his family. The police give him an apathetic, helpless response when he reports the crime. As he searches he gets help from friends, but it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, despite seeing the machinations of a stolen bicycle racket on open display in a market. As he frantically runs around, a creepy guy talks to his son, and appears to be preying on him. Later he splurges on wine and mozzarella sandwiches, but his son can't help but notice what affluent kids are eating. Most dangerously, we feel the threat of an angry mob when he thinks he's found the culprit. What we see again and again is a harsh, unjust world, and all of this is being reflected in the boy's eyes.In the film's most gripping scene, the man faces the question, to what lengths should he go for his family? I felt great empathy for him, despite what seemed like a little carelessness on his part for his bike (and son!), considering how important they are to him. The feeling is magnified when director Vittorio De Sica shows us a huge rack of pawned items early on, and later in that brilliant crowd scene at the end, both of which made me think that this is just one story of many, that there is so much suffering in tough times, and most of it we're completely unaware of. There seems to be allegory here, as his bicycle has been stolen, so the future appeared to have been stolen for Italians in the 1940's. It's a small moment when the man gets a little break from a stranger, but this forgiving gesture carries tremendous meaning for the film, as does the moment the son takes his hand to move forward, together.

8.0,"Despite its reputation, it's still not DeSica's best!","THE BICYCLE THIEVES is an Italian ""Neo-realist"" film--so called because it used real people in rather ordinary situations. Some see these as anti-Hollywood but the actual reason for them was that after the war, the Italian film industry was in ruin and they were practically broke, so making these simple films about simple people was a natural outgrowth, though some of the groundwork for this style began during the war.The story itself is about a poor man who is out of work but is finally able to secure a job using his bicycle. The problem is that soon after starting back to work, the bike is stolen so he spends the rest of the film searching for the bike (sort of like PEEWEE'S GREAT ADVENTURE, but not a comedy). Later in the film, the focus is not just on the bike but on the relationship between the man and his young son. There really is nothing more to this very simple plot, but it is a fascinating time capsule into the desperate state of Italy until its rebirth in the mid-1950s.The fact that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is so well known and respected is a testament to the fact that many ""in the know"" aren't really that smart after all. What they actually didn't realize is that the director (DeSica) did several other films that were at least as good, if not better. I have heard and read much fawning praise for this film while at the same time wondering how these critics can discuss THE BICYCLE THIEVES without mentioning his other great works. It wasn't like THE BICYCLE THIEVES was his one crowning achievement as director--it's just that this one was discovered abroad and by the Oscar people (AMPAS). I challenge you to watch MIRACLE IN MILAN, UMBERTO D or especially THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US and then tell me that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is THE great masterpiece. These films (particularly THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US) have a great depth of emotion that THE BICYCLE THIEVES lacks and the connection to the audience is greater (provided you ever see these other films).I am not cursing THE BICYCLE THIEVES--it is a very good and simple film.

,The true point of the film,"....is the relationship of the father and son. Watch the film with your focus on the son, not the father.

,Stolen,"Spoilers herein.This is a film about child, one who is both IN the film and watches it.Hard as it is to imagine today, the world of film once had ideas on the surface, and lively controversies. Men took risks and sometimes survived to be celebrated.Here is a case: an experiment in urban photography, naturalistic acting (rather, naturalism) and investment in a narrative based on unromantic caprice. It is on many `best of' lists. But as with many projects (`On Golden Pond' comes to mind) the IDEA of the film is far superior to the film itself. This film is mawkishly sentimental while advertising that it isn't. It is crisply crafted while claiming otherwise. It is highly stylized - especially the confrontations - where it claims verity.The ideas explored have long ago been replaced by others more vital. As a result, the more you see this the more tired it seems. Except. Except for a couple shots of the kid, like when he is interrupted when peeing.

9.0,"Bicycle Thieves cycles through Italian neorealism, pedalling alongside some of the greatest masterpieces.","Ladri Di Biciclette. Ranked as one of the most influential and inspirational films of all-time. At one point, was deemed the greatest film of all time. An extensive list of self-proclaimed accolades that has assured its position in cinematic history. The question inevitably was whether or not Bicycle Thieves was indeed that perfect post-war drama many claimed it to be. Aside from one glaring character action that didn't particularly sit well with me, I must confess that after some deliberation I came to the conclusion that this drama is technically flawless. Flabbergasting on occasion. The sheer complexity of its simple story is nothing short of genius from De Sica. A working class father searches the entirety of Rome in order to find his recently stolen bicycle, an essential equipment that was to be the salvation of his family.Post-war and post-fascist, this minimalistic story arguably presents some of the best interpretations of humanistic values in both classic and modern cinema. There are so many themes tackled through De Sica's visualised direction, that the essence of realism surpasses that of neorealism. A story so relatable, dealing with poverty and a wealth class system, that it borders the boundaries of experimentalism.A cast of non-actors running around the impoverished streets of urban Rome, where citizens recuperate from the burning chaos that ensued from the war. De Sica's wide angled shots that capture the fragility and hostility of Italy. Neighbourhoods imparting their falsified honesty with threatening behaviour. The criminal act of desperation when all seems lost. An honest soul filled with anguish. A delicate father and son relationship that relishes in humanism, embellishing moral values. Montuori's cinematography capitalising on the urban disarray. Cicognini's score beautifully exhuming Italian Renaissance. Da Roma's sharp editing eloquently transitioning each scene, stringing them along into the most humble of stories. Only for it to all end on a melancholic note.De Sica commences the story with an assured layer of optimism, only for life to unfortunately unravel and crush that sense of hope. Despite Bartolini including various lines of comedic flair, the tale itself remains grounded. Maggiorani is a natural performer. His character's desperation is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and frantic body movement. Staiola, who plays his son, was exceptional. Possibly one of the best child performances I've seen. The constant staring towards his father shows the endearment and loyalty that presides in him. Exceptional.My only criticism, and it comes down to a personal opinion, is when Antonio slaps his son and doesn't apologise for it. Sure, treating him to a fancy pizzeria may act as a symbolic apology, whilst also showcasing the wealth disparity even further. But it didn't sit well with me. Understandably, it conveyed his frustration and desperation for his lost bicycle, however his son really did not do anything to deserve that. It was at that precise moment I was more invested in the son than I was with him. The recovered film was also a tiny bit rough around the edges, yet never detracted from the experience.My first endeavour into Italian neorealism was a success. No doubt. The environment and story that De Sica presented was scathingly realistic and relatable, all weighed down by superb natural performances. The themes and context are all hiding in the crevices of Rome, and Bicycle Thieves beautifully illustrates that. A simple tale that has the velocity of the Giro d'Italia.

10.0,An Italian masterpiece...,"Not only that, but a masterpiece of cinema. I do like foreign language movies, and for me Bicycle Thieves is one of those quintessential jewels of foreign language cinema. What makes me love Bicycle Thieves so much is the emotional impact. It is an incredibly touching movie, especially at the end which is so harsh and pessimistic yet very real that I can't help getting choked. It is not just the ending that is so achingly poignant, it is also the ironic humanism Bicycle Thieves has, and the film is also chilling in the scene when Bruno sees his father steal and redemptive in when Bruno slips his hand into his father's. Aside from the poignancy, the film is incredibly well made, with stunning photography, wondrous scenery and poetic symbolism. Alessandro Cicognini's score brings a dramatic intensity to the proceedings as well, and the Italian songs are wonderful. The script is both thought-provoking and philosophical(you live and you suffer), and the story follows or adopts a flow-of-life structure. The pace I have no problem with either, it is drawn-out but it is so deliberately to add to the neo-realism. Vittorio Di Sica directs impeccably and the acting is pretty much outstanding with Enzo Staiola delivering one of the most heart-breakingly believable child performances I have seen especially. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",italian masterpiece,not only that but masterpiece cinema i do like foreign language movies me bicycle thieves is one those quintessential jewels foreign language cinema what makes me love bicycle thieves so much is emotional impact it is incredibly touching movie especially at end which is so harsh pessimistic yet very real that i cant help getting choked it is not just ending that is so achingly poignant it is also ironic humanism bicycle thieves has film is also chilling scene when bruno sees his father steal redemptive when bruno slips his hand into his fathers aside poignancy film is incredibly well made with stunning photography wondrous scenery poetic symbolism alessandro cicogninis score brings dramatic intensity proceedings as well italian songs are wonderful script is both thought provoking philosophical you live you suffer story follows or adopts flow life structure pace i have no problem with either it is drawn out but it is so deliberately add neo realism vittorio di sica directs impeccably acting is pretty much outstanding with enzo staiola delivering one most heart breakingly believable child performances i have seen especially all all masterpiece 10 10 bethany cox,0.5931481481481482,0.17548260381593717,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,A Sad Slice of LIfe,"This is a masterwork. After years I can still see the images. Once I had children, it became even more to me. This is a microcosm of what it must have been like in postwar Axis countries. There is widespread unemployment, everyone trying to scrape a living. This man and his wife try to find a way to keep going; they have so little. Even though things are hard, the little boy, Bruno, idolizes his father. The final scene is about as gut wrenching as anything ever put on film. It is not sentimental as some say; it is painful. We have a man of great morals driven by forces over which he has no control, but that isn't going to matter. The options are starvation and abandonment. It's interesting how the crowds that judge this man counter the efforts he has made. The film is grueling and despairing. The thing is that it is so human. The bad guys seem to be winning all the time. The universe is indifferent and harsh. This movie is extremely well acted and there are great scenes that can be analyzed over and over. It is visually striking with great symbolic references. Ultimately it is just so human.",sad slice life,this is masterwork after years i can still see images once i had children it became even more me this is microcosm what it must have been like postwar axis countries there is widespread unemployment everyone trying scrape living this man his wife try find way keep going they have so little even though things are hard little boy bruno idolizes his father final scene is about as gut wrenching as anything ever put film it is not sentimental as some say it is painful we have man great morals driven by forces over which he has no control but that isnt going matter options are starvation abandonment its interesting how crowds that judge this man counter efforts he has made film is grueling despairing thing is that it is so human bad guys seem be winning all time universe is indifferent harsh this movie is extremely well acted there are great scenes that can be analyzed over over it is visually striking with great symbolic references ultimately it is just so human,0.7004166666666666,0.08166666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.44, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,One family's struggle with poverty in Post-WWII Italy,"This powerful film must be viewed in the original version (with subtitles) to capture the essence of the feeling. Post WWII Italy, seen from the view of the ""have nots"", where everyone struggles and there are few laughs. A family man at last is offered a job, but to keep it, he must show up for work with a bicycle. He had pawned his bicycle, but by giving up the family linens, he gets it back, only to have it stolen on the first day at work. He, his son, and several friends go to great lengths to help the man find his stolen bicycle, without results. Eventually the man resorts to becoming a bicycle thief himself.I have never seen anyone so ashamed, as this man was, when his son witnesses the humiliation of seeing his father caught stealing and mobbed for his offense. I was also stunned by seeing the size of the pawnshop (it looked like an Amazon warehouse!), as well as a ""bicycle fence yard"" that was enormous. During poor economic times pawnshops and ""fences"" seem to be the only ones flourishing.This is a stunning motion picture achievement. The poor film quality (suffering considerably after some 50 years) only adds to the authenticity. ""The Bicycle Thief"" is one of the finest films I have viewed. It rivals ""La Strada"" for my favorite foreign film. This film receives my highest recommendation.",one familys struggle with poverty post wwii italy,this powerful film must be viewed original version with subtitles capture essence feeling post wwii italy seen view have nots where everyone struggles there are few laughs family man at last is offered job but keep it he must show up work with bicycle he had pawned his bicycle but by giving up family linens he gets it back only have it stolen first day at work he his son several friends go great lengths help man find his stolen bicycle without results eventually man resorts becoming bicycle thief himself i have never seen anyone so ashamed as this man was when his son witnesses humiliation seeing his father caught stealing mobbed his offense i was also stunned by seeing size pawnshop it looked like amazon warehouse as well as bicycle fence yard that was enormous during poor economic times pawnshops fences seem be only ones flourishing this is stunning motion picture achievement poor film quality suffering considerably after some 50 years only adds authenticity bicycle thief is one finest films i have viewed it rivals la strada my favorite foreign film this film receives my highest recommendation,0.5862499999999999,0.11750000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
