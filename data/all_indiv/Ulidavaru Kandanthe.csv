7.0,A new Perspective to Kannada Cinema! Slow yet Huanting!,"Will Ulidavaru Kandante..As seen by the rest succeed in offering new perspective in cinema ? The answer is probably ""Yes"".In the past we did have scripts and films based from coastal-region but this is probably the first one to have captured attention from the rest of the places in the state and obviously the coast. The trailer and music both went viral getting accolades and now it is time for the full feature to be seen by the rest.I have to admit that Rakshit Shetty's debut directorial venture transported me to Dakshina Kannada landscapes sitting right in center of Bangalore. The atmosphere lasted for over more than two hours. Rakshit has chosen a script which is well woven starting with the right note to capture your attention right from the first frame. Unlike prominent Kannada Cinema ""Ulidavaru Kandante"" gives more prominence to the characters. This is out and out a character driven script. There is a story to be told and the story is narrated quite interestingly. Multiple view points have been used in films for decades, its success or failure depends on the art and facility with which it can aid the story being told. Rakshit has grandly succeed in his efforts. In the past we have witnessed ""Yuva"", ""Memento,"" ""Hero,"" ""Irreversible"", ""Amores Perros"" that use various perceptions of facts. What these films all have in common is that the visual device used does not get in the way of the story but enhances it. ""Ulidavaru Kandante"" too falls in this league.The film as such is presented in a chapter-wise manner where in each chapter allows you to explore each character visually. There is a reason why these characters exist in the space of the film. There are a few which could have been avoided. The actors have done a commendable job in giving life to the characters. Rakshit, Rishab, Kishore, Achyut in pivotal roles deserve appreciation. I know Achyut is not a native of Dakshina Kannada but the way he has presented himself just shows his strength and versatility. I recently watched few of his offbeat films and watching him in this role was a pleasure. Rakshit's ""charisma"", Rishab's ""fear"", Kishore's ""feeling"", Achyuta's feeling, fear and irritation with ""Kaaki"" will be remembered. The child actors also have pulled in splendid performance. Poojary, Tara, Sangita, Yagna and folks who have played Rakshit's accomplice have provided great support to the main characters. I believe this film will go down as one of the best acted films. The actors are so natural and casual it does not feel like they are really acting out on the screen.Karm Chawla's cinematography, Ajaneesh's BG score, sync sound succeeds in providing the much necessary atmospheric experience. The coastal landscapes are brilliantly captured and presented. Having know these places personally it gives you a great feeling to watch them on big screen. The color scheming and VFX does need a special mention. Who would not want to try out the ""Sin City"" like shot? Wow! The BG score is haunting and goes well with the film. A couple of songs ""Paper Paper"" and ""Gati"" seems out of place as far as narrative is concerned. Probably this has more to do with commercial aspects. ""Kanna Muchhe"", ""Kaakig Banna"" match with the narrative. Especially the way they have brought in ""Kaakig Banna"" is simply brilliant. Hats off to Achyut making this a memorable song even though it is in the near end of the film. If you pay attention to the sound design and sound capture you might feel a lot of background noise being captured. Especially during the Tiger painting scene. There is a sudden drop in the sound levels at times. We are in an era where in sync sound is picking up gradually. Its at a very few instances where in the sound capture is kind of average but at a overall level it gives you a phenomenal experience in listening to the speech with the inner expressions. In a way ""Ulidavaru Kandante"" is technically brilliant film-making.The film though entertaining and satisfactory comes with few negatives. The first being the run-time. The film starts of with a great pace but gets slow from the second chapter on-wards. If it was a bit tight it would have been more perfect than what it is now. Some audience are bound to get tired. Never mind you cant keep everyone happy. The other factor is the penetration of this film beyond Karnataka. This film is high on the tradition, dialect and lifestyle of the coastal region. It would be interesting to see how this could interest people from other states. Lucia had a great success in this aspect. I wonder if ""Ulidavaru Kandante"" can achieve this. We will have to wait and watch on how this is received and propagated.Two things. Be calm and patient while watching this. It is not an edge of seat thriller. Give the film some time to get it on to you. Do not expect a ""wow"" climax. Just watch the perspectives and bring out your own",new perspective kannada cinema slow yet huanting,will ulidavaru kandante as seen by rest succeed offering new perspective cinema answer is probably yes past we did have scripts films based coastal region but this is probably first one have captured attention rest places state obviously coast trailer music both went viral getting accolades now it is time full feature be seen by rest i have admit that rakshit shettys debut directorial venture transported me dakshina kannada landscapes sitting right center bangalore atmosphere lasted over more than two hours rakshit has chosen script which is well woven starting with right note capture your attention right first frame unlike prominent kannada cinema ulidavaru kandante gives more prominence characters this is out out character driven script there is story be told story is narrated quite interestingly multiple view points have been used films decades its success or failure depends art facility with which it can aid story being told rakshit has grandly succeed his efforts past we have witnessed yuva memento hero irreversible amores perros that use various perceptions facts what these films all have common is that visual device used does not get way story but enhances it ulidavaru kandante too falls this league film as such is presented chapter wise manner where each chapter allows you explore each character visually there is reason why these characters exist space film there are few which could have been avoided actors have done commendable job giving life characters rakshit rishab kishore achyut pivotal roles deserve appreciation i know achyut is not native dakshina kannada but way he has presented himself just shows his strength versatility i recently watched few his offbeat films watching him this role was pleasure rakshits charisma rishabs fear kishores feeling achyutas feeling fear irritation with kaaki will be remembered child actors also have pulled splendid performance poojary tara sangita yagna folks who have played rakshits accomplice have provided great support main characters i believe this film will go down as one best acted films actors are so natural casual it does not feel like they are really acting out screen karm chawlas cinematography ajaneeshs bg score sync sound succeeds providing much necessary atmospheric experience coastal landscapes are brilliantly captured presented having know these places personally it gives you great feeling watch them big screen color scheming vfx does need special mention who would not want try out sin city like shot wow bg score is haunting goes well with film couple songs paper paper gati seems out place as far as narrative is concerned probably this has more do with commercial aspects kanna muchhe kaakig banna match with narrative especially way they have brought kaakig banna is simply brilliant hats off achyut making this memorable song even though it is near end film if you pay attention sound design sound capture you might feel lot background noise being captured especially during tiger painting scene there is sudden drop sound levels at times we are era where sync sound is picking up gradually its at very few instances where sound capture is kind average but at overall level it gives you phenomenal experience listening speech with inner expressions way ulidavaru kandante is technically brilliant film making film though entertaining satisfactory comes with few negatives first being run time film starts with great pace but gets slow second chapter wards if it was bit tight it would have been more perfect than what it is now some audience are bound get tired never mind you cant keep everyone happy other factor is penetration this film beyond karnataka this film is high tradition dialect lifestyle coastal region it would be interesting see how this could interest people other states lucia had great success this aspect i wonder if ulidavaru kandante can achieve this we will have wait watch how this is received propagated two things be calm patient while watching this it is not edge seat thriller give film some time get it you do not expect wow climax just watch perspectives bring out your own,0.48899925471354044,0.21468372896944332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,One small step called Ulidavaru Kandanthe A Gaint Leap for Kannada Film Industry,"Ulidavaru KandantheIt is a Bold, intuitive , innovative and extraordinarily simple yet extremely effective machinery which transformed the way a story is told.It is non linear way of narration , equally justifying each charterer and showing their depth, We all are heroes in our own life and we cannot walk away from our story.... and our story is always the way we want it to be..... often we chose to ignore the facts for the fairy tale, for it comforts us in despair and gives a hope....This is capitalized in this story telling, where each narrator feels that his perspective is the truth. Even a small material will cause a large shadow when its rightly placed at the right time.A butterfly effect of events which will cause an avalanche of catastrophes...Plot is very simple, but strongly supported by astonishing script and mesmerizing acting. Last but not the least kudos to the debut directer /writer Rakshit Shetty to pulling an incredible master piece.That said, this cinema is like summer rain which makes you feel like you are in paradise, the entire movie holds your undivided attention and the music is brilliantly fixed on to the script its very hard to see it as a separate entity.Movies seems to be inspired by few Hollywood flicks which is not a bad thing when its so elegantly executed.",one small step called ulidavaru kandanthe gaint leap kannada film industry,ulidavaru kandantheit is bold intuitive innovative extraordinarily simple yet extremely effective machinery which transformed way story is told it is non linear way narration equally justifying each charterer showing their depth we all are heroes our own life we cannot walk away our story our story is always way we want it be often we chose ignore facts fairy tale it comforts us despair gives hope this is capitalized this story telling where each narrator feels that his perspective is truth even small material will cause large shadow when its rightly placed at right time butterfly effect events which will cause avalanche catastrophes plot is very simple but strongly supported by astonishing script mesmerizing acting last but not least kudos debut directer writer rakshit shetty pulling incredible master piece that said this cinema is like summer rain which makes you feel like you are paradise entire movie holds your undivided attention music is brilliantly fixed script its very hard see it as separate entity movies seems be inspired by few hollywood flicks which is not bad thing when its so elegantly executed,0.5573571428571428,0.1989285714285714,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,Simply Mindblowing!!!,"This movie just sets the bar for the rest to come. Looking at the trailer I was looking forward to a good movie but this turned out to be a masterpiece. Honestly, you have to be familiar with movies like Pulp Fiction, Inception, Donnie Darko, Requiem for a Dream etc to show liking towards it, as this is not a typical Indian Cinema. Anyway, if you thought 'LUCIA' was cool, Just wait till you watch this!!.Anyway, coming back to the movie. The story is plain and simple, it revolves around the death of a character and a reporter investigating it, writing down the perspectives of the others involved in the incident. What takes the cake though, is the direction, screenplay, acting and the background score. Simply Flawless!! Didn't expect that sort of direction from a debutant director.Simply amazing!!!. The film is divided into 6 chapters, each from a different point of view, revolving around the same time frame. The movie adds its own style and at the same time preserving the authenticity of the native regions. In ending is left to your interpretation.",simply mindblowing,this movie just sets bar rest come looking at trailer i was looking forward good movie but this turned out be masterpiece honestly you have be familiar with movies like pulp fiction inception donnie darko requiem dream etc show liking towards it as this is not typical indian cinema anyway if you thought lucia was cool just wait till you watch this anyway coming back movie story is plain simple it revolves around death character reporter investigating it writing down perspectives others involved incident what takes cake though is direction screenplay acting background score simply flawless didnt expect that sort direction debutant director simply amazing film is divided into 6 chapters each different point view revolving around same time frame movie adds its own style at same time preserving authenticity native regions ending is left your interpretation,0.45890652557319217,0.21880511463844796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Rakshit Shetty : Al Pacino of KFI! Brilliant movie!,"Chapter 1: As the title says, its ""Ulidavaru Kandante"". This crime comedy thriller depends on how you see and understand the movie. It's always difficult to direct a movie with non-linear storyline and intertwined plots. But, Rakshit Shetty has done a stunning job with his first venture as a Director! I can sense the influence of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Christopher Nolan on him. It's a really good thing that Rakshit is influenced by such great directors. Chapter 2: Film connects by intersecting story lines(perspectives) of different characters. So, be very attentive in the cinema hall else you'll miss a part of it and you might miss something which has a connection to a different scene.The CGI use in few scenes reminded me of Sin City. Little reference of pop culture is well captured and it plays an important role in the movie. Actually, it was quite brilliant. The best part of the movie is its regional flavour(Mangaluru and TuLu). Chapter 3: Songs and Background score by Ajaneesh Loknath is amazing! Background score is as important as the dialogues in the movie because it sets the mood to the movie. It can give nice contrast to the movie and it is absolutely mind-blowing in this movie. BG score has a strong impact on few characters and it's incredible. Using TuLu words in few dialogues and songs is a really good thing since it exposes the regional aura to the rest of Karnataka. Few directors and music directors in KFI should learn a bit from this movie. Chapter 4: Rakshit is all over the movie and his character is really diabolical(li'l harsh but yes he is). He's the ""Al Pacino"" of Kannada Film Industry now! Shetre, super neevu! Achyuta Kumar, Sheetal, Kishore, Tara and the entire cast has done a great job. The kid ""Democracy"" is just fantastic and his dialogue delivery was spectacular! I think that kid has a great future. Final Chapter: To everyone who think the movie is slow, that is because the movie grows with every single scene and that is how it should be. It is definitely not slow. I think the movie meets all the expectations which a good movie should have. People should definitely watch this movie in theaters instead of crying that there are no good movies made in Kannada. Yes, I'm talking about you haters! Specially, few people(kannadigas in my friends list) who'll watch all other language movies in theaters except Kannada movies which they'll download from the internet after the digital print is released. Get your lazy arse up and watch the movie in the theater when its still running! Personally, I feel this movie should appear in the top 250 IMDb movies list. And, its a perfect ten(10/10)! ‪#‎UlidavaruKandante‬",rakshit shetty al pacino kfi brilliant movie,chapter 1 as title says its ulidavaru kandante this crime comedy thriller depends how you see understand movie its always difficult direct movie with non linear storyline intertwined plots but rakshit shetty has done stunning job with his first venture as director i can sense influence quentin tarantino guy ritchie christopher nolan him its really good thing that rakshit is influenced by such great directors chapter 2 film connects by intersecting story lines perspectives different characters so be very attentive cinema hall else youll miss part it you might miss something which has connection different scene cgi use few scenes reminded me sin city little reference pop culture is well captured it plays important role movie actually it was quite brilliant best part movie is its regional flavour mangaluru tulu chapter 3 songs background score by ajaneesh loknath is amazing background score is as important as dialogues movie because it sets mood movie it can give nice contrast movie it is absolutely mind blowing this movie bg score has strong impact few characters its incredible using tulu words few dialogues songs is really good thing since it exposes regional aura rest karnataka few directors music directors kfi should learn bit this movie chapter 4 rakshit is all over movie his character is really diabolical lil harsh but yes he is hes al pacino kannada film industry now shetre super neevu achyuta kumar sheetal kishore tara entire cast has done great job kid democracy is just fantastic his dialogue delivery was spectacular i think that kid has great future final chapter everyone who think movie is slow that is because movie grows with every single scene that is how it should be it is definitely not slow i think movie meets all expectations which good movie should have people should definitely watch this movie theaters instead crying that there are no good movies made kannada yes im talking about you haters specially few people kannadigas my friends list wholl watch all other language movies theaters except kannada movies which theyll download internet after digital print is released get your lazy arse up watch movie theater when its still running personally i feel this movie should appear top 250 imdb movies list its perfect ten 10 10 ulidavarukandante,0.5831272893772895,0.2346680402930404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,"""Ulidavaru Kandanthe"" – An artistic masterpiece.","I've seen people utterly confused and disappointed after the movie (no doubt) with the only tiny consolation in offer being ""It was different"". I've read reviews in Kannada Newspapers (*Gives Aaron Eckhart's two-face look of Harvey Dent from 'The Dark Knight'*) horrendously regarding the movie as a ""waste of time"", going to limits so as to say that ""the only death that happens in the movie is that of the audience"". But I have only one thing to say. Rakshit Shetty – you incredibly talented out of the stars oh-we-needed-this-so-very-badly- marvelous beauty ! I have to admit, at the end of the movie, I sat there on my seat, unwilling to walk out, wanting for more, before the fading lights reluctantly forced me to leave the theatre. Yes Rakshit Shetty, such was the ecstasy of watching MY Udupi come to life, in arguably one of the best movies I have ever watched.I've never been an avid admirer of Kannada movies, though I always keep an open mind. Since the likes of Lucia, I've always been looking forward to eventful ventures in the industry. And the moment I had seen the trailer, I knew, that ""Ulidavaru Kandanthe"" was what I was looking for.I'm not going to give out spoilers, for this is a movie each one ought to savor from his/her own perspectives. I'm going to tell you why ""Ulidavaru Kandanthe"" is such a masterpiece and why it will go down to be one of my favorite movies of all times (Beating Pulp Fiction).To begin with, the very first scene. Fishermen Singing their coastal rhymes as they labour on the machinery to fit a huge wooden piece into place, the video being focused on the wood . To me, the most memorable moments in the whole film. For there was a meticulous sync in the video and the audio creating a rhythmic chant, a near-apocalyptic heartbeat, a countdown to the epic journey that was to come. I felt a stroke of genius in that and realised I couldn't just rest back on my seat, for this was to be a movie of detail, and boy was I right! Secondly, Ajaneesh B Lokanath. The last time I kept humming the background score weeks after watching a movie was with ""The Good The Bad The Ugly"". Not just the songs, the entire movie is as much an enchanting musical experience as it is a magical visual delight.And then, the performances. Well, Tara, in her tiny role is just brilliant ( sorry, short of words here). Achyuth is absolutely adorable and Richi so elegant and genuine. ""Democracy"" is cute, entertaining and marvelous at the same time. Everyone does a spectacular job, which is definitely one of the real highs of the movie.Rakshit Shetty's direction gives Kannada Industry new hope. Clearly, a lot of things have been inspired by Tarantino ( in caps ""INSPIRED"" not plagiarised), but I can hardly think it could have been bettered. Mixed with some brilliant cinematography, superb camera-work and an indomitable background score, the intricate details and some sheer genius ""stuff"" like depicting the very same scene from different camera angles, the brilliant scene where tara prepares to cook her sons favourite ""Meen Curry"" for example, stand out.And being a resident of this coastal town of Udupi, the very sound of ""Malpe"" is tantalizing. Having lived here from the day I was born, I couldn't help but admire the artistic mastery with which Rakshit Shetty portrays the cultural heritage of coastal Karnataka, like I said, a visual delight.But what makes ""Ulidavaru Kandanthe"" stand out in an industry dominated by item songs and sequences shot in luxurious foreign sites, is the importance the director places in the beauty of simplicity. You don't need a rich and pompous location to shoot a movie, you just need to know that every location is rich and pompous, given you depict it from the right perspectives. The entire movie has a non linear storyline, a confusing and unsure first half, slow mid way, but that allows you to discern the characters better, and I think that's what Rakshit wants you to do, rather than try to solve the mystery, which exists or not, depends on the viewers perspective as well.All in all, ""Ulidavaru Kandanthe"" is an affably ineffable tale, a saga, an unforgettable experience, the beginning of a new era, every (Dakshina) Kannadiga's pride. An artistic masterpiece, matched only by its own ingenuity to leave the viewer ascertain his own storyline, his own ending, through his own perspectives.

9.0,Nice meaningful movie!,"Ulidavaru kandante is very good effort from the Kannada film industry. I must say this movie has captured raw emotions very well in several situations. And i hope movies like these are well received by the Audience and eventually making sure that these kind of experiments continue and do well. This movie also brings the other variations of the kannada language in Karnataka which is awesomely portrayed!The movie gives more importance to art in itself rather than conventional movies(in any regional language in general) which gives importance to commercial elements. Lastly , I felt the second half could have been bit faster to improve the entertainment quotient. That said, it doesn't mean its boring. Its just that the movie gives more importance to script!Overall a great movie!

7.0,As seen by the rest or as seen by you?,"Ulidavaru Kandante (As Seen by the Rest), one of the most anticipated movies in Kannada film industry in the year 2014 for me was a brilliant experience. Having waited for this movie for months, I went to the movie as soon as I could after the release. The movie had already created the hype required. However, it was not up to the expectation or maybe I expected more. The screenplay was adapted from Pulp fiction and moulded to make the general audience understand. The screenplay was indeed brilliant and was supported by brilliant performance by most of the pivotal characters, beautiful music and mind-blowing cinematography. However, the story was a bit weak.

7.0,"More than Veermandi, this one is The Indian Version of Japanese Cult 'Roshomon' with an OPEN BLEAK ENDING.","Ulidavaru Kandanthe (2014) : Brief Review -More than Veermandi, this one is The Indian Version of Japanese Cult 'Roshomon' with an OPEN BLEAK ENDING. Few days ago I watched Kamal Hassan's Veerumandi which i thought was the only attempt of Roshomon style storytelling in Indian cinema. But i was wrong because i did not know Ulidavaru Kandanthe then. Now when I have seen it I think this is more of an Indian Version of Akira Kurosawa's Japanese Cult Classic 'Roshomon' (1950) than Veerumandi. I said this thing in my review of Veerumandi that the film lacks multiple versions of the same story as it belongs to only two characters whereas Roshomon had four versions of the same story. Now, Ulidavaru Kandanthe has even surpassed that number as it tells the same story from six different perspectives or six chapters. It's more like a crime anthology but still i feel the strong presence of Roshomon effect there. In the film, a journalist sets out to uncover the truth behind an incident, through the perspectives of different people, unraveling how they and their lives are intertwined with it. It looks little complex at some occasions because it gambles with the multiple dimensions of the same events set in different time but by the end you get all the answers except for One Big Suspense in the last frame. That Bleak ending is actually left there for your own interpretation, you have to guess what would have happened from your own perspective. This was a brilliant move i must say but i am not sure whether it is completely reliable and fulfilling. Anyways, I congratulate the director and writer for at least trying something different from mainstream crime thrillers. Overall, Ulidavaru Kandanthe is a must see for movie buffs because it delivers lots of good things like acting, writing, technical effects, storytelling, complexly driven narrative, background score, cinematography and direction.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",more than veermandi this one is indian version japanese cult roshomon with open bleak ending,ulidavaru kandanthe 2014 brief review more than veermandi this one is indian version japanese cult roshomon with open bleak ending few days ago i watched kamal hassans veerumandi which i thought was only attempt roshomon style storytelling indian cinema but i was wrong because i did not know ulidavaru kandanthe then now when i have seen it i think this is more indian version akira kurosawas japanese cult classic roshomon 1950 than veerumandi i said this thing my review veerumandi that film lacks multiple versions same story as it belongs only two characters whereas roshomon had four versions same story now ulidavaru kandanthe has even surpassed that number as it tells same story six different perspectives or six chapters its more like crime anthology but still i feel strong presence roshomon effect there film journalist sets out uncover truth behind incident through perspectives different people unraveling how they their lives are intertwined with it it looks little complex at some occasions because it gambles with multiple dimensions same events set different time but by end you get all answers except one big suspense last frame that bleak ending is actually left there your own interpretation you have guess what would have happened your own perspective this was brilliant move i must say but i am not sure whether it is completely reliable fulfilling anyways i congratulate director writer at least trying something different mainstream crime thrillers overall ulidavaru kandanthe is must see movie buffs because it delivers lots good things like acting writing technical effects storytelling complexly driven narrative background score cinematography direction rating 7 10 by,0.4497584541062801,0.0013586956521739093,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,An Immersive Experience,"For more than two hours I was soaked in the culture of South Canara . The sea, the riverside, greenery and the folk arts all produce a mesmerizing effect. Some of the newspapers found the movie to be stretched , meandering and a waste of time. What I did conclude after watching ""Ulidavaru Kandante"" was that they exaggerated the film's weaknesses to a great extent . The film doesn't sell itself as a thriller . Neither does it promise a mind-blowing climax . All it seeks is, to show a portmanteau of perspectives on an incident during the Krishnashtami season in Udupi. Though the perspectives are not etched very well , they provide interesting insights to life in South Canara during the early 90's . I could relate to the ideas of ""running away from home to Bombay / Gulf "" , underworld etc because these were some of the social issues that I saw during my years of growing up in Udupi ( the 90's). The swagger of Rakshit Shetty , the portrayal of despair and hope by Thara , joie de vivre of the children ,the love-struck Kishore and the sheer brilliance of Achyuth Kumar make the movie a treat to watch. The perspectives do overlap, but that's how an incident pans out in real- life. Many of the dialogues are in Kundapura Kannada and a few are in Tulu . This makes the movie very real but audiences could find it hard to understand them . And subtitles were missing in some places . I did love some of the colloquialisms in the movie, ""Vali Kaluk "" : which means to turn a woman a widow ( Vole : Ornament , Kaliyodu : Remove in Kannada ), Boda Sheera ( Do you want sheera - Kesari Bhath in Tulu , an allusion to Sheera served during the Hindu ceremony of mourning). These gems were lost on the audience without an appropriate explanation of the contaxt. Rakshit delivers his dialogues with a flamboyance that makes them memorable.The cinematography, music and the choreography of the Huli- Vesha are absolutely top class.The cinematic device of using the story of a Cuban boy and the Agneepath protagonist is a nice touch.I am giving the movie an 8 because it could have been shorter, the perspectives should have been clearer and easy to follow for an ordinary viewer.

7.0,It doesn't get cooler than that tiger dance...,"The other reviews have said almost everything that needs to be said about this film. Before seeing this I'd heard comparisons to Pulp Fiction, Agneepath and half a dozen other films but in reality, those comparisons are not really necessary because Ulidavaru Kandante is clearly it's own film. Portmanteau films have been gaining ground in Indian cinema over the last few years but it's still a fairly new format in the Kannada industry. These kind of films are difficult to execute and can easily go wrong which makes this achievement all the more impressive given it's Rakshit Shetty's directorial debut. I found the first 30 minutes patchy but the film recovers quickly and dramatically improves after that. The last 45 minutes really make the film and some of the surreal visual scenes may over time become iconic in Kannada or even independent Indian cinema. Now I've seen it in the cinema, I'm looking forward to re-watching it on DVD and taking in the different vignettes all over again. I'll end by saying that Rakshit Shetty's tiger dance is hands down the coolest scene I've seen in any film from any country in the last few years.",it doesnt get cooler than that tiger dance,other reviews have said almost everything that needs be said about this film before seeing this id heard comparisons pulp fiction agneepath half dozen other films but reality those comparisons are not really necessary because ulidavaru kandante is clearly its own film portmanteau films have been gaining ground indian cinema over last few years but its still fairly new format kannada industry these kind films are difficult execute can easily go wrong which makes this achievement all more impressive given its rakshit shettys directorial debut i found first 30 minutes patchy but film recovers quickly dramatically improves after that last 45 minutes really make film some surreal visual scenes may over time become iconic kannada or even independent indian cinema now ive seen it cinema im looking forward re watching it dvd taking different vignettes all over again ill end by saying that rakshit shettys tiger dance is hands down coolest scene ive seen any film any country last few years,0.48154695099139544,0.07398054620276844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,One of the greatest indian movies ever made,"Rakshit Shetty, hats off man. This was an effort and a half.. Just when we thought Kannada movie industry was on a decline, this movie as well as Lucia and Thithi,has brought hope.This movie has certainly taken inspiration from acclaimed movies such as Pulp Fiction(Tarantino in general), Scarface and most notably Rashomon. But it is not a ripoff by any means..This movie is basically about an incident that took place during Janmastami, an Indian festival and a journalist's attempt at figuring out what exactly had happened through many witnesses. Hence the title Ulidavaru Kandanthe which translates to as seen by the rest. This movie is about how people view an incident from different perspectives. There are 5 people who tell everything they know about the incident and the plot is divided into 6 chapters. The thing I have noticed is that as the narrator changes the entire genre of the movie changes. For Democracy it was a romantic movie, for Shankar Poojary and Dinesha it is a crime movie, for Balu it is a thriller and for Shailesha it is a mother son sentiment movie. Great isn't it? And there is a theory about the main five characters compared to the pancha bhoota(Indian mythology) as well which I found fascinating. Even the songs carry a lot of meaning and contributes to the story.The characters are not that well fleshed out as it is a plot driven movie but the cast do a commendable job especially Rakshit(again) who brings all the swagger in the world to play Richi who provides the much needed entertainment but doesn't deviate from the actual plot. Also Kishore as Munna,Tara as Rathnakka and Achyuta Rao as Balu are outstanding. Also Rakshit's decision to give a glimpse of the culture of coastal Karnataka was a masterstroke as the cinematography was magnificent.The only thing which I didn't like in the movie is the editing and the love story which proves a little distracting and puts a small scratch on an otherwise flawless masterpiece. I highly recommend each and everyone to watch the best Kannada(maybe Indian) movie of all time!!!",one greatest indian movies ever made,rakshit shetty hats off man this was effort half just when we thought kannada movie industry was decline this movie as well as lucia thithi has brought hope this movie has certainly taken inspiration acclaimed movies such as pulp fiction tarantino general scarface most notably rashomon but it is not ripoff by any means this movie is basically about incident that took place during janmastami indian festival journalists attempt at figuring out what exactly had happened through many witnesses hence title ulidavaru kandanthe which translates as seen by rest this movie is about how people view incident different perspectives there are 5 people who tell everything they know about incident plot is divided into 6 chapters thing i have noticed is that as narrator changes entire genre movie changes democracy it was romantic movie shankar poojary dinesha it is crime movie balu it is thriller shailesha it is mother son sentiment movie great isnt it there is theory about main five characters compared pancha bhoota indian mythology as well which i found fascinating even songs carry lot meaning contributes story characters are not that well fleshed out as it is plot driven movie but cast do commendable job especially rakshit again who brings all swagger world play richi who provides much needed entertainment but doesnt deviate actual plot also kishore as munna tara as rathnakka achyuta rao as balu are outstanding also rakshits decision give glimpse culture coastal karnataka was masterstroke as cinematography was magnificent only thing which i didnt like movie is editing love story which proves little distracting puts small scratch otherwise flawless masterpiece i highly recommend each everyone watch best kannada maybe indian movie all time,0.5593367346938775,0.3120280612244898,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"

,A(nother?) little perspective,"(Unfortunately) I don't understand the language, and need English sub-titles. Unfortunately, the distributors/cinemas in my little town are not all that considerate, or seem to want a wide audience to enjoy niche movies. Bad business, but hey, they're management. So, the way I've been watching quite a few movies of late without subtitles, I just lay back and tried enjoying the experience. Boy, it sure was some experience. A trip, without being completely trippy (except during the painted tiger dance sequences, and the paper-medicine song). Now, this has been done before, and has 2 aspects to it. 1, being the multiple perspectives aspect. Not very well done, but better than most, it calls to mind works like Rashomon (of course), Amores Perros, Yuva, Vedam and even lesser works like Vantage point, 11:14 and Dumm maaro dumm (slightly underrated, IMO). This one calls those to mind, in this aspect, not in a very good way, but its not bad either, and doesn't call attention to itself much, since its kinda smooth (the transitions, I mean). The performances are good-to-average, with the director-lead giving himself both the plum role, plum lines and a solid performance, with some of the supporting characters following suit - Achyuth Kumar, Kishore, Tara stand out in the rest of the ensemble. The technical values are superb, with ,mentions having to be made of the immaculate cinematography (aided by fantastic locations, of course - and was evocative, in a good way, of 'Mithya') by Karm Chawla and sound design (aided, of course, by a very eclectic soundtrack that grew on me as the movie progressed). I confess I was getting restive during the first half, but patience did pay off, since the 2nd half has quite a few pleasant surprises in store.The problem? The plot just is not powerful enough to warrant the 'Rashomon' technique of filming, though perhaps the movie comes out as more powerful than it would have been if filmed otherwise. Shakespeare also seems to have made an impact on the makers in the way multiple plot lines play out, and that also seems to be a good thing, in terms of ensuring hard impact. Just wish it had something more substantial to stay.Verdict? Go watch it in the multiplex. Definitely better than all the trash playing, but don't go expecting another 'Lucia'.",nother little perspective,unfortunately i dont understand language need english sub titles unfortunately distributors cinemas my little town are not all that considerate or seem want wide audience enjoy niche movies bad business but hey theyre management so way ive been watching quite few movies late without subtitles i just lay back tried enjoying experience boy it sure was some experience trip without being completely trippy except during painted tiger dance sequences paper medicine song now this has been done before has 2 aspects it 1 being multiple perspectives aspect not very well done but better than most it calls mind works like rashomon course amores perros yuva vedam even lesser works like vantage point 11 14 dumm maaro dumm slightly underrated imo this one calls those mind this aspect not very good way but its not bad either doesnt call attention itself much since its kinda smooth transitions i mean performances are good average with director lead giving himself both plum role plum lines solid performance with some supporting characters following suit achyuth kumar kishore tara stand out rest ensemble technical values are superb with mentions having be made immaculate cinematography aided by fantastic locations course was evocative good way mithya by karm chawla sound design aided course by very eclectic soundtrack that grew me as movie progressed i confess i was getting restive during first half but patience did pay off since 2nd half has quite few pleasant surprises store problem plot just is not powerful enough warrant rashomon technique filming though perhaps movie comes out as more powerful than it would have been if filmed otherwise shakespeare also seems have made impact makers way multiple plot lines play out that also seems be good thing terms ensuring hard impact just wish it had something more substantial stay verdict go watch it multiplex definitely better than all trash playing but dont go expecting another lucia,0.4561358304005363,0.11637129210658623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"

5.0,Naanu Kandante!,"This was one of the most anticipated movie of 2014! The trailer was a huge hit & with Rakshit Sir interacting with us in FB n twitter, I was able to understand his view/passion/commitment towards direction so I was waiting like a mad dog for this movie! The theater was full, the environment was great but I've to admit that I was kinda disappointed after the movie! Not saying its bad! Content & technicality wise, Movie is brilliant but because of Kundapura/Mangalore kannada, I was not able to understand 70-80% of the dialogues! I could have managed but throughout the movie it was not a good experience for me because the voices weren't audible enough! I'm not sure if it was the fault of Eshwari theater or the effect of sync sound system but we were not able to hear 60-70% of the dialogues! And it gets worse! There is no subtitles(There was subs for 6-9 dialogues but I see no point in that). So sadly for me, it was like watching a Japanese 'Roshomon' movie without audio & without subs! So the whole dialogue content was dots to me & I had to connect it by myself to understand what the characters said! I was not able to understand the Cuban kid & many other important thoughtful conversations in the movie! So I feel very bad for that! I don't want to completely blame it on M'lore kannada but subtitles should have been there for better & perfect understanding! And I also felt that the movie is dragged! I'm fine with movie being lengthy n slow paced but those scenes should make sense & it should be well connected with the story! So I think 10-15 mins should be chopped off!! Coming to the positive aspects I've to say the movie was brilliant & very very thoughtful! I'm very happy that we are gifted with one more brilliant writer-director Rakshit Shetty! Making is top class! We can see his work in every single frame! Story & screenplay is again too good! I can't say I loved the climax because I was able to predict it from the time when I heard 'Perspectives'in the trailer but it was very well executed! I loved all the characters & also loved the importance given to every single character! From Democracy to Rathnakka I think everyone did maximum justice to their role! The Maphia chase scene(background which looked like Sin City)was amazing, Mother-son scene was touching & Munna closing his eyes, visualising himself with Sharada on the beach, is just beautiful! Cinematography is perfect! Music was top notch! Hands down Ajaneesh Sir! :salute: Well Content & technicality wise it is one of the best movies in recent times! So if I was a critic I would have given 9or10/10! But I was a confused patron who was not able to completely understand the dialogues so I would give 7/10! So my only complaints are Movie length, No subtitles(Subs were there in the trailer, so I thought it would be here too) & the most of the dialogues being in Kundapura/M'lore Kannada!

In one of his interviews he mentioned this film which led me to watch the hindi dubbed version. What's good: 1. We often complain that why Indian films don't experiment or are not on the level of hollywood film. This film is an answer to that. The kind of storytelling in this film reminded me of Pulp fiction. 2. The film is unpredictable which is the main requirement for this kind of film. What's bad: 1. The ending is highly disappointing. It leaves you with a lot of questions. 2. The storytelling technique and the non linear format will confuse a lot of viewers. This film is for people who want to watch something different in terms of storytelling.,good film that could have been great with better ending,i watched this because rakshit shetty whom i liked avane srimannarayana one his interviews he mentioned this film which led me watch hindi dubbed version whats good 1 we often complain that why indian films dont experiment or are not level hollywood film this film is answer that kind storytelling this film reminded me pulp fiction 2 film is unpredictable which is main requirement this kind film whats bad 1 ending is highly disappointing it leaves you with lot questions 2 storytelling technique non linear format will confuse lot viewers this film is people who want watch something different terms storytelling,0.6958333333333334,0.26666666666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,Inspired from east and west yet true to the culture,"Inspired by both west and east, from Tarantino, Scarface and Sin City to Kurosawa Ulidavaru Kandanthe is still close to the culture and people of Karnataka. One of the best attempts at such a filmmaking in India. Breaking stereotypes of an actor and make a haunting hero out of him is not an easy task. Rakshit Shetty shows his genius at filmmaking with all the right components. The supposed Rashomon effect in this film was the only bit that seemed to be forced and the bit of contemplative monologue at the end which is supposed to be a part of an article!!",inspired east west yet true culture,inspired by both west east tarantino scarface sin city kurosawa ulidavaru kandanthe is still close culture people karnataka one best attempts at such filmmaking india breaking stereotypes actor make haunting hero out him is not easy task rakshit shetty shows his genius at filmmaking with all right components supposed rashomon effect this film was only bit that seemed be forced bit contemplative monologue at end which is supposed be part article,0.5741496598639456,0.15986394557823128,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
