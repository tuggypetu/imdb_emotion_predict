7.0,I Actually Sort of Liked This,"Depicts the end days of a decadent zamindar (landlord) in Bengal, and his efforts to uphold his family prestige even when faced with economic adversity.After the box office failure of ""Aparajito"", Ray desperately needed a hit film and decided to make a film based on both a popular piece of literature and a film that would incorporate Indian music. It was the first film to extensively incorporate classical Indian music and dancing.For the life of me, I haven't found an Indian film -- classic or contemporary -- that I really liked. The ""Apu trilogy"" does nothing for me, and Bollywood is a disaster. But ""Music Room"" may be the first exception... and it is precisely because of the traditional music. The cinematography is really good, but that music!",i actually sort liked this,depicts end days decadent zamindar landlord bengal his efforts uphold his family prestige even when faced with economic adversity after box office failure aparajito ray desperately needed hit film decided make film based both popular piece literature film that would incorporate indian music it was first film extensively incorporate classical indian music dancing life me i havent found indian film classic or contemporary that i really liked apu trilogy does nothing me bollywood is disaster but music room may be first exception it is precisely because traditional music cinematography is really good but that music,0.47395833333333337,0.18854166666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,The Greatest Film You Never Heard Of,"At the time I post this, only 123 people have cast a vote of any kind for The Music Room. What a shame.Satyajit Ray is one of the greatest directors of all-time and The Music Room is his masterpiece. Correction: The Music Room is a masterpiece of world cinema.How to describe this movie? In Hollywood lingo, you could call it Citizen Kane meets Black Narcissus with a big dose of King Lear. Of course, if you called it that, they'd shelve the project and spend the money on the sequel to XXX.Pity poor Biswambhar Roy, a king in a lonely castle. He's lost not only his family but his entire way of life. He is a mistake. A forgotten man waiting in his empty shell of a world.He spends the last remnants of his once vast fortune on a final, lavish musical performance in his crumbling home, a last-ditch attempt to connect to the pride and joy he once felt in his life.Not that he is innocent. He is proud and oblivious, spoiled and selfish. But surely not a bad man. Merely a displaced man. So we can cheer as he is granted one last moment of happiness and weep for him as he meets his inevitable end.How is that Satyajit Ray remains unknown even to many die-hard cineastes in the States?

7.0,Adored the musical performances,"Beautifully shot and with a great soundtrack, but a rather dreary story, which is a critique of idle members of the traditional zamindar (aristocrat) class, a celebration of traditional Indian music, and a depiction of the end of an era. In the film, a damn fool of a middle-aged man (Chhabi Biswas) squanders his family fortune as the portraits of four generations of his ancestors look on in his music room, where he hosts large groups of friends to lavish performances despite his dwindling funds. He likes lolling about, smoking a hookah and drinking cognac, and it's clear he likes the music as well, but what he likes even more is the prestige and status that he has, and lording it over one of his neighbors he views (and treats) as inferior.I loved seeing and hearing the various musical instruments, the wonderful vocalizations, and the performances - especially that dancer towards the end - they were something special. The rest of it had meaning, but was less compelling for me, despite all the craft and attention to detail director Satyajit Ray put in. It would have been more interesting had we had gotten more depth and insight into some of the other characters.

,A study of the nature of privilege in society -- PLOT DISCUSSED,"WARNING -- PLOT DISCUSSED -- The jalsaghar is a great music hall in the mansion of the main character, a scion of a great landowning family. It's almost all he has left of the Ray family's legacy. Over the years his land has been slowly eaten away by one of the great rivers of Bengal. But he still has the trappings of aristocracy -- his retainers address him as ""Hujur"" (""my lord""); even his wealthy neighbour, Ganguli, addresses him as ""Thakurda"" (""(paternal) grandfather""). He lives only for his jalsaghar, where he can recreate his family's past glory and where he can still win a game of one-upmanship against Ganguli. Meanwhile, Ganguli is up-and-coming. He's a businessman, the new aristocrat, land-poor but cash-rich. He gets electric lights for his house; he gets a motor car, the first in the region. Satyajit Ray, the legendary director, masterfully contrasts the hollowness of the old aristocrat with the shallowness of the new aristocrat. How is privilege earned? Who is due respect? What is worthy of pride? What will pride get you? These are the questions that are explored with subtlety. The focus of the film is the performance of Chhabi Biswas, a legend of the Calcutta stage. (An interesting aside -- ""chhabi"" is Bengali for ""picture"" and ""biswas"" means ""belief."") He fit the mold of a classic actor -- temperamental, undependable, a raging alcoholic, a master. Almost every scene is wholly dependent on him, as he preens and boasts and rages and pines away for lost glory. When you read that Biswas was in real life completely tone-deaf, his creation of a music-lover is an astonishing accomplishment, both by him and by Satyajit Ray.",study nature privilege society plot discussed,warning plot discussed jalsaghar is great music hall mansion main character scion great landowning family its almost all he has left ray familys legacy over years his land has been slowly eaten away by one great rivers bengal but he still has trappings aristocracy his retainers address him as hujur my lord even his wealthy neighbour ganguli addresses him as thakurda paternal grandfather he lives only his jalsaghar where he can recreate his familys past glory where he can still win game one upmanship against ganguli meanwhile ganguli is up coming hes businessman new aristocrat land poor but cash rich he gets electric lights his house he gets motor car first region satyajit ray legendary director masterfully contrasts hollowness old aristocrat with shallowness new aristocrat how is privilege earned who is due respect what is worthy pride what will pride get you these are questions that are explored with subtlety focus film is performance chhabi biswas legend calcutta stage interesting aside chhabi is bengali picture biswas means belief he fit mold classic actor temperamental undependable raging alcoholic master almost every scene is wholly dependent him as he preens boasts rages pines away lost glory when you read that biswas was real life completely tone deaf his creation music lover is astonishing accomplishment both by him by satyajit ray,0.5524080086580087,0.2621212121212121,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Indian master filmmaker Satyajit Ray's profoundly evocative film that pays homage to classical Indian art forms,"Jalsaghar (aka ""The Music Room"") is a 1958 drama film directed by master Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Based on a short story of the same name by Bangla writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Jalsaghar presents the tale of decline of a feudal lord in the pre-independence India. Jalsaghar stars veteran Bangla actor Chhabi Biswas in the lead role of Huzur Biswambhar Roy. Huzur is the last of Zamindars—a dying breed of landlords who once formed the very basis of the Indian Feudal System. Huzur's glory days are over but his sense of superiority remains intact. He lives in the past neither acknowledging the present nor anticipating the future. He continues to be a servant of his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty.Jalsaghar was Ray's fourth film which he made after the commercial failure of Aparijito—the finally film in Ray's much acclaimed ""The Apu Trilogy"". Ray had initially thought of making a commercial film, based on some popular work of literature, which would incorporate popular Indian music. But, what eventually transpired was something that was totally different. It was more of an art-house work than a commercial movie that Ray had initially intended to make. The movie failed to do well at the Indian box-office. But, it received both critical and financial success in Europe and the US and helped Ray earn international reputation. The music of Jalsaghar was written by the Indian composer and sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan who was encouraged by Ray to compose musical pieces that would gel well with the movie's dark and gloomy tone. The movie's melancholic musical composition and sombre art direction—the sublime use of mirrors, chandeliers, etc.—gives it a Gothic feel in the vein of American Film-Noir films of the '40s and '50s.In Jalsaghar, Ray highlights the perpetual conflict of tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining the Indian caste system. Jalsaghar is a sublime work of cinema that, having stood the test of time for over five decades, continues to inspire the budding filmmakers as well as enthrall the audiences worldwide. Jalsaghar is widely regarded as Satyajit Ray's most evocative film. It serves to be a great means of getting acquainted with Ray's oeuvre. Jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also the most accessible of Ray's films, especially for foreign viewers. Jalsaghar is not a movie that would woo a casual viewer. Restless viewers should best stay away from it. But, a patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie owing to its slow pace may pose impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Jalsaghar is a deeply thought-provoking work of cinema that demands multiple viewings. The movie is a must watch for every student of cinema. Jalsaghar.is an essential watch for all Satyajit Ray fans as well as those who understand and appreciate intelligent cinema. 10/10A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review indian master filmmaker satyajit rays profoundly evocative film that pays homage classical indian art forms,jalsaghar aka music room is 1958 drama film directed by master indian filmmaker satyajit ray based short story same name by bangla writer tarashankar bandopadhyay jalsaghar presents tale decline feudal lord pre independence india jalsaghar stars veteran bangla actor chhabi biswas lead role huzur biswambhar roy huzur is last zamindars dying breed landlords who once formed very basis indian feudal system huzurs glory days are over but his sense superiority remains intact he lives past neither acknowledging present nor anticipating future he continues be servant his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty jalsaghar was rays fourth film which he made after commercial failure aparijito finally film rays much acclaimed apu trilogy ray had initially thought making commercial film based some popular work literature which would incorporate popular indian music but what eventually transpired was something that was totally different it was more art house work than commercial movie that ray had initially intended make movie failed do well at indian box office but it received both critical financial success europe us helped ray earn international reputation music jalsaghar was written by indian composer sitar maestro ustad vilayat ali khan who was encouraged by ray compose musical pieces that would gel well with movies dark gloomy tone movies melancholic musical composition sombre art direction sublime use mirrors chandeliers etc gives it gothic feel vein american film noir films 40s 50s jalsaghar ray highlights perpetual conflict tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining indian caste system jalsaghar is sublime work cinema that having stood test time over five decades continues inspire budding filmmakers as well as enthrall audiences worldwide jalsaghar is widely regarded as satyajit rays most evocative film it serves be great means getting acquainted with rays oeuvre jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also most accessible rays films especially foreign viewers jalsaghar is not movie that would woo casual viewer restless viewers should best stay away it but patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded movie owing its slow pace may pose impediments uninitiated viewer jalsaghar is deeply thought provoking work cinema that demands multiple viewings movie is must watch every student cinema jalsaghar is essential watch all satyajit ray fans as well as those who understand appreciate intelligent cinema 10 10a more depth review film can be read at,0.31616666666666676,0.10183333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Fire And Light,"For me the most rewarding films (or any art for that matter) are those that are acutely mindful of life and death and themselves in the midst of it. In the words of Harold Bloom, ""We all fear loneliness, madness, dying. Shakespeare and Walt Whitman, Leopardi and Hart Crane will not cure those fears. And yet these poets bring us fire and light."" The same with all art, much of which this film epitomizes.""The Music Room"", as it is known in English, is as much about the power of cinema as it is about that of music. It is as much about life as it is about death, both elliptically consummate by reason of each other: art as a life of inspiration, inspiration as regained strength. Art as addiction, addiction as loneliness, loneliness as death.The ending is one of the most filmically mesmerizing moments I know of. Light and shadow, derangement and perspicuity, again life and death. And as for the Blu-ray (Region A) released by the Criterion Collection in 2011, it's phenomenal to the hilt, a cultural act in itself, in my books among their most enduring and best releases so far (perhaps only the complete Jean Vigo compares).",fire light,me most rewarding films or any art that matter are those that are acutely mindful life death themselves midst it words harold bloom we all fear loneliness madness dying shakespeare walt whitman leopardi hart crane will not cure those fears yet these poets bring us fire light same with all art much which this film epitomizes music room as it is known english is as much about power cinema as it is about that music it is as much about life as it is about death both elliptically consummate by reason each other art as life inspiration inspiration as regained strength art as addiction addiction as loneliness loneliness as death ending is one most filmically mesmerizing moments i know light shadow derangement perspicuity again life death as blu ray region released by criterion collection 2011 its phenomenal hilt cultural act itself my books among their most enduring best releases so far perhaps only complete jean vigo compares,0.5272727272727273,0.33295454545454545,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.5}"
8.0,A subtle look at ageing + the pre-Independence Indian caste system,"This was seen in the monthly Foreign Film Series in a society for retired university (KU) peeps. This 1958 story is remarkably subtle, about the advancing age and declining wealth of a higher caste Indian man, a Zamindar (landlord), whose income from his inherited lands is dropping from the previous levels of his wealthy ancestors because increasing river floods have lessened his rentable property and income. He's unable to adjust his manner of living to either that change or simultaneous changes in the Indian economy that lead to new economic benefits and social mobility for many in lower castes. He's especially irritated at his nouveau riche lower caste new next door neighbor whose income comes from money lending rather than through inherited property and wealth; he engages in expensive rival concerts which he cannot truly afford and these leave him even poorer. Through two extended flashbacks we learn he had been married and had a son (16? 18?); both wife and son died together on a trip. So he's alone for many years. While Indian music is his primary comfort (played in ""the music room"" of his palatial home), he also begins to use it as his primary club against his ""upstart"" neighbor. As he ages we see his memory decline, e.g., asking one of his two remaining servants, ""What month is this?"" before he presents one last concert for invited guests (and to belittle his rival, his lower caste neighbor, an included guest) before he then embarks on an activity which leads to his death. Great examples of Indian music (but the closed captions on the DVD we saw had white type/lettering which sometimes was not very legible against its background). The movie also very subtly raises the question -- to what extent is this person (one's self or relative or friend) going through parallel sequences in the getting old process?",subtle look at ageing pre independence indian caste system,this was seen monthly foreign film series society retired university ku peeps this 1958 story is remarkably subtle about advancing age declining wealth higher caste indian man zamindar landlord whose income his inherited lands is dropping previous levels his wealthy ancestors because increasing river floods have lessened his rentable property income hes unable adjust his manner living either that change or simultaneous changes indian economy that lead new economic benefits social mobility many lower castes hes especially irritated at his nouveau riche lower caste new next door neighbor whose income comes money lending rather than through inherited property wealth he engages expensive rival concerts which he cannot truly afford these leave him even poorer through two extended flashbacks we learn he had been married had son 16 18 both wife son died together trip so hes alone many years while indian music is his primary comfort played music room his palatial home he also begins use it as his primary club against his upstart neighbor as he ages we see his memory decline e g asking one his two remaining servants what month is this before he presents one last concert invited guests belittle his rival his lower caste neighbor included guest before he then embarks activity which leads his death great examples indian music but closed captions dvd we saw had white type lettering which sometimes was not very legible against its background movie also very subtly raises question what extent is this person ones self or relative or friend going through parallel sequences getting old process,0.38020104895104895,0.05848110223110224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.65}"

10.0,Treasure this movie; it's a masterpiece,"Satyajit Ray made ""The Music Room"" in 1958, a few years after ""Pather Panchali"" and before completing the rest of the Apu Trilogy and like them, it too is a masterpiece. It's about the sin of pride and how it destroys the supercilious old landlord Biswambhar Roy, (a magnificent performance from Chhabi Biswas), whose idea of 'keeping up with the Jones'' is to squander all he has on musical evenings that will outdo those of his nearest neighbour. It's also about the transformative affect of music, of which there is much and all of it wonderful. Although you might say it destroys him Biswambhar is also redeemed by opening up his music room for one last great concert.This is also one of the cinema's greatest studies of obsession and of loneliness.

10.0,"Mesmerized, entertained, and provoked","The film is a masterpiece, a definite 10. As with the Apu trilogy, I am mesmerized and absorbed by the pacing and drama of the film. Even though the film uses music, its appreciation, and its status as the vehicle for its themes, there is no (or very little?) background music for the spoken portions of the film. This provides not only realism, but sets off the intense and magnificent performance of the protagonist. There is also a great deal of entertainment in this film: the music performances are excellent. I wonder if Ray found the best musicians of the region and gave them roles as performers in the musical soirees: performers playing performers. I have the sense that there is very little artifice in the cinematography. That is, I feel that the filming techniques were not highly sophisticated. But the eye, the light, the composition are almost perfect. I think that the other commenter (the only other one!) stated the themes quite well for me.

There is something savage, auto-destructive but also the purest in form about the landlord's passion for music and childish vanity in front of his peers, which made me ponder over the place of music in our society long after the credits end. In the age of MTV and MP3, we are used to the idea of carrying routinely our favorite songs everywhere from streets to bathroom, and it's pity that we hardly experience anymore the authentic ambiance of intimate music gathering such as miraculously acted and filmed in Jalsaghar. Music in other era and other place must have been high point and extra-ordinary moment of community life, source of the spiritual inspiration for civil life as well as its destruction.

,Bollywood movie?,"Good heavens! This is about as far from Bollywood movies (cheesy musicals) as one could get. Jalsaghar is a poignant rendering of social transition at the personal level -- the indigent aristocrat whose delusive and self-destructive obsession with bringing his music room back to life shields him from the reality of his family's economic and social collapse, and indeed hastens it; the showy nouveau-riche neighbor who embodies the rise of a new social order based on economic achievement rather than aristocratic roots and inherited wealth.

,Satyajit Ray's Most Underrated Gem,"After leaving an indelible mark on the global stage with his pure & poetic The Apu Trilogy, Satyajit Ray brings his restraint touch & deft eye to the more conventional narrative structure in Indian cinema and subverts it from inside out. Jalsaghar aka The Music Room isn't devoid of the musical & dance segments that are a given in most Indian films but instead of serving as mere entertaining interludes, they play an integral role in the plot.Written, produced & directed by Ray, the film concerns a feudal landlord's passion for music & quest for social respect in the rapidly changing India and his refusal to change with the times that leads to his undoing. Through his dwindling fortunes & decadent lifestyle, Ray attempts to illustrate the contrast between old & new India and the fate that awaits those who cling on to their obsolete past & are unwilling to accept or acknowledge the modern society.Our protagonist isn't shown in a negative light however. Instead, the film observes his all-consuming obsession with music, pride in his social prestige & envy for his next-door neighbour's increasing fortunes, and how they contribute to his downfall. Chabbi Biswas' performance is nearly flawless, and he brings the ill-fated landlord to life with all his flaws & virtues in tact. Also adding to the experience are opulent set pieces, beautiful camerawork, and neat use of classical Indian music & dance.Overall, Jalsaghar presents the Bengali filmmaker tightening his grasp around his craft, and is one of his most impressive directorial efforts.

8.0,"Great, little, effective Indian drama.","Besides of all of the well known, familiar, typical Bollywood type of movies, India was also capable of delivering some genuinely good, little movies.What makes this movie a good one is that it's being a rather simplistic and little drama, that actually works out more effective because of that. It focuses mainly one main character, that is slowly starting to realize he is loosing everything because of the changing times. It's a movie that works on a dramatic level with its main character and makes all of his emotions and feeling come across very realistic and almost sensible.Of course the movie is not as stylized and perfectly put together as a big Hollywood movie from around the same time period but nevertheless ""Jalsaghar"" still is one fine put together movie, by director Satyajit Ray. You can really tell he is a director that progressed over the years, as he gained more and more experience, recognition and money to work with.Really visually this movie is being great. I really liked the black & white cinematography by Subrata Mitra, who started out his movie career along with Satyajit Ray.

Elegant cinematography, a perfect location and an elaborate set, and three amazing musical performances, each more electrifying than the last. I could watch that final dance over and over again.

7.0,My brief review of the film,"There is quite a bit that I admired about this Indian film, however there are also a number of aspects that, whether it be for objective or subjective reasons, I did not particularly about it. On the positive side, what the film has to say about excessive pride is interesting, as are the motivations of the main character. The photography is fascinating, not only because of the shots with mirrors but the general panning is effective too, capturing well the excellent sets. Music is an element that I found applied very effectively at times to establish the mood, however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it. The high contrast prints are good for certain scenes, such as the fireworks, but the feel they generally provide is graininess, which makes the film rather uncomfortable to look at. One of the aspects that I did not like at all was the way in which the story was told. The film is mostly collection of images threaded together, rather than a series of connecting events. Some scenes, such as the main character's son riding an elephant or watching a painter, tend to disturb the flow of the plot. Another point is the supporting characters, all of whom are either silly or just lightly developed, but at least there is a good character at the center of the plot. It might also be a bit hard for those not familiar with Indian culture to decipher certain events. The last thing that I would complain about is however the final few minutes of the film in which performance is treated as more important than the character's reactions. So overall, what can I say? Some seem to believe that this is a masterpiece, and maybe it is, but I myself simply cannot agree with that charge. I do however think that it is a good piece of cinema, and I agree that it is deserving of respect. Even if one may not enjoy it, there is enough to be appreciated here to make it a worthwhile watch.",my brief review film,there is quite bit that i admired about this indian film however there are also number aspects that whether it be objective or subjective reasons i did not particularly about it positive side what film has say about excessive pride is interesting as are motivations main character photography is fascinating not only because shots with mirrors but general panning is effective too capturing well excellent sets music is element that i found applied very effectively at times establish mood however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it high contrast prints are good certain scenes such as fireworks but feel they generally provide is graininess which makes film rather uncomfortable look at one aspects that i did not like at all was way which story was told film is mostly collection images threaded together rather than series connecting events some scenes such as main characters son riding elephant or watching painter tend disturb flow plot another point is supporting characters all whom are either silly or just lightly developed but at least there is good character at center plot it might also be bit hard those not familiar with indian culture decipher certain events last thing that i would complain about is however final few minutes film which performance is treated as more important than characters reactions so overall what can i say some seem believe that this is masterpiece maybe it is but i myself simply cannot agree with that charge i do however think that it is good piece cinema i agree that it is deserving respect even if one may not enjoy it there is enough be appreciated here make it worthwhile watch,0.5335557704706643,0.1415782444505849,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"

6.0,Pride & prejudice of a zamindar,"The premise of the movie is quite good. It unfolds like a greek tragedy, wherein you know what's coming and still you hitch a ride in the protagonist's car (or elephant in this case!). As with many of Shakespeare's characters, his own flaw i.e, his excessive pride leads to his ultimate destruction.This is the story of an aging and lonely zamindar who tries to live the final days of his life with as much splendor as possible. He has seen a lot of ups and downs in his life (in fact more than most people). Being blue-blooded, it seems that all he's ever been trained for is ruling people and having expensive tastes. Thus, once the zamindari system gets abolished, he has nothing to turn to. By today's standards, he's quite a difficult man to live with. He's prejudiced towards the capitalist neighbor who has made his own fortune through his own hard work. He doesn't really pay any attention to his wife's advice that he should oversee his lands better and not squander his remaining wealth throwing lavish parties. He has so much pride that just in order to upstage his neighbor, he organizes a lavish celebration impromptu, and enjoys the neighbor's discomfort. Unfortunately, the fates decide that he has run out of luck and he ends up paying a very heavy price for his pride. While crossing the river to attend the celebration, the boat carrying his wife and son gets caught in the storm and they perish. In the years since, he's been reduced to the shell of a man he once was. But even so his prejudice against the working class neighbor and his pride about his noble lineage are still present. Using the very last of his resources, much to the chagrin of his ever suffering retainers, he holds a last music and dance performance at his palace. He again bests his neighbor by paying more to the artists. Afterwards, he realizes he has totally and utterly lost everything. Then, in a fit of his old arrogance and exuberance, he decides to ride his horse. However, muddle-headed that he is, he ends up spooking the horse and is eventually thrown off it. Oh Well, at least he had a royal end!What I didn't like about this movie was its extremely sad mood, which clung to every scene of the film. Even the moments which were supposed to have been celebrations and parties did not uplift my mood. I realize that this is the story of a sad and lonely man, but there were moments when he was happy too. I only wish his happiness, howsoever ephemeral, had sucked me in just like his sadness did.

9.0,Monumental masterpiece of Satyajit Ray,"""The Newsweek"" magazine once asked Henri Cartier-Bresson , the great French photographer considered to be the father of modern photojournalism , during an interview to name his favorite film. Bresson replied -"" Satyajit's Ray's 'The Music Rom'. An old film but one that made an indelible impression on my mind.""""The Music Room"" is a film that led to greatness by Satyajit Ray's devotion to a single mood: elegiac. Ray isn't alone in sculpting this great piece. The acting by Chabi Biswas as the crumbling aristocrat Huzar Biswambhar Roy, cinematography by Subrata Mitra and music direction by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely. The film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee's short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation, Satyajit Ray gave his own spin to the film, making music, rather being an interlude, an integral part of the screenplay. In ""Jalsaghar or The Music Room"", Ray examines the age-old conflict between the landed nobility and the rich without pedigree, between those who dwell in the past and those who embrace the future. Using the same meticulous, unforced style employed in his celebrated ""Apu Trilogy"",Ray explores how one man's need for a pampered, sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin. It's a fascinating snapshot of Indian culture in the 1930s, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth.Set in the 1930's with the emerging nouveau rich, Roy is the last in a long of rich patriarchs, stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till the end to his refined means. Roy lives in a mansion in the middle of a desert, a symbol of his isolation from encroaching destitute. Roy is frequently filmed alone, as are other subjects (his dog, horse, elephant). The film begins with the elderly Zamindar (landlord) sitting alone, staring blankly in his back garden overlooking a once proud space. He is served by one of his two humble and loyal servants. The story flashes back some 15-20 years to a more glorious time when the younger Huzar, with his young son Khoka and wife Padma (the realist/pragmatist to Huzar's idealism) was the class of his region, hosting luxurious concerts in his home. Huzar's centerpiece, his ivory tower and final refuge from the external reality/realism is the titular music room. The room reflects the Huzar's pride, his heirloom, his inner soul. Ray draws us in spatially, in concentric circles, from the outer oasis, to the backyard pool/yard, to the mansion, to the music room and further yet, the music room's stage. Likewise Mitra's camera often, and nearly always in relation to Roy, dollies inwards toward Roy. The movement not only serves to honor the character and make us feel more empathy toward him, but counterpoints the film's maze-like construction. Chhabi Biswas gives a superb performance as the crumbling feudal landlord. Subrata Mitra's cinematography and music by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely to create the atmosphere. "" Music Room"" is a very visual film -- there are numerous ingenious shots (the insect dying in the glass, the bliss of an elephant being bathed in the river, the joy of the servants reopening the dusty music room, the way the chandelier gets reflected in the wine glass revealing Huzur's states of mind , and the last scene where a spider crawls up the leg of his own portrait) and a stirring dance sequence. The camera movements reinforce the character and highlight film's maze-like construction and Roy being trapped in his past. ""The Music Room"" remains as a majestic masterpiece of a man's monumental effort to cling to his illustrious legacy and hold his head high when his feet wither.",monumental masterpiece satyajit ray,newsweek magazine once asked henri cartier bresson great french photographer considered be father modern photojournalism during interview name his favorite film bresson replied satyajits rays music rom old film but one that made indelible impression my mind music room is film that led greatness by satyajit rays devotion single mood elegiac ray isnt alone sculpting this great piece acting by chabi biswas as crumbling aristocrat huzar biswambhar roy cinematography by subrata mitra music direction by ustad vilayat khan all contribute immensely film adaptation tarashankar banerjees short story but instead creating exact adaptation satyajit ray gave his own spin film making music rather being interlude integral part screenplay jalsaghar or music room ray examines age old conflict between landed nobility rich without pedigree between those who dwell past those who embrace future using same meticulous unforced style employed his celebrated apu trilogy ray explores how one mans need pampered sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin its fascinating snapshot indian culture 1930s cautionary tale about dangers inflated opinion self worth set 1930s with emerging nouveau rich roy is last long rich patriarchs stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till end his refined means roy lives mansion middle desert symbol his isolation encroaching destitute roy is frequently filmed alone as are other subjects his dog horse elephant film begins with elderly zamindar landlord sitting alone staring blankly his back garden overlooking once proud space he is served by one his two humble loyal servants story flashes back some 15 20 years more glorious time when younger huzar with his young son khoka wife padma realist pragmatist huzars idealism was class his region hosting luxurious concerts his home huzars centerpiece his ivory tower final refuge external reality realism is titular music room room reflects huzars pride his heirloom his inner soul ray draws us spatially concentric circles outer oasis backyard pool yard mansion music room further yet music rooms stage likewise mitras camera often nearly always relation roy dollies inwards toward roy movement not only serves honor character make us feel more empathy toward him but counterpoints films maze like construction chhabi biswas gives superb performance as crumbling feudal landlord subrata mitras cinematography music by ustad vilayat khan all contribute immensely create atmosphere music room is very visual film there are numerous ingenious shots insect dying glass bliss elephant being bathed river joy servants reopening dusty music room way chandelier gets reflected wine glass revealing huzurs states mind last scene where spider crawls up leg his own portrait stirring dance sequence camera movements reinforce character highlight films maze like construction roy being trapped his past music room remains as majestic masterpiece mans monumental effort cling his illustrious legacy hold his head high when his feet wither,0.4388178780284044,0.1749456975772765,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,India's 'Citizen Kane',"No review could ever do this incredible film full justice. This is not Satyajit Ray's most famous work but it's probably his most satisfying. The cinematography, shadow & light play alongside the film's music combine to perfectly highlight the moments of elation and ultimate downfall of its lead character. Chhabi Biswas is perfectly cast as the ageing zamindar oblivious to his world crumbling down around him. Reportedly panned by some critics on its release in India, the film went on to find success in Western Europe. Now after years of having to contend with grainy transfers on DVD, New York's Criterion Collection have released a pristine remastered edition that highlights every single beautifully shot frame. The cleaned up audio does wonders for the incredible music & classical dance scenes, which feature a guest appearance from Ustad Waheed Khan.

8.0,"An immortal melody of sacrifice, pride and arrogance by Legend Satyajit Ray.","Jalsaghar/The Music Room (1958) : Brief Review -An immortal melody of sacrifice, pride and arrogance by Legend Satyajit Ray. Jalsaghar directed by Satyajit Ray was his first film having long musicals, in which, the master director has successfully compiled his artistic ingredients. The film is about a Zamindar (Landlord) who is a big fan of Music and Dance from the days when landlords used to host musical treats inviting other big people of the village. Soon after natural disasters and government's orders he loses everything he had in life but the Music keeps haunting him. In this very much simple narrative Satyajit Ray shows his class by putting slow motion and long takes frames. Even with the runtime of around 98 Minutes, Jalsaghar hardly has dialogues for 30 odd minutes. Most of the narrative is filled with Classical music and folk dance yet all the cinematic portion is highly watchable. The main concept breaks the silene somewhere in the middle of narrative and then for next 40-50 minutes we are into watching a cinematic and artist gem. Despite less dialogues Jalsaghar throws poignant message by using references of ancestors pride, blood , arrogance and regret. Chhabi Biswas grabs almost all the runtime hence you don't get to look at any other actor's performance. He just doesn't let you think about others, he captures the essence and realism of the character so well. Yet, the supporting cast looks fine with rare presence. Jalsaghar has some great artistic moments to look for. Watch out for the last 20 minutes that how the music, tones and lights are used to explore the subtle meaning of the content. This was way ahead of time for Indian Cinema and may be that's why the reception was poor when the film released in 1958 but later it grown a Cult status.

4.0,The Music Room (Jalsaghar),"I found this Indian Bengali film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I knew nothing about prior to reading about it, but I was hoping for something worthwhile, directed by Satyajit Ray (Pather Panchali, Aparajito, The World of Apu). Basically Bishwambar Roy (Chhabi Biswas) is a wealthy landowner, or zamindar, who lives in a palace, the decadent manner of his ancestors, with his wife and son and his many servants. His biggest passion, which his wife thinks of as an addiction, is music, and he spends a great deal of his fortune and time throwing lavish parties for the locals to attend concerts to be held in his magnificent music room. His wealth however is dwindling, his lands are being eroded by the local rivers, and he pays for a concert, arranged for his son's coming of age, by selling some of the family jewels. His neighbour Ganguli (Gangapada Basu) invites him to a party at his house, but Roy decides to organise a party of his own, the same day, and it costs him the last of his jewels. Roy's wife Mahamaya (Padma Devi) and son Khoka (Pinaki Sen Gupta) are killed in a storm, he becomes reclusive, and closes his music room. Many years later, he decides to hold one final concert, spending the last of his money, and again to spite and outdo Ganguli. It ends in tragedy when he rides his horse at speed on the beach, deliberately galloping towards a wrecked ship, the horse is panicked, and he falls to the floor, injuring himself, as he bleeds he dies. To be completely honest, I did not follow the full story as it was playing out, concentrating on the subtitles made this difficult I suppose, but I did enjoy the great music and dance routines that went on in the music room, all in all it a reasonable drama.
