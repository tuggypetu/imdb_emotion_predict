8.0,I enjoyed this movie,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.",i enjoyed this movie,baahubali 2 conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with somewhat weak storyline but film is visually dazzling behold with great costumes interiors phenomenal set pieces special effects colorful exciting it is also exhilarating though silly its action it thus succeeds as pretty good conclusion this story but above all else both these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic scope world building that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters,0.5619727891156462,0.3586734693877551,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.24}"

8.0,The epic epic continues,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond).",epic epic continues,baahubali 2 2017 continues epic silliness first baahubali 2015 with even bigger battles dance scenes menacing looks muscles surprise reveal at end part 1 is explained circle is completed with transition hero role amarendra baahubali himself his son mahendra baahubali both played by prabhas who as infant was saved his murderous uncle by queen as seen prologue first film like its antecedent this film swings wildly almost slapstick comedy e g baahubali passes himself as blockhead get near princess devasena bloody if cartoonish violence including multiple impalements immolations decapitations buzz saw chariot is back now equipped with sort volley gun arrow launcher but tactical highlight is palm tree catapults that launch teams soldiers who use their shields form armored balls mid air even wile e coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable but laws physics are outrageously ignored throughout most action scenes this is just particularly egregious but fun example not surprisingly most film is cgi very good places but times looking more like video game than epic live action film as with i watched subtitled version so cant really comment acting but all leads still look sound part anushka shettys devasena sathyarajs kattappa are particularly good there were few weak scenes weird flying ship dream sequence comes mind that imo kept being as overall as good as but all all over top epic fantasy with perhaps somewhat different aesthetic than western audiences are used picture aragorn arwen backed by dancing elves breaking into love duet middle council elrond,0.40012499999999995,0.05970075757575758,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6.0,Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film. Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is. Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance. In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?",baahubali 2 is shallow yet satisfying end saga,so finally we get see why katappa killed baahubali this was question that was everyones tongue baahubali 2 answers question but it may or may not satisfy you fact there are many twists this film baahubali beginning was good experience it was milestone terms vfx story line though clich d was good background score was powerful cinematography was beautiful baahubali 2 is more what you saw baahubali but it fades comparison yes fight scenes are larger scale than first one you may have guessed that trailer yes there is fight scene that we all have been waiting see yes there are some scenes that would give you adrenaline rush but midst all this chaos you feel that something is not right something is missing you dont know what it is baahubali beginning was first film that made us believe that we were able produce such films that film single handedly intrigued us maybe that is reason baahubali 2 does not feel like original work anymore it feels like copy paste original without any soul screenwriters try make it work by giving us back stories but some part it does not fit acting performances are okay with most good performances coming prabhas duggubati anushka some actors are over top just like first film it is also longer than baahubali which is treat fans i mean they deserve it after all they have been waiting two years see it big screen serious movie goers though it is big let down since most film could have been edited make it shorter point most time is wasted same things that were problems with baahubali unnecessary romance songs i know we indians are used watching songs but gods sake stop doing it songs do not add any value story they are cringe worthy you are making film that is supposed be compared with hollywoods behemoths then you add dance sequence it thats utterly stupid it seems me that this film didnt really need sequel but everyone wanted know why katappa killed baahubali it could have worked as single film without all dance romance end i would like say that baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting they will definitely be happy with package its nothing exceptional though so some moviegoers might be disappointed but no matter how well film is made or how many shortcomings it has i would still request you go watch this film you need support it because if it isnt hit no one future will think about taking risks well have watch same old bollywood films rest our lives can you tolerate another happy new year or hamshakals,0.4915747446997447,0.16184475246975247,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!",epic conclusion bahubali saga,its nearly perfect film it has some bad cringe moments cheap special effects but these things cant take u away good parts director has vision thing that lacks most indian filmmakers he executed it perfectly during first quarter film can be boring some people they stretched here little bit as bahubali goes find his love therere plenty crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps one bull another these things can make u laugh climax wall jump too there are plenty dramatic emotionally impactful goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there that final fight between two is well choreographed shot conclusion is satisfying,0.6110714285714285,0.13681547619047624,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis. The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity.",mediocre product made by mediocre artists,i watched this only because my wife insisted that i accompany her having hated part 1 i thought i would calm myself down with few beers before embarking what would be assault everything that i considered be important film be considered classic alas i live pious state kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited hence i was unable procure any alcohol particular day i braced myself what would almost certainly be torturous experience i was treated mediocre special effects over top action scenes which even little boy would find hard take seriously actor prabhas was insufferable his face expressions were grotesque he phones it most time anushka shetty was very pretty but her performance during action scenes made me chuckle another reviewer compared chariot scene famous chariot racing sequence benhur but i was reminded chariot chase sequence mervyn leroys quo vadis film did feature some grand vistas sets like elephant statue that is carved out rock but still attached rocky mountain this is when prabhas anushka first arrive magarmazhi boat kali statue with fire burning out various parts when dagubatti nasser are plotting prabhas murder was also remarkable dagubattis coronation scene had lot potential all these things indicated me that at least some people with imagination were working behind scenes but everything about film is shoddy rajamouli director must take blame shoddiness once again indian public has elevated mediocre product made by bunch mediocre artists into worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1 500 crores some may think that this is great achievement but it is not we as nation are promoting spreading mediocrity,0.614392179636082,-0.03053487840073206,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.27}"
5.0,Very conveniently gets concluded,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums.

1.0,The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt.",excessively generic pool horrible film tropes,i must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us firstly we like overpriced but useless things case point our obsession with mercedes half crowd that has seen this movie has done so see extravagance secondly we must appreciate promotions while we see obvious success prabhas promoting this movie using tropicana we are left wonder whether we should have rajnikanth promote heinz ketchup his next this movie is rife with references all unintentional i hope chariot scene that has technological advancement ben hur parody 70s slow motion sequences that look like leftovers puke worthy drama 300 round it all up script that is reminiscent lion king trilogy archetypal this movie is bane indian cinema it is deeply saddening see indian cinema industry fall so hard its back maybe this movie should be given us film students as crash course what not do when directing movie despite all intents purposes you will leave theater not comprehending general lack two half hours you spent there only thing this film reminds us is that tale king solomon spider rajamouli is spider who will not give up despite his many failures crowd that watches this movie hails him as god just ask yourself this how dare you put him pedestal that worships people like orson welles frank coppola charles chaplin even great indian guru dutt,0.3677536231884058,-0.021376811594202908,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"
4.0,Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic. Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort. The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me.",very predictable not worth hype,be frank i was not so keen watch movie first day but as my friends comments reviews were pouring i decided catch matin e show today first day as i have anticipated movie is not up mark at least surely not as much as it flashed all around there are good movies there are great movies but good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short expectations become average movies thats what exactly happened here movie started with stories flashback we see bahubali moving out mahismati with katappa ending up finding his lady love as usual romance entering bhallaldev playing all dirty politics keep his step brother away throne big brother happily left his deserving throne marry his lady love then more conspiracy by jealous brother whos now king at last successful killing bahubali prison his wife here its continuation first part acting is good at least by all central characters especially sathyaraj who had lions share screen presence anushka prabhas did good job rana stood out though had limited opportunities actually he was only one who looked authentic now biggest part movie why katappa killed bahubali we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back right after first part hint same reason why bhishma though fond pandavas supported them fought against them there was no surprise at all actually we have seen many such movies honest upright warrior prince about be king badass villain whos also his brother conspire against him get him killed then his son comes back revenge very clich d effort graphics are so so though i am not very convinced movie almost looks like animation movie i really felt director should have concentrated story more at least there should be some twists turns there could be breakout villain but it was very plain simple end lighter note theres hidden lesson married men it shows what happens when you let your mom wife gets into fight you end up supporting your wife but then if support your mom you are mommas boy if you support your wife you are wifes puppet horn dilemma course d dconclusion one time watch as per me,0.39225146198830396,0.14577276524644944,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__",epic conclusion celebrated war drama,baahubali beginning released back 2015 was pan indian blockbuster that raised standards technical brilliance indian films with stellar war sequences awe inspiring art direction making its bollywood counter parts run their money make sequel techncially speaking prequel that matches grandeur brilliance magnum opus baahubali might look irrealizable but not master craftsman like s s rajamouli who has come up with stunning piece cinema that lives upto hype all means even outshines original as far as depth story line smooth narrative is concerned well made sequel is without doubt better movie altogether with thoroughly convincing hearty story line that engages viewers by inviting them be part mahishmati kingdom its run time 168 minutes more befitting finale this epic is doubtful first half by itself makes it paisa vasool affair normal movie going audience love track between tammana prabhas was let back first part best thing about conclusion is that it takes care leaving aside such avoidable sub plots tries concentrate inner conflicts emotions lead characters making it hearty affair viewers first half movie was first rate this matter more entertaining comparison with nevertheless very good second half way k v vijayendra prasad handled answer million dollar question why kattappa killed baahubali was brilliant overflow emotions surrounding that question was delight watch made remarkable by brilliant lead performances courtroom sequences particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional highlight narrative notable lame point movie was patchy graphics few sequences which is too sub standard considering mammoth budget presentation climax portions were good but not as riveting as rest narrative audience response was enormous critical sequences cheers whistles ensure that movie is going make it big with its impressive wom among families youth alike absence breath taking war sequence like kalaleya fight first part didnt make any impact thanks brilliant penning story line by k v vijayendra prasad prabhas gave convincing performance as both amarendra bahubali mahendra baahubali with required zeal intensity that characters demanded anushka was delight watch stamped her authority as lady action superstar indian cinema remya krishnans act was powerful rana daggubati was good gave better performance comparison with his act first nasser played his part well sathyaraj was lovable excelled both comic emotional sequences songs background score by m m keeravani were effective elevated atmosphere narration all songs qualify repeated hearing with picks being dandaalayya oka praanam hamsa naava cinematography by k k senthil kumar was top notch managed capture visual grandeur movie art direction part was handled well by sabu cyril editing by kotagiri venkateswara rao was good overall baahubali conclusion is stunning visual extravaganza must watch cinematic experience preferably best theater your locality take bow ss rajmouli,0.49901408450704227,0.2852934272300469,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"

Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century.

10.0,Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover. People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry. When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years. Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra. 1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen. Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.",why so much hatred watch before posting review,why so much hatred this movie i wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1 star ratings im surprised not even single point they liked this movie this means when you keep negativity mind everything looks negative sheer collections this movie india alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover people who are saying this movie collections are just because hype should remember no movie world wins box office just through hype or publicity hype is good first day or weekend collections but once movie is out only content wins at box office fact many times too much hype damages collections if movie is not up mark i can give you few examples indian superstar rajinikanths movie kabali hyped so high than any movie india before not even baahubali 1 had that much hype that hype helped get unimaginable records first day first weekend however content movie is not justifiable over hype so it just collapsed at box office there are plenty examples like this another example is south indian director shankars film i where hollywood star arnold schwarzenegger came india attend audio function that created so much buzz but everyone knows what result that movie at end therefore point is just with hype publicity no one can make movie run long run also no director world can make movie which satisfies all audiences not even james cameron when his latest movie avatar got released there were plenty people who did not like movie imdb rating 7 8 people questioned what is there that movie other than spectacle vfx that is not james cameron best works compare his previous movies titanic terminator 2 etc however majority people around world embraced that movie made it biggest blockbuster ever hollywood film industry when you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside watch again think second why baahubali 2 is able achieve mind boggling collections able run successfully 50 days 1050 centers if there is nothing this movie how it would collect that much think hard you will realize greatness this movie if you still not satisfied at least appreciate peoples hard work that put their heart soul this movie 5 years finally my review this movie is as follows it is most engaging gripping jaw dropping movie that ive seen recent times i bet you will get goosebumps while watching some scenes guaranteed ive known rajamouli since his first movie his biggest strength is his screenplay emotional drama he told many interviews what is his success mantra 1 elevation scenes he ensures there is at least one peak elevation scene every ten or 15 minutes movie even story wont allow such scenes imo this is one reasons he takes more time make movies as conceive each such scene is not easy job this will keep you engaged throughout movie without any dull movement if you think movie as two dimensional graph his movies are like sine wave except there are no negative values only positive values occasionally rise peak keep this point mind watch baahubali 1 2 there is always one or two elevation scene s every 10 or 15 minutes especially baahubali 2 you forget take breath screenplay is so tight engaging 2 emotional drama he is true master emotional drama scenes that lead kattapa killing baahubali are emotional roller coaster drama between each lead characters is top notch 3 villain character almost all his movies villain character is more dominant powerful charming intelligent than hero he creates more scenes establish villain point here is impact that this build up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific even baahubali 2 villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible defeat him overall its eye feast watch this movie if possible watch it imax or 4k screen thanks rajamouli giving such wonderful masterpiece,0.5297736862293823,0.1738895281933257,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX","Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back. It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires. It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable. Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"".

8.0,A cinematic marvel.,"Bahubali 2 review :The two year long wait is finally over! The bedazzling first part of SS Rajamouli's 'Bahubali' (2015) gets a befitting sequel which is not only bigger in scale, better in execution but more importantly, spectacular in vision.A direct sequel to the first part - which ended with the loyal soldier Kattappa's (Sathyaraj) shocking revelation that he killed the valiant Amarendra (Prabhas in dual role as baap-beta Baahubali) - the film carries forward the story of Amarendra Bahubali who is designated heir to the Maheshmati throne by the reigning Raajmata Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan).Bahubali travels to a neighbouring kingdom where he wins the heart of its princess Devasena (Anushka Shetty) by pretending to be a village bumpkin. This love track, though utterly unconvincing and distracting, serves as catalyst for a political conspiracy hatched by rival cousin Bhallal Deva (Rana Daggubati) and his jealous father (Nassar) to overthrow Bahubali as the to-be king.Even with a simplistic plot, Rajamouli manages to hold your attention throughout not allowing you to glance even once at your mobile to check that random message. The audience in the South Mumbai single screen I visited, was reacting uproariously with whistles and claps to every action scene - from Bahubali taming a wild elephant to the stampede of bulls with flaming horns and the ground shattering (literally!!) climactic encounter between Beta Bahubali and Bhallal Deva. Peter Hein, take a bow!On the tech front, the CGI and VFX are a further improvement over the rich legacy left by the prequel. The grandeur of Maheshmati city and the opulence of the palatial sets are awe-inducing. Musically though, the movie falls short as none of the songs pass muster. The fantasy song on a flying ship has a Disney hangover.The performances are first rate. Prabhas and Rana Daggubati are absolutely convincing as the warring cousins. Ramya Krishnan, getting the meatier part than the other two female leads, is simply outstanding. Sathyaraj as Kattappa, is effective in the emotional as well as a few comic moments he gets during Bahubali's courtship with Devasena. Anushka Shetty does well in her wide role transcending from a beautiful princess to a Rakhee like revenge seeking maa. Tamannah Bhatia is hardly there in the film.It's to Rajamouli's credit that he has not let the pressure to replicate the astounding success of 'Bahubali - The Beginning' get to him and has not compromised on his mega vision in any way. Also, he has efficiently linked every event from the prequel right till the Shiv linga which was placed beneath a waterfall in first part getting a proper culmination in this concluding chapter.Ultimately, Bahubali is a cinematic marvel - a franchise which India needs to showcase to the world. As for that nagging question since last two years ""Why Kattappa killed Bahubali"", please rush to the nearest cinema with friends and family and find out for yourself!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",cinematic marvel,bahubali 2 review two year long wait is finally over bedazzling first part ss rajamoulis bahubali 2015 gets befitting sequel which is not only bigger scale better execution but more importantly spectacular vision direct sequel first part which ended with loyal soldier kattappas sathyaraj shocking revelation that he killed valiant amarendra prabhas dual role as baap beta baahubali film carries forward story amarendra bahubali who is designated heir maheshmati throne by reigning raajmata sivagami ramya krishnan bahubali travels neighbouring kingdom where he wins heart its princess devasena anushka shetty by pretending be village bumpkin this love track though utterly unconvincing distracting serves as catalyst political conspiracy hatched by rival cousin bhallal deva rana daggubati his jealous father nassar overthrow bahubali as be king even with simplistic plot rajamouli manages hold your attention throughout not allowing you glance even once at your mobile check that random message audience south mumbai single screen i visited was reacting uproariously with whistles claps every action scene bahubali taming wild elephant stampede bulls with flaming horns ground shattering literally climactic encounter between beta bahubali bhallal deva peter hein take bow tech front cgi vfx are further improvement over rich legacy left by prequel grandeur maheshmati city opulence palatial sets are awe inducing musically though movie falls short as none songs pass muster fantasy song flying ship has disney hangover performances are first rate prabhas rana daggubati are absolutely convincing as warring cousins ramya krishnan getting meatier part than other two female leads is simply outstanding sathyaraj as kattappa is effective emotional as well as few comic moments he gets during bahubalis courtship with devasena anushka shetty does well her wide role transcending beautiful princess rakhee like revenge seeking maa tamannah bhatia is hardly there film its rajamoulis credit that he has not let pressure replicate astounding success bahubali beginning get him has not compromised his mega vision any way also he has efficiently linked every event prequel right till shiv linga which was placed beneath waterfall first part getting proper culmination this concluding chapter ultimately bahubali is cinematic marvel franchise which india needs showcase world as that nagging question since last two years why kattappa killed bahubali please rush nearest cinema with friends family find out yourself regards sumeet nadkarni,0.4702380952380952,0.1031827016520894,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"

To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more.

10.0,Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level.

1.0,As lame as the first one,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works. The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick. Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over.",as lame as first one,this movie is as lame as first movie i am also disappointed that audience liked this movie just goes show anything works plot is weak predictable similar any south indian movie where protagonist goes through hardships someone gets murdered someone seeks revenge too many south indian melodramatic movies have same story line key disappointments are as follows 1 tamanna bhatia has 0 dialogues 2 tamanna bhatias story has no reference movie role revel group is unclear 3 katappa is shown as powerful but his personality figure persona body language is quite contrary as weak feeble emotional helpless 4 action sequences are ridiculous most disappointing also funniest part movie particularly how soldiers are propelled into kingdom using cocunut trees 5 ramayas queen mothers performance is too melodramatic queen should be shown as strong political powerful ramaya is shown as melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions 6 protagonist looks weak as compared antagonist i was rooting antagonist 7 plot is weak there is nothing new 8 why dis adivasi army attack kingdom part 1 is never discussed described i thought war part 1 was totally random 9 what happened love story between young bahubali tamanna bhatia 10 last 15 20 mins seemed like wrap up job where director wanted finish wind up real quick overall i recommend not spending any money watching this movie theatres watch it at home one streaming websites generally very disappointing but i am glad that it got over,0.5868441558441558,-0.02934199134199132,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,typical masala trash,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie. Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told. The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass. Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines. Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2.",typical masala trash,i dont come write reviews here ever but had write one this garbage sure now i one liked first part not because its vfx not at all but because storytelling vfx first movie were definitely over hyped were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere league average hollywood movie i think they were worse than that magadheera that matter but i still loved movie because i felt there was wonderful story waiting be discovered this entire series it was being told very nice way innovative indian movie coming second part now its utter nonsense here i said it vfx are huge step down first movie there are lot scenes where you can tell that set or fight is absolutely fake but as i said i dont judge indian movies purely vfx ever because i know that our budget can not match that hollywood biggest disappointment me was storyline or lack it way it was told first half had almost no story development it was filled with same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done like hundred indian movies hero is champ but he acts like dumb person ends up wooing heroine crap highly predictable director turned katappa one biggest shines first movie me into joker just appease mass now i didnt have any great interest why katappa killed bahubali i think everyone had this clue that it had have happened orders sivagami so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband son still curiosity was know how boy did that disappoint i dont know how anyone can take that thread storyline fast as wind story development answer question that had become centre interest millions people last two three years it was pure nonsense era when we have game thrones understand depth politics that kings warriors can connive this thing felt like coming right out early 90s indian movie people are satisfied with it it just dampens my belief our peoples ability think we just accept any half baked poorly conceived idea plot it is that because which our writers dont take pain think deeply over plot lines deeply disappointed by movie i had high hopes but i should have known better unfortunately type hype this movie has received is going spoil indian cinemas image everywhere people all over world wont come know that we are also capable making drishyam they would remember us with bahubali 2,0.5494261294261293,0.06552045177045177,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.26}"

Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'.",expectations soiled,yes movie cannot be skipped as first part twist question at end ensure we all will flock theatres so ill dwelve rather what one expected movie what one got exp magnum opus with brilliant vfx act brilliant vfx indeed with kingdom dream sequences war scenes portrayed effectively border disbeliefexp enhancing character bahubali n son devsana bhallaldev sivagami kattappa with brilliant one liners act characters watered down with very few one liners keep audience hooked sivagamis fierceness gets lost kattappas loyalty questioned bhallaldevs might becomes more brain than brawn worst even bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength skillsexp nuanced script where politics drama get overshadowed by pure heroics camera following lead character all time act muddled script reminiscent good old mahabharat serial schemes sub schemes where bahubali keeps losing without any retributionexp music which would create awe timed beautifully take movie forward act bgm remains good enough but songs didnt deliver especially romantic number between devsana bahubali which good share budget gets wastedexp last but not least epic climax final war which would go hour where sivadu finally manages kill bhallaldev against all odds act kind anti climax which feels edited too much put together fast enough ensure reasonable running time enough shows hit rs 500 crs collection weekall all somewhere commercials seem have overtaken story melodrama overshadowing epic making vfx substituting genuine acting independently keeping aside expectations film has been done well with good bgm main characters building up muscles graphics team putting lot efforts costumes team doing well too love story between bahubali devsana develops like typical bollywood potboiler with fake acting caricature wannabe boyfriend middle finally blooming romance with dream sequence clouds flying ship anushka shetty as devasena her credit delivers wonderful performance as young devasana with strong dialogues attitude however as conclusion ends dialogue giving hint another sequel pours out excitement crowd is nowhere be seen but those times where you have open mouth stared cheered our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people conquered animals even challenged nature jai mahishmati,0.5532766439909297,0.18738905085843868,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10.0,"Visual Spectacle, nothing less than a masterpiece!!","I don't think 1000 words will be sufficient to write my thoughts about this movie. I've followed S S Raja Mouli's work right from his first film and have been an admirer of his work ever since. One strong reason is that I enjoy action genre and Raja Mouli's movies have terrific action sequences.When I bought a ticket for Baahubali: The Beginning, I knew I was going to be entertained but didn't realise I was going to witness such a visual spectacle. After many many years, here was a movie which had repeat value. And with every repeated viewing, the movie only kept growing on me. So when Baahubali 2: The Conclusion was releasing, my expectation was sky high. The last time I was so excited and eager for a movie release was for The Matrix Reloaded. I wanted to get the best experience, so I booked a ticket in an IMAX screen and since I was watching the Telugu version in a screen in Chennai, I didn't have my family accompanying me. I had gone to the theatre alone with a promise that I'd take them to see the Tamil version later. It so happened that the guy sitting next to me had also come to see the movie solo, he had just moved to Chennai and he had seen the movie already once. I come back home after the movie and my wife wanted to know how the movie was. My answer was ""Disappointed"". I did not like the movie when I saw it the first time. Throughout the first half, I kept saying to myself that that is not how Amarendra Baahubali or Kattappa would behave, I wasn't expecting the first hour to be so light hearted and kept on picking stuff that I had not imagined would be part of the movie. Was the movie really bad? Well, we all know the answer. No.... the reason wasn't that the movie was bad, the reason was that I already had a movie playing in my head and I was expecting that movie to unfold on the screen before me. This experience has thought me that if you really want to enjoy a movie, don't step into the theatre with preconceived notions of what the film will be like. Go with a clean slate and if the movie is good, you will enjoy it.So when I went to see Baahubali 2: The Conclusion the second time with my family, this time in a theatre that was jam packed, I fell in love with the movie. And that love, admiration is only increasing with every repeat viewing. Visually, this moving is stunning. Words can't really describe the experience, you need to watch it to feel it. Yes, it has inspirations drawn, so did the greatest of visually stunning movies like Avatar. Its about adding your own interpretation to it and S S is a master in that. You might say there are few things which are hard to digest or unbelievable, well its a fantasy movie and if you see the movie as one, you will not complain. Rarely do you see such attention to details in movies. You would have noticed the obvious scenes like the opening credit or the chariot crash scene. But I will mention these 2 scenes where such detailing wasn't required but goes on show how much effort has been put in.1. The angry elephant - agreed its VFX, but it could have been a simple elephant. But observe the detailing on the elephant, the ornaments and the other accessories it has on. This is serious detailing, not lazy filmmaking.2. The scene when Mahendra Baahubali reaches on the roof of Mahishmathi palace using palm tree (remember... its a fantasy film). Notice the scene where Prabhas is running and observe the detailing in the background.This is serious filmmaking, passionate filmmaking. More power to you director saab!! Special mention to M M Keeravani's background score. One of the best I've heard, me and my 8 year old keep humming the score. It stays with you well after you've finished watching the movie. Pity, they haven't released the BG track separately.This movie is a must watch!!",visual spectacle nothing less than masterpiece,i dont think 1000 words will be sufficient write my thoughts about this movie ive followed s s raja moulis work right his first film have been admirer his work ever since one strong reason is that i enjoy action genre raja moulis movies have terrific action sequences when i bought ticket baahubali beginning i knew i was going be entertained but didnt realise i was going witness such visual spectacle after many many years here was movie which had repeat value with every repeated viewing movie only kept growing me so when baahubali 2 conclusion was releasing my expectation was sky high last time i was so excited eager movie release was matrix reloaded i wanted get best experience so i booked ticket imax screen since i was watching telugu version screen chennai i didnt have my family accompanying me i had gone theatre alone with promise that id take them see tamil version later it so happened that guy sitting next me had also come see movie solo he had just moved chennai he had seen movie already once i come back home after movie my wife wanted know how movie was my answer was disappointed i did not like movie when i saw it first time throughout first half i kept saying myself that that is not how amarendra baahubali or kattappa would behave i wasnt expecting first hour be so light hearted kept picking stuff that i had not imagined would be part movie was movie really bad well we all know answer no reason wasnt that movie was bad reason was that i already had movie playing my head i was expecting that movie unfold screen before me this experience has thought me that if you really want enjoy movie dont step into theatre with preconceived notions what film will be like go with clean slate if movie is good you will enjoy it so when i went see baahubali 2 conclusion second time with my family this time theatre that was jam packed i fell love with movie that love admiration is only increasing with every repeat viewing visually this moving is stunning words cant really describe experience you need watch it feel it yes it has inspirations drawn so did greatest visually stunning movies like avatar its about adding your own interpretation it s s is master that you might say there are few things which are hard digest or unbelievable well its fantasy movie if you see movie as one you will not complain rarely do you see such attention details movies you would have noticed obvious scenes like opening credit or chariot crash scene but i will mention these 2 scenes where such detailing wasnt required but goes show how much effort has been put 1 angry elephant agreed its vfx but it could have been simple elephant but observe detailing elephant ornaments other accessories it has this is serious detailing not lazy filmmaking 2 scene when mahendra baahubali reaches roof mahishmathi palace using palm tree remember its fantasy film notice scene where prabhas is running observe detailing background this is serious filmmaking passionate filmmaking more power you director saab special mention m m keeravanis background score one best ive heard me my 8 year old keep humming score it stays with you well after youve finished watching movie pity they havent released bg track separately this movie is must watch,0.4891294642857143,0.14119047619047623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Baahubali 2 is a film that will be remembered across decades,"A strong story line built upon the enriches of Indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. We have a very strong cultural background of Vedas, Puranas and the great mythological epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. I grew up reading these big epics and after so many years I witnessed an epic film - 'Baahubali - A Man with strong arms'. I celebrated this Indian Magnum Opus just like the way I have celebrated all time great blockbusters in Hollywood and Bollywood.If we can accept the great stories like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings trilogy, the famous Game of thrones series (which has its own heroes following the same dharma - righteous path to combat evil), then we shall also celebrate Baahubali too. SS Rajamouli - (Director) had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities and larger than life characters in our own mythological epic stories. There are many reasons to celebrate the humongous Baahubali 2 too.Baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers, it is a story which has managed to unite entire India irrespective of state, language, film industry based on a simple question - 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali'?, it is most certain that the direction, power of narration and screenplay has created an impact and liking towards the film. Don't forget, Baahubali 1 - The Beginning had laid the initial footprint two years ago and the first part of the movie was not forgotten.Baahubali 2 rides on the momentum from where the first part has left. It has it's own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps to the viewers and the famous fight scenes that galore within itself. Claps thud, whistles blow, shouts from the viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed in words. It is a film which doesn't rely solely on VFX, thought it has been touted as the best film with extraordinary visuals. It doesn't disappoint the viewers and the execution was strong enough to make a visual impact.Baahubali is our own Indian super hero who follows the simple righteous path of Dharma and character is well sculpted. Emphasis is thoroughly laid on every finer detail in the film. Devasena and Sivagami are the two most powerful women characters which one can see in recent times. Bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions. Kattappa's is always the go to warrior who bows his head to the King. Background score of this film has been excellent and it keeps the audience enthralled and entertained. Baahubali's character and it's powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent BGM.Baahubali, undoubtedly is a proud Indian film that broke barriers, it has proved that with a strong subject and excellent directional execution one can reach the sky. Eventually, it is the character Baahubali himself that prevails in every viewer's mind and imagination. The world wide appreciation as reported from top news channels such as Guardian, Wall street Journal etc has been remarkable. It has set a new benchmark in the Indian film industry and it is striking the doors of Hollywood as it already turned down the some of the newly released Hollywood blockbusters in terms of Box-office collections.Instead of criticizing the film and finding out flaws in CGI, Indians should stand up and applaud 'Baahubali' for it's impact and contribution to Indian cinema. My rating is 10/10 and it has been an unbelievable experience watching it on big screen. It is flawless and I take a bow to the hard work put in by the entire cast and crew of the film. It teaches us the sole aspect of belief and execution. SS Rajamouli believed in the subject(Bahubali) with lot of conviction, he braved the odds and he breathed fire and life into it. The result, we can see everywhere.....thanks to the story teller himself. Baahubali will be remembered across decades and it lives on.....",baahubali 2 is film that will be remembered across decades,strong story line built upon enriches indian mythologies its closely resembling characters we have very strong cultural background vedas puranas great mythological epics like ramayana mahabharata i grew up reading these big epics after so many years i witnessed epic film baahubali man with strong arms i celebrated this indian magnum opus just like way i have celebrated all time great blockbusters hollywood bollywood if we can accept great stories like harry potter lord rings trilogy famous game thrones series which has its own heroes following same dharma righteous path combat evil then we shall also celebrate baahubali too ss rajamouli director had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities larger than life characters our own mythological epic stories there are many reasons celebrate humongous baahubali 2 too baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers it is story which has managed unite entire india irrespective state language film industry based simple question why katappa killed baahubali it is most certain that direction power narration screenplay has created impact liking towards film dont forget baahubali 1 beginning had laid initial footprint two years ago first part movie was not forgotten baahubali 2 rides momentum where first part has left it has its own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps viewers famous fight scenes that galore within itself claps thud whistles blow shouts viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed words it is film which doesnt rely solely vfx thought it has been touted as best film with extraordinary visuals it doesnt disappoint viewers execution was strong enough make visual impact baahubali is our own indian super hero who follows simple righteous path dharma character is well sculpted emphasis is thoroughly laid every finer detail film devasena sivagami are two most powerful women characters which one can see recent times bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions kattappas is always go warrior who bows his head king background score this film has been excellent it keeps audience enthralled entertained baahubalis character its powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent bgm baahubali undoubtedly is proud indian film that broke barriers it has proved that with strong subject excellent directional execution one can reach sky eventually it is character baahubali himself that prevails every viewers mind imagination world wide appreciation as reported top news channels such as guardian wall street journal etc has been remarkable it has set new benchmark indian film industry it is striking doors hollywood as it already turned down some newly released hollywood blockbusters terms box office collections instead criticizing film finding out flaws cgi indians should stand up applaud baahubali its impact contribution indian cinema my rating is 10 10 it has been unbelievable experience watching it big screen it is flawless i take bow hard work put by entire cast crew film it teaches us sole aspect belief execution ss rajamouli believed subject bahubali with lot conviction he braved odds he breathed fire life into it result we can see everywhere thanks story teller himself baahubali will be remembered across decades it lives,0.5785340324776945,0.2756308558421234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
