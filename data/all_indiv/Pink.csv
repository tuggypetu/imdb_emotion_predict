10.0,Dyeing our conscience,"When a girl says NO, (she could be anyone, your girl friend, your date, your wife or even a sex worker). it means a NO. This is exactly the point which PINK drives to the audience, all the while shaking up our conscience and questioning ourselves.Minal Arora (Taapsee Pannu) Falak Ali (Kriti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are three friends and room mates who choose to go to a rock concert and run into Rajveer Singh (Angad Bedi) and his friends. The girls are invited for dinner which they choose to accept and it is implied that Rajveer and his friends tried to act fresh with the girls and Minal in an act of self defense hitsRajveer with a bottle, making him almost lose an eye. Both the parties choose not to go to the law enforcement authorities and few days later, the girls are threatened by phone calls and their house owner is given threats to have the girls thrown out. Minal goes to the police and reports the incident which happened that night and an FIR is filed. But to her shock, she is arrested on the charges of prostitution and murder attempt.Steps in Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachan) a once famous elderly lawyer who has quit practice mainly due to his bipolar disorder. Sehgal offers to defend the girls in a case which almost appears to be a lost cause as the girls are subjected to humiliation and are portrayed as criminals.Amitabh Bachan as Sehgal gives once again a magnificent performance, his gas mask, his blank stares in the courtroom all add up to his fantastic portrayal of the character.Taapsee Pannu gives the best performance of her career, her body language, her mumbling, frightened looks and especially the scene where Sehgal calls her to the stand, make it the most outstanding performance of the year.Kriti Kulhari need s a special mention, especially in the breakdown scene on the stand.Angad Bedi is good as well and actually makes us loath the character, especially in the final cross-examination scene which brings out the double standards the society is into.Screenplay by Ritesh Shah deserves applause and especially the dialogues when Sehgal lists out the safety standards for women/girls.Direction by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhary is classy and does not deviate from the plot with inane sub plots. Right from the word go, he ensures every scenes grips our conscience and tugs us into self- examination.I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to watch flashy item songs, or duets set in Switzerland or out of the world costumes. This movie is for patrons who are into serious cinema and can appreciate good performances.",dyeing our conscience,when girl says no she could be anyone your girl friend your date your wife or even sex worker it means no this is exactly point which pink drives audience all while shaking up our conscience questioning ourselves minal arora taapsee pannu falak ali kriti kulhari andrea andrea tariang are three friends room mates who choose go rock concert run into rajveer singh angad bedi his friends girls are invited dinner which they choose accept it is implied that rajveer his friends tried act fresh with girls minal act self defense hitsrajveer with bottle making him almost lose eye both parties choose not go law enforcement authorities few days later girls are threatened by phone calls their house owner is given threats have girls thrown out minal goes police reports incident which happened that night fir is filed but her shock she is arrested charges prostitution murder attempt steps deepak sehgal amitabh bachan once famous elderly lawyer who has quit practice mainly due his bipolar disorder sehgal offers defend girls case which almost appears be lost cause as girls are subjected humiliation are portrayed as criminals amitabh bachan as sehgal gives once again magnificent performance his gas mask his blank stares courtroom all add up his fantastic portrayal character taapsee pannu gives best performance her career her body language her mumbling frightened looks especially scene where sehgal calls her stand make it most outstanding performance year kriti kulhari need s special mention especially breakdown scene stand angad bedi is good as well actually makes us loath character especially final cross examination scene which brings out double standards society is into screenplay by ritesh shah deserves applause especially dialogues when sehgal lists out safety standards women girls direction by aniruddha roy chowdhary is classy does not deviate plot with inane sub plots right word go he ensures every scenes grips our conscience tugs us into self examination i would not recommend it anyone who wants watch flashy item songs or duets set switzerland or out world costumes this movie is patrons who are into serious cinema can appreciate good performances,0.5059934318555007,0.19429392446633825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"Excellent, intense & gripping courtroom drama!!","More than half of the seats empty in the theater at an afternoon show of ""Pink"" gives us the message whats exactly wrong with Bollywood. Replacing the movie with Dabangg or other such worthless crap, shows would be house-full. Pink is a masterpiece and lives up to it's expectations. Powerful and world-class performances given by Amitabh Bachchan sir (once again) and Piyush Mishra makes this movie a gem. This is one of the career best performance by Big B. He runs the whole show. Tapsee's acting could have been so much better; but still, it was a job well done. The movie deals with what we read daily in our newspapers. MOLESTATION. This movie depicts the corrupt system and shows it in a brutally honest way (personal experience). I'd say go for this movie, you'll surely love it.

,Pink is a social movement that should be accepted with open arms and use to improve society,"Pink is not a film and this is not a review..A dialogue from Rang De Basanti – ""Koi Bi desh perfect nevi ho ta hai..use perfect banana parta hai"" – and for that one needs to change the various aspects of societal mindset. #Pink is not just a film but a statement against this prejudiced, hypocritical feudal societal fabric that can't handle modern-thinking women.Two major point raised without being didactic:- 1.Stop being judgmental. A modern working woman who wears short (I would say more comfortable in this humid climate) clothes or one who parties & drinks or one who is friendly doesn't mean SHE IS AVAILABLE. SO STOP LABELING HER..2.Most vital point – NO MEANS NO..She can be your friend, GF, sex-worker, even your wife : NO means No. I am sure even most educated men won't get this point but I hope they does..Honestly Shoojit Sircar (who is synonymous with quality films Vicky Donor Madras Cafe Piku) & debutante Dir Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury should be applauded for The Film Pink as it has the power to change mindset. Hope Pink is watched at a large scale, start a debate and inspire young adults. Going by the reactions all over I guess the movement has just began, that is Power of Great Cinema.Kudos to Amitabh Bachchan to be part of such a topical film demanding respect.His acting and choice of films are getting better and better with old-age..This issue was necessary to be told and his name would increase the audience base. Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari are a revelation. Their pain reflects the voice of majority of Indian women who have to face ordeals even in the busiest of streets in our country. Angad Bedi is so authentic that you will hate him. Debutante Andrea Tariang is effortless. And can Piyush Mishra & Dhritiman Chatterjee go wrong in any role? Pink is indeed a taut social thriller which needs your attention.It is taut and gritty and it establishes its plot-points effectively keeping the tension intact. And while doing so it makes evident points against the society. The court-room sequences in the 2nd half is tremendously superb. As a cinema it is Talvar of 2016 albeit with a straight plot-line.Btw, Do watch the end credit..",pink is social movement that should be accepted with open arms use improve society,pink is not film this is not review dialogue rang de basanti koi bi desh perfect nevi ho ta hai use perfect banana parta hai that one needs change various aspects societal mindset is not just film but statement against this prejudiced hypocritical feudal societal fabric that cant handle modern thinking women two major point raised without being didactic 1 stop being judgmental modern working woman who wears short i would say more comfortable this humid climate clothes or one who parties drinks or one who is friendly doesnt mean she is available so stop labeling her 2 most vital point no means no she can be your friend gf sex worker even your wife no means no i am sure even most educated men wont get this point but i hope they does honestly shoojit sircar who is synonymous with quality films vicky donor madras cafe piku debutante dir aniruddha roy chowdhury should be applauded film pink as it has power change mindset hope pink is watched at large scale start debate inspire young adults going by reactions all over i guess movement has just began that is power great cinema kudos amitabh bachchan be part such topical film demanding respect his acting choice films are getting better better with old age this issue was necessary be told his name would increase audience base tapsee pannu kirti kulhari are revelation their pain reflects voice majority indian women who have face ordeals even busiest streets our country angad bedi is so authentic that you will hate him debutante andrea tariang is effortless can piyush mishra dhritiman chatterjee go wrong any role pink is indeed taut social thriller which needs your attention it is taut gritty it establishes its plot points effectively keeping tension intact while doing so it makes evident points against society court room sequences 2nd half is tremendously superb as cinema it is talvar 2016 albeit with straight plot line btw do watch end credit,0.5139353259034111,0.16147416413373858,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.34}"

This is a tight slap on all those so called ""Sanskari uncles and aunties"" that judge girls by what they wear. Every person not just a male,but this is was for every gender. It asks just a single question to the society i.e ""WHY"" why don't you just let girls do whatever they want to do. At least let them smile or laugh for god sake. please don't just wait for someone to point out some faults in your daughter,sister or mother.

10.0,Thought Provoking and a Giant leap in Bollywood. We need more of these.,"Just seen PINK the movie and I would like admit that nothing has moved me so much as this movie did. Superb Acting by Tapsee Pannu She is probably the best we got in bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan did a very intense and powerful character and uplifted the role in his own charisma, His acting skills shows the reason why he is the biggest bollywood star ever. Director precisely enlights the deep rooted problems and harassments faced by women specially in metros and the immaturity of the society who blindly judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, talk or work. We badly needs these kind of movies to awake the generic thoughts of people who thinks that they can Objectify women and Misuse the power against them.

9.0,"Do Yourself A Favor, Leave Everything And Watch PINK !!!","I have always believed that the purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. The courtroom drama based movies are always engaging as the prosecutor and defendant both fight to solve the case with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses. Films like ""Damini"", ""Jolly LLB"",""Talvar"" or the recent ""Rustom"" has been immensely successful in keeping the audience engaged with impeccable dialogues and fantastic screenplay but what makes ""Pink"" different is the beautiful message on morality and equality of an independent woman when she is says ""NO"" to getting involved into any sexual preferences.""Pink"" tells the story of three independent girls in the city of Delhi who get involved in a crime in order to save themselves. Hell break lose when one of them, Meenal(played by Tapsee Pannu) file a harassment case against the Rajvir Singh(Angad Bedi), a nephew of a powerful minister. Little they know when their attackers turn their life miserable. Enter the scene, an old aged lawyer (played by Amitabh Bachchan), who wears anti-pollution mask every time he is on road, takes up the case to fight for justice.""Pink"" is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps and eye-popping experience. The scene where Falak(played by Kirti Kulhari) calls her friend to compromise with the situation and immediately retaliate is jaw- dropping. The scene where Amitabh Bachchan asks Andrea (played by Andrea Tariang) where is she is from is a beautiful scene showing acceptance of her place in India. Couple of scenes in second half - interrogation scene between the female cop and Angad Bedi with Amitabh Bachchan in the court, the scene between Tapsee Pannu and Piyush Mishra is well-executed. A big clap for the director Aniruddha Roy for a fantastic characters details defined in 136 minutes. Screenplay is the hero with nail-biting moments. Art direction is fine while Cinematography is just about okay.Amitabh Bachchan is a knight in shining armour. Watch out for him in the second half when he questions the witnesses in the courtroom. It is unforgettable performance which should be lauded for its sheer brilliance. Among the actors - Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari is mindblowing with their natural performances. Angad Bedi does well as menacing character. Piyush Mishra, as usual, is powerful.On the whole, ""Pink"" is an experience that needs to be lauded for its impeccable direction, electrifying performances and beautiful message.

9.0,Pink through its highly engaging plot and courtroom drama turns out to be so powerful that it is bound to shake you to the core.,"Pink, a brilliant film by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury is going to shake you to the core. It is not a film from a feminist perspective, but it does talk about the shackles in which girls of our country are tied even in this century. Pink does raise many pertinent questions, talks of double standards, gender discrimination etc. In spite of females excelling in almost every field, there are many unsaid rules in our society which decides whether a female is of good character or not. The beauty of the film is that this is not at all a loud film in spite of conveying a very loud message. It talks of the attitudes prevalent all around us which stamps a female of 'questionable character' on the basis of the length of the her skirt, the time when she returns home after work, how much she smiles at men, whether she drinks / parties or not, and her virginity status etc. There are enough moral policing for girls. It also talks about the corrupt system in our country, the cops who actually need to protect people, end up in framing people in false cases. Pink through its highly engaging plot and courtroom drama turns out to be so powerful that it is bound to make you think. Three single independent working women Minal Arora (Taapsee Pannu), Falak Ali (Kirti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are friends and they share an apartment in Delhi. Minal is from Delhi itself, but due to her odd working hours, she stays with friends. Falak is from Lucknow and Andrea from Meghalaya. Their lives take a turn when they go for a rock concert with a friend Vishwa (Tushar Pandey) and befriend Rajveer (Angad Bedi) and Dumpy (Raashul Tandon). They accept a dinner invitation from Rajveer and go for the same in a resort in Surajkund, Haryana. After some light talks, jokes, drinks, Minal is inappropriately touched by Rajveer. In an effort for self- defense, Minal picks up a bottle and smashes it on Rajveer. The girls manage to escape from the resort. Till the credits roll, the incident is not shown which led to the whole plot. But the screenplay is so strong that one gets to have vivid visualization of what could have gone wrong. Girls do not approach the police initially out of fear. They even get more scared when they come to know that Rajveer is the nephew of very influential politician. Later, when all three are harassed by the boys gang (actor Vijay Varma also joins the gang) by different means, they decide to approach police department and file a case. But Rajveer files a case in turn against Minal mainly and accusing other two too. Minal is accused for 'Attempt to murder', for extorting money etc. All three of them are labeled in the FIR as prostitutes. Minal is arrested, and the case is handled by none other than Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachchan), who lives in the neighbourhood of Minal, Falak and Andrea. The initial shots itself show Deepak doing morning exercises in the park, where he often ends up looking at Minal jogging with blank expressions. Deepak Sehgal had called it quits to his profession as a lawyer due to his bipolar disorder, but comes to the rescue of the girls. The second half is highly engaging with courtroom sequence. Piyush Mishra as Prashant is the prosecution lawyer. There we get to see some fine and smart moves during the debate. Deepak had answers to every accusation which Prashant was bringing up. Who wins in the end – Girls or the boys? How efficiently does Deepak suffering from bipolar disorder fight the case ? What defense statements were made by Prashant to protect the boys ? What was the motive of girls behind accepting dinner invitations from acquaintances, was it to extort money from the rich (as accused)? How were the girls Minal, Falak and Andrea treated in the society, workplace and in court after this incident ? How did they handle their character assassination? There are certain moments in the films which certainly would bring tears to your eyes. There is a scene, where after the incident, Minal is commented upon as the girl involved in 'Surajkund Kand', she just puts the hood of her sweatshirt on her head instead of retaliating, Amitabh Bachchan removes the hood. There are many more such moments. There is no lecture in the film; rather it talks about what is happening in and around us. There are some parts of the plot which were not very much justified: Amitabh Bachchan's Bipolar disorder, his ailing wife confined to a hospital bed. The boys appeared very influential and egoistic in the beginning, wanted to punish girls at any cost, but once when the courtroom drama started unfolding, there was not a single moment of encounter / threatening from these boys to girls, which seemed unlikely. But these are very much unnoticeable in midst of powerful scenes. Pink, a very powerful and outstanding film, conveys a message very loudly that when a woman (be it friend, acquaintance, wife) says 'No', it actually means 'No'. It also prompts society to stop judging a girl on the basis of length of her skirt, time of her returning home, her single status, her attempts to enjoy life in parties etc. The poem by Tanvir Ghazi recited by Amitabh Bachchan when the credits roll, clearly conveys that it is high time to end the patriarchal rules which shackles the women in stereotypes.

6.0,"Great, until it became unrealistic preaching.","Pink (2016) ""No. No, your honor. 'No' is not a word. It is a complete sentence. It doesn't need any further explanation. 'No' simply means 'no'. My client said no', your honor and these boys must realize that 'no' means 'no' whether the girl is an acquaintance, a friend, girlfriend, or a sex worker. Or even your own wife! 'No' means no'! I want someone says so, you stop."" The Good: * Makes important statements regarding social issues includes consent, double standards for females and males, inherent biases, molestation, misogyny, rape, self defense, social strata, and violence against women. This is especially relevant in India, where rapes often go unreported for to fear of public shame and possibly (as portrayed in the film) having it backfire. It is still frowned upon by some for a girl to be independent, outspoken, willful, or to drink or go anywhere in private with a male. * Amitabh Bachchan, due to his seniority, was originally first listed in the credits. However, to show gender equality, he requested to have his name listed after the three leading ladies. It is great to know that the actor was as passionate about gender quality as his character was in the film. * A clever creative choice was showing the scene of what actually happened that night, in slow motion, during the credits. Be sure to wait for that. The Bad: * Great acting overall by the three leading ladies, but they were quite melodramatic. It alternated between an impressive performance and a performance completely overdone. * Bachchan may have had a powerful presence, but he was also creepy. Whatever the reasons, his breathing mask, combined with his mysterious demeanor and harsh voice, made for more of a creepy presence. Add to that the angles that made his eyes look white in many scenes, he was straight up scary. Supposedly he had bipolar, but I do not even know why that was a detail. The Ugly: * Unrealistic portrayal of a court debate. These lawyers would not be a allowed to intimidate and yell at the witnesses on the stand, practically coercing them into a false confession. Likewise, they would not be allowed to preach on topics irrelevant to the case. The case becomes a stage for feminism, narrated by Bachchan. * Makes important points, but crosses the line very early on into preaching. To the point that I might call this propaganda. * Unrealistic to the point that I could not take it seriously and became bored in the second hour of this unnecessarily long film. Conclusion: Many memorable lines, overall good performances,, made a valuable case for many important social issues; but excessive in length, portrayed court cases unrealistically, and it became preaching (practically) propaganda.",great until it became unrealistic preaching,pink 2016 no no your honor no is not word it is complete sentence it doesnt need any further explanation no simply means no my client said no your honor these boys must realize that no means no whether girl is acquaintance friend girlfriend or sex worker or even your own wife no means no i want someone says so you stop good makes important statements regarding social issues includes consent double standards females males inherent biases molestation misogyny rape self defense social strata violence against women this is especially relevant india where rapes often go unreported fear public shame possibly as portrayed film having it backfire it is still frowned upon by some girl be independent outspoken willful or drink or go anywhere private with male amitabh bachchan due his seniority was originally first listed credits however show gender equality he requested have his name listed after three leading ladies it is great know that actor was as passionate about gender quality as his character was film clever creative choice was showing scene what actually happened that night slow motion during credits be sure wait that bad great acting overall by three leading ladies but they were quite melodramatic it alternated between impressive performance performance completely overdone bachchan may have had powerful presence but he was also creepy whatever reasons his breathing mask combined with his mysterious demeanor harsh voice made more creepy presence add that angles that made his eyes look white many scenes he was straight up scary supposedly he had bipolar but i do not even know why that was detail ugly unrealistic portrayal court debate these lawyers would not be allowed intimidate yell at witnesses stand practically coercing them into false confession likewise they would not be allowed preach topics irrelevant case case becomes stage feminism narrated by bachchan makes important points but crosses line very early into preaching point that i might call this propaganda unrealistic point that i could not take it seriously became bored second hour this unnecessarily long film conclusion many memorable lines overall good performances made valuable case many important social issues but excessive length portrayed court cases unrealistically it became preaching practically propaganda,0.5793390376984128,0.07559895833333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"

7.0,Bold & Brave!,"Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's 'Pink' is a gripping Courtroom-Drama, that's Bold & Brave. It tackles the sensitive & thought-provoking issue of gender-equality & the difference between one's approval & one's disapproval. The message of this well-made film, is, without doubt, even stronger than the film itself. 'Pink' Synopsis: After a rock-concert, Three independent women (Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari & Andrea Tariang) are harassed by three men. Soon after, the women are targeted, arrested & subjected for something they never did. Things take a turn when an aged lawyer (Amitabh Bachchan) decides to defend the 3 women in court. 'Pink' is about fighting for whats right & how A ""NO"" is clearly A ""NO"". India is a country that's been dealing with the horrors against women, as this society, by and large, is chauvinistic & men-driven. 'Pink' is about gender-equality & how its not remotely fine, to harass any girl, just because she decided to hang out with you after a few drinks. Its about keeping that enormous ""I'm a man, I can do anything"" bull-crap away & dealing with a situation with a sense of reality & chivalry. 'Pink' is a dramatic look at three brave women, who with the help a righteous lawyer, storm against the men who wronged them & are not held responsible for doing something so wrong & repulsive. 'Pink' works, because the narrative is straight to the point. And mind you, the incident, that the film is based upon, isn't shown to us till the end credits roll. And yet, 'Pink' holds you. The first-hour builds, as the proceedings get darker & more on-your-face, but its the second-hour, when the drama shifts to the courtroom, is when things are pulled out & argued upon. Although the second-hour does drag for a bit, the drama never shifts to anything else & stays to the point, at all times.Ritesh Shah's Screenplay is well-done. Shah tackles a really thought-provoking, relevant topic & presents it, as it should be. A special mention for the sharply Written Monologue towards the film's concluding moments, where Amitabh powerfully says ""A NO is A NO"". Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's Direction is excellent. He's handled this dramatic film, with precision. And its a joy to know that the prolific Shoojit Sircar, has produced this film! Cinematography & Editing are super. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Music by Various Artists, is in sync with the film's mood.Performance-Wise: Amitabh Bachchan shines, in a role, that's undoubtedly the strongest here. His delivery in the final monologue, particularly, is note-worthy. But its The Ladies who steal 'Pink'. Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari & Andrea Tariang are exceptional. Taapsee is excellent as the women who protected herself & keeps the fire alive to fight back. Also, she looks gorgeous. Kirti is a revelation. She's terrific & her angry breakdown in the courtroom, is heart-wrenching. Andrea gets a smaller role & even lesser lines to speak comparatively, but is simply flawless as a woman, who refuses to be a victim. Of the supporting cast, Piyush Mishra hams it up as the lawyer defending the baddies, while Dhritiman Chatterjee is first-rate as the Judge. Angad Bedi is okay, but Vijay Verma crawls your skin & is absolutely unforgettable as the chauvinist, remorseless young-blood. Mamta Shankar, As Amitabh's wife, is decent in a cameo. Rest lend very good support.On the whole, 'Pink' is a well-made film, with a strong message.

7.0,A powerful courtroom drama,"Pink is a gripping social film, brilliantly directed by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury. The script is excellent, very well layered, and the film moves at a steady pace. Pink works as a taut thriller, and it is really a strong one at that - very intriguing and highly captivating. But the trick is that it's not just about the thrills because beneath the well-built tension lies a deeply involving social message on the important issues of sexual harassment, corruption, cultural and class differences, and above all, gender equality. The story culminates in a lengthy courtroom sequence which is stupendous and fascinating. This portion of the film takes away from everything else in it, and it is aided by consistently authentic, sharp dialogue, and an impressive attention to detail. That the setting is realistic only helps, ditto for the fantastic editing and cinematography, which enhance the film's credibility. This remains the film's prime asset which will have viewers on the edge of their seats.The acting is roundly excellent and, needless to say, the film relies on the towering presence of Amitabh Bachchan, who is tremendous. There isn't a single false note in the way he plays this fantastic part - stylish, compassionate, heroic, and never less than a real character. Interestingly, he gives up top billing for the three leading ladies, so as to highlight their importance. Indeed, all three of them are convincing. Taapsee Pannu is the central of the three, and she is highly competent, but the other two, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang, actually give the film most of its raw energy and compassion. They are wonderful. Among the supporting actors, Piyush Mishra does exceedingly well as the amusing prosecutor, but the scene-stealer is doubtlessly Dhritiman Chatterjee, who is phenomenal as the fair and decent judge whose every expression speaks volumes. Other than being an important, issue-based film, Pink is a true cinematic experience well worth watching.",powerful courtroom drama,pink is gripping social film brilliantly directed by aniruddha roy chowdhury script is excellent very well layered film moves at steady pace pink works as taut thriller it is really strong one at that very intriguing highly captivating but trick is that its not just about thrills because beneath well built tension lies deeply involving social message important issues sexual harassment corruption cultural class differences above all gender equality story culminates lengthy courtroom sequence which is stupendous fascinating this portion film takes away everything else it it is aided by consistently authentic sharp dialogue impressive attention detail that setting is realistic only helps ditto fantastic editing cinematography which enhance films credibility this remains films prime asset which will have viewers edge their seats acting is roundly excellent needless say film relies towering presence amitabh bachchan who is tremendous there isnt single false note way he plays this fantastic part stylish compassionate heroic never less than real character interestingly he gives up top billing three leading ladies so as highlight their importance indeed all three them are convincing taapsee pannu is central three she is highly competent but other two kirti kulhari andrea tariang actually give film most its raw energy compassion they are wonderful among supporting actors piyush mishra does exceedingly well as amusing prosecutor but scene stealer is doubtlessly dhritiman chatterjee who is phenomenal as fair decent judge whose every expression speaks volumes other than being important issue based film pink is true cinematic experience well worth watching,0.597879956301009,0.2864819099029625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,'Pink' is STRIKING...,"Pink addresses a prevalent societal issue extremely effectively. It is a very well made courtroom drama that is hugely thought provoking.The movie keeps viewer hooked from the very beginning, with a brief gory scene. Thereafter, the thrill just continues to build up and an intense drama sets up for an exciting, enriching second half. The movie is centered around three girls, and their fight for justice, respect, dignity, freedom and most importantly, CHOICE. The last 20 minutes are the most blunt, important and weighty; almost sum up the purpose of entire film. When a girl says NO, it simply means NO and doesn't necessarily have to come with a reason or explanation, whether she's a stranger, a friend, a girlfriend, a wife or a prostitute. Pink keeps coming harder at the viewer, telling and retelling that its not the size of a girl's skirt, or her (over)friendliness or her smoking/drinking/partying that enables you to decide/presume anything about her character. The director succeeds in bringing fore to the curtain what he likely intends to- the patriarchal dirt in our society as well as system, and the evil presumptions about urban world girl in more ways than one. The crisp camera-work, story and well-written dialogues make it seem genuinely realistic. The three girls portray their characters excellently. AB continues to add on to his list of amazing ventures, with another ace performance. Two other notable mentions are, the S.H.O. Madam and the Judge, who brilliantly occupy their respective screen spaces.Pink, as many of the wiser critics have said, is truly a landmark in Indian Cinema, and has a resounding message to deliver.

6.0,Could have been something wonderful........turns out to be a very amateurishly made movie,"I happened to read a few reviews of the movie. Everyone who is anyone was going gaga about the movie. Huffington Post was the only source that reviewed it as an average movie. Surely it was not possible that everyone got it wrong and only Huffpost got it right. I watch very few Hindi movies but curiosity got the better of me and so when Star Gold aired it at the weekend I decided to sit through it.Now I know why Huffpost is one of the most credible source of news in the world. People have their pet peeves and mine is bad acting. I can tolerate average movies but I cannot cannot stand bad acting. If you woke up one morning and decided to be an actor then you better learn how to act.The first hour of the movie is actually quite decent. The 3 girls who play the protagonists are not going to win an Oscar anytime soon but there is not much about their acting to complain about. There are a couple of very good performances in there as well, namely the old man who plays the landlord and even the main antagonists cousin who is out to exact revenge.Post the first hour the movie seriously takes a dip for the worse. A particular directorial skill that often goes unnoticed is merging scenes with one another. With Pink it feels like someone shot a few short movies and haphazardly stitched them together. It goes something like this, Court scene...girls sitting on sofa at home...court scene....Amitabh sitting on chair at home..court scene...Repeat.If Piyush Mishra was a Hollywood actor I am certain that at some stage in his career he would have been nominated for an Academy award for Best Supporting Actor.This is however one of his worst performances to date. Its like the Director told him, you have to go there and be really loud. Forget acting...just scream at every chance you get.Even the performances of the 3 protagonist girls takes a clear dip post the first hour. Amitabh Bachchan is Amitabh Bachchan. Even when he is not great he is alright. This is clearly not his best work. He just looks angry throughout the movie. Apparently he is suffering from some mental ailments but the director leaves that to our imagination. The directors directive to Amitabh was.........you have to be really really angry at every given chance.And then the best actor in the cast takes the stand. The bloke who plays the main villain. You really want to hit him on the head with something. Not because he is the villain and you want to hurt him but because he is that bad an actor.In the end the judge convicts 3 of the 4 accused on charges that were never proved or even discussed in the entire courtroom drama. Maybe the director just decided to skip that part totally.The subject of consent should have been discussed a long time ago in India and it really should not have taken a badly made movie to highlight the issue.",could have been something wonderful turns out be very amateurishly made movie,i happened read few reviews movie everyone who is anyone was going gaga about movie huffington post was only source that reviewed it as average movie surely it was not possible that everyone got it wrong only huffpost got it right i watch very few hindi movies but curiosity got better me so when star gold aired it at weekend i decided sit through it now i know why huffpost is one most credible source news world people have their pet peeves mine is bad acting i can tolerate average movies but i cannot cannot stand bad acting if you woke up one morning decided be actor then you better learn how act first hour movie is actually quite decent 3 girls who play protagonists are not going win oscar anytime soon but there is not much about their acting complain about there are couple very good performances there as well namely old man who plays landlord even main antagonists cousin who is out exact revenge post first hour movie seriously takes dip worse particular directorial skill that often goes unnoticed is merging scenes with one another with pink it feels like someone shot few short movies haphazardly stitched them together it goes something like this court scene girls sitting sofa at home court scene amitabh sitting chair at home court scene repeat if piyush mishra was hollywood actor i am certain that at some stage his career he would have been nominated academy award best supporting actor this is however one his worst performances date its like director told him you have go there be really loud forget acting just scream at every chance you get even performances 3 protagonist girls takes clear dip post first hour amitabh bachchan is amitabh bachchan even when he is not great he is alright this is clearly not his best work he just looks angry throughout movie apparently he is suffering some mental ailments but director leaves that our imagination directors directive amitabh was you have be really really angry at every given chance then best actor cast takes stand bloke who plays main villain you really want hit him head with something not because he is villain you want hurt him but because he is that bad actor end judge convicts 3 4 accused charges that were never proved or even discussed entire courtroom drama maybe director just decided skip that part totally subject consent should have been discussed long time ago india it really should not have taken badly made movie highlight issue,0.4879848710317461,0.03276041666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8.0,NO Means NO. ♦ Grade B+,"Rarely come in Bollywood films that provoke you, reignite a topic of grave importance, unleash fury in you so much that it stays with him or her for a long time. One such film is ""Pink"", a highly engrossing courtroom crime drama by Bengali filmmaker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury.Minal (Tapsee Pannu), Falak (Kirti Kulhari), and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are three independent working women who live alone in a rented apartment in the capital city of India. Following a night of drunken brawl with some men they met at a rock concert, the trio come back home in a state of exponential disquietude. What really happened towards the end of the night at a hotel where the trio and the men met and further partied post the concert is not clear, save for one immediate consequence: one of the men had to be rushed to the hospital. What follows is a harrowing story about a study on assumptions that society as a whole makes on people, especially women. Hence, one guesses, the title, ""Pink"".The film does not describe what really happened that night, and one has to wait for the second half to get some deep insights into the matter as the scene shifts to a Sessions Court where Deepak (Amitabh Bachchan), a reputed lawyer, comes out of retirement to enable the female trio a chance at vindicating themselves after they were picked up by the police for crimes that they say they didn't do. One can connect the dots here, but that is where one will go wrong as the story gathers pace and proves you wrong. The plot will have you flummoxed for it does not take side as to who - the unruly group of four men or the trio of liberal and rebellious fashionista women - are at fault. What could have been averted with just an apology blows out of proportion when the male group use the hand of politics that is resting on their shoulders to settle scores with the female group who also are not fully of one mind about a possible compromise. It goes to show that today's youth - or let me be more general - today's people, practice vendetta more than pacifism, and the blame is on feudalism, which has mutated itself to an ultra-strong force that produces madness in today's world. One will be impressed and hooked with the narrative in 30 minutes, guaranteed. While police apathy is one theme it touches upon, Pink is largely about what today's society, with its feudal roots, assumes when a woman consumes alcohol, when she hangs out with her male friends, when she keeps a casual relationship with that widower, when she has casual sex with that librarian she met while discussing Franz Kafka's ""The Trial"", or when she wears that transparent-lace brassiere - the possibilities are endless. It focuses on the futile point that a woman's (or a man's) character is defined by their behavior, their demeanor, their air at a given point of time and at a given location. It strains to enlighten us with the fact that this assumption is rubbish and full of void. It narrates the assumptions in strong points, delivered, some as innuendos ad others as clearly as text written on iron, by the talented Piyush Mishra as solicitor defending the male group. It also has a lot to say about the discrimination of Indians against their own brothers and sisters who hail from the Northeast, a topic which was most recently reignited by a TV commercial. The courtroom sequences are well-edited, but are slightly cheesy if not fast-paced for an audience whose senses have been numbed by the likes of Great Grand Masti (2016) and Freaky Ali (2016). A much- needed jolt to their senses, this film embraces realism wherever required and furnishes a story that is divinely appropriate and fabulously timed, just to convey an important message: that when a woman says NO, it means NO.The three actresses are marvelous and well-directed. There's not a single frame where they go out of character, helping the story to reveal itself using their own portrayals as windows of loud expressions. Sometimes, the most difficult characters to play are the ones that are so close to real life. Amitabh Bachchan again comes up and impresses his audience, hat-tricking his bout of roles that are aligned in the same column of crime thrillers. Mishra and supporting cast are very good, and happy to see Dhritiman Chatterjee. The film works partially because of the cast and their performance, along with some crisp writing, easy screenplay, and a subtle, but loud score.The 150-minute drama does, of course, have its share of flaws, but not substantial enough to affect your viewing or enjoyment. The courtroom scenes don't always sample realism, but that can be forgiven as a cinematic liberty taken by Mr. Chowdhury and writer Ritesh Shah. The hand of political influence which the male group were banking on fails to advance inside the court as is not what usually happens, either in real or reel life. But, one doesn't have time to pinpoint these petty flaws in the film because he or she also wants to assume that the women are not guilty or that the men are not guilty; this way, even the plot tries to play with you, making you believe in smoke and mirrors.It partially reminds one of Quentin Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs (1992), where the actual scene of the heist is never shown. Here, the actual scene is not clearly shown unless you are patient enough. So, don't miss the end credit roll.BOTTOM LINE: Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's debut Bollywood feature ""Pink"" is gritty, relevant, and a well-executed film that demands immediate viewing for it will be quoted in numerous occasions as we leap forward with a backward mind.

9.0,"PINK is dark, brave and a much needed film","PINK is what everyone needs to watch and understand today. Not just India, the world needs to stop stereotyping and objectifying women.The movie starts off with three girls, scared and terrified by the incident that was about to change their lives. What happens next are the instances that take place everyday in our country with working women, college going girls, models and almost every urban girl. In a country where political influence can buy anyone, a women is treated as an object. They are judged by what they wear, whom they hang out with and where they work.The movie is backed by some powerful performances. Taapsee shines as Minal, she is brilliant as a modern, independent and brave woman who isn't shy from admitting publicly that she isn't a virgin. She puts up a brave act. Her friends played by Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Taring support her well and together they all are great. One cannot not praise Mr.Bachchan. He plays every character with finesse and this isn't an exception. His character raises several questions that we as a society should think on. Although initially I kind of hated him in the movie but as the movie goes on you realize how aptly his character was written. Everyone else (Angad Bedi, Piyush Mishra etc) does justice to their role.Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury does full justice to the story. He puts up a great show and gives us a reality check of our hypocritical society where women are judged every now and then. The background score is decent. Although the songs aren't great, they suit the story and go with the flow. The dialogues are great and the screenplay is brilliant. What I liked most about this movie is that it is relatable, it is what many women face today. There's nothing new about this movie because this is reality and everyone of us knows it but this has to be presented to change people's mind. And it is undoubtedly presented very well. I hope people watch this movie and realize that its time to change our society.",pink is dark brave much needed film,pink is what everyone needs watch understand today not just india world needs stop stereotyping objectifying women movie starts off with three girls scared terrified by incident that was about change their lives what happens next are instances that take place everyday our country with working women college going girls models almost every urban girl country where political influence can buy anyone women is treated as object they are judged by what they wear whom they hang out with where they work movie is backed by some powerful performances taapsee shines as minal she is brilliant as modern independent brave woman who isnt shy admitting publicly that she isnt virgin she puts up brave act her friends played by kirti kulhari andrea taring support her well together they all are great one cannot not praise mr bachchan he plays every character with finesse this isnt exception his character raises several questions that we as society should think although initially i kind hated him movie but as movie goes you realize how aptly his character was written everyone else angad bedi piyush mishra etc does justice their role director aniruddha roy chowdhury does full justice story he puts up great show gives us reality check our hypocritical society where women are judged every now then background score is decent although songs arent great they suit story go with flow dialogues are great screenplay is brilliant what i liked most about this movie is that it is relatable it is what many women face today theres nothing new about this movie because this is reality everyone us knows it but this has be presented change peoples mind it is undoubtedly presented very well i hope people watch this movie realize that its time change our society,0.5534205693296602,0.2970615243342516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,A riveting thriller of today's darker society,"Often times, those who are nominated to positions of power and influence, bear a false sense of privilege that is misused and goes unchecked. In a city that is known exactly for a large number of such men, women tend to become the victims of misogyny and indignity. 'Pink' is a reflection of this deeply flawed society that even in today's times, instinctively falls back on stereotyping that is baseless. Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's social drama truly becomes a thriller of sorts in its second half when the trial exposes not just the victims and perpetrators but also the society which plays a huge role in determining who the guilty are. When a casual night out after a rock concert ends up with a bottle smashed into the face of a minister's nephew, the girls who were simply defending themselves from physical molesters have drawn curtains on a wild party life. Constantly in a state of nervous silence and anxious worry, their daily routines soon get affected by threats from the men who seek vengeance for the grave injury to their beloved friend. Minal Arora (Tapsee Pannu), in an impulsive act of rage and self-defense, smashed a bottle onto Rajveer Singh (Angad Bedi) who crossed the lines of decency when they were at a party. Unfortunately for Minal and her friends, Falak (Kirti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang), Rajveer happens to be the nephew of a powerful South Delhi politician. A series of harassment attempts affect their landlord, their workplace and even their casual coffee outings. Thus, even the FIR complaint against the harassment by Rajveer and his accomplices falls on deaf ears at the Police station and soon enough, a counter complaint gets Minal arrested for attempted murder. These proceedings are keenly observed by one of the neighbors where the girls live and seeing the injustice, offers to take their case even though he had retired as a renowned lawyer due to his mental illness. Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachchan) maybe old and weak but he knows the law better than most and with his more measured approach, he combats Prashant Mehra (Piyush Mishra), the prosecutor whose loud and boisterous accusations reflect the society's flawed mentality and baseless stereotyping. Mehra represents the bigotry of the orthodox Indian society that downplays the role of women and their rightful positions while questioning every action with a perverse and sick assumption. His loud and overpowering arguments are the embarrassing reality of the way many men think of women even in these times in an evolving society. In stark contrast, Deepak Sehgal tries to evaluate how low the society has fallen to mistreat and misjudge 3 innocent women who were victims of the power-hungry perpetrators. Can he help deliver unbiased justice to the girls while challenging the irregularities of society's stigma and prejudices? Pink hits the value system hard and the director keeps the viewer engaged with twists and revelations that keep the verdict hanging till the very end. Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari deliver riveting performances as they struggle through their altered realities. Tapsee mumbles her responses as a witness in the box but she portrays her shaken self quite convincingly. Falak is targeted by Mehra's accusations of prostitution and eventually, deviates from the planned defensive lines. Kirti's performance here is gut wrenching and her plight is understandable. Prashant Mehra's aggressive prosecution allows Piyush Mishra to thrive on his excellent dialogue delivery. He matches up to Amitabh Bachchan's commanding presence with his performance, thus charging the scene up for audiences to enjoy. As an aging Deepak Sehgal, Bachchan's portrayal of an acclaimed lawyer is powerful not only with his sheer presence and calculated dialogue delivery, but also the conviction with which he fervently supports the girls. The closing statement by Amitabh Bachchan is among his finest performances in recent times that also highlights the film's underlying theme. It's effect is moving and necessary to shake up the hypocrisy in a flawed society. However, while Mr. Sehgal's decision to fight for the girls comes as celebratory news in the plot line, there's hardly any communication among them in preparation for each hearing. That's precisely where we would've had a better understanding of why they behaved as they did in court. It still provides for riveting courtroom drama but for the kind of overall realism depicted by Chowdhury, this seems like a fundamental interaction that's almost omitted. Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury keeps the accusations louder than the defense and with good reason. The hypocrisy and outdated mentality resonate through the general population and in some cases, out of guilt of being a part of it. Pink is a very important film for today's times and as an influence for the future generations. It depicts the darker reality that we live with but choose to ignore it as it may not affect us directly. It demands a change in the way we think of women, a basic change in mentality that is needed to raise society as a whole and treat each other with respect and draw strict lines when it comes to individuality. 8.955 on a scale of 1-10.",riveting thriller todays darker society,often times those who are nominated positions power influence bear false sense privilege that is misused goes unchecked city that is known exactly large number such men women tend become victims misogyny indignity pink is reflection this deeply flawed society that even todays times instinctively falls back stereotyping that is baseless director aniruddha roy chowdhurys social drama truly becomes thriller sorts its second half when trial exposes not just victims perpetrators but also society which plays huge role determining who guilty are when casual night out after rock concert ends up with bottle smashed into face ministers nephew girls who were simply defending themselves physical molesters have drawn curtains wild party life constantly state nervous silence anxious worry their daily routines soon get affected by threats men who seek vengeance grave injury their beloved friend minal arora tapsee pannu impulsive act rage self defense smashed bottle onto rajveer singh angad bedi who crossed lines decency when they were at party unfortunately minal her friends falak kirti kulhari andrea andrea tariang rajveer happens be nephew powerful south delhi politician series harassment attempts affect their landlord their workplace even their casual coffee outings thus even fir complaint against harassment by rajveer his accomplices falls deaf ears at police station soon enough counter complaint gets minal arrested attempted murder these proceedings are keenly observed by one neighbors where girls live seeing injustice offers take their case even though he had retired as renowned lawyer due his mental illness deepak sehgal amitabh bachchan maybe old weak but he knows law better than most with his more measured approach he combats prashant mehra piyush mishra prosecutor whose loud boisterous accusations reflect societys flawed mentality baseless stereotyping mehra represents bigotry orthodox indian society that downplays role women their rightful positions while questioning every action with perverse sick assumption his loud overpowering arguments are embarrassing reality way many men think women even these times evolving society stark contrast deepak sehgal tries evaluate how low society has fallen mistreat misjudge 3 innocent women who were victims power hungry perpetrators can he help deliver unbiased justice girls while challenging irregularities societys stigma prejudices pink hits value system hard director keeps viewer engaged with twists revelations that keep verdict hanging till very end tapsee pannu kirti kulhari deliver riveting performances as they struggle through their altered realities tapsee mumbles her responses as witness box but she portrays her shaken self quite convincingly falak is targeted by mehras accusations prostitution eventually deviates planned defensive lines kirtis performance here is gut wrenching her plight is understandable prashant mehras aggressive prosecution allows piyush mishra thrive his excellent dialogue delivery he matches up amitabh bachchans commanding presence with his performance thus charging scene up audiences enjoy as aging deepak sehgal bachchans portrayal acclaimed lawyer is powerful not only with his sheer presence calculated dialogue delivery but also conviction with which he fervently supports girls closing statement by amitabh bachchan is among his finest performances recent times that also highlights films underlying theme its effect is moving necessary shake up hypocrisy flawed society however while mr sehgals decision fight girls comes as celebratory news plot line theres hardly any communication among them preparation each hearing thats precisely where we wouldve had better understanding why they behaved as they did court it still provides riveting courtroom drama but kind overall realism depicted by chowdhury this seems like fundamental interaction thats almost omitted director aniruddha roy chowdhury keeps accusations louder than defense with good reason hypocrisy outdated mentality resonate through general population some cases out guilt being part it pink is very important film todays times as influence future generations it depicts darker reality that we live with but choose ignore it as it may not affect us directly it demands change way we think women basic change mentality that is needed raise society as whole treat each other with respect draw strict lines when it comes individuality 8 955 scale 1 10,0.5419140383426098,0.056507280598189685,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,"Very much watchable, but sans Bachchan, it wouldn't impress as much","This movie had ""Bachchan"" written all over it. The movie is very much watchable with a very good story, power-packed acting by Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari, brilliant background score and capitalizing on AB's voice. Some key flaws were overshadowed by the strengths, though.Story (8/10): Pink is about something which has been said time and again about when a girl says ""NO"", it means ""NO"" and nothing else (I hope I don't need to mention the context here!). Ironically, a contrary of this is what Bollywood movies reiterated in the 80s and 90s through cheap songs. Three girls from a modest background trying to fight not just a bunch of misguided and politically powerful boys who tried to violated their modesty but also the society that often discourages them from doing the right thing, let alone support them. The plot is not at all new but the story had pretty new elements that showed that a girl's background, habits, clothes or even ""occupation"" has nothing to do or justify any kind of crime that happens to her. The story was powerful, flow was good enough. However, one major flaw was the projection of antagonists which was very weak - something that takes the sheen away from protagonists as well. With the kind of reputation Ritesh Shah carries - with Airlift, CityLights, and Kahaani in his pocket - it didn't elevate.Acting (9/10): Besides the obvious - Bachchan - two actors to watch out for was Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari who gave brilliant performances. Their expressions and dialog delivery was really good. No major names in the rest of the cast. The movie was largely shouldered by Amitabh Bachchan. I am simply amazed at how this legend continues to do this year after years and there is no stopping - in fact, he elevates it every single time. However, there was a drought on the antagonists' side where there were no major names to call for. Villains aren't intimidating enough, except for the inexplicable rage attacks (if I may say so). I would have loved to see someone like KK Menon there. Great antagonists make great courtroom drama as well - be it in Kanoon, Waqt, Damini or OMG.Direction (9/10): In his Hindi directorial debut, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury was impressive. The flow of the movie was just right and never felt it was losing audience attention. What I loved was the way he projected different perceptions prevailing in the current society regarding crimes against women in a very subtle manner. In that process, he also portrays certain ironies where women themselves are involved in suppressing any voice raised against such crimes. He also touched upon the issue of discrimination against the people of North East - in general, and especially girls. However, he capitalized heavily on Amitabh Bachchan's voice and relied largely on him to bring this movie to success.Overall (9/10): I loved it, even though I have seen better. For Amitabh fans, which practically the entire country, this movie is a treat. But remove him, hypothetically, and I doubt if this movie would have made such a huge impact.",very much watchable but sans bachchan it wouldnt impress as much,this movie had bachchan written all over it movie is very much watchable with very good story power packed acting by bachchan tapsee pannu kirti kulhari brilliant background score capitalizing abs voice some key flaws were overshadowed by strengths though story 8 10 pink is about something which has been said time again about when girl says no it means no nothing else i hope i dont need mention context here ironically contrary this is what bollywood movies reiterated 80s 90s through cheap songs three girls modest background trying fight not just bunch misguided politically powerful boys who tried violated their modesty but also society that often discourages them doing right thing let alone support them plot is not at all new but story had pretty new elements that showed that girls background habits clothes or even occupation has nothing do or justify any kind crime that happens her story was powerful flow was good enough however one major flaw was projection antagonists which was very weak something that takes sheen away protagonists as well with kind reputation ritesh shah carries with airlift citylights kahaani his pocket it didnt elevate acting 9 10 besides obvious bachchan two actors watch out was tapsee pannu kirti kulhari who gave brilliant performances their expressions dialog delivery was really good no major names rest cast movie was largely shouldered by amitabh bachchan i am simply amazed at how this legend continues do this year after years there is no stopping fact he elevates it every single time however there was drought antagonists side where there were no major names call villains arent intimidating enough except inexplicable rage attacks if i may say so i would have loved see someone like kk menon there great antagonists make great courtroom drama as well be it kanoon waqt damini or omg direction 9 10 his hindi directorial debut aniruddha roy chowdhury was impressive flow movie was just right never felt it was losing audience attention what i loved was way he projected different perceptions prevailing current society regarding crimes against women very subtle manner that process he also portrays certain ironies where women themselves are involved suppressing any voice raised against such crimes he also touched upon issue discrimination against people north east general especially girls however he capitalized heavily amitabh bachchans voice relied largely him bring this movie success overall 9 10 i loved it even though i have seen better amitabh fans which practically entire country this movie is treat but remove him hypothetically i doubt if this movie would have made such huge impact,0.5939639905548997,0.23499547422274697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.23}"

10.0,'NO' is a statement...'YES' it is,"The site's movie description says, 'When three young women are implicated in a crime; a retired lawyer steps forward to help them clear their names'. WOW! that's it? That's enough to describe this masterpiece right? Well there's more to this movie than just this sentence. First of all, this movie if put on a filmy metric scale would show the real potential of the Bollywood's film making ability. This film is an answer to all those movie lovers who were eagerly waiting for an amazing content in Hindi cinema for a long time. This is hence an important film for the entire Indian cinema fraternity. 'PINK' in its title itself is unique and it says a lot. This film throws light on the most appearing news on Indian tabloids and unfortunately that's the most ignored news as well,which is 'violence against women'. And that's exactly why this film is so important. The writer dedicates the entire first half to set the plot and foundation with the help of some terrific performances by each and every cast. The second half is a seat gripping court room drama, where Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Sir) lists a set of 'rules' during the proceeding of the case in court. These rules are nothing but the ways in which modern day women are being stereotyped in our country. Finally he concludes his arguments by explaining the meaning of the smallest yet powerful word 'NO'...and A NO MEANS NO. Let's hope that the cynical, misogynistic, chauvinistic men population of our nation will understand its meaning after watching this movie, at least now! A special applause for the three lead actresses Tapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, and Andrea Tariang who pulled their roles off with ease. Needless to mention our shehenshah, when his mere voice can play such roles brilliantly, its a 'baayen haath ka khel' for him. After a spectacular performance in Te3n and now with this film, I think he's a strong contender for the 2016 national award for the best actor. I don't want to find any flaw, So its a must watch people,don't miss such exceptional movies and complaint later that Bollywood doesn't make sensible movies. More than everything, the concepts like 'ZERO FIR' are so informative and the points like 'women and minors can get bail on weekends and the bail proceedings can be heard at a judge's residence on Saturday and Sunday' needs to be educated to every girl child of our country.

10.0,Stupendous! speechless,"A brilliant film! Salute to the director's and writer's conviction and message. The typical mindset that is prevalent that if a woman goes to a party and drinks or jokes with a guy ...she will be willing for sex. The stigma that every male chauvinist has been harboring has to change. A woman has the freedom to laugh or drink, wear whatever she likes or attend parties. That doesn't give any man the right to presume that she is a slut or she is ready to sleep with anyone. And that change is only possible when every mother educates her son to respect women and learn to accept NO for an answer. I seriously wish more writers & directors come up with such brilliant messages that can be an eye opener to all communities who look down upon women for being bold.
