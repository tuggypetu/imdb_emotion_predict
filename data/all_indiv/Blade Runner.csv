,A Milestone Of Science Fiction And A Cyberpunk Masterpiece,"A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director). It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy"", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",milestone science fiction cyberpunk masterpiece,feast eyes dark uncompromising with haunting musical score by vangelis that adds hypnotic quality those breathtaking megacity landscapes future los angeles ridley scotts adaptation philip k dicks post apocalyptic bounty hunter story do androids dream electric sheep is visionary work art its dystopian masterpiece id personally call it as much milestone science fiction as kubricks 2001 be advised watch version known as final cut if you want catch blade runner as it was intended by its director its hard overstate how influential film was it invented sci fi subgenre now known as cyberpunk it was also first film noir sci fi setting although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial mere eye candy it is philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about nature being human its slow brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used different pace more action underwhelmed but make no mistake this is groundbreaking masterwork its genre timeles classic 10 stars out 10 favorite films imdb com list mkjokvqlsbs lesser known masterpieces imdb com list ls070242495,0.44603174603174606,0.1130952380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,"A glorious, timeless nightmare","Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982).Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)",glorious timeless nightmare,dark deep uncertain unsettling imagine most beautiful nightmare youve ever had this is blade runner 1982 ridley scotts blade runner is brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions making it simply ten times more important than any film its genre i love it not only initial feeling it gives but because its perseverance none visuals themes or technology feel dated but as deep gripping current as ever it is timeless beauty with huge doses emotion set 2019 los angeles blade runner zooms eerily lit urban streets city follows richard deckard superbly played by harrison ford who brings exquisite moral ambiguity his character special policeman who tracks down terminates artificially created humans called replicants who have escaped off world colony made their way earth need be stopped things deckard encounters his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like who is really replicant are replicants really bad if replicants are bad when why did we go such lengths with our technology create them are replicants really humans is deckard hero this truly is film that demands subsequent discussion its ambiguous ending leave haunting eerie feeling spite rich glaze science fiction futurism coating this adventure there are distinct film noir elements present primarily bluish haze that film is seen through its gritty urban atmosphere whoever thought this combination is genius since it is all about technology it fits then that blade runner features ridiculous amount product placement especially atari any other film this would have felt out place but here it is simply perfect score by vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with striking cinematography film blade runner deserves credit celebration remembrance it is simply excellent film 10 out 10 i dont just throw this grade out like some people,0.5871153223194041,0.1820051830255912,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"

9.0,Still outshines the others 17 years later,"Blade Runner belongs on a list of 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out of the theater in a stupor as though hit by a sledgehammer, the first time I saw it. It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called ""entertainment"" we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the ""happy ending"" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. ""I don't know how long we had together. Who does?"" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.After ""Blade Runner"", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an ""oldie"" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.The more I think of it, the more I realize that ""Blade Runner"" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre. I wish Ridley Scott would return to science fiction, but then again today's Hollywood would never release a movie like ""Blade Runner.""",still outshines others 17 years later,blade runner belongs list 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out theater stupor as though hit by sledgehammer first time i saw it it fulfills one my requirements great films that i walked out theater different person than when i entered it fulfilled another requirement that it improved with repeated viewings there is so much take visually intellectually emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at first viewing trying sort it all out unlike so called entertainment we get today at movies this film didnt spoonfeed its meaning you it left ending ambiguous so your imagination has supply it film demands discussion there are so many topics debate is deckard replicant do deckard rachel live happily ever after why is there unicorn directors cut is deckard hero or are replicants really good guys every time i watch it my answers change i may be one few that really likes original probably because ive seen that version couple dozen times since 1982 before directors cut came out this may contradict what i said earlier about being spoonfed but i liked narration because it explained what was going deckards mind i didnt mind happy ending because it still implied that their troubles may not be over i dont know how long we had together who does but with that version memorized i now appreciate directors cut it probably has better ending at least i think so until i view it again its also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like sean young daryl hannah m emmet walsh william sanderson edward james olmos i think they all did great job vangelis did beautiful moving score after blade runner most big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down good guys vs bad guys with lots loud explosions your face effects very simplistic messages if any thats why i still contend that oldie like blade runner still outshines them all it has incredible special effects but never at expense story cityscapes do more than dazzle you they involve you more i think it more i realize that blade runner is not only my favorite science fiction movie but one my favorite films any genre i wish ridley scott would return science fiction but then again todays hollywood would never release movie like blade runner,0.5475267626430417,0.28285932413839393,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,New Blu-Ray Disc Made Me A Blade Runner Fan,"Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder.""Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it's his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away. This is, indeed, an amazing film.",new blu ray disc made me blade runner fan,sometimes you just need give film second chance even if it is 20 years later only some rave reviews about picture quality this new 5 disc complete collectors edition enticed me watch this again wow i am glad this was very entertaining tremendous visual audio treat i actually appreciated audio best because even this new blu ray era one doesnt often find film with very active surround speakers however this restored version did sound is at point best ive heard blu ray disc or any dvd that matter visuals well fans blade runner know all about them they are fantastic scene after scene reminded me stanley kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called jacobs ladder because there are so many things see hear story is different one filled with strange characters i can see where people would watch this film multiple times enjoy it very much each time collectors edition has best picture ever according director ridley scott is version im most pleased with it has added scenes one didnt see earlier versions rest dvd has those earlier versions apparently there are several including those with harrison ford doing narration like out late 40s film noir speaking latter thats what this film looked like combination film noir or neo noir sci fi movie it has many dark images fantastic night time scenes wonderful closeups always interesting color palette sci fi films usually get dated hurry thanks ever increasing special effects progress movie industry but this still looks very good despite being made over 25 years ago blade runner still looks very much state art scott says this is best version best his film has ever looked sounded since its his movie who am i argue so if youre like me never gave this movie chance i lost interest halfway through with my vhs look at it give this second look this blu ray edition you will be blown away this is indeed amazing film,0.4811237741849987,0.3042088523721177,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...","Blade Runner describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called ""replicants""; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth. Made by Tyrell Corporation under the motto ""more humans than humans"" -especially the ""Nexus-6"" models- not only resembles humans, they are far superior physically.The replicants were declared illegal on planet Earth after a bloody mutiny occurred on the planet Mars, where they worked as slaves. A special police force, Blade Runners, is in charge of identifying, tracking and killing - or ""withdrawing"", in terms of the police itself - the fugitive replicants found on Earth. With a group of replicants loose in Los Angeles, Rick Deckard, the best agent that has existed in regard to the recovery and removal of the replicas, is removed from his semi-retirement to use some of ""the old magic blade runner"".Ridley Scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style and futuristic design is so well made that accomplished to create a visual vocabulary: neon lights, abandonment, decay, loneliness, obscurity, indifference and alienation are the core of the aesthetics of the film, which will eventually become and serve as a pattern for successive cinematographic works.The script David Webb Peoples adapted from 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' takes the viewer into a dwelling and philosophical controversy, as it creates doubt and empathy to the so called replicants, primarily as seen in many shots of Rick Deckard hesitating about the true nature of his task.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer haunts the attention into the essence of the story. Their characterization throughout infiltrates the different conceptions of life. A saddened soul searching for the meaning of his punished existence and the other, ruminating a task sinking him into a moral void brimming with guilt.At the end, the movie leaves you wondering about the implications the creation of highly intelligent beings (IA) must have and, if it's worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that the difference is non existent.""Time... to die"".10/10.",all those moments will be lost time like tears rain,blade runner describes future which through genetics artificial humans are manufactured called replicants employees dangerous jobs slaves outer colonies earth made by tyrell corporation under motto more humans than humans especially nexus 6 models not only resembles humans they are far superior physically replicants were declared illegal planet earth after bloody mutiny occurred planet mars where they worked as slaves special police force blade runners is charge identifying tracking killing or withdrawing terms police itself fugitive replicants found earth with group replicants loose los angeles rick deckard best agent that has existed regard recovery removal replicas is removed his semi retirement use some old magic blade runner ridley scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style futuristic design is so well made that accomplished create visual vocabulary neon lights abandonment decay loneliness obscurity indifference alienation are core aesthetics film which will eventually become serve as pattern successive cinematographic works script david webb peoples adapted do androids dream electric sheep takes viewer into dwelling philosophical controversy as it creates doubt empathy so called replicants primarily as seen many shots rick deckard hesitating about true nature his task harrison ford rutger hauer haunts attention into essence story their characterization throughout infiltrates different conceptions life saddened soul searching meaning his punished existence other ruminating task sinking him into moral void brimming with guilt at end movie leaves you wondering about implications creation highly intelligent beings ia must have if its worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that difference is non existent time die 10 10,0.5361172161172162,0.11184065934065934,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10.0,One of Ridley Scott's best,"Blade Runner is quite simply wonderful, and not only is it one of Ridley Scott's best films, but also one of the best of the genre. For one thing, the visuals are superb. Not just in the special effects which are just mind-blowing but also in the cinematography, colours and sets. Another strong asset is the score, in fact Blade Runner is easily one of Vangelis's best by how mysterious and haunting it all is.The story is just great. True, it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it, but that is not a flaw in any way, quite the contrary. The story is very compelling, and also very deep thematically. Blade Runner is further advantaged by memorable dialogue, superb direction by Scott and good pacing. I can understand why some are underwhelmed by the ending, I was at first, but the more I saw the film the more the ending made sense to me. Finally the performances. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast, and Sean Young supports him admirably, but the real star of the cast is Rutgar Hauer who is outstanding in his role.In conclusion, a brilliant film and something Scott should be proud of. 10/10 Bethany Cox",one ridley scotts best,blade runner is quite simply wonderful not only is it one ridley scotts best films but also one best genre one thing visuals are superb not just special effects which are just mind blowing but also cinematography colours sets another strong asset is score fact blade runner is easily one vangeliss best by how mysterious haunting it all is story is just great true it is sort film you need see more than once understand appreciate it but that is not flaw any way quite contrary story is very compelling also very deep thematically blade runner is further advantaged by memorable dialogue superb direction by scott good pacing i can understand why some are underwhelmed by ending i was at first but more i saw film more ending made sense me finally performances harrison ford is perfectly cast sean young supports him admirably but real star cast is rutgar hauer who is outstanding his role conclusion brilliant film something scott should be proud 10 10 bethany cox,0.6848809523809523,0.5404603174603174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.14}"
7.0,Adding My Voice to a Loud Chorus,"I was 15 when the film was released in 1982.

That is when the ""Director's Cut"" was released theatrically. I was now 25 years. I wanted to see this because I saw a clip on television and someone saying this film was meant to be seen on the ""Big Screen"" and so off I went. This cut of the film is most well known for being the version that ""Took Away"" the Harrison Ford Voice Overs. It also included a shot of a unicorn that implied that ""Harrison Ford"" is a Replicant. I was not blown away by this film. I thought it was ""good"" not ""great""The story does take its time but the rewards are huge if you pay close attention. . Its haunting images are so memorable that it influenced future filmmakers.

10.0,"A compelling, thematically-deep SF film","This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it. The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures. ""Blade Runner"" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself. These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a ""blade runner"". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story's setting. However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford's character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard's life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up. By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development. However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story's themes. Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot. The film's power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film's brilliance may be lost on you. The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who ""gets"" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.""Blade Runner"" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history.",compelling thematically deep sf film,this is truly one greatest science fiction films ever made one that requires thinking viewer order understand appreciate it directors cut is recommended one see as it omits somewhat distracting narration avoids unnecessary hollywood style ending that is at odds with rest films tone true science fiction story or film is about ideas not spaceship battles futuristic gadgets or weird creatures blade runner fully qualifies as this its examination impact technology human society existence very nature humanity itself these themes are set fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as viewer is immersed dystopian futuristic los angeles harrison ford fans accustomed normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as replicant hunting detective known as blade runner they should be this dissatisfaction is part film experience part dehumanized existence storys setting however as story unfolds we see fords character rick deckard slowly come alive again recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants replicants genetically engineered human cyborgs that deckard must hunt down kill are many ways more alive than deckard himself initially their escape off world colony has explicit self directed purpose whereas deckards life appears have none other than his job one that he has tried give up by some standards deckard replicants have thin character development however this is deeply thematic philosophical film as such characters are tools storys themes each character reflects some aspect humanity or human existence but they lack others each is broken ways that reflect broken society which they live were conceived created there are several dramatic moments involving life death struggles but most these are more subdued than normal detective story plot films power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery dark futuristic cityscape its philosophical themes among themes explored are following dehumanization people through society shaped by technological capitalistic excess roles creator creation their mutual enslavement their role reversal i e creations triumph over its creator nature humanity itself emotions memory purpose desire cruelty technological mastery environment universe mortality death more personal identity self awareness meaning existence if you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes films brilliance may be lost you climax involves soliloquy that brings many themes together simple yet wonderfully poetic way anyone who gets film should be moved by this others will sadly miss point may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead blade runner is masterpiece that deserves recognition long remembrance film history,0.42474894719792683,0.04280560709132138,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.49}"
,One of the Best Looking Dark Films Ever Made,"Blade Runner (1982)** 1/2 (out of 4) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is one of the best Blade Runner's in the business. A Blade Runner is a person who is paid to go after illegal replicants and the most recent case has him going after four including the sadistic Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER was released with minor fans but overtime it grew into what many consider one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. It's really hard to judge or rate this movie because it's available in so many different versions. This viewing here was actually the third version I've seen and I gotta say that if you have to keep re-editing, adding and altering a movie then I question how good it is to begin with.I know many people consider BLADE RUNNER to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I honestly get their reaction but I certainly don't share it. The film is certainly one of the most brilliantly looking movies ever made. Visually this film is rather incredible as director Scott has no problem creating the mood of this dark city as well as the rather grim nature. The special effects, costume design, sets and music score are all flawless and perfectly capture a terrific vision.With that said, I think there's a lot more style than substance here. Not for a second did I ever get totally involved in the ""story"" going on. I thought it was a rather interesting idea but storywise there's nothing great here. I also thought the slow nature was a bit too boring. I know this is a thinking man's approach but it just didn't work with me. With that said, the ending is quite excellent and I thought the scenes between Ford and Hauer were extremely effective.The performances from the entire cast is another major plus with Ford perfect in the role, which is a throwback to the type of detectives that we'd see in film noir titles of the 40s and 50s. Hauer makes for a great villain and we get nice support from Sean Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joe Turkel and Daryl Hannah among others.Again, I understand why some call BLADE RUNNER one of the greatest films ever made. In my opinion, the original theatrical cut is quite poor. The Director's Cut was certainly an improvement. Having now just watched ""The Final Cut"" it reall didn't improve too much from the director's cut. As is, I'd probably recommend the Director's Cut.",one best looking dark films ever made,blade runner 1982 1 2 out 4 rick deckard harrison ford is one best blade runners business blade runner is person who is paid go after illegal replicants most recent case has him going after four including sadistic roy batty rutger hauer ridley scotts blade runner was released with minor fans but overtime it grew into what many consider one greatest science fiction movies ever made its really hard judge or rate this movie because its available so many different versions this viewing here was actually third version ive seen i gotta say that if you have keep re editing adding altering movie then i question how good it is begin with i know many people consider blade runner be one greatest movies ever made i honestly get their reaction but i certainly dont share it film is certainly one most brilliantly looking movies ever made visually this film is rather incredible as director scott has no problem creating mood this dark city as well as rather grim nature special effects costume design sets music score are all flawless perfectly capture terrific vision with that said i think theres lot more style than substance here not second did i ever get totally involved story going i thought it was rather interesting idea but storywise theres nothing great here i also thought slow nature was bit too boring i know this is thinking mans approach but it just didnt work with me with that said ending is quite excellent i thought scenes between ford hauer were extremely effective performances entire cast is another major plus with ford perfect role which is throwback type detectives that wed see film noir titles 40s 50s hauer makes great villain we get nice support sean young m emmet walsh edward james olmos william sanderson joe turkel daryl hannah among others again i understand why some call blade runner one greatest films ever made my opinion original theatrical cut is quite poor directors cut was certainly improvement having now just watched final cut it reall didnt improve too much directors cut as is id probably recommend directors cut,0.6077380952380952,0.32107371794871803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Living in Fear in a Quest for Life,"In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the Tyrell Corporation releases the evolution of robots in the Nexus phase with Replicants that are identical to humans, but with superior strength and agility and the intelligence of the genetic engineers who created them. They are used off-world as slave labor in the colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill. The execution of a Replicant is called retirement.In November 2019, in Los Angeles, the retired Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned by his former chief Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) that assigns him to hunt down four Replicants that are hidden in Los Angeles. Deckard studies the profiles of Roy (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and finds that they had been designed with four years lifespan maximum and they tried to infiltrate themselves in the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard visits their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), in his corporation. Sr. Tyrell asks Deckard to demonstrate his Voigt Kampff method to discover the Replicants in his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) and Deckard concludes that she is a sophisticated Replicant but she does not know. When Deckard ""retires"" Zhora and Leon, he feels affected by their deaths and by the question of Rachel whether he has tested himself to know whether he is a Replicant. But he needs to end his mission and find Roy and Pris. ""Blade Runner"" is a melancholic work of art that raises existential questions about fear, life, death, emotions, mortality, humanity, dehumanization and love among other philosophical questions in an environment totally destroyed by excessive pollution, technology, marketing and consumption. The wrecked Earth is left to police and little people only, the others inhabitants have moved to the colonies in the off-world. The conflict appears when the retired Blade Runner Deckard is forced to hunt down Replicants again but now with different feelings, after falling in love for the Replicant Rachel and in doubt whether he is also a Replicant. Sean Young certainly has the best role of her career. The bleak cinematography and special effects are awesome and the soundtrack of Vangelis is among the most beautiful of the cinema history. I can not precisely say how many times I have watched the different versions of this film that is among my five favorite movies in the movie-theater, on VHS, on DVD and now on Blu-Ray, but my guess is at least twelve times. The last times I had seen this film were on 06 May 2000 and 31 May 2003.

,Finest hour.,"This is simply Scott's finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot.

9.0,Timeless,"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been covered in preceding decennia? Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I would suggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt, Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its concepts at a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the 1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10.",timeless,what can be said about this film that hasnt already been covered preceding decennia blade runner either version stands test time as epic story which transcends disparity genres as well as seminal dark sci fi film which has been mimicked so frequently varying degrees success since its original release interplay film noir sci fi what is one most philosophically symbolic academically analyzed narratives modern era holds its ground both visual cerebral levels even face todays cgi laden blockbusters new directors cut contrary many cinematic re hashings actually serves clarify many more nebulous aspects plot makes great film even better arguably allowing it be modernized polished new generation viewers who are more picky yet simultaneously less idealistic all while sustaining feeling flavor original call it restorative work if you will tinny meandering score by vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding fits texture mood film beautifully indeed many reasons finding this film someones dvd collection makes true statement about their discriminating refined taste movies equally their appreciation film as artistic medium i would suggest picking up reader by someone like nietzsche foucualt descartes kierkegaard or any great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film order appreciate story its concepts at whole new level regardless if youre watching it either 1st or 100th time enduring classic intrepid piece film making with rich often haunting visuals designed entertain promote introspection amongst its viewers 9 10,0.44990817263544536,0.2918699986881804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,A frame to die for.,"I spent a weekend with the new DVD set of Blade Runner. Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris's acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, ""why in the world would the characters do that?!"" But here's what's interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth's marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard's life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford's delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience's hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn't even really know what he's found. Things don't magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it's a movie it's a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard's briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel's scenes in Deckard's apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  ""If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes,"" he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.As for which cut of the film, I don't think any single one is perfect (and I'd honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the ""Final Cut"" over the others and admire Ridley Scott's restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won't even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy's beckoning of Sebastian could've been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don't have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it's still a beautiful film to just  watch.",frame die,i spent weekend with new dvd set blade runner watched all four versions pretty much back back minus work print version starting with us theatrical finishing with final cut across those eight hours i spent with film i did not get tired watching just watching that futuristic film noir vibe deep dark shadows majestic use light color used make run down polluted cityscape look so beautiful fact when i got final cut which had been cleaned up restored remixed picture sound quite literally took my breath away blade runner is easily one best looking films ever made some ways many ways blade runner strikes me as silly particularly its more climactic moments where protagonist faces off against replicant priss acrobatic means attacking deckard when roy batty chases deckard his shorts when few moments before he was fully clothed film goes over top point where i find myself asking why world would characters do that but heres whats interesting as silly as blade runner may get it never betrays its own world everything that happens some queer way feels natural this strange futuristic world i like movie its action scenes but i simply adore it during quieter moments parts where not whole hell lot is happening you can simply watch absorb jordan cronenweths marvelous cinematography my favorite scene comes when rachel has saved deckards life emotional wreck killing another replicant top revelation that she herself is replicant she stands by window where light floods so much light that whole screen goes white then it recedes again we see characters again later that same scene she sits at piano plays bit then lets her hair down hearing deckard stumbling other room she looks out corner her eye shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over frame plus some other quiet moments resonate with truer low key science fiction feel such as scene tyrell corporation where deckard applies voight kampff test rachel more or less mundane questionaire interview with typical sci fi gadget sitting table but ridley scott terry rawlings compacts lengthy endeavor into few short moments using stunningly simple montage later deckard sits front voice activated screen analyzing photograph task is presented as dull monotonous job made especially evident harrison fords delivery yet scene itself never bores voice activation not only serves as staple sci fi device but cleverly allows deckard take audiences hand guide them through this investigative process perhaps what i like most about scene audience even deckard himself doesnt even really know what hes found things dont magically fall into place with scooby doo moment revelation he finds another clue that might lead somewhere albeit since its movie its good guess clue does lead somewhere my mind at least moments such as voight kampff scenes deckards briefing photograph analysis both rachels scenes deckards apartment gives world blade runner solid grounding so later it can get away with absurd which brings me replicants roy batty rutger hauer particular whose strangely sympathetic that his murderous tendencies spawn directly his fear dying this is man who possesses strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around earth sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has few short moments why should shmuck like deckard live 50 years when roy his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off shoulder orion seen c beams glitter dark if only you could see what ive seen with your eyes he proudly warmly tells one scientists who helped create him as which cut film i dont think any single one is perfect id honestly watch any them heartbeat i prefer final cut over others admire ridley scotts restraint his definitive dvd release most modifications are fine tuning tweaks casual viewer wont even notice unless watching two version back back most said fine tuning improve film although admittingly roys beckoning sebastian couldve been left out but hell all versions blade runner are included so people dont have much room complain about changes no matter what version you go with its still beautiful film just watch,0.4808716585944309,0.13513387052991008,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,"""Los Angeles, November, 2019"" - an unforgettable movie theater experience","I saw ""Blade Runner"" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the ""Director's Cut"" or ""Final Cut"", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.""Blade Runner"" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be ""retired"" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Los Angeles, November, 2019"". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little ""action"", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like ""Blade Runner"" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED.

10.0,The Last Great Noir,"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.Finally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don't give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated ""Lord of the Rings"" sheen common in today's effects-driven blockbusters.

6.0,"good atmosphere/ production design, but everything else was weak","This movie is obscenely over rated. It is clear that ALL the attention was given to the production design and overall look to the film, as the script (no matter the 'version') is awful. For a film so raved about by nearly every critic, the plot is cookie cutter and drab. The pacing is, well, there simply isn't any pacing. It is S L O W. The characters are completely uninteresting and the film isn't deep or genuinely philosophical enough to warrant the attention it asks us to pay. There are many parts that are simply goofy and unintentionally funny, like when Rutger Hauer pops his head through the wall towards the end and says something silly, or when Darryl Hannah could have killed Deckard but instead decides to back up and then do a bunch of goofy gymnastics flips in order to give him time to pick up his gun and blow her ""guts"" out.

10.0,A movie you have to watch twice,"First time I saw this I wasn't impressed. Maybe because I expected more action from a Sci-Fi movie. Then I rented it on VHS, and upon re-watching I figured something out: This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. if I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself.",movie you have watch twice,first time i saw this i wasnt impressed maybe because i expected more action sci fi movie then i rented it vhs upon re watching i figured something out this is one very few movies that gets better more often you see it it is subtle movie slowly but surely this one has made it into top 5 my best movies all time list i dont particularly care directors cut version though inner monologue is missing which gives you some most thought inspiring moments some added scenes downright make no sense at all if id seen that one first i might never have given it second chance cast is exceptional every one them does really fine job especially rutger hauer who otherwise has very few good movies his name maybe day falcon delivers stunning performance most cast who were unknown before this movie have moved fame some fortune rightfully so technical point view there is not much criticize more than 20 years later this movie still doesnt look dated apart atari neon signs atmosphere is created with lot attention detail models buildings are some most beautiful believable ones i have ever seen now i recently read book which it is based do androids dream electric sheep by philip k dick its quirky read frankly not very good book it has too many plot holes deus ex machina devices logical inconsistencies plus total letdown ending what it does add movie is setup why atmosphere is like it is polluted dark many freaks around nice question whether hero might be replicant himself,0.481713200379867,0.24616524216524222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Intriguingly Philosophical,"Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"". The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span. This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director's cut to boot. A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant. It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil. Corruption is everywhere. The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40's, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music. Rachael's entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40's.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues. This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional. Much of the set was pulled off using models. In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated. These guys really knew what they were doing. I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it. Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford. I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role. His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director's Cut). Rutger Hauer's performance was intense. His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical. Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive. Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp. It works on so many remarkable levels. The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live? Why do I have to die? What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care? Is this all merely an illusion? At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant. Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today. In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success.",intriguingly philosophical,blade runner directed by ridley scott based philip k dicks novel do androids dream electric sheep is sci fi slash noir film about cop named rick deckard harrison ford decrepit 2019 los angeles whose job it is retire four genetically engineered syborgues known as replicants four fugitives pris daryl hannah zhora joanna cassidy leon brion james their leader roy batty rutger hauer have escaped off world colony order find their creator bully him into expanding their pre determined four year life span this film originally flopped when it came out 1982 but since has become widely acclaimed cult classic with directors cut boot large part success that this movie has received can be attributed its ability operate many different levels ridley scotts hauntingly possible depiction what might become los angeles down line is absolutely brilliant it captures elements noir with its urban atmosphere decadence lighting characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil corruption is everywhere garbage littered streets permanence dark rain give us sense that weve seriously screwed up atmosphere impression that all respectable human beings have fled off world colonies leaving only scum earth behind there is hint style 40s especially with respect cars costumes music rachaels entire outfit including her hair screams 40s soundtrack arranged by vangelis who won oscar his chariots fire score consisted mainly jazz blues this functioned represent dark moody world uncertainty pessimism special effects were exceptional much set was pulled off using models my opinion sets made by hand require leagues more skill are much more impressive realistic than those computer generated these guys really knew what they were doing i was especially fond pyramidesque tyrell corporation building which hinted at god like presence eldon tyrell joe turkell creator script hampton fancher david peoples course phil dick worked me as well as actors who gave voice it harrison ford was well harrison ford i thought he did tremendous job down playing role his voice over narration helped you along was yet another feature conducive film noir apparently this was taken out directors cut rutger hauers performance was intense his lines at end were intriguingly philosophical daryl hannahs chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive joanna cassidy was just plain hot there is more this film than just pulp it works so many remarkable levels movie itself is detective noir quest meaning life science fiction environment but story is commentary what it means be human questions each one us have about life like how long have i live why do i have die what happens when i die doesnt my maker care is this all merely illusion at end film we are left wonder if these replicants are human if deckard himself is fact replicant scott raises more questions here than he answers as result critics are still debating mysteries this film today sense ambiguity blade runner is culprit its success,0.5061295351473922,0.14150110801896515,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,important sci-fi film,"Early in the 21st Century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase known as Replicants. Replicants were used Off-world as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny, they were declared illegal on earth and Blade Runner units were created to retire trespassing Replicants. It's 2019 Los Angeles. Policeman Gaff (Edward James Olmos) brings in ex-blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) orders him to track down four escaped Nexus 6 models. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Pris (Daryl Hannah). Deckard goes to test the new Nexus 6 model by using the machine on Rachael (Sean Young). Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) hasn't told her. The Replicants track down Hannibal Chew (James Hong) and J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to meet Tyrell.I remember first seeing this on cable with the happy ending. It remains the version I like the most despite its inherit contradiction. I still like the shock of the green with the Vangelis music driving into the future. Also I like the voice-overs despite their detractors. I love the final voice-over during the happy ending which is eliminated in the final cut. In addition, I cannot abide by Deckard being a Replicant. This is great cyberpunk vision of the future. Its designs are still influential. I love the hard-boiled noir genre being married to a sci-fi movie. It does move slowly in the middle but I accept that flaw. It is meticulous and detailed visually. The Philip K. Dick story is compelling.

6.0,I just don't get it....,"I admit right up front that I am perplexed by this film and my review will no doubt annoy a lot of fans of this film. Let's face it, ""Blade Runner"" is a cult film--and those who like it usually don't just like it--they adore it. I've known several people who insist rather rabidly that it's one of the greatest films of all time. And, when I tell them that I don't particularly like the film, they are confused---'how could anyone not love the film?' often say. In one case, the film lover insisted that I borrow his Director's Cut (one of about 17 different Director's Cuts or Special Editions, I think) because I must have been mistaken. Well, after my second viewing, I did enjoy and appreciate the film a bit more. But I still didn't get the devotion to this film it often receives.Here is what I liked and didn't like about the film. It had great sets and was VERY other-worldly. While I think the print was a bit too dark, I understand this was done to fit the very dark mood of the film. However, I just felt the film was too dark--oppressively dark...even sadistically dark (such as the eye gouging scene). It completely depressed me--so much so that I found I just didn't like or care about anyone. And, to top it off, the film ended very badly. The director's original ending (where you learn that Harrison Ford's character is also a replicant) would have been so much better. So, this is one case where the Director's Cut is definitely better, as this original ending has been restored. Overall, the film looks impressive and is original--but these alone were not enough for me to give it a glowing endorsement. It's good but that is all.",i just dont get it,i admit right up front that i am perplexed by this film my review will no doubt annoy lot fans this film lets face it blade runner is cult film those who like it usually dont just like it they adore it ive known several people who insist rather rabidly that its one greatest films all time when i tell them that i dont particularly like film they are confused how could anyone not love film often say one case film lover insisted that i borrow his directors cut one about 17 different directors cuts or special editions i think because i must have been mistaken well after my second viewing i did enjoy appreciate film bit more but i still didnt get devotion this film it often receives here is what i liked didnt like about film it had great sets was very other worldly while i think print was bit too dark i understand this was done fit very dark mood film however i just felt film was too dark oppressively dark even sadistically dark such as eye gouging scene it completely depressed me so much so that i found i just didnt like or care about anyone top it off film ended very badly directors original ending where you learn that harrison fords character is also replicant would have been so much better so this is one case where directors cut is definitely better as this original ending has been restored overall film looks impressive is original but these alone were not enough me give it glowing endorsement its good but that is all,0.5240178571428573,0.18797288359788364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.23}"
