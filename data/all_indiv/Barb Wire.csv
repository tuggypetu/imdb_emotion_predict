7.0,"A distopic remake of 'Casablanca' with Pamela Anderson: surprisingly, it is not bad","Although based in comic book series, the ""Barb Wire"" movie intends to be a remake o classical ""Casablanca"". It keeps the core elements of the 40's film, but adapts it to a distopic sci-fi action futuristic movie. Pamela Anderson plays Barb, a role similar to Bogart's Rick. The gender of the love affair from the past and of the third part of the love triangle have also been changed. The fictional town of Steel Harbor in the United States replaces Casablanca and the story is held during a futuristic Second Civil War rather than in the beginning of World War II. Both protagonists own a bar/nightclub, but Barb Wire is also a bounty huntress. As this remake is a sci-fi film, special contact lenses that cheat retinal scans substitute the letters of transit kept with Rick. As predictable, acting is worse in this remake, which has much more action. Off course ""Casablanca"" is much better, but surprisingly ""Barb Wire"" is not bad, in spite of the bad critics it has received.",distopic remake casablanca with pamela anderson surprisingly it is not bad,although based comic book series barb wire movie intends be remake o classical casablanca it keeps core elements 40s film but adapts it distopic sci fi action futuristic movie pamela anderson plays barb role similar bogarts rick gender love affair past third part love triangle have also been changed fictional town steel harbor united states replaces casablanca story is held during futuristic second civil war rather than beginning world war ii both protagonists own bar nightclub but barb wire is also bounty huntress as this remake is sci fi film special contact lenses that cheat retinal scans substitute letters transit kept with rick as predictable acting is worse this remake which has much more action off course casablanca is much better but surprisingly barb wire is not bad spite bad critics it has received,0.4077922077922077,0.14805194805194805,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,Babewatch,"What do you really expect from a chick like Pamela Anderson..? That she´s performing character roles Meryl Streep is normally meant to play?!? In this film you get her usual qualities in a sufficient amount: Pam is pretty, Pam is sexy and she´s joking in a self-ironic humor for the whole film. So what do you want more?!? The opening sequence is great and Udo Kier, one of the most culty German actors next to the deceased Klaus Kinski is also in! Of course, if you expect a great film you certainly will be disappointed: the set decoration is pretty cheap and the plot is stolen from ""Casablanca"". Nevertheless ""Barb Wire"" is very entertaining and should be regarded as funny action trash with an attractive main actress - nothing more, nothing less!

7.0,"""Have you ever heard of overkill?""","Picture this: a Pamela Anderson science fiction double bill on television. I mean, you'd just HAVE to watch it, wouldn't you? Just to see how bad it was.1995's Naked Souls kept making me look for the ""TV Movie"" credit that wasn't there. A cheap and exploitative ""erotic thriller"" where Pammie exposes her left breast within the first three minutes of the movie. Anderson is an artist, specialising in plaster-casting nude women, rubbing mixture over their breasts while they proclaim ""it feels kinda sexy"". Her boyfriend, decently played by Brian Krause, is studying brain wave patterns and accidentally crosses his own with that of a serial killer. It's all very silly and derivative, also involving a Faustian pact with a mysterious benefactor. What disturbs is that all the victims of the killer are nude women  I mean, who gets into a swimming pool naked?  meaning the film uses sexual violence as titillation. Dean Stockwell, in a minor role, is wasted in stuff like this.If Anderson's role in the predictable Naked Souls was peripheral (and also completely irrelevant to the plot), then Barb Wire sees her take over the screen. Released the following year, this saw the now Pamela Anderson Lee as the titular character, a Barbarella of the 90s. Of course she can't act  she only manages one expression throughout the whole two hours  but her assured performance is wonderful here. While it's easy to lump both these films together as trash entertainment, Barb Wire is so much more than that. A vibrant, witty and well-directed cartoon for the screen, its constant energy is a delight. What really appeals is in seeing the sheer amount of cinema pastiches the film rigs up. Batman, Never Say Never Again and even The A-Team are all parodied. But most significantly, it shares multiple plot similarities with Casablanca, and I honestly suspect that this was intentional. Or would its 2017 planes really be so old-fashioned? Barb is a neutral bar owner during a war by day (ring a bell?) a vixen for hire by night. The landscape she occupies is an excitingly neon world of legalised prostitution, engineered diseases and sophisticated contact lenses. Maybe the opening moments  Anderson Lee exposing her bare nipples while water washes over them to a baying crowd  are tacky and unnecessary. The scenes that follow also contain a torture sequence that is not only misguided in its attempt to arouse but also transparent in its purpose for expository dialogue. Yet beyond those first few scenes we have an action movie that contains above-average scripting for the genre, and some fun moments. It's amusing to try and guess whether Pam knew she was being kitsch or whether she genuinely believed she was giving a good performance. But whatever the answer, it still gets a laugh when a rowdy customer finds his genitals in the mouth of her rabid Rottweiler. ""Sit"", she tells the dog, much to the drunk's displeasure. ""Now, you don't want to see her roll over, do you?""All the criticisms that can be made against this film  that it's badly acted, appallingly scripted, dumb and sexist (even though none of them are 100% true anyway)  can be disputed by the fact that it's SUPPOSED to be badly acted, appallingly scripted, dumb and sexist. This is a film that never pretends to be anything other than a pumped-up, camp and downright silly movie. What's more, it succeeds in being more entertaining and convincing than many of the ""straight"" versions of the same format, with particular note drawn to it's fight scenes. They may be excessive and lack maturity, but they're shot beautifully and are fun to watch. I'm not a huge fan of action pictures, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. If you want a film that possesses depth and integrity, then see something else. If you want a lovably stupid movie, with Pamela Anderson sticking out her little finger as she burns rubber on a motorbike, then watch this.

,Pam's got nice breasts.....and that's the end of the film,"Barb runs a bar and is also a mercenary out for herself in the civil war. However when her ex-boyfriend Axel comes to se her she takes a job helping a scientist get across the country to expose a government cover up. However will she remain a mercenary or will she pick sides?When people are famous for being naked  that's pretty much what they should stay doing. Do we want porn actresses doing serious Hollywood roles? No  let them stick to what they know. I'm not calling Anderson a porno star but lets be honest, she famous for having great breasts right? So how can we harness this star power? Lets put her in tight clothes in a futuristic remake of Casablanca!The plot is a sheer rip off and still manages to be poor. It is only an excuse for tight clothes and silly big explosions. As a dumb Saturday night special it still barely cuts it for me, although it is noisy, if that's all you want.....Anderson isn't an actress  if it wasn't for a good publicity agent and a boob-job, she wouldn't even be offered the roles that Shannon Tweed gets! She doesn't convince as an actress as she can't get above the range required by Baywatch  look scared, look happy, look sad, look determined, oh and poke out your boobs! The rest of the cast have nothing to do and it's a shame to see reliable bit part players like Howard and Xander Berkley appearing in this.Overall it has some pretty explosions but really this is like a Playboy video  it's all designed for the purpose of capitalising on Anderson's body.......why should we be surprised that it does nothing else.",pams got nice breasts thats end film,barb runs bar is also mercenary out herself civil war however when her ex boyfriend axel comes se her she takes job helping scientist get across country expose government cover up however will she remain mercenary or will she pick sides when people are famous being naked thats pretty much what they should stay doing do we want porn actresses doing serious hollywood roles no let them stick what they know im not calling anderson porno star but lets be honest she famous having great breasts right so how can we harness this star power lets put her tight clothes futuristic remake casablanca plot is sheer rip off still manages be poor it is only excuse tight clothes silly big explosions as dumb saturday night special it still barely cuts it me although it is noisy if thats all you want anderson isnt actress if it wasnt good publicity agent boob job she wouldnt even be offered roles that shannon tweed gets she doesnt convince as actress as she cant get above range required by baywatch look scared look happy look sad look determined oh poke out your boobs rest cast have nothing do its shame see reliable bit part players like howard xander berkley appearing this overall it has some pretty explosions but really this is like playboy video its all designed purpose capitalising andersons body why should we be surprised that it does nothing else,0.598973727422003,0.12680623973727426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"

7.0,A thoroughly entertaining movie,"I know a lot of people hate this, but I personally think they're missing the point; It's not supposed to be taken seriously, it's just for fun. I almost rolled around on the floor laughing at times, due to the sheer stupidity of several scenes. It's so bad that it's good. It's so 'B-movie-like' that you can't possibly take it serious. A lot of people are saying the story is a rip-off of Casablanca. I don't know if that's true, since I haven't seen Casablanca, but I'll take your word for it. I didn't expect it to be an original story. In fact, I didn't expect more of the movie than to see Pamela Anderson naked. That was the primary reason I bought it, no reason to deny that. But the movie was just so entertaining, in every scene there was something so ridiculous that you couldn't help laughing at it. And that's the point. Don't sit down and analyze this movie, save that for intelligent movies. I knew from the very first scene, that this wasn't going to be intelligent, or great, or whatever. But it was fun to watch, and it does have a plot, and scenes that go together to create a meaning, which is more than what could be said about several new movies(Scary movie 2, just to name one). I didn't, for one single scene, find it to be boring, slow or just the least bit intelligent. And that's exactly what it was made to be. Entertainment. Nothing more.As an added bonus, it has some great parodies on Bond and Batman movies. You should definitely watch it, if you're into B movies(normally I'm not, but this was just too good to miss.) 7/10",thoroughly entertaining movie,i know lot people hate this but i personally think theyre missing point its not supposed be taken seriously its just fun i almost rolled around floor laughing at times due sheer stupidity several scenes its so bad that its good its so b movie like that you cant possibly take it serious lot people are saying story is rip off casablanca i dont know if thats true since i havent seen casablanca but ill take your word it i didnt expect it be original story fact i didnt expect more movie than see pamela anderson naked that was primary reason i bought it no reason deny that but movie was just so entertaining every scene there was something so ridiculous that you couldnt help laughing at it thats point dont sit down analyze this movie save that intelligent movies i knew very first scene that this wasnt going be intelligent or great or whatever but it was fun watch it does have plot scenes that go together create meaning which is more than what could be said about several new movies scary movie 2 just name one i didnt one single scene find it be boring slow or just least bit intelligent thats exactly what it was made be entertainment nothing more as added bonus it has some great parodies bond batman movies you should definitely watch it if youre into b movies normally im not but this was just too good miss 7 10,0.5806058928151951,0.09324138393905836,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.18}"
7.0,Wham! Bam! Thank you Pam!,"To be perfectly honest with you, my appreciation of this movie is almost solely based on Pamela Anderson's breasts. I'm not going to waste your time and claim anything else. Take Pammy out of 'Barb Wire' and you are left with something highly mediocre. The story, action and other characters are simply by-the-numbers and I really cannot be bothered discussing them. It's Pamela's film pure and simple.It wouldn't be over-stating it to say that I thought the opening credit sequence was quite good. Pamela in tight black leather, half out of her top being soaked by a hose? I would say there's four good ideas in there, all in one. Unfortunately, this is where the film peaks and we are only two minutes in. Sadly, a story kicks in at this point and spoils things. But seriously Ms Anderson is perfect for this flick. Her pneumatic figure couldn't be any better for the role she's playing. She is quite ridiculously sexy throughout the entire picture and the film frankly flags when she is not on screen. She is more than serviceable in this action role too. It's worth pointing out here that I am a big Russ Meyer fan and, therefore, it's perhaps no surprise that I have a huge weakness for dangerous, sexy, buxom women. The biggest compliment I can pay Pammy, therefore, is that on this showing she would not have looked out of place as one of the lead bad girls in 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' High praise but quite frankly true.The only criticism I can level at Pamela here is she doesn't get naked enough.",wham bam thank you pam,be perfectly honest with you my appreciation this movie is almost solely based pamela andersons breasts im not going waste your time claim anything else take pammy out barb wire you are left with something highly mediocre story action other characters are simply by numbers i really cannot be bothered discussing them its pamelas film pure simple it wouldnt be over stating it say that i thought opening credit sequence was quite good pamela tight black leather half out her top being soaked by hose i would say theres four good ideas there all one unfortunately this is where film peaks we are only two minutes sadly story kicks at this point spoils things but seriously ms anderson is perfect this flick her pneumatic figure couldnt be any better role shes playing she is quite ridiculously sexy throughout entire picture film frankly flags when she is not screen she is more than serviceable this action role too its worth pointing out here that i am big russ meyer fan therefore its perhaps no surprise that i have huge weakness dangerous sexy buxom women biggest compliment i can pay pammy therefore is that this showing she would not have looked out place as one lead bad girls faster pussycat kill kill high praise but quite frankly true only criticism i can level at pamela here is she doesnt get naked enough,0.5546846846846846,0.09064993564993566,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
5.0,"Let's face it, if you're looking for depth and a meaning, you've put the wrong movie in your machine","There are some films that are bad, infamous bad and Barb Wire is one of those I have heard about. Some bad films are trashy but can be a bit fun, like Showgirls and some can just be wrong like Striptease. Barb Wire is a film I guess in some way I'm kind of undecided on, it has the making for just a bad movie with Pamela's bad acting but has the action scenes and cheesy lines that make it fun as well. This movie is a retelling of Cassablanca and isn't so quick to hide that fact, so I guess this is the exotic remake. Pam Anderson is a sexy female lead and isn't that hard to believe that at times she can be tough, she does wear that leather well I have to admit, but some of the way she delivers the lines was a little too Shaquil O'Neil, I think if you're going to do a movie like this, you might as well go over the top, go a little James Woods, it's all good. But we need a fun action film with the lead being female, just sad that this is a bad film that got overlooked. Set in 2017 during the ""Second American Civil War"", Barb Wire owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in Steel Harbor ""the last free city"" in a United States ravaged by the civil war and she brings in extra cash by hiring out as a mercenary and bounty hunter. Her club is raided by Chief of Police Willis, who is looking for the fugitive Dr. Corrina ""Cora"" Devonshire. Devonshire, a former government scientist, has information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior, Colonel Pryzer of the Congressional Directorate; she is trying to escape to Canada in order to make this information public. Meanwhile, Devonshire has turned up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood, a ""freedom fighter"" whom Barb had known at the outbreak of the war, but the two were separated soon afterward. Axel is now married to Cora, and is trying to help her get to Canada. They are trying to find a contraband pair of contact lenses which will allow Cora to evade the retinal scan at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.Barb Wire really wasn't as bad as I was expecting, even though it's just a remake of a classic romantic movie, it does have some cool moments. I loved some of the action scenes, the fight on the fork lift was a lot of fun to watch and since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, it's all good and makes the fight scenes that more exciting. I guess I could say that I enjoyed the movie a little bit, I suppose it's a new guilty pleasure. Pam Anderson may be an awful actress, but it's not like I was looking for an Oscar worth movie when I decided to watch it. But I have a feeling that the director has some serious sexual issues considering some of the strange erotic torture devices used in the film are a bit much, maybe I don't want to know. If you have an open mind and are looking for a good bad film, I think you'll get a kick out Barb Wire. However just think if you're looking for an actual action film with good acting, just look at the cover, enough said.5/10",lets face it if youre looking depth meaning youve put wrong movie your machine,there are some films that are bad infamous bad barb wire is one those i have heard about some bad films are trashy but can be bit fun like showgirls some can just be wrong like striptease barb wire is film i guess some way im kind undecided it has making just bad movie with pamelas bad acting but has action scenes cheesy lines that make it fun as well this movie is retelling cassablanca isnt so quick hide that fact so i guess this is exotic remake pam anderson is sexy female lead isnt that hard believe that at times she can be tough she does wear that leather well i have admit but some way she delivers lines was little too shaquil oneil i think if youre going do movie like this you might as well go over top go little james woods its all good but we need fun action film with lead being female just sad that this is bad film that got overlooked set 2017 during second american civil war barb wire owns hammerhead nightclub steel harbor last free city united states ravaged by civil war she brings extra cash by hiring out as mercenary bounty hunter her club is raided by chief police willis who is looking fugitive dr corrina cora devonshire devonshire former government scientist has information about bioweapon being developed by her former superior colonel pryzer congressional directorate she is trying escape canada order make this information public meanwhile devonshire has turned up at hammerhead she is accompanied by axel hood freedom fighter whom barb had known at outbreak war but two were separated soon afterward axel is now married cora is trying help her get canada they are trying find contraband pair contact lenses which will allow cora evade retinal scan at steel harbor airport lenses pass through hands several lowlifes before also ending up at barbs nightclub barb wire really wasnt as bad as i was expecting even though its just remake classic romantic movie it does have some cool moments i loved some action scenes fight fork lift was lot fun watch since movie doesnt take itself too seriously its all good makes fight scenes that more exciting i guess i could say that i enjoyed movie little bit i suppose its new guilty pleasure pam anderson may be awful actress but its not like i was looking oscar worth movie when i decided watch it but i have feeling that director has some serious sexual issues considering some strange erotic torture devices used film are bit much maybe i dont want know if you have open mind are looking good bad film i think youll get kick out barb wire however just think if youre looking actual action film with good acting just look at cover enough said 5 10,0.4821233164983166,0.017731130751964117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"

4.0,"Feed her after midnight, get her wet, but, whatever you do, don't call her ""Babe""!","Pamela Anderson Lee will certainly never be mistaken for a talking pig, especially in the outfits she gets to wear in Barb Wire. Pamela has cascading blonde hair down to there, acres of cleavage and plenty of clingy leather getups cut up to here. If you get distracted and call Ms. Wire the dreaded ""B"" word, you may find yourself dealing with her nasty-tempered Rottweiler, Camille, a sidekick with bite. This highly anticipated comic-book action/adventure, starring the pinup star of Baywatch, lasted only a short time in theaters before going bust, so to speak. I'm sure the backers couldn't care less, as their investment was made back in advance by tremendous worldwide sales. Barb Wire was sold on the star's face and form long before there was a story concept or anything resembling a script. Good thing, too. Yes, the futuristic plot does bear some parallels to Casablanca, but the family resemblance is strictly skin-deep. Barb is a nightclub owner who helps an old flame, now a freedom fighter, and his wife escape from a corrupt police official and some neo-Nazi types. Of all the gin joints in the world, Axel had to walk into Barb's. Barb has just been hosed down while performing a torrid dance onstage and is feeling, well, charitable. The movie gets off to a pretty good start, with tongue well in cheek, but grows wearisome when it forgets to laugh at itself. The explosions, shoot-outs and chases are eventually numbing.

6.0,I would have loved this if I saw it when it first came out.,"A sort of remake of Casablanca set in the future and in a strip club? Pam Anderson is Barb Wire and she must help someone get on a plane to Canada, with contact lenses. Whatever else the plot is, do people really care?This film was made, marketing and watched because of one thing and one thing only, Pamela Anderson. This was her naked sci/fi Hollywood film, the opening of the movie shows her stripping, showing her breasts and getting hit with water. Ooooh, so sexy. This was probably the one scene many kids watched over and over. The film itself is regarded as one of those, it's so bad it's good. I can totally see that and once I got pass Anderson's wooden acting, I actually enjoyed myself. Guilty as charged.I said I would have loved this when it first came out. I say that because I was around 10 years old and a film like this, that is drenched in so called ""sexiness"" would have been imprinted on my mind. Seeing it for the first time in full when I'm 22, went to film school and have been on the internet since I was whatever age, the film doesn't strike me as sexy. Anderson does look good though and seeing her prance around in tight leather doesn't hurt either. Much better than what Halle Berry tried to do with Catwoman. Anderson became famous for her breasts and that was the focus of the film. Every other shot is of her massive cleavage. Am I complaining? Not really. But we have porno for that, the catch is that Anderson is someone ""somewhat"" famous. There is a special feature on the DVD called SEXY OUTTAKES. This is ten minutes long and it is of her stripping with the water. Basically the entire opening, but for ten minutes. Jango Fett from the Star Wars prequels is in this film, I found myself saying ""Hey it's that guy"" a lot every time a character came on screen. The film is campy, what else do I need to say? The acting is campy, the script is god-awful and taken from Casablanca, the nudity isn't even that good. I expected more, the film feels like a tease. Barb Wire is like Showgirls. Made to appeal to the perverted crowd, only this one has explosions. I'm giving this one a high rating, for it's campiness feel.

3.0,"Fortunately, it is not this easy...","Wow. Now this is not good. However, the movie sets its level right away, by having a stripping, dancing wet Barb (Anderson) already in the introduction of the movie. So, there you have what this movie is all about. Sure you get some violence, explosions and bad costumes as a bonus. Clearly, there is no relevant story in the movie, all revolves around (Barb) to show her off in different ways. The mentioned costumes are almost offending to the audience. Whoever responsible for them clearly did not work very hard. Barb competes with herself to wear some leather-thing that shows off as much as possible, but actually must be considered well dressed as compared to other ladies. The villains wear something that bear a striking resemblance to nazi-uniforms. Well sure, we know who's the bad guys, thank you. And some other people wear broken calculators and other piece of machinery that you'll find in a scrap-heap as hats, and are automatically dressed up like guys from the future. If it was this easy to make a good movie, I could have made it myself. Fortunately it is not, and Barb Wire is not a good movie.But, and this is a mysterious but, I actually didn't get bored out of my mind and switched off.

6.0,Silicone Camp DeLuxe!,"What's the matter? People don't have a sense of humorous camp anymore? I don't understand why ""Barb Wire"" is generally regarded as one of the world's worst movies ever made, whereas it's honestly not any worse than the vast majority of cheesy and violent post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi flicks from the late 70's/early 80's. Well, perhaps it's slightly worse than those, but at least the defects are widely compensated by the totally unpretentious atmosphere and the light-headed approach of everyone involved in the production, including Pam Anderson herself. Nobody who cooperated on ""Barb Wire"" seemed to take the film overly serious, so why should we? In fact, the concept is even quite unique and courageous! Who would ever dare to do a futuristic remake of ""Casablanca"" and replace the talented Humphrey Bogart with a busty blond bimbo, the cherubic Ingrid Bergman with a beefcake Maori rebel warrior and the legendary Rick's Café with a sleazy bar called The Hammerhead? It's a trashy, campy, sleazy, grotesque and incredibly flamboyant Sci-Fi story timed in the year 2017, in a society spoiled by the Second Civil War and a city dominated by mayhem, corruption and resistance. Barb Wire owns the successful bar, but makes even more money with her side jobs as rough bounty hunter and hired assassin. She leads a good life until her former resistance-lover shows up with a fugitive scientist who needs a special pair of contact lenses in order to flee to Canada. Barb always remained neutral in political matters (following her example Rick in ""Casablanca""), but it looks as if she'll have to get involved now. ""Barb Wire"" may be bad, but at the same time it's fantastically entertaining, with horrible dialogs and one-liners (""Don't call me babe!""), hideous wasteland sets, explosive action sequences and extravagant costume designs. Mrs. Anderson herself continuously exhibits revealing leather outfits and sexy stilettos while her opponents the Congressionals harness Nazi-like uniforms. The relatively unknown director David Hogan even managed to gather an impressive selection of B-actors to fill up his supportive cast, like Steve Railsbeck, Xander Berkeley, Clint Howard and even Udo Kier. So, seriously, what's the problem here? ""Barb Wire"" surely isn't as worthless as it looks or everyone claims it is. Try to interpret it as a throwback to traditional post-apocalyptic cinema mixed with excessively violent modern day comic book adaptations and you'll definitely find some enjoyment.",silicone camp deluxe,whats matter people dont have sense humorous camp anymore i dont understand why barb wire is generally regarded as one worlds worst movies ever made whereas its honestly not any worse than vast majority cheesy violent post apocalyptic sci fi flicks late 70s early 80s well perhaps its slightly worse than those but at least defects are widely compensated by totally unpretentious atmosphere light headed approach everyone involved production including pam anderson herself nobody who cooperated barb wire seemed take film overly serious so why should we fact concept is even quite unique courageous who would ever dare do futuristic remake casablanca replace talented humphrey bogart with busty blond bimbo cherubic ingrid bergman with beefcake maori rebel warrior legendary ricks caf with sleazy bar called hammerhead its trashy campy sleazy grotesque incredibly flamboyant sci fi story timed year 2017 society spoiled by second civil war city dominated by mayhem corruption resistance barb wire owns successful bar but makes even more money with her side jobs as rough bounty hunter hired assassin she leads good life until her former resistance lover shows up with fugitive scientist who needs special pair contact lenses order flee canada barb always remained neutral political matters following her example rick casablanca but it looks as if shell have get involved now barb wire may be bad but at same time its fantastically entertaining with horrible dialogs one liners dont call me babe hideous wasteland sets explosive action sequences extravagant costume designs mrs anderson herself continuously exhibits revealing leather outfits sexy stilettos while her opponents congressionals harness nazi like uniforms relatively unknown director david hogan even managed gather impressive selection b actors fill up his supportive cast like steve railsbeck xander berkeley clint howard even udo kier so seriously whats problem here barb wire surely isnt as worthless as it looks or everyone claims it is try interpret it as throwback traditional post apocalyptic cinema mixed with excessively violent modern day comic book adaptations youll definitely find some enjoyment,0.6588840298023974,0.03398931000971818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,"Not great, but a lot of fun.","I'm a fan of the comic book series, Barb Wire (or was, until its cancellation). And I'm afraid I have mixed feelings about the movie. It certainly isn't true to the comic. Barb isn't a tough as nails, but guided by her morals woman. She's a cold blooded killer for hire, in this one. Still, it's difficult not to like Pam Anderson's role, if only because of her being sexy. There is a touch of humor in her campy portrayal. It's not spectacular acting, but it's fun. Pamela also resembles the comic book Barb to an uncanny degree, and the supporting cast is wonderfully cartoony. The story isn't well written, but it gives the cute one liners (""Don't... call me babe""), and action sequences, which are all fun to watch. I realize that it isn't high art, but this movie just has a level of silliness and seriousness that's hard not to like. The music, story, and dialogue all give the movie its cheesiness, and in some way, it's made to be entertaining.Pam is extremely sexy in this movie, and great to watch. She has a scowl all the time, and is dressed to kill in low cut, tight outfits. Sadly, we don't get that much nudity (which alone could have carried the movie). The scenes where there is some, it's pretty clear, and we get a good look at Pamela's incredible body, and the atmosphere and her poses are always very sexy. But there isn't enough of this. It's a fun blend of action, silly dialogue, nudity, and... well Pamela Anderson. Go rent it. It's not a great movie, but it's not a terrible one, and one that's a heck of a good time. NOTE: I suggest the unrated version. It contains more nudity (there isn't that much to begin with) and a ten minutes of footage at the end with Pamela nude in a bathtub, which is really great.",not great but lot fun,im fan comic book series barb wire or was until its cancellation im afraid i have mixed feelings about movie it certainly isnt true comic barb isnt tough as nails but guided by her morals woman shes cold blooded killer hire this one still its difficult not like pam andersons role if only because her being sexy there is touch humor her campy portrayal its not spectacular acting but its fun pamela also resembles comic book barb uncanny degree supporting cast is wonderfully cartoony story isnt well written but it gives cute one liners dont call me babe action sequences which are all fun watch i realize that it isnt high art but this movie just has level silliness seriousness thats hard not like music story dialogue all give movie its cheesiness some way its made be entertaining pam is extremely sexy this movie great watch she has scowl all time is dressed kill low cut tight outfits sadly we dont get that much nudity which alone could have carried movie scenes where there is some its pretty clear we get good look at pamelas incredible body atmosphere her poses are always very sexy but there isnt enough this its fun blend action silly dialogue nudity well pamela anderson go rent it its not great movie but its not terrible one one thats heck good time note i suggest unrated version it contains more nudity there isnt that much begin with ten minutes footage at end with pamela nude bathtub which is really great,0.5953292806484296,0.1652161431948666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Just a good action movie,"Firstly, I give 8/10 in regards to action movies. What do you want in an action film? Actors who act like they own the place, a plot that holds together, explosions, fight scenes, and if you can get some sexy stuff, then that's a plus. This movie has all of this.People say Pam doesn't act well in this? Do the same people give good grades to films with Steven Seagal or J. C. V. D? Let's be honest, I love Stalone and Schwarzennger, but we can't say Schwarzzy acts better in Terminator, Conan, or most of his movies.The only reason why people criticized this film, and Pam's acting, is PURE SEXISM. People are willing to accept that Rambo can take on half the soviet army with only a bow and a handful of grenades in the afghan desert, but people aren't willing to accept that a gorgeous big breasted blonde would be able to tear them a new one, ride a motor cycle while shooting down 50 guys, and screw over the whole legal and criminal establishment.I think this is the only reason why this movie has such a bad mark on here, and why it was so badly received. Pure sexism. In 1996, people were not willing to accept a woman as an action movie star.By all means, I found it more fun to watch than Predator. Half of predator was just watching big muscle men crawling in the jungle, acting all tough. Here you have stuff happening. Could there have been more gunfights? Hell yes. Could there have been more Pam kicking ass? By all means yes - you can't have enough Pam kicking ass. Does the ending get to be a bit cliché? Yes.I liked this movie more than the average action film, not just because I think Barb Wire is a great character, and Pam does her super well. I liked that this movie had ambiance. Filthy streets, crummy buildings; something between sci-fi and Film noir. Ambiance is very important for me when I watch a movie, and this one has it. Finally, YES, I did enjoy all the crude nudity, sexy lingerie, and so one - though I enjoyed all this while the movie set badass empowering female characters.I think there is still time to make a series of these - I would gladly watch the next ones in the movie theatres.",just good action movie,firstly i give 8 10 regards action movies what do you want action film actors who act like they own place plot that holds together explosions fight scenes if you can get some sexy stuff then thats plus this movie has all this people say pam doesnt act well this do same people give good grades films with steven seagal or j c v d lets be honest i love stalone schwarzennger but we cant say schwarzzy acts better terminator conan or most his movies only reason why people criticized this film pams acting is pure sexism people are willing accept that rambo can take half soviet army with only bow handful grenades afghan desert but people arent willing accept that gorgeous big breasted blonde would be able tear them new one ride motor cycle while shooting down 50 guys screw over whole legal criminal establishment i think this is only reason why this movie has such bad mark here why it was so badly received pure sexism 1996 people were not willing accept woman as action movie star by all means i found it more fun watch than predator half predator was just watching big muscle men crawling jungle acting all tough here you have stuff happening could there have been more gunfights hell yes could there have been more pam kicking ass by all means yes you cant have enough pam kicking ass does ending get be bit clich yes i liked this movie more than average action film not just because i think barb wire is great character pam does her super well i liked that this movie had ambiance filthy streets crummy buildings something between sci fi film noir ambiance is very important me when i watch movie this one has it finally yes i did enjoy all crude nudity sexy lingerie so one though i enjoyed all this while movie set badass empowering female characters i think there is still time make series these i would gladly watch next ones movie theatres,0.5324209840338874,0.17121759065307451,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
3.0,Terrible...but it isn't like the filmmakers were trying to make high art!,"I have a weird obsession....to see every film on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. ""Barb Wire"" is currently #44....and my 94th film on this list! However, after seeing it, I am not sure that it really deserves to be on the list. Sure, Pamela Anderson got the Razzie Award for her performance and it is a dopey film...but unlike most of the films on the list it was never intended to be a good movie. It simply was made as an excuse to dress (and undress) Anderson in very revealing clothes! It's not what anyone would consider a masterpiece, not was it ever intended as one....just a film to show as much of the lady as she was willing to show. And, in places (such as the opening credits) you see a lot.""Barb Wire"" is based on a comic book by Dark Horse, a company known for characters such as The Mask, Hellboy and comics like ""Sin City"". Again....none of these characters or films were ever intended to be carried by the Criterion Collection nor to be up for Academy Awards!In this story, Anderson plays the title character, a combination stripper, hooker and assassin. And it's all set in a dystopian and dark world...of the USA in 2017! She strips, turns tricks and leaves bodies where ever she goes! She also, interestingly, sounds like she's doing a Steven Segal impersonation in the film...softly mumbling most of her lines. Bad enough for a Razzie? I wouldn't say so...but it's not like I'm in charge of giving out these infamous awards!You can probably assume that I thought the film was pretty dumb....and you'd be right. But it's exactly what many folks wanted in 1996...a chance to see Anderson at least semi-naked. It delivers this....along with a dark, silly and not especially enjoyable story.If you actually JUST want to see Ms. Anderson's body, skip to the special features on the disc and select 'SEXY OUTTAKES'....then you can skip the silly movie entirely and just see what most folks who watch the DVD really want anyway.By the way, the opening song was ""Word Up""....an extremely catchy R&B/hiphop song by Cameo. But, oddly, some other folks perform it...and it's not nearly as good as the original. I wonder why they didn't just pay for the rights to the original....I can't imagine it would have been THAT expensive.",terrible but it isnt like filmmakers were trying make high art,i have weird obsession see every film imdbs infamous bottom 100 list barb wire is currently my 94th film this list however after seeing it i am not sure that it really deserves be list sure pamela anderson got razzie award her performance it is dopey film but unlike most films list it was never intended be good movie it simply was made as excuse dress undress anderson very revealing clothes its not what anyone would consider masterpiece not was it ever intended as one just film show as much lady as she was willing show places such as opening credits you see lot barb wire is based comic book by dark horse company known characters such as mask hellboy comics like sin city again none these characters or films were ever intended be carried by criterion collection nor be up academy awards this story anderson plays title character combination stripper hooker assassin its all set dystopian dark world usa 2017 she strips turns tricks leaves bodies where ever she goes she also interestingly sounds like shes doing steven segal impersonation film softly mumbling most her lines bad enough razzie i wouldnt say so but its not like im charge giving out these infamous awards you can probably assume that i thought film was pretty dumb youd be right but its exactly what many folks wanted 1996 chance see anderson at least semi naked it delivers this along with dark silly not especially enjoyable story if you actually just want see ms andersons body skip special features disc select sexy outtakes then you can skip silly movie entirely just see what most folks who watch dvd really want anyway by way opening song was word up extremely catchy r b hiphop song by cameo but oddly some other folks perform it its not nearly as good as original i wonder why they didnt just pay rights original i cant imagine it would have been that expensive,0.5589746031746031,0.012723809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"

Hell, I think she needs a series about this bounty hunter than her bodyguard service.",call me babe you get shoe head,okay yes this movie is cheesey casablanca rip off stars pamela anderson lee her two biggest assets but give it chance what you see is great b movie that has some good action sequences funny dialogue movie be camp it cant know it is bad this one thinks it is serious you can see pam trying hold her own amazingly she does most part i loved how she dipped down her voice delivered her lines earnestly she was great i think they need sequel hell i think she needs series about this bounty hunter than her bodyguard service,0.6555555555555556,0.3354700854700855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.42}"
