4.0,Lestranger than fiction,"I'd really love to tell you about the plot. I really would! But I would struggle to pull all the multitude of strands together from J.K. Rowling's story and coherently explain them to anyone. If Rowling had put ten thousand monkeys (not a million - it's no bloody Shakespeare) into a room with typewriters and locked the door I wouldn't be surprised.Let me try at a high level..... The arch-criminal wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being tortured in 'Trump Tower', but manages to escape and flees to Paris in pursuit of a mysterious circus performer called Credence (Ezra Miller) and his bewitched companion Nagini (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) played fetchingly by Claudia Kim. Someone needs to stop him, and all eyes are on Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). But he is unable to do so, since he and Grindelwald are ""closer than brothers"" (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). So a reluctant and UK-grounded Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is smuggled into the danger zone... which suits him just fine since his love Tina (Katherine Waterston) is working for the ministry there, and the couple are currently estranged due to a (topical) bout of 'Fake News'.Throw in a potential love triangle between Newt, his brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and old Hogwart's schoolmate Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz) and about a half dozen other sub-plots and you have... well... a complete muggle - - sorry - - muddle.Above all, I really can't explain the crux of the plot. A venerable diarrhoea of exposition in a crypt, during an inexplicably quiet fifteen minutes (given 'im-who-can-be-named is next door with about a thousand other people!) left me completely bewildered. A bizarre event at sea (no spoilers) would seem to make absolutely NO SENSE when considered with another reveal at the end of the film. I thought I must have clearly missed something... or I'd just not been intelligent enough to process the information.... or.... it was actually completely bonkers! Actually, I think it's the latter: in desperation I went on a fan site that tried to explain the plot. While it was explained there, the explanation aligned with what I thought had happened: but it made no mention of the ridiculousness of the random coincidence involved!The film's a mess. Which is a shame since everyone involved tries really hard. Depp oozes evil very effectively (he proves that nicely on arriving in Paris, and doubles-down about 5 minutes later: #veryverydark). Redmayne replays his Newt-act effectively but once again (and I see I made the same comments in my ""Fantastic Beasts"" review) his character mumbles again so much that many of his lines are unintelligible.I also complained last time that the excellent actress Katherine Waterston was criminally underused as the tentative love interest Tina. this trend unfortunately continues unabated in this film.... you'll struggle afterwards to write down what she actually did in this film.Jacob (Dan Fogler) and Queenie (Alison Sudol, looking for all the world in some scenes like Rachel Weisz) reprise their roles in a sub-plot that goes nowhere in particular.Of the newcomers, Jude Law as Dumbledore is a class-act but has very little screen time: hopefully he will get more to do next time around. Zoë Kravitz impresses as Leta.As you would expect from a David Yates / David Heyman Potter collaboration, the product design, costume design and special effects are all excellent. Some scenes are truly impressive - an 'explosion' in a Parisian garret is particularly spectacular. But special effects alone do not a great film make. Many reviews I've seen complain that this was a 'filler' film... a set-up film for the rest of the series. And I can understand that view. If you analyse the film overall, virtually NOTHING of importance actually happens: it's like the ""Order of the Phoenix"" of the prequels.I dragged myself along to see this one because ""I thought I should"". The third in the series will really need to sparkle to make me want to see it. If J.K. Rowling were to take me advice (she won't - she NEVER returns my calls!) then she would sculpt the story-arc but leave the screenwriting to someone better. The blame for this one, I'm afraid, lies at Rowling's door alone.",lestranger than fiction,id really love tell you about plot i really would but i would struggle pull all multitude strands together j k rowlings story coherently explain them anyone if rowling had put ten thousand monkeys not million its no bloody shakespeare into room with typewriters locked door i wouldnt be surprised let me try at high level arch criminal wizard grindelwald johnny depp is being tortured trump tower but manages escape flees paris pursuit mysterious circus performer called credence ezra miller his bewitched companion nagini nudge nudge wink wink played fetchingly by claudia kim someone needs stop him all eyes are albus dumbledore jude law but he is unable do so since he grindelwald are closer than brothers nudge nudge wink wink so reluctant uk grounded newt scamander eddie redmayne is smuggled into danger zone which suits him just fine since his love tina katherine waterston is working ministry there couple are currently estranged due topical bout fake news throw potential love triangle between newt his brother theseus callum turner old hogwarts schoolmate leta lestrange zo kravitz about half dozen other sub plots you have well complete muggle sorry muddle above all i really cant explain crux plot venerable diarrhoea exposition crypt during inexplicably quiet fifteen minutes given im who can be named is next door with about thousand other people left me completely bewildered bizarre event at sea no spoilers would seem make absolutely no sense when considered with another reveal at end film i thought i must have clearly missed something or id just not been intelligent enough process information or it was actually completely bonkers actually i think its latter desperation i went fan site that tried explain plot while it was explained there explanation aligned with what i thought had happened but it made no mention ridiculousness random coincidence involved films mess which is shame since everyone involved tries really hard depp oozes evil very effectively he proves that nicely arriving paris doubles down about 5 minutes later redmayne replays his newt act effectively but once again i see i made same comments my fantastic beasts review his character mumbles again so much that many his lines are unintelligible i also complained last time that excellent actress katherine waterston was criminally underused as tentative love interest tina this trend unfortunately continues unabated this film youll struggle afterwards write down what she actually did this film jacob dan fogler queenie alison sudol looking all world some scenes like rachel weisz reprise their roles sub plot that goes nowhere particular newcomers jude law as dumbledore is class act but has very little screen time hopefully he will get more do next time around zo kravitz impresses as leta as you would expect david yates david heyman potter collaboration product design costume design special effects are all excellent some scenes are truly impressive explosion parisian garret is particularly spectacular but special effects alone do not great film make many reviews ive seen complain that this was filler film set up film rest series i can understand that view if you analyse film overall virtually nothing importance actually happens its like order phoenix prequels i dragged myself along see this one because i thought i should third series will really need sparkle make me want see it if j k rowling were take me advice she wont she never returns my calls then she would sculpt story arc but leave screenwriting someone better blame this one im afraid lies at rowlings door alone,0.4700081400081399,0.088390059015059,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"

4.0,I don't even remember it,"The one thing this movie successfully does, is cast an obliviate on you. I literally just watched it, and I don't even remember what it's about. The magical element of this film is simply having so much happen, while simultaneously, nothing really happens.There's a little bit of nostalgia, with Easter eggs and great visuals; the actors are great- Johnny Depp has the most menacing introduction I've seen; Jude Law convinced me that he is young Dumbledore; the music is spectacular. But none of that can hide the truth of the fact that this movie is just BORING.There is literally so much plot thrown at you non-stop. The movie expects you to care about, invest in and remember so many characters, that at some point, you mentally clock out. I'm an intense potterhead, and I love learning more l about the wizarding world. But this is just too much information, being force-fed in very little time.

6.0,overloaded,"In 1927 New York City, evil wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes a prison transport and heads to Paris with his supporters. In London, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) refuses British Ministry of Magic's command to hunt Grindelwald. It's revealed that it was Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) who sent Newt to NYC and this time he sends him to Paris. Newt is joined by Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is already there searching for lost pure-blood wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) along with everyone else.

There is too much of everything. I don't understand Queenie's dark turn. I hoped that she was playing along but that seems extremely unlikely. For some reason, Tina has turned a lot colder.

2.0,Even The Last Jedi wasn't this incompetent,"THE LAST JEDI is often reviled as far as recent blockbusters go, but at least the editing was competent and the story, while problematic and too eager to shock at the expense of logic or characterization, was coherent. THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD cannot claim any of these modest skills. The opening escape scene is a masterpiece of horrible editing, camerawork, and lighting. And it all goes downhill from there.This movie basically exists to set up later movies.

5.0,The Sole Purpose To Milk In Other Sequels,"The first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film can easily stand alone as engaging new series for the viewers who are still hungry for new material in the world author J.K. Rowling created which is the Wizarding World. And sure we were told in advance that we were going to get five more movie adaptations in the future, I was excited about seeing this spin-off from the very successful Harry Potter films that came out between 2002-2012. Sure not everyone liked ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I managed to find it ever so enjoyable as a welcome addition to the Wizarding World. It may sound like a cliche what I'm about to say, but ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Griendelwald"" failed to live up to the standards that the first installment measured up to. I can't remember a time when a movie like this was so muddled, watching what could gave been a simple viewing pleasure would end up so labouring.If there was a plot to this installment, I wonder where it is hiding, because this movie is so convoluted it's all over the place. I tried my hardest to follow through, but it just meanders from one scenario after another and trying to decipher it gave me a migraine. I even watched it again to see what I missed, only to end up regretting it later on as I ran out of pills. It tries to stay in the tradition of the myth behind the Harry Potter lore, but fails to stand on its own. If you're a Potter fan you will likely get a better understanding of the goings-on in the movie. But casual movie viewers will be overwhelmed.I can at times just skim through the details knowing the series pretty much by knowing what to expect and the adventures of what's to come, but in ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" you don't see very all that much because the sole purpose of this film is only to cash in a reminder that there are other films in this franchise to follow. It gets to the point that it could become quite tedious as scenes are rushed with no full explaining which results in everything being quite empty. Sure there is some CGI magic featured here, but it still isn't enough to carry the film in terms of plot, story or theme. Just all style and no substance.The indecisiveness in where it wants to go can be nauseating and the editing seems very absent in the long turn. Scenes are presented in little fragments and then are forgotten and only come back later again without any full explaining going on. There are way too many characters in the movie and they have no real significance to them to care about or even have something to grab our attention. In order to get the better feel of the plot, the need to introduce the characters one more time and to find a surface where the subplots intertwine. There are old characters and newer ones, unfortunately none really do much service because too many things happening and very little is coming out.Though the bad outweighs the good stuff, ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" can at least claim that the characters coming back was a pleasure in addition the newer ones offer some kind of hope for the future like Jude Law as a young Dumbledore. Also though not very well-rounding the wizardry effects were very impressive. It would be a scintillating run if Rowling lets us in on the wizardry in Paris. However, there are some scene set there that are put into doubt. With a little hope, we might get more of our questions fulfilled. I guess we'll have to be patient until then.In the end, it's highly questionable if this sequel will be of equal significance to what is yet to come. Right now all I can say is this second installment is an utter mess. Too many things happening and not enough story being told. This can turn off a lot of people from wanting to see this movie. If this was like a puzzle it may have the pieces, however I hope that the next installments can places them together.

4.0,"Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Newt and 1000 other things","A movie this expensive and with a fan base as large as that has no right being this awful.The problem lies within the conception of this new saga. Either you tell a story of a magical zookeper with his cute baby Nifflers and quirky adventures to make children and easy to please adults go ""awwww"" or you tell a convoluted story about gay love, Dumbledore, Nazis and the Wizarding World War.Those should be two different things.They don't gel together at all.Why is Newt seen as a perfect candidate to look for Credence? Just so he can be in the movie again? The less said about the return of Jacob the better. Nagini is now a girl with a curse on her? And wizards pay to see her change into a snake in a circus. But Rowling already established, that changing into animals is what many wizards can do and it shouldn't be special at all. Even teachers and journalists in Harry Potter could do it. All this does is make everything more confusing. So Neville killed a Korean lady in the last movie? How awful! Way to steal his moment!It's just things like this that drag this movie down. The Titanic, Leta LeStrange, brother of Newt, Tina, Queenie (roofing Jacob to marry him, then joining the Nazis???), Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Credence (Dumbledore's brother?) .. the list goes on an on. This movie is bloated and stuffed with too many characters and plot lines I didn't care about. This is what you get when you want to please everyone.It made me smile when, at the end of the movie, all characters stand on the bridge at Hogwarts just to look at Newt having a talk with Dumbledore while being out of earshot. It's just a hilarious b-movie moment and that the director was serious about it makes it even more funny.This movie stumbles around with Newt and his fantastic beasts tied to one leg and a heap of uninteresting charactes on the other, being always where the plot needs him to. He has no business being there - similar to this movie.JK Rowling and Warner seem to think that all fans want is more lore thrown at them. But it's the characters that drew us into the world of Harry Potter.This franchise is in trouble. You can see it already by the evolution of the respective movie posters. In FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM, the main characters and 20's New York are on the cover. Next up in GRINDELWALD are a boatload of characters and the Eiffel tower in the background (FANTASTIC BEASTS already very small in the logo). And for DUMBLEDORE'S SECRETS (part 3) we have Hogwarts big on the cover. It's like Warner, Rowling and the producers are so desperate as to shout ""Please come back, it's about Hogwarts again!!! It's things you know!! Nostalgia!!""I think people are already more discerning today and don't have blind loyalty to a franchise that just doesn't deliver and doesn't know what it wants. It's gonna be tough if they really want to make 5 movies total of these. I can't see this gaining more fans over time.I give it 4/10 because relative to it's budget and fan base, it was just awful.By the way - what were the crimes of Grindelwald?

7.0,A lot of fantastic elements but not quite fantastic enough overall,"Am something of a fan of Harry Potter, books and films. Having grown up with the franchise and cherishing the fond memories being engrossed in the books, the midnight shopping trips to get the latest one and watching the films in the cinema being entertained, dazzled and at times even scared. Found myself really enjoying the first 'Fantastic Beasts' film, though not all my friends and family did for understandable reasons.Had high hopes for 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald'. It became one of my most anticipated films of the year after being captivated by the trailer. Although the critical reception was mixed, the high hopes were not shattered because word of mouth from friends, whose opinions this reviewer always trusts, was positive and am someone aiming to see all the film for franchise completest sake. My thoughts after watching 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' were mostly positive though with a few fairly serious misgivings.'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' is a sequel that is bigger in spectacle, darker in content and bolder in its basic story. Yet, compared to some sequels that have earned that distinction by me, it is an example of a follow-up that fell short of being better. It wasn't for me vastly inferior and the drop in quality was not large, although visually this film looked better and preferred the cast here too the previous film had more focus and cohesion and the creatures were used better. Can totally see where critics are coming from while also seeing what those who liked it saw in it.Will get the not so good things out of the way. Do agree with those who have described 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' as over-stuffed. There are too many characters and not all of them are necessary and the others given too short shrift, the inclusion of Nicolas Flamel for instance was pointless with him having literally nothing to do and felt merely there as a thrown in Harry Potter reference. It was great to see life at Hogwarts and feel nostalgic with the references, but that was also hurt by that what was shown didn't seem to fit continuity-wise.There were too many story strands too, variably explored. Making the story feel cluttered and not always focused, which affects the cohesion. The big revelation(s) in the last act, especially for what seemed to be the conclusion of the main story strand, did confuse me and needed much more breathing space for the viewer to take it all in, one is left in a whirlwind that gets bigger.Some of the pace could have been tighter, with some of the middle act meandering and not always involving. The ending came over as a bit rushed to me, well-staged but a slowing down pace-wise would have made the crucial revelations much clearer.However, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' has a lot of fantastic elements. Once again, it does look great and looks even better perhaps than the previous film. The production design is wondrous, especially once in Paris though loved the look of Hogwarts as well, and it is beautifully shot, with tighter editing and slightly more polished effects (though both were great in the previous film). Loved the little details too. The return of James Newton-Howard was a more than welcome one, with a score that is even more haunting, more whimsical, more ethereal and more rousing, one standout being in the beginning with the phantom carriage.Enjoyed enough of the script, with enough thoughtful, emotional (did feel for Credence) and amusing parts, the last one being provided by Jacob and the Niffler. Though there are parts that don't make the script here as focused as before and die-hard Harry Potter fans won't be squealing with delight as much and feeling as nostalgic over the references because the continuity fitted much more before. Although the story execution is flawed, there is charm, offbeat wit, imagination and nail-biting suspense, so the magic is there. Another improvement over the previous film is that the beginning gets to the point more and is better paced.David Yates' direction shows experience and he handles the set pieces very well. The phantom carriage escape and Ministry Library scenes really stand out, while the circus freak show part is suspenseful and intriguing. Would have loved to have seen far more of the creatures and more variety but when they do appear they are delightful and each serve purpose to the story. Again not only are they technical marvels they also have personality, the most used is the Zouwu, while the one that serves most point to the story is Pickett. My favourite will always be Niffler though. The characters are worth caring for generally and the cast are on great form. Eddie Redmayne has even more nuance and charm here and Johnny Depp's evil personified Grindelwald is vastly improved here. Ezra Miller's repression and Zoe Kravitz's empathy are moving to watch while Dan Fogler is amiable and very funny. Genius casting too is provided by Jude Law as Dumbledore, a fine example of creating enormous impression in relatively minor screen time. Katherine Waterston, while still commanding the screen beautifully, is on the underused side and Alison Sudol is not as charming.Overall, an enjoyable film with many fantastic elements.

It feels like a waste of energy, especially knowing that there are plenty of people out there who genuinely enjoy this film series, but I'm just not one of them.

In fact, the one decent thing about the first film (Queenie and Jacob) is entirely ruined in this film's third act.

6.0,"Stunning movie, but where was the plot..?","Let me start off by saying that I am a big Harry Potter fan; I loved all 8 HP movies, and really liked the 1st installment of Newt's adventures as well. This movie just didn't really do the trick for me. There was absolutely nothing to complain about visually; the movie was even more stunning than the first one, with even more beautifully designed 'Beasts'. And as many other people have mentioned, as a Harry Potter fan, you just can't hate this movie. Where Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only contained a handful amount of references to the Harry Potter series, The Crimes of Grindelwald has tonnes. Enough to hype up any Harry Potter fan.The problem this movie had for me was its plot, or rather, its almost nonexisting plot. This movie just seemed to serve as background information or something for the upcoming movies in this series (for which we'll undoubtedly have to wait another 2 years or more..), more of like a setup for things to come. It introduced many new characters and revealed certain things about already known characters. But yet, some of these things just felt unnatural, as if JK Rowling just kept writing more and more to squeeze into 1 movie. This basically leads to a movie where the biggest plot is to find Credence's 'true identity' - not really much of a plot at all. Some of the reveals about characters also seemed a bit strange, but that could be just me. All in all, all this dialogue about characters made it extra confusing to know what the movie was about, in addition to it lacking much of a plot to begin with.This movie is definitely not a waste of money or anything, you could just buy a ticket for the stunning scenes and you'd be satisfied. It's just that this movie was quite a disappointment compared to many people's expectations I think, seeing as it basically is just a setup for the upcoming movies, which lacks a good plot.",stunning movie but where was plot,let me start off by saying that i am big harry potter fan i loved all 8 hp movies really liked 1st installment newts adventures as well this movie just didnt really do trick me there was absolutely nothing complain about visually movie was even more stunning than first one with even more beautifully designed beasts as many other people have mentioned as harry potter fan you just cant hate this movie where fantastic beasts where find them only contained handful amount references harry potter series crimes grindelwald has tonnes enough hype up any harry potter fan problem this movie had me was its plot or rather its almost nonexisting plot this movie just seemed serve as background information or something upcoming movies this series which well undoubtedly have wait another 2 years or more more like setup things come it introduced many new characters revealed certain things about already known characters but yet some these things just felt unnatural as if jk rowling just kept writing more more squeeze into 1 movie this basically leads movie where biggest plot is find credences true identity not really much plot at all some reveals about characters also seemed bit strange but that could be just me all all all this dialogue about characters made it extra confusing know what movie was about addition it lacking much plot begin with this movie is definitely not waste money or anything you could just buy ticket stunning scenes youd be satisfied its just that this movie was quite disappointment compared many peoples expectations i think seeing as it basically is just setup upcoming movies which lacks good plot,0.5414677664677665,0.2547472797472798,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1.0,COnfusing and boring,"Not really sure how I can elaborate more on what other people have said, but yeah, very boring, long winded and confusing. If I hadn't watched the movie with someone who already saw it, I would have been lost. I had to keep pausing it and having them explain the plot to me. I was worried I was being a moron, but looking at other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one who was completely lost. Characters seemed to turn up out of completely nowhere, and some of the time, they're characters who have already been in previous scenes but since they weren't very well introduced or explained, I just kind of forgot they'd been in the film before. It's called ""crimes of grindalwald"", but he doesn't really do much of anything except walk around, all the film does is establish lore for the next movie.The reason I hated the first Fantastic Beasts was because it felt like one long trailer for the next movie. This movie just felt like a world building info dump for the third movie in what I presume will be a trilogy. I'm still waiting for the movie I went to watch 2 years ago and they keep holding it off. The characters aren't nice or lovable, or memorable, so when they turn evil or die, I simply don't care about it.The main character, whatever his name was, (just had to google it, Newt Scaramadger) is entirely unlikable and didn't really need to be in the film. Like, leave him as just a character for exclusively the first movie, and put all the content of the third movie into this one. all the grindlewald world building would only take like 15 minutes with him gone. And have grindlewald actually commit a ton of evil acts. His henchman does one or two bad things, but the man himself is legend for being a dark wizard and general menace, in this he just seems to be an extreme politician. I get the social commentary and all, but for a film called ""crimes of grindalwald"", i wanted to see him commit some. This film should have covered the period it skipped over. Why was grindalwald in jail? lets see him be friends with dumbledore. how did he become a dark wizard? all the stuff I'm actually interested in is skipped over, in favor of having some weird kid who turns into a floating black cloud who I don't care about be tracked down by everyone and treated like he has some important destiny that we aren't privvy to.But yeah, the plot was very messy and didn't make much sense. You shouldn't need a 300 IQ to piece together the plot of a Harry Potter film. I also felt myself questioning holes in logic in the wizarding world I never even had before, because this film didn't portray the universe very well. none of the charm of harry potter, just a bunch of special effects and a drab, predictable fantasy world that didn't make me excited one bit.

2.0,Most Disappointing Film Of The Year.,"Truly horrendous. Easily the most disappointing film I have seen all year, on a fundamental level this film was flawed, the primary culprit bing J.k Rowling and the extreme amounts of creative dominance she must have been given in the writing process.First, I must praise certain aspects of this motion picture, although there is little to commend. The performances were for the most part a strength (Although some let the side down), most notably Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore was wonderful as the caring, charming and more complex young Dumbledore. In addition to this, I must comment that Johnny Depp was a surprisingly positive cast member, also Eddie Redmayne was alright, a little overdone on the mumbling aspect but still a pleasure to see. The rest of the cast was fairly competent with the exception of those that will be stated later on.The screenplay of this film, what can I say. I have only negatives to deliver on this aspect. I can only image that what occurred was similar to George Lucas during the Star Wars Prequels - constantly surrounded by people who would only say 'Yes' to all the decisions. Because they are the one who mad the great original series, surely they can do no wrong. Oh how history has repeated Itself.This screenplay fails on the basic fundamentals of story telling, show don't tell. Most of this picture is two hours of continuous uninteresting drear, badly written with actors struggling to convey the poor choices and dialogue delivered by Rowling. I may be mistaken but in one scene in particular, in Hogwarts, Theseus Scamander gets called a 'Weasley' - If this is memory is true, it is symbolic of the shoddiness and laziness of the screenplay and many of the the basic failures of this film.The film follows two almost entirely unconnected threads, one of Credence and the other of Scamander. Both are boring, and the juxtaposition between them is jarring and fuel for confusion. The Credence plot-line is particularly of failure, it is highly unclear and unexplained, and is just 45 minutes of useless meandering with no emotional impact or significance to the plot as a whole. I even found Ezra Miller to almost seem as of he was struggling to even portray this incredibly bland, standard and boring character. I am one who knows a fair amount about the Harry Potter universe and at first I even didn't get the Nagini reference, until she became a snake in a very unnecessary and out of the blue scene, for she has zero effect upon even Credences story, I cant remember if she spoke a single line, and was so badly delivered by her actress by the fault of Rowling's screenplay.Newt Scamander's plot-line was almost equally as uninteresting and badly executed, for in his plotline, he barely does anything. Once could have removed Tina, Jacob, Queenie, Leta Lestrange, Theseus, Yusuf and Abernathy and the plot-line would have ended in petty much exactly the same place. It is overcrowded, and it is truly a waste of acting talent. For all these performers are of a high caliber and here do nothing. All these characters were uninteresting with the exception of Queenie who had a somewhat interesting arc but was executed badly due to Rowlings screenplay, this singular arc had much more potential.This plot-line is extremely convoluted, Newt Scamander has just over an hour of screen time, despite this being his movie, he is surprisingly not in it a great deal. There is one scene in particular which evokes my mention of the lack of the basic ""show don't tell"" fundamental of story telling. In this scene Leta Lestrange, Yusuf and the rest of the gang excluding Queenie, they use flashbacks to explain a plot thread about one characters lineage. It is extremely convoluted, and involves the Titanic, forced exposition and some complain about forced diversity (In making one of the Lestrages Black) but I dot not say that is a valid criticism. Overall this is supposed to tie up and be an evocative emotional moment for the majority of the characters in the narrative, but as the characters had little to no initial characterisation, the convolutedness only adds to the boredom, as the audience simply does not care for what is being presented, as well as how it is just exposition bing vomited at the audience, it is flimsy, boring and at the most fundamental bad film making, and entirely undefendable.As a result, all of the new characters introduced in this feature hold no significance to the plot, nor are emotionally invested in, thus a waste of time. In addition to this, Jacob is fairly wasted in this feature, he doesn't grow as a character and simply tags along like a fish out of water that is no longer funny for the most part. Although the running salamander joke was effective, but this was his sole contribution to the film, all he does is look shocked or hold buckets.Tina Goldstein played by Katherine Waterston is absolutely wasted as both a character and an actress. Such promise laid in this films precursor and yet contributes nothing to this feature, she had no function to the story nor any emotional impact on the audience at all. A total waste of Katherine Waterston who is a great talent in other motion pictures.Gellert Grindelwald was played by Johnny Depp. And wow, what a mixed bag, one the one had he was handled well by Depp however in terms of characterisation and villainy, Rowling has really let the side down. Apart from the reasonably good opening scene, Grindelwald is unthreataning, bland and disappears for large chunks of the narrative. Fo a film which bares his name, he was hardly the focal point (Nor was Newt Scamander, thus who is the foci of this film?) Grindelwald flat out says he doesn't want to kill muggles, or hurt them, so why is he a threat? What are his crimes? All the characters simply talk about how bad he was, it is never shown apart from one cliche scene of killing a family, it hold little emotional wight or significance. Once again this flaw falls on Rowling and fundamental rule of ""Show don't tell"". Which I needn't divulge again. But this displays the fatal flaw of this film, how it fails on a very basic level, to deliver a crude, boring, uninteresting and convoluted product. In addition to this, Rowling includes very unsubtle Anti-Trump undertones which when delivered well can be thought provoking but in this film, are not delivered well and give an even more jarring and convoluted third act.Now in must explore the screenplay as a whole. Of the greatest holes in the consistency of this feature is its two concurrent plots. For they are strenuously linked and are left unexplained, this results in headache, confusion and boredom. Nothing is resolved by the end, since there was no real problem at the beginning either, it feels like over two hours of useless meandering just propped up by bad hints to earlier greater works and setting up a future series, and every single film ever made in which isn't focus was to set up more films has been bad. For this film has no describable plot, it's a mess. Unlike other more successful films that have set up a future, such as phase one Marvel or heck even the first Hobbit film, they had discrete narratives of their own, and characters to invest in, this film does not have those fundamentals.The plot-twists of this film are unconvincing and unimaginative and hold no weight other than that hey relate to earlier films. This a lazy trick used by Rowling and is simply bad storytelling. For due to the lack of proper character development or emotional weight, the twists hod, no impact to the audience and thus are simply cheap ploys used by Rowling to try and save the feature, which clearly didn't work on most of the audience.On a technical level, this film holds some good aspects. The sound design and visual effects are for the most part fun and vivid but are fairly standard by modern blockbuster standards. The cinematography though, oh my god, it is terrible. Extreme disorientating closeups then suddenly standard unimaginative angles. It is truly jarring. The colouration is so incredible bland, other than the blue fake dragon at the end, no other image sticks in my head as memorable or even noteworthy or fun. It is almost black and white, so grey and depressing. This doesn't feel like a family friendly fantasy film about fun silly creatures and a Magizoologist, this feels like a fascist take over. If I had children I wouldn't show them this film, its grey, boring and jarring, all things unsuitable for young children over great distances of time.As a result of the abhorrently bland cinematography and colour palette, the costume design, set design, makeup and visual effects all suffer. The image becomes flat, uninteresting, after the last film won the Academy Award (Oscar) for Costume Design, this colouration choice really does an injustice to this achievement, and to the hard work the costume designers must have gone to to trump their previous achievement. Nothing about this films image is good, its truly a mistake and must be fixed if people are to remember any future instalments, or find them fun. For this blandness works against the film, it is not stylish but instead is boring. Not like 'Schindler's List' which was in almost pure B&W which gave the film character or more recently the film 'Her' which used a lot of red hues to heighten the loving and bemused atmosphere. This film has no clear focus as to what its colouration/cinematography was seeking to achieve. For if it seeks to be dark, it belongs not in a film called 'Fantastic Beasts', the pathetic fallacy fails on a fundamental level, the semantic's do not match up. This film sis so confused in so many aspects. Even the score was completely unremarkable and completely forgettable, I cant remember a single part of it. Showing that its only function was to dictate emotion, not to heighten or compliment it as a good score does. 2/10.",most disappointing film year,truly horrendous easily most disappointing film i have seen all year fundamental level this film was flawed primary culprit bing j k rowling extreme amounts creative dominance she must have been given writing process first i must praise certain aspects this motion picture although there is little commend performances were most part strength although some let side down most notably jude law as albus dumbledore was wonderful as caring charming more complex young dumbledore addition this i must comment that johnny depp was surprisingly positive cast member also eddie redmayne was alright little overdone mumbling aspect but still pleasure see rest cast was fairly competent with exception those that will be stated later screenplay this film what can i say i have only negatives deliver this aspect i can only image that what occurred was similar george lucas during star wars prequels constantly surrounded by people who would only say yes all decisions because they are one who mad great original series surely they can do no wrong oh how history has repeated itself this screenplay fails basic fundamentals story telling show dont tell most this picture is two hours continuous uninteresting drear badly written with actors struggling convey poor choices dialogue delivered by rowling i may be mistaken but one scene particular hogwarts theseus scamander gets called weasley if this is memory is true it is symbolic shoddiness laziness screenplay many basic failures this film film follows two almost entirely unconnected threads one credence other scamander both are boring juxtaposition between them is jarring fuel confusion credence plot line is particularly failure it is highly unclear unexplained is just 45 minutes useless meandering with no emotional impact or significance plot as whole i even found ezra miller almost seem as he was struggling even portray this incredibly bland standard boring character i am one who knows fair amount about harry potter universe at first i even didnt get nagini reference until she became snake very unnecessary out blue scene she has zero effect upon even credences story i cant remember if she spoke single line was so badly delivered by her actress by fault rowlings screenplay newt scamanders plot line was almost equally as uninteresting badly executed his plotline he barely does anything once could have removed tina jacob queenie leta lestrange theseus yusuf abernathy plot line would have ended petty much exactly same place it is overcrowded it is truly waste acting talent all these performers are high caliber here do nothing all these characters were uninteresting with exception queenie who had somewhat interesting arc but was executed badly due rowlings screenplay this singular arc had much more potential this plot line is extremely convoluted newt scamander has just over hour screen time despite this being his movie he is surprisingly not it great deal there is one scene particular which evokes my mention lack basic show dont tell fundamental story telling this scene leta lestrange yusuf rest gang excluding queenie they use flashbacks explain plot thread about one characters lineage it is extremely convoluted involves titanic forced exposition some complain about forced diversity making one lestrages black but i dot not say that is valid criticism overall this is supposed tie up be evocative emotional moment majority characters narrative but as characters had little no initial characterisation convolutedness only adds boredom as audience simply does not care what is being presented as well as how it is just exposition bing vomited at audience it is flimsy boring at most fundamental bad film making entirely undefendable as result all new characters introduced this feature hold no significance plot nor are emotionally invested thus waste time addition this jacob is fairly wasted this feature he doesnt grow as character simply tags along like fish out water that is no longer funny most part although running salamander joke was effective but this was his sole contribution film all he does is look shocked or hold buckets tina goldstein played by katherine waterston is absolutely wasted as both character actress such promise laid this films precursor yet contributes nothing this feature she had no function story nor any emotional impact audience at all total waste katherine waterston who is great talent other motion pictures gellert grindelwald was played by johnny depp wow what mixed bag one one had he was handled well by depp however terms characterisation villainy rowling has really let side down apart reasonably good opening scene grindelwald is unthreataning bland disappears large chunks narrative fo film which bares his name he was hardly focal point nor was newt scamander thus who is foci this film grindelwald flat out says he doesnt want kill muggles or hurt them so why is he threat what are his crimes all characters simply talk about how bad he was it is never shown apart one cliche scene killing family it hold little emotional wight or significance once again this flaw falls rowling fundamental rule show dont tell which i neednt divulge again but this displays fatal flaw this film how it fails very basic level deliver crude boring uninteresting convoluted product addition this rowling includes very unsubtle anti trump undertones which when delivered well can be thought provoking but this film are not delivered well give even more jarring convoluted third act now must explore screenplay as whole greatest holes consistency this feature is its two concurrent plots they are strenuously linked are left unexplained this results headache confusion boredom nothing is resolved by end since there was no real problem at beginning either it feels like over two hours useless meandering just propped up by bad hints earlier greater works setting up future series every single film ever made which isnt focus was set up more films has been bad this film has no describable plot its mess unlike other more successful films that have set up future such as phase one marvel or heck even first hobbit film they had discrete narratives their own characters invest this film does not have those fundamentals plot twists this film are unconvincing unimaginative hold no weight other than that hey relate earlier films this lazy trick used by rowling is simply bad storytelling due lack proper character development or emotional weight twists hod no impact audience thus are simply cheap ploys used by rowling try save feature which clearly didnt work most audience technical level this film holds some good aspects sound design visual effects are most part fun vivid but are fairly standard by modern blockbuster standards cinematography though oh my god it is terrible extreme disorientating closeups then suddenly standard unimaginative angles it is truly jarring colouration is so incredible bland other than blue fake dragon at end no other image sticks my head as memorable or even noteworthy or fun it is almost black white so grey depressing this doesnt feel like family friendly fantasy film about fun silly creatures magizoologist this feels like fascist take over if i had children i wouldnt show them this film its grey boring jarring all things unsuitable young children over great distances time as result abhorrently bland cinematography colour palette costume design set design makeup visual effects all suffer image becomes flat uninteresting after last film won academy award oscar costume design this colouration choice really does injustice this achievement hard work costume designers must have gone trump their previous achievement nothing about this films image is good its truly mistake must be fixed if people are remember any future instalments or find them fun this blandness works against film it is not stylish but instead is boring not like schindlers list which was almost pure b w which gave film character or more recently film her which used lot red hues heighten loving bemused atmosphere this film has no clear focus as what its colouration cinematography was seeking achieve if it seeks be dark it belongs not film called fantastic beasts pathetic fallacy fails fundamental level semantics do not match up this film sis so confused so many aspects even score was completely unremarkable completely forgettable i cant remember single part it showing that its only function was dictate emotion not heighten or compliment it as good score does 2 10,0.49694879321591656,0.0064395586655860634,Positive,"{'Happy':

4.0,More focused on franchise building than telling a good story!,"As both a lover of the Harry Potter Universe and a lover of movie going, I was thoroughly disappointed, even angry with this movie. While the visuals are as magical as ever, it's clear that the filmmakers are so distracted by trying to build a franchise that they're forgetting to actually tell a good story! The chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced. With so many new people and also so many questions for our old heroes, there wasn't enough time for any kind of (explainable) character development or for the viewers to connect with anyone on the screen. The only ""character development"" with one of our main heroes felt random and out of character and we aren't given much reason or warning for this change. I was also very disappointed with the writing behind Tina's character as her role was demoted from a strong willed Auror and woman to merely a side kick and love interest. Huge and important elements of the story were left for us only to assume what had happened when discussing the one year time jump between the two films (like the Jacob/Queenie relationship, Jacobs memory, etc.). As a whole, the film screamed ""money hungry"" and ""franchise building"" rather than letting us really connect with the characters. It also seemed as if they were only adding in twists that would surely get a reaction from viewers despite the fact that they not only discredited the original Harry Potter films, but just felt like unrealistic and a little too convenient! In short, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter Universe, I was disappointed, upset and felt really let down, and as a film goer, I was confused with the plot and frustrated with the lack of character connection and development! The only reason I have given a 4/10 instead of a 1 is for Eddie Redmayne's perfect execution of the shy, socially awkward but loveable and charming Newt Scamander and for the alluring performance from Jude Law's Dumbledore who leaves us wanting to know more of his history! But in the end, it was a huge disappointment as a stand-alone movie.",more focused franchise building than telling good story,as both lover harry potter universe lover movie going i was thoroughly disappointed even angry with this movie while visuals are as magical as ever its clear that filmmakers are so distracted by trying build franchise that theyre forgetting actually tell good story chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced with so many new people also so many questions our old heroes there wasnt enough time any kind explainable character development or viewers connect with anyone screen only character development with one our main heroes felt random out character we arent given much reason or warning this change i was also very disappointed with writing behind tinas character as her role was demoted strong willed auror woman merely side kick love interest huge important elements story were left us only assume what had happened when discussing one year time jump between two films like jacob queenie relationship jacobs memory etc as whole film screamed money hungry franchise building rather than letting us really connect with characters it also seemed as if they were only adding twists that would surely get reaction viewers despite fact that they not only discredited original harry potter films but just felt like unrealistic little too convenient short as huge fan harry potter universe i was disappointed upset felt really let down as film goer i was confused with plot frustrated with lack character connection development only reason i have given 4 10 instead 1 is eddie redmaynes perfect execution shy socially awkward but loveable charming newt scamander alluring performance jude laws dumbledore who leaves us wanting know more his history but end it was huge disappointment as stand alone movie,0.6244377739660757,0.06974223365732801,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.41}"
4.0,What a DISGRACE to the magical world of JK Rowling..,"If I were to describe this movie with one word , I would say it was a ""Filler"" It was only after the movie that i was informed that the Fantastic Beasts ""franchise"" is going to be a 5 movie one . After I learned that , this movie's purpose became so clear to me . I just watched a 2-hour movie in which the main characters had NOTHING to do with the plot AT ALL . This movie was all about Grindelwald finding Credence and convincing him to join his army so Credence would kill Dumbledore in the future . Newt , Tina , Jacob and Quennie did nothing in this movie but couple-fighting and catching maybe 1 or 2 magical creatures. We got to follow a story about Newt's childhood love , which led to absolutely nothing . The main characters just made it to the right place at the right time to spectate the end of the movie in which Grindelwald finds Credence , convinces him to join his army and boom , that is the movie . The only thing that Newt did is stealing the ""blood-bond"" between Grindelwald and Dumbledore by using the Niffler. All in all , it was a really poor movie , the plot was shallow and it was totally a filler . It just gave us a little bit of magic but that's it . I give it a 4 only because i am a huge Harry Potter fan . This movie made me really unhappy by seeing my favorite magical world being milked for money . We don't really need 5 movies with the 2 being fillers , all we needed was 3 magical rides to the Harry Potter world . Thanks for reading this . 4/10",what disgrace magical world jk rowling,if i were describe this movie with one word i would say it was filler it was only after movie that i was informed that fantastic beasts franchise is going be 5 movie one after i learned that this movies purpose became so clear me i just watched 2 hour movie which main characters had nothing do with plot at all this movie was all about grindelwald finding credence convincing him join his army so credence would kill dumbledore future newt tina jacob quennie did nothing this movie but couple fighting catching maybe 1 or 2 magical creatures we got follow story about newts childhood love which led absolutely nothing main characters just made it right place at right time spectate end movie which grindelwald finds credence convinces him join his army boom that is movie only thing that newt did is stealing blood bond between grindelwald dumbledore by using niffler all all it was really poor movie plot was shallow it was totally filler it just gave us little bit magic but thats it i give it 4 only because i am huge harry potter fan this movie made me really unhappy by seeing my favorite magical world being milked money we dont really need 5 movies with 2 being fillers all we needed was 3 magical rides harry potter world thanks reading this 4 10,0.7177295918367347,0.19585459183673473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.44}"
