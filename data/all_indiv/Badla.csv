5,Copy of the Spanish original 2016th Contratiempo.,"I have seen the Original Spanish version of this movie last year and rated it an eight. I knew the 2019th Badla was a direct copy of that movie. What interested me was how they would change the most famous Amitabh Bachchan in an unknown man.Everything of Badla is the same of the movie Contratiempo. Well almost everything. Badla is an Indian production and the main characters of Contratiempo changed from gender in the Indian version. I liked seeing Amitabh perform, especially knowing the story and the plot twist at the end. Yes I can say the acting is very solid.But here is my thing. I am not a supporter of people who copy movies. Instead of putting all the effort in making Badla, they could have supported Contratiempo as a good movie. Maybe people of India should look outside the box, that is called India. There are many good movies made in other countries. Please don't copy movies, because you ran out of original ideas of your own.Good movie. But because it is a copy, it does not deserve a high rating. If this movie would have been the original, I would have given it my fullest support.",copy spanish original 2016th contratiempo,i have seen original spanish version this movie last year rated it eight i knew 2019th badla was direct copy that movie what interested me was how they would change most famous amitabh bachchan unknown man everything badla is same movie contratiempo well almost everything badla is indian production main characters contratiempo changed gender indian version i liked seeing amitabh perform especially knowing story plot twist at end yes i can say acting is very solid but here is my thing i am not supporter people who copy movies instead putting all effort making badla they could have supported contratiempo as good movie maybe people india should look outside box that is called india there are many good movies made other countries please dont copy movies because you ran out original ideas your own good movie but because it is copy it does not deserve high rating if this movie would have been original i would have given it my fullest support,0.4892307692307692,0.2596794871794872,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.42}"
4,A remake shouldn't mean copy paste,"When you watch a remake of an outstanding movie with some mind-blowing twist in the end and some amazing cinematography and acting, you already have your expectations at the next level. To be really fair, I was awestruck after watching ""An invisible guest"" and the effect it left after, but I still watched Badla with a neutral mind and gave it a genuine try. But at the end, I felt I just saw a translated version of it's original. It's a screen by screen copy paste along with 90 percent of the dialogues. The only change was the gender. Come on Ghosh ji, use some of your creativity. Why would you just remake the movie exactly the same. Remake doesn't mean copy paste. For instance, look at Don. That's a fab remake, it not only gave justice to it's predecessor but also took it to a different level. For those of you who liked Badla, just watch it's original and you will understand my super disappointment.",remake shouldnt mean copy paste,when you watch remake outstanding movie with some mind blowing twist end some amazing cinematography acting you already have your expectations at next level be really fair i was awestruck after watching invisible guest effect it left after but i still watched badla with neutral mind gave it genuine try but at end i felt i just saw translated version its original its screen by screen copy paste along with 90 percent dialogues only change was gender come ghosh ji use some your creativity why would you just remake movie exactly same remake doesnt mean copy paste instance look at don thats fab remake it not only gave justice its predecessor but also took it different level those you who liked badla just watch its original you will understand my super disappointment,0.5912037037037038,0.1476851851851852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.58, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.26}"

6,An interesting remake,"First thing first, be aware that this movie is a 99% remake of the excellent 2-year-old movie Contratiempo (2016). Just switch the genders and the Hispanic actors with hindi ones. In August 2019, both movies are available on Netflix but, for some unexplained reason, Netflix does not connect them in the 'more like this' section. That's weird!Then, is Badla (2019) a bad remake? Objectively and definitely no! I think bad reviews come from anger at seeing a remake without knowing it. And that's fully understandable. You are now officially warned!Finally, I catch a glimpse of two possibilities: 1) either you have already seen Contratiempo (2016) and I kindly invite you to strongly postpone the screening of this remake, unless you unfortunately suffer from Alzheimer or 2) you haven't already seen Contratiempo (2016) and you have the choice between a Hispanic atmosphere or a hindi one.",interesting remake,first thing first be aware that this movie is 99 remake excellent 2 year old movie contratiempo 2016 just switch genders hispanic actors with hindi ones august 2019 both movies are available netflix but some unexplained reason netflix does not connect them more like this section thats weird then is badla 2019 bad remake objectively definitely no i think bad reviews come anger at seeing remake without knowing it thats fully understandable you are now officially warned finally i catch glimpse two possibilities 1 either you have already seen contratiempo 2016 i kindly invite you strongly postpone screening this remake unless you unfortunately suffer alzheimer or 2 you havent already seen contratiempo 2016 you have choice between hispanic atmosphere or hindi one,0.5657407407407408,0.062962962962963,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8,"Even aft watching the original in 2017, i got pulled into seeing this cos of two reasons.","After having already seen The Invisible Guest in 2017 n having posted a review of it, two things really pulled me into seeing this official remake : the top notch cinematography n Mr. Bachan. The trailer looked as if they did more expenditure compared to the original n the movie proved it.The plot is the same but with a small change, in the original, a businessman stands accused of murdering his lover as he was found with the lover's dead body in a locked hotel room. But in this case they made a businesswoman an accused.The London locations r awesome, the marshland and woodlands of the rural area is picturesque. The spooky hotel a la The Shining in the middle of nowhere really stands out.Another good aspect is that there r no songs n dance, no hero bashing goons matrix style, no jingoism, no six packs, etc.",even aft watching original 2017 i got pulled into seeing this cos two reasons,after having already seen invisible guest 2017 n having posted review it two things really pulled me into seeing this official remake top notch cinematography n mr bachan trailer looked as if they did more expenditure compared original n movie proved it plot is same but with small change original businessman stands accused murdering his lover as he was found with lovers dead body locked hotel room but this case they made businesswoman accused london locations r awesome marshland woodlands rural area is picturesque spooky hotel la shining middle nowhere really stands out another good aspect is that there r no songs n dance no hero bashing goons matrix style no jingoism no six packs etc,0.4410714285714286,0.2696428571428572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.38}"

6,"An Interesting Film, With A Weak Ending!","An official adaptation of the Spanish Film ""The Invisible Guest"", Director Sujoy Ghosh's 'BADLA' is an interesting murder-mystery, that keeps you guessing. While not entirely unpredictable neither perfect, this atmospheric film is a ride you wouldn't mind taking.'BADLA' Synopsis: When top businesswoman Naina (Taapsee) is accused of murdering her lover, she seeks help from a prolific lawyer Badal Gupta (Amitabh Bachchan) to defend her. Naina says she is innocent, but is she telling the truth?'BADLA' is a cat and mouse film, where an accused and her lawyer discover each other, while taking us to the back story that involves the murder here in question. And Ghosh, also Writer here, adapts the story well. The mystery unfolds well, and its twisted-ness manages to hold your grip. A particular sub-plot involving a grieving mother (Amrita Singh) is well-done and gives the film a nice emotional spin. Singh, superb in the role, proves how underrated the veteran has remained almost all through her career.The only glitch in Ghosh's Writing lies in its culmination. And for any suspense murder-mystery, the finale is the most crucial. But, sadly, 'BADLA' lacks the bite here. The main twist in the tale is rather implausible and will make you question it. In short, the film works until the end. A more cleverer end was the need here! The Dialogue are enjoyable. Ghosh's Direction is skilled and well-done. The director is in form this time. Avik Mukhopadhyay's Cinematography captures the grim beauty of Glasgow, brilliantly. Editing is razor-crisp, as the film wraps up under a neat 120-minutes. Art and Costume Design are top-notch. Background Score is first-rate.Performance-Wise: Taapsee and Amitabh challenge each other with arresting turns. Taapsee captures the flawed woman with a fierceness that comes across as natural rather than overdone. And Amitabh, as always, commands the screen. It's been 50 years since this man started working in movies and even 5 decades later, there are a very few who can hold your attention like Bachchan does. In supporting roles, Manav Kaul is underused, while Tony Luke is fantastic and adds to the film's mystery, purely on the strength of his personality.On the whole, 'BADLA' will keep you guessing. Just don't expect to be blown away when the final suspense reveals.

6,"Decent entertainment, interesting narrative","Badla is a very good murder mystery by Sujoy Ghosh. The film flows really well and keeps commanding the viewers' attention all through, mainly thanks to the great narrative style. The film is set in a room where a lawyer interviews his client, a businesswoman who is accused of having murdered of her lover and maintains she is innocent. The style employed in the film, where multiple versions as imagined and recounted by either the lawyer or the woman take the form of a flashback, thus creating a myriad of different flashbacks and twists, is really captivating. Now, this is not an original film, it is an official remake, and I wouldn't go as far as to say it is a great film, but it's really very enjoyable and tense. The film's actors do very well and obviously Bachchan is the one who leads the cast with a predictably excellent performance, which only grows as the film goes on. As the manipulative and immoral leading lady, Taapsee Pannu does well with a fairly unlikable character.
