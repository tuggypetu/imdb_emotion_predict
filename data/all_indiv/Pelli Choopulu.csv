9.0,Tharun Bhascker Scores and how!,"Tharun Bhascker Daassyam, almost a year and half ago, this name was trending in the film fraternity, especially in TFI and do you know why? That's because, one of the most acclaimed short films of recent times 'Sainma' debuted online at that time and later got released on YouTube after making enough fortune. And that film is this man Bhascker's brain child. Well, you might wonder why I'm stressing so much on his short 'Sainma' rather than talking about 'Pellichupulu', that's because the 20 odd minutes you spend watching 'Sainma' speaks volumes about this mans talent and believe me, you will never regret watching it. Coming to the current topic, the flick's based or precisely developed from Bhascker's previously directed, another well acclaimed short 'Anukokunda'. The film is a coming of age comedy-drama and the story is about Chitra and Prashanth who meet for the first time in a pellichupulu and eventually how they travel along with each other is what that follows. That's it, simple right? No, hold on. There are a lot of twists and turns in this simple story line, thanks to the well written screenplay. The way in which the first half runs is too damn good. It just flows and you won't even realise its almost time for a break. Though the story gets a lil predictable in the second half, it still manages to keep audience intact with the flow. The characters and the characterizations in the film are so near to reality that one can easily relate to them. And the dialogues are one of the biggest assets to the film, simple and real. The actors Vijay Devarakonda and Ritu Varma were competent to show there skills and make their presence felt. They did a 100% justice to their characters, commendable performances. And there is this character named 'Kaushik' played by Priyadarshi, man o man, what a gem of dialogue delivery he has! Made the whole theatre erupt in laughter for more than 10 times I guess, brilliant acting. Rest of the cast did their part well. Coming to the technical side, editing was neat. Cinematography was good. Music, scored by Vivek Sagar was too good and apt at many situations. Very hardly does one see The Hindu review a movie and call it 'A Gem'. What more do you want? Just go and grab a ticket, this one's a sure shot hit.",tharun bhascker scores how,tharun bhascker daassyam almost year half ago this name was trending film fraternity especially tfi do you know why thats because one most acclaimed short films recent times sainma debuted online at that time later got released youtube after making enough fortune that film is this man bhasckers brain child well you might wonder why im stressing so much his short sainma rather than talking about pellichupulu thats because 20 odd minutes you spend watching sainma speaks volumes about this mans talent believe me you will never regret watching it coming current topic flicks based or precisely developed bhasckers previously directed another well acclaimed short anukokunda film is coming age comedy drama story is about chitra prashanth who meet first time pellichupulu eventually how they travel along with each other is what that follows thats it simple right no hold there are lot twists turns this simple story line thanks well written screenplay way which first half runs is too damn good it just flows you wont even realise its almost time break though story gets lil predictable second half it still manages keep audience intact with flow characters characterizations film are so near reality that one can easily relate them dialogues are one biggest assets film simple real actors vijay devarakonda ritu varma were competent show there skills make their presence felt they did 100 justice their characters commendable performances there is this character named kaushik played by priyadarshi man o man what gem dialogue delivery he has made whole theatre erupt laughter more than 10 times i guess brilliant acting rest cast did their part well coming technical side editing was neat cinematography was good music scored by vivek sagar was too good apt at many situations very hardly does one see hindu review movie call it gem what more do you want just go grab ticket this ones sure shot hit,0.41647748246585453,0.16933831672203767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8.0,A laugh riot that's realistic and well put.,"A laugh riot that's realistic and well put.After a long time, I enjoyed a Telugu Film and felt happy after coming out of the theater and also watch it another time. Last time I had such a feeling for a Telugu Film was for ""Mithunam"" and it was four years ago.The good thing is that this film does not have any dances, there are no fights, there are no melodramatic dialogues. Though the sentimental part drags the movie, the humour overtook the drag and added a pull. It's the fun I took back home and was happy with the feeling this movie gave.The protagonists were new for me and of all the characters I liked the character of ""Kaushik"". It is played by ""Priyadarshi"". Of course, the film belongs to Ritu Varma as ""Chitra"" who reminded of ""Roopa"" in Anand (Anand is a 2004 film).It's refreshing to see a new director make a movie that's terrific in content (the writing, narration) and make the actors do an excellent job. Kudos to Tharun Bhascker. He has a long way to go if he sticks to non-commercial films and believes that content is above all else.The cinematography and editing are two departments which impressed me. The camera was invisible, as there are no specific long shots. The whole movie is shot in a straightforward and realistic way which is a huge bonus. From locations to interiors decors it was all well put and also colorful at the same time. There was life all through the film and hardly there was any dull visual. Also, the film was fluid with very few dull moments (dull moments were mostly in the sentimental last half hour). The cuts done were nice; there were no jump cuts and it is simply put. So, Telugu Film Industry can look forward to Nagesh Banell the cinematographer and Ravi Teja Girijala the editor. These are two good finds from the film.I was impressed by the use of music too. Taking the budget constraints into account Music is a commendable job done by Vivek Sagar. I loved the usage of the song ""Raalu Raaga Poolamaala."" Also, I must appreciate a huge fact this film is done in Sync Sound. That is there is no dubbing used; a terrific challenge is handled well and the results are seen in the movie.I am not putting the story or any dialogues out here. I am sure the Telugu Film Audience will embrace a film like.A 4/5 for a Telugu Film. A rarity from me but this is one film I will watch multiple times.",laugh riot thats realistic well put,laugh riot thats realistic well put after long time i enjoyed telugu film felt happy after coming out theater also watch it another time last time i had such feeling telugu film was mithunam it was four years ago good thing is that this film does not have any dances there are no fights there are no melodramatic dialogues though sentimental part drags movie humour overtook drag added pull its fun i took back home was happy with feeling this movie gave protagonists were new me all characters i liked character kaushik it is played by priyadarshi course film belongs ritu varma as chitra who reminded roopa anand anand is 2004 film its refreshing see new director make movie thats terrific content writing narration make actors do excellent job kudos tharun bhascker he has long way go if he sticks non commercial films believes that content is above all else cinematography editing are two departments which impressed me camera was invisible as there are no specific long shots whole movie is shot straightforward realistic way which is huge bonus locations interiors decors it was all well put also colorful at same time there was life all through film hardly there was any dull visual also film was fluid with very few dull moments dull moments were mostly sentimental last half hour cuts done were nice there were no jump cuts it is simply put so telugu film industry can look forward nagesh banell cinematographer ravi teja girijala editor these are two good finds film i was impressed by use music too taking budget constraints into account music is commendable job done by vivek sagar i loved usage song raalu raaga poolamaala also i must appreciate huge fact this film is done sync sound that is there is no dubbing used terrific challenge is handled well results are seen movie i am not putting story or any dialogues out here i am sure telugu film audience will embrace film like 4 5 telugu film rarity me but this is one film i will watch multiple times,0.4928796727381634,0.20385648942252715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A breath of fresh air,"After the very well deserved failures of Brahmotsavam, Sardar Gabbar Singh and Aagdu, the Telugu audience had shown maturity in rejecting formulaic horrible movies with larger than life hero worship. Pellichupulu, the little movie, comes as a breath of fresh air. The USP of the movie is a simple story that connects. For a change, no one in the movie is running around screaming as if their life is at stake. I do not want to write about the various aspects of the movie as the other reviewers have already said it better. The movie is based on real life incidents which are extremely believable. The lead pair has a fabulous chemistry and the comic situations are extremely funny. The future of Telugu film industry is glorious if such movies keep getting attention and success. Go watch it, this one is a gem.",breath fresh air,after very well deserved failures brahmotsavam sardar gabbar singh aagdu telugu audience had shown maturity rejecting formulaic horrible movies with larger than life hero worship pellichupulu little movie comes as breath fresh air usp movie is simple story that connects change no one movie is running around screaming as if their life is at stake i do not want write about various aspects movie as other reviewers have already said it better movie is based real life incidents which are extremely believable lead pair has fabulous chemistry comic situations are extremely funny future telugu film industry is glorious if such movies keep getting attention success go watch it this one is gem,0.47142857142857136,0.0993421052631579,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Well-made movie with a perfect local flavor,"A whiff of fresh air, after a glut of movies trudging the same cliché-ridden run-of-the-mill plot lines and mainstream tropes some of us are really tired of. Now, one thing a lot of people are gonna feel about the movie when they walk out, is its connect to the food industry, and while that exists, in a manner of speaking, it is (unfortunately, to me) not the sole focus, and the link is, at best, tenuous. The way they do not get into details the way The 100-foot journey /Cheeni Kum / Burnt / Chef (food trucks come from this one) / No Reservations / Ratatouille all do. However, let's look at all the good stuff first. Believe me, most of the stuff IS good. 1. For a few, pace could be the thing. For me though, no matter how long the movie is, 'how long did it feel' is a key component of things I look for. For this one, it just zipped past, all thru, even when it did take the cliché-ridden route on many occasions post- intermission, and even overall, it clocks at a lean/mean 2 hours/so, even with an informal/blooper reel during the end-credits (a trend of sorts these days). 2. Feel that this could be a spiritual companion-piece to Shekhar Kammula's 'Godavari'. That one took 2 strong-minded leads, followed their respective trajectories, and using a road-movie template allowed us to watch things unfurl, while this one sticks to their trajectories, and watches things unfurl over there. Ritu Varma (previously seen with both Nani and Vijay Devarakonda in 'Yevade Subrahmanyam', this time reuniting with Vijay D) is almost a perfect foil for Kamalini Mukherjee (though not as cute/sweet/endearing as Kammula's muse), and while Devarakonda's & Sumanth's characters are polar opposites of the other, while having similar trajectories eventually, esp. when it comes to relating to their leading ladies. Of course, another movie with which this one has it DNA firmly in- place is 'Band Baaja Baaraat' (imho, Singh/Sharma have not come close to topping their performances from that one yet, in spite of all the accolades they've received for their later work, but their characters could not hold a candle to the lead pair in this one), with the milieu being changed from wedding planning to operating/running the business of food trucks.3. The eclectic selection of background score themes and the songs that play in the background, that (gradually seem/sound to) fit each situation, and yet have something for everyone (everyone will not enjoy everything on play, btw), which is quite unorthodox, and kinda stood out for me. Disappointingly though, not all of the score made it to the iTunes album being sold. 1 of the best parts about the score though, is that they play out mostly in the background, and do not interrupt the flow of the narrative, sometimes looping over various sequences, guiding context based on the similarity of musical theme.4. The production/set design, along with the cinematography, are pitch-perfect for the material on hand, and complement the narrative in just the right way, without calling attention to themselves. 5. The narrative style changes from the one pre-intermission (mostly contextual flashbacks) to the staid one that takes over post, and makes for an interesting transition. Keeps our interest going, for most of the time. 6. All the performances are good, and the screenplay gives the best lines to 2 relatively new character actors, 1 with a comic theme (Priyadarshi Pulikonda), and the other playing an unorthodox matter- of-fact kind of character, the kind that is rarely-seen in local fare (Anish Kuruvilla). Gururaj Manepalli and Kedar Shankar get the opportunity to weave a few interesting/unorthodox notes into their clichéed roles, and that is, indeed, something of a pleasure to watch. Short shrift is given to some (Abhay Bethiganti - I think there was some material there, and the lady who plays Anish Kuruvilla's daughter), but that's par for the course, I guess. The elephant in the room, is of course, what almost everyone has taken away from this flick, that of the deadpan-deliverer of the funniest lines in the flick - Priyadarshi Pulikonda. I won't say much abt it, other than saying that it's not just his success, and credit has to go to the writer/director equally, if not more - Tharun Bhascker Dhaasyam.7. While I did not like the way certain lead characters treat the household help, in hindsight, the way it has been depicted does shine the light on cold fact. 8. One of my all-time favorite aspects about the movie is the way they've shot it in 2 of my fav places to dine out locally - Café D- Hide (for some reason tho, they called it 'Social', even though the sign is clearly visible), and Cinema Social (watched it in the same mall, coincidentally), and the time they take over there (which, for my money, was good, but not about enough). :-). On the other side though, other than the movie not embracing its milieu the way it's apparent inspirations did (referred to earlier her), mature language is also allowed to be present, which is topical. However, it also points to the hypocrisy inherent in the local guardiansofthemovies, which would have muted/cut off the same words in an international production. Sigh. I also did not much care for the way Hash browns were used to signify taste, but will not talk about the context much.Anyways, in conclusion, worth repeat viewings, on the big screen...",well made movie with perfect local flavor,whiff fresh air after glut movies trudging same clich ridden run mill plot lines mainstream tropes some us are really tired now one thing lot people are gonna feel about movie when they walk out is its connect food industry while that exists manner speaking it is unfortunately me not sole focus link is at best tenuous way they do not get into details way 100 foot journey cheeni kum burnt chef food trucks come this one no reservations ratatouille all do however lets look at all good stuff first believe me most stuff is good 1 few pace could be thing me though no matter how long movie is how long did it feel is key component things i look this one it just zipped past all thru even when it did take clich ridden route many occasions post intermission even overall it clocks at lean mean 2 hours so even with informal blooper reel during end credits trend sorts these days 2 feel that this could be spiritual companion piece shekhar kammulas godavari that one took 2 strong minded leads followed their respective trajectories using road movie template allowed us watch things unfurl while this one sticks their trajectories watches things unfurl over there ritu varma previously seen with both nani vijay devarakonda yevade subrahmanyam this time reuniting with vijay d is almost perfect foil kamalini mukherjee though not as cute sweet endearing as kammulas muse while devarakondas sumanths characters are polar opposites other while having similar trajectories eventually esp when it comes relating their leading ladies course another movie with which this one has it dna firmly place is band baaja baaraat imho singh sharma have not come close topping their performances that one yet spite all accolades theyve received their later work but their characters could not hold candle lead pair this one with milieu being changed wedding planning operating running business food trucks 3 eclectic selection background score themes songs that play background that gradually seem sound fit each situation yet have something everyone everyone will not enjoy everything play btw which is quite unorthodox kinda stood out me disappointingly though not all score made it itunes album being sold 1 best parts about score though is that they play out mostly background do not interrupt flow narrative sometimes looping over various sequences guiding context based similarity musical theme 4 production set design along with cinematography are pitch perfect material hand complement narrative just right way without calling attention themselves 5 narrative style changes one pre intermission mostly contextual flashbacks staid one that takes over post makes interesting transition keeps our interest going most time 6 all performances are good screenplay gives best lines 2 relatively new character actors 1 with comic theme priyadarshi pulikonda other playing unorthodox matter fact kind character kind that is rarely seen local fare anish kuruvilla gururaj manepalli kedar shankar get opportunity weave few interesting unorthodox notes into their clich ed roles that is indeed something pleasure watch short shrift is given some abhay bethiganti i think there was some material there lady who plays anish kuruvillas daughter but thats par course i guess elephant room is course what almost everyone has taken away this flick that deadpan deliverer funniest lines flick priyadarshi pulikonda i wont say much abt it other than saying that its not just his success credit has go writer director equally if not more tharun bhascker dhaasyam 7 while i did not like way certain lead characters treat household help hindsight way it has been depicted does shine light cold fact 8 one my all time favorite aspects about movie is way theyve shot it 2 my fav places dine out locally caf d hide some reason tho they called it social even though sign is clearly visible cinema social watched it same mall coincidentally time they take over there which my money was good but not about enough other side though other than movie not embracing its milieu way its apparent inspirations did referred earlier her mature language is also allowed be present which is topical however it also points hypocrisy inherent local guardiansofthemovies which would have muted cut off same words international production sigh i also did not much care way hash browns were used signify taste but will not talk about context much anyways conclusion worth repeat viewings big screen,0.4084197890232374,0.17469958202716826,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,Pellichoopulu is the one of the best Telugu movies I've seen in a while!,"I watched Pellichoopulu without much hope of being impressed or even of being entertained. Recent Telugu movies have been passable, but nothing that really got my attention. Pellichoopulu totally blew these thoughts out of my head!The first half of PC was riotously funny, as the gang led by Prashant (Vijay Devarakonda) are goons who engage in the same dumb things college guys do around the world. Koushik (Priyadarshi) was unbelievably funny--the last time I remember laughing that much at a comedian's antics was maybe the Sunil of old (movies like Dhee, Ready, etc.). Ritu Verma as Chitra was awesome--I distinctly remember being amazed that there was finally a true-to-life strong female character in a Telugu movie. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the first half was that it was so current and relevant. Every teenager sees aspects of their group of friends in Prashant's gang, and the insertion of jokes about social media was timely and hilarious. Chitra's determination and modern character makeup was far more reminiscent of today's Indian women than the made-up doll roles that Tammannah, Samantha, and even Kajal frequently find themselves in.The second half slowed down considerably, as the focus shifted to the emerging love story between Prashant and Chitra. I was a little less enthused about this half, but I believe it to have been very well done in its own way. The tension between the two kept me engaged, and the non-obvious way in which it resolved itself left me more satisfied than the usual fight scenes that Telugu movies use as a way of having a hero save the heroine.Overall, Pelli Choopulu is a must-watch with great writing, direction, and action. I know I will be watching it again for many years.",pellichoopulu is one best telugu movies ive seen while,i watched pellichoopulu without much hope being impressed or even being entertained recent telugu movies have been passable but nothing that really got my attention pellichoopulu totally blew these thoughts out my head first half pc was riotously funny as gang led by prashant vijay devarakonda are goons who engage same dumb things college guys do around world koushik priyadarshi was unbelievably funny last time i remember laughing that much at comedians antics was maybe sunil old movies like dhee ready etc ritu verma as chitra was awesome i distinctly remember being amazed that there was finally true life strong female character telugu movie perhaps most striking aspect first half was that it was so current relevant every teenager sees aspects their group friends prashants gang insertion jokes about social media was timely hilarious chitras determination modern character makeup was far more reminiscent todays indian women than made up doll roles that tammannah samantha even kajal frequently find themselves second half slowed down considerably as focus shifted emerging love story between prashant chitra i was little less enthused about this half but i believe it have been very well done its own way tension between two kept me engaged non obvious way which it resolved itself left me more satisfied than usual fight scenes that telugu movies use as way having hero save heroine overall pelli choopulu is must watch with great writing direction action i know i will be watching it again many years,0.4480607966457024,0.20406184486373163,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,#10/10 For a Telugu Movie,#MustWatch. Telugu movies are changing for the better. There is still room to grow though. And now the faults: 1. Child artists are used only for the cuteness. Same thing happens here with him getting locked in with the potential bride and groom. At least his role was very small. If used too much it goes from annoying to unbearable. Now here is an excuse for the guy and girl to get to know each other. Okay so its forgivable as it pushes the plot along. 2. Too many coincidences. During their conversation they and in turn we realize that their paths have crossed. While Prashant (actor Vijay's character) was interning as a chef Chitra (actress Ritu's character) was a customer in that restaurant. Prashant's call center outburst went viral on YouTube and Chitra saw it yet she only realized that it was him when he tells her. That seems neither here nor there. The call center outburst though hilarious was due to another coincidence Lol #Coincidance #HandsomeDancer by James Manzello. 3. The love blossoms and they do not know how to express it till the very end which is really for the commercial point of view. Total 3 faults.The guys as it turns out actually went to the wrong house. They started the food truck business together which was inspired by true events and they slowly fell in love while gradually going down different paths till they hit a fork in the road and you know the rest. The first potential father in law was money minded but frank and sensible also. Anyway it is a happy ending which is okay in this case I guess. It is a nice feelgood movie,10 telugu movie,telugu movies are changing better there is still room grow though now faults 1 child artists are used only cuteness same thing happens here with him getting locked with potential bride groom at least his role was very small if used too much it goes annoying unbearable now here is excuse guy girl get know each other okay so its forgivable as it pushes plot along 2 too many coincidences during their conversation they turn we realize that their paths have crossed while prashant actor vijays character was interning as chef chitra actress ritus character was customer that restaurant prashants call center outburst went viral youtube chitra saw it yet she only realized that it was him when he tells her that seems neither here nor there call center outburst though hilarious was due another coincidence lol by james manzello 3 love blossoms they do not know how express it till very end which is really commercial point view total 3 faults guys as it turns out actually went wrong house they started food truck business together which was inspired by true events they slowly fell love while gradually going down different paths till they hit fork road you know rest first potential father law was money minded but frank sensible also anyway it is happy ending which is okay this case i guess it is nice feelgood movie,0.5402124183006537,0.11233660130718953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.26}"

Direction,script and story- Direction was amazing and cant believe that Telugu industry has creative directors. Each and every scene was fabulous and entertaining. Script was masterpiece and it made a simple story excellent with powerful script.2.)All actors- Everyone did their parts well. All were realistic and special mention to Vijay and ritu who acted out their parts very well and those two friends of vijay were hilarious specially priyadarshi whose humors went with the flow.3.)Comedy- All the comedy were realistic and its something which we also see in day to day life and its presented out well on screen by actors.

9.0,Crisp and Clean,"This movie is one of those rare movies where everything fell into right place . cool performances . The actors have done a great job in portraying the roles . Specially the lead cast performances are on point and most of people remember them by their character's names and that's the best thing about it . Their friends characterization and group scenes are absolutely hilarious . Telangana slang is used in an awesome way. specially Darshi , is an actor surely to look out for . His timing is top class and whenever he's on screen the movie is some next level . Music is great and used to good extent . The fusion they did with song in ""raalu raga poolamala"" song is great experiment and it worked for the film . Mainly the heroine is so beautiful and she has done author backed role that's commendable . hope it gives her a break that she deserves . Finally, I would like to talk about the man who is responsible for putting this all together--Tharu bascker,director . Kudos to him for writing this simple yet intriguing story and for showing it and clean manner without inducing unnecessary songs and slapstick comedy . The best part about it is , the film has repeat value, you can watch as many times you want and not get bored with it . One minor problem is that the climax ended simply and was predictable i wish director could have pulled out some racy climax .Like instead of radio as climax they could have used her Australia thing like her not giving up and hero eventually chases her to airport to tell her about his love . something like that not exactly though. but rest of the movie is awesome so one can ignore these minor things.",crisp clean,this movie is one those rare movies where everything fell into right place cool performances actors have done great job portraying roles specially lead cast performances are point most people remember them by their characters names thats best thing about it their friends characterization group scenes are absolutely hilarious telangana slang is used awesome way specially darshi is actor surely look out his timing is top class whenever hes screen movie is some next level music is great used good extent fusion they did with song raalu raga poolamala song is great experiment it worked film mainly heroine is so beautiful she has done author backed role thats commendable hope it gives her break that she deserves finally i would like talk about man who is responsible putting this all together tharu bascker director kudos him writing this simple yet intriguing story showing it clean manner without inducing unnecessary songs slapstick comedy best part about it is film has repeat value you can watch as many times you want not get bored with it one minor problem is that climax ended simply was predictable i wish director could have pulled out some racy climax like instead radio as climax they could have used her australia thing like her not giving up hero eventually chases her airport tell her about his love something like that not exactly though but rest movie is awesome so one can ignore these minor things,0.5981040564373897,0.3590277777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7.0,"Pelli Choopulu serves a sweet dish of love, professional desires, comedy and slight bit of woman empowerment.","Pelli Choopulu (2016) : Brief Review -Pelli Choopulu serves a sweet dish of love, professional desires, comedy and slight bit of woman empowerment. There are some films which offer something out of their genre but never get known for that. The reason for it is quite acceptable that we don't have any specific genre to fit them in, we have same old tags which are used and will be used forever. Pelli Choopulu is known as a rom-com but actually it is not even half of what it is called. Numerically, there is 30% rom-com portion while rest of the 70% combines a sweet mixture of ambitions, realisation and slight bit of woman encouragement. We see many films made on these topics separately so obviously it becomes typical, but fortunately not boring. Maybe tasting a new dish of unknown genre made by using all the known ingredients is what makes it tasty. Nevertheless, Pelli Choopulu still fulfills your appetite of watching a good film. A wannabe businesswoman and a happy-go-lucky guy meet each other during an arranged marriage blind date but eventually team up to start a food truck on their own. This unexpected union serves them to realise the actual taste of life and then typical romance follows the rest of the story. Vijay Deverakonda and Ritu Verma makes a very sweet chemistry on screen. Their individual performances, looks, accents and rest of the characteristics are fine too. The film has very thoughtful dialogues coming in very genuine way, so genuine that sometimes you even miss the point and then realise it after a moment. The music is good, cinematography is decent, screenplay is engaging and Tharun Bhascker's direction is perfect for the limits of this content. Pelli Choopulu may sound mediocre as a love-story but other elements like drama, family problems, self-esteem and woman empowerment saves it from sinking and swims it to the shore safely.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",pelli choopulu serves sweet dish love professional desires comedy slight bit woman empowerment,pelli choopulu 2016 brief review pelli choopulu serves sweet dish love professional desires comedy slight bit woman empowerment there are some films which offer something out their genre but never get known that reason it is quite acceptable that we dont have any specific genre fit them we have same old tags which are used will be used forever pelli choopulu is known as rom com but actually it is not even half what it is called numerically there is 30 rom com portion while rest 70 combines sweet mixture ambitions realisation slight bit woman encouragement we see many films made these topics separately so obviously it becomes typical but fortunately not boring maybe tasting new dish unknown genre made by using all known ingredients is what makes it tasty nevertheless pelli choopulu still fulfills your appetite watching good film wannabe businesswoman happy go lucky guy meet each other during arranged marriage blind date but eventually team up start food truck their own this unexpected union serves them realise actual taste life then typical romance follows rest story vijay deverakonda ritu verma makes very sweet chemistry screen their individual performances looks accents rest characteristics are fine too film has very thoughtful dialogues coming very genuine way so genuine that sometimes you even miss point then realise it after moment music is good cinematography is decent screenplay is engaging tharun bhasckers direction is perfect limits this content pelli choopulu may sound mediocre as love story but other elements like drama family problems self esteem woman empowerment saves it sinking swims it shore safely rating 7 10 by,0.5173662153449388,0.2137878787878788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.21}"

8.0,An Excellent Watch !!,"Chitra has just completed MBA and aspires to pursue further studies in Australia and become an entrepreneur. Prashanth is forced to pursue Engineering course by his father though he aspires to be a chef. He is also too lazy to chase his dream and seeks shortcuts to settle down in life. The movie takes off when the two protagonists meet accidentally during a pellichoopulu (a common Indian ritual where potential groom and bride meet along with their families). What follows is a narrative that presents a predictable story in an engaging manner with oodles of humor and very relatable situations.Vijay Deverakonda is authentic in his portrayal of Prashanth who is used to the daily taunts from his father and would prefer to laze around seeking simplistic solutions without a care. Ritu Varma, with her sparkling presence lights up every frame and is pitch perfect as the ambitious Chitra who is at ease in conveying a wide range of emotions. They share an easy chemistry and are ideal foil for each other which make them instantly likeable and keeps the viewers invested in how they fare. Besides the leads, the movie benefits from a competent set of supporting cast who register their presence even in the smallest of roles and adding to the funny situations. Composer Vivek Sagar has provided some good songs and adds value with his background score.Debutante director Tharun Bhascker Dhaassyam has made a breezy romcom which checks almost all the right boxes a genre which is mostly messed up in narratives that are mired in melodrama or mindless action or other ""masala"" elements. His competence as an engaging storyteller is evident in the way that he strikes a fine balance in presenting the multiple threads of understated romance, aspirations of girls which are often ignored or even trampled upon as well as the casual attitudes of a section of youth Wei fail to follow one's dreams due to their lethargy and seeking easy solutions, family bonds without getting preachy or melodramatic and constant flow of jokes which do not feel forced.With an entertaining first feature, Tharun has announced his arrival as a film maker to look forward to.",excellent watch,chitra has just completed mba aspires pursue further studies australia become entrepreneur prashanth is forced pursue engineering course by his father though he aspires be chef he is also too lazy chase his dream seeks shortcuts settle down life movie takes off when two protagonists meet accidentally during pellichoopulu common indian ritual where potential groom bride meet along with their families what follows is narrative that presents predictable story engaging manner with oodles humor very relatable situations vijay deverakonda is authentic his portrayal prashanth who is used daily taunts his father would prefer laze around seeking simplistic solutions without care ritu varma with her sparkling presence lights up every frame is pitch perfect as ambitious chitra who is at ease conveying wide range emotions they share easy chemistry are ideal foil each other which make them instantly likeable keeps viewers invested how they fare besides leads movie benefits competent set supporting cast who register their presence even smallest roles adding funny situations composer vivek sagar has provided some good songs adds value with his background score debutante director tharun bhascker dhaassyam has made breezy romcom which checks almost all right boxes genre which is mostly messed up narratives that are mired melodrama or mindless action or other masala elements his competence as engaging storyteller is evident way that he strikes fine balance presenting multiple threads understated romance aspirations girls which are often ignored or even trampled upon as well as casual attitudes section youth wei fail follow ones dreams due their lethargy seeking easy solutions family bonds without getting preachy or melodramatic constant flow jokes which do not feel forced with entertaining first feature tharun has announced his arrival as film maker look forward,0.5368124769287559,0.12415097822074567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"

8.0,A genre defining movie?,"I typically don't like romcoms as I think it is too easy for them to fall under the trap of the omnipresent, banal, and repetitious themes and character personalities that plague 95% of the the romantic movies that exist. But this is a great movie with a lot of heart that escapes most of the aforementioned pitfalls, and provides a fresh story with new ideas and characters. Movies like this are essential to keep the genre alive.The director worked brilliantly with this script, and has created an entertaining spectacle that has enough substance to easily carry the movie past the predictable themes that it does contain. All the characters here are in some way flawed but also likable, which gives way to some lighthearted moments where you couldn't help but smile. Everyone also always stays in character, which I feel is vital for any film. There are many instances in this movie that will surprise you, and for a comedy all of it surprisingly holds well together. You know a movie is good when some scenes stay with you after it is over. Indeed, some of the scenes here are so clever and funny that you couldn't help but appreciate the ingenuity of it all.Apart from all this commendation, there is one thing which is tugging at my stomach. On one hand it is the freshest take on a romcom I've seen in recent times, on the other, I kind of hate the apparent acceptance of dowry the movie portrays. There is even a scene in which Prashant, the male lead, says directly to Chitra, the female lead that there is nothing wrong with dowry and she says nothing to counter it. I understand that this indirectly comments on the social acceptance of dowry in our nation and this is how many Indians perceive it, but Prashant does not have to fall under that category. The movie industry has a tremendous influence in shaping our culture along with the mindset of the younger audience, and it's a shame that the director chose not to stand against it. I may be coming along as too harsh, so I am just dropping that awesome 9 to a solid 8.",genre defining movie,i typically dont like romcoms as i think it is too easy them fall under trap omnipresent banal repetitious themes character personalities that plague 95 romantic movies that exist but this is great movie with lot heart that escapes most aforementioned pitfalls provides fresh story with new ideas characters movies like this are essential keep genre alive director worked brilliantly with this script has created entertaining spectacle that has enough substance easily carry movie past predictable themes that it does contain all characters here are some way flawed but also likable which gives way some lighthearted moments where you couldnt help but smile everyone also always stays character which i feel is vital any film there are many instances this movie that will surprise you comedy all it surprisingly holds well together you know movie is good when some scenes stay with you after it is over indeed some scenes here are so clever funny that you couldnt help but appreciate ingenuity it all apart all this commendation there is one thing which is tugging at my stomach one hand it is freshest take romcom ive seen recent times other i kind hate apparent acceptance dowry movie portrays there is even scene which prashant male lead says directly chitra female lead that there is nothing wrong with dowry she says nothing counter it i understand that this indirectly comments social acceptance dowry our nation this is how many indians perceive it but prashant does not have fall under that category movie industry has tremendous influence shaping our culture along with mindset younger audience its shame that director chose not stand against it i may be coming along as too harsh so i am just dropping that awesome 9 solid 8,0.5157828282828283,0.16415945165945164,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
