10.0,Witty con man.,"From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies. It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.",witty con man,opening credits design we get mood this very entertaining film they create tone what will follow steven spielberg is rare form directing this movie that doesnt have dull moment mr spielberg has found perfect actor fill shoes con man with perfect casting leonardo dicaprio its very easy see why all women fall prey this charmer he was fast talker slick operator he exudes charisma fill another couple movies its welcome sight have mr dicaprio working vehicle that shows his talent as frank abagnale man many faces he plays game hide seek throughout movie with hanratty fbi agent that is his trail tom hanks shows great assurance gusto with this character course dicaprio magnetism dominates action with many ironic twists miraculous narrow escapes he pulls with aplomb thats bewildering feds who are his tail all time minor roles are equally important christopher walken as father starts out as prototype con man but hes too decent do wrong his business fails eventually his marriage natalie baye fine french actress ends divorce because obviously she hates being married loser action doesnt stop one moment this film is great fun watch with winning combination mr spielberg assured hand gives us this time out mr spielberg can thank genial mr dicaprio who responds obviously his direction makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes,0.5891145833333334,0.26109375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.49}"
9.0,A lot of fun,"While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.",lot fun,while watching catch me if you can i had so much fun i smiled constantly well that smile was interrupted by laughs movie tells story frank w abignale jr who is just kid as he pretends be schoolteacher after his father mother get divorce he runs away starts pretending be co pilot doctor lawyer way he does this is funny brilliant i am not big fan leonardo dicaprio who plays frank but this movie he is perfect he gives very fine performance tom hanks is fbi agent carl who is after him as always hanks is good story is inspired by real story i dont know how many ways it is true but watching this guy all i wanted see was him pulling more his nice little tricks scene where he pretends be schoolteacher is just great if you want nice funny movie not too heavy this one will definitely please you,0.5719696969696969,0.37746212121212125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
7.0,Very good film has those Spielberg edges!,"At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",very good film has those spielberg edges,at first i thought i was going see lightweight film great director but instead i watched another impressive achievement by steven spielberg few things stand out course performances are terrific leonardo dicaprio is believable as guy that can convince people that hes someone else dicaprio is charmer is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk young ladies tom hanks as fbi agent reminds me his cynical character that he played league their own his mere presence adds more this film sign great film star christopher walken gives one his best performances his already interesting career last scene him as he talks his son restaurant is so moving that it reflects great talent walken you can understand why dicaprio admires loves his father walken conveys these emotions makes audience react just accurately ill be rooting him at oscar time another impressive thing about this film is beautiful cinematography by janusz kaminski whos real artist with camera has worked several spielberg films one shot particular stands out ray sunshine coming through kitchen window walken very thought provoking course since its spielberg film its very personal spielberg was interested frank abagnale character because as youngster he also came broken family wanted be someone else spielberg would sneak onto studios tell people that he worked there also real frank abagnale jr appears as french police officer well made extremely well acted sharply written viewers seem forget that this is really film about breaking up family aftermath this really is personal film spielberg very good one,0.5552380952380953,0.2801904761904761,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,"Top-notch, brilliantly crafted entertainment, rich with fascinating details, memorable incidents and engaging performances","What a terrific piece of film-making! From the charming animated title sequence (featuring John Williams's delightfully sneaky score) to the end, this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman, Steven Spielberg, who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his ""manipulation,"" i.e. his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama.Leonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I've seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy's selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fianc√©e and on down to the tiniest role. I'm especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.Spielberg's movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible.

8.0,Hard to believe its true,"I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10",hard believe its true,i dont know how accurate these events are but as they are based accounts written by frank abagale jr himself then i assume that they are probably only dramatised viewing audience its hard believe that people were so naive that they allowed frank abagnale achieve what he did but i have give guy credit pushing system riding high life as long as he did leonardo dicaprio does great job capturing character frank abignale jr strange i didnt picture him role jet setting gigalo rest cast although only little more than fringe characters are all very well cast give typically fine performances as you would expect with calibre hanks walken all all this is fine film that most people will enjoy watching 8 10,0.5837037037037037,0.16513888888888886,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.03, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.66}"
,"Brilliant, especially DiCaprio","On Leonardo DiCaprio's 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn't realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on 'Growing Pains'--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn't see much to like about ""Titanic"" except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, 'Romeo and Juliet' was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.But if he could be nominated for his 'Aviator' performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive"", or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in ""Smokey and the Bandit"". The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.Frank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.Tom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.I loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from 'To Tell the Truth' was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn't feel I had time to watch the new version).This was Oscar-caliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didn't seem to agree.",brilliant especially dicaprio,leonardo dicaprios 31st birthday i have pleasure praising one finest actors working today i didnt realize what i was seeing when that homeless boy showed up growing pains show not exactly known quality its actors i didnt see much like about titanic except excitement watching people evacuating ship sinking also romeo juliet was just corny with 400 year old dialogue modern setting but if he could be nominated his aviator performance dicaprio must be doing something right here he shows us what he is capable especially when frank jr is conning people most all when he tries outwit hanatty i am reminded harrison ford tommy lee jones fugitive or perhaps burt reynolds jackie gleason smokey bandit strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes long way toward making this movie work frank jr showed lot intelligence dicaprio effectively showed us what this man could do imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed right side law but his life run was more fun watch tom hanks as popular as he is can be commended his willingness play second banana change he did fine job martin sheen christopher walken also made impact here i loved old cars even older songs clip tell truth was nice touch theme song still gives me craving vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years i didnt feel i had time watch new version this was oscar caliber too bad academy awards people didnt seem agree,0.5077922077922079,0.2264181221077773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

9.0,A film well worth catching,"'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.While 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",film well worth catching,catch me if you can has such talented cast true story is fascinating one while steven spielberg is inconsistent director he was big childhood influence he has proved several times that he is capable masterpieces iconic status while catch me if you can is not quite one spielbergs best films list that sees likes schindlers list jaws raiders lost ark et it is one his better later films me thats since schindlers list there are occasional lapses into overly sentimental schmaltz with depiction abagnales family life not first or last time with spielberg long way worst case but that is one fault that was had me spielberg directs impeccably both visual style dramatic momentum directorial job that just screams pure class catch me if you can further benefits as always beautiful cinematography janusz kaminski 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative make one think that it is more than just film with 60s setting john williams score is not one his best or most memorable but still fits really well has right amount slick jazziness whimsy understated pathos without over emphasising over emphasis was reason why his score amistad was rare misfire him story takes fascinating story makes ceaselessly engrossing film out it ingenious opening credits sequence heartfelt ending film is long but never feels it this is further helped by script that has deft mix genuinely funny comedy poignant emotional moments nail biting suspense characters are intriguing cant praise performances enough leonardo dicaprio is movie star charisma personified brings wit larceny charm character that is true crook every sense but it is easy see why one would fall his actions it is easy overlook tom hanks due role being not as colourful or as showy but he brings charismatic command generosity doggedness role that could have been really bland annoying lesser hands sterling supporting cast christopher walken is especially superb particularly latter parts film as his life is ruined martin sheen amy adams are memorable nathalie bye solid overall even if catch me if you can is not one spielbergs masterpieces it is one his better later films one his most purely enjoyable ones well worth catching 9 10 bethany cox,0.5553046218487393,0.2325980392156863,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Slick and enjoyable story telling,"When his parents file for divorce and he has to chose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jnr runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.Based on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.The presentation is good. Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick. Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth. But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.The cast is good even if they aren't all used well. If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy. Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio. Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.

8.0,Catch It If You Can!,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.There's no real plot to go into, as I have already given it to you. Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role. I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom. If you just want to sit back and relax, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the perfect film for you. There's nothing all that special in the film, but the film kind of becomes special because it is so easy to watch. I recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"" to anyone who can enjoy a movie for what it is.

8.0,Catch it if you can. I concur this movie is good.,"Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story"" in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel & Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym ""Sean O'Reilly"" in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch.

9.0,Caught me,"One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Terminal"", ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich"".Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her - we know something she doesn't.Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or ""concurs"" with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.",caught me,one thing is sure steven spielberg has amazing range he made this engaging movie five year period that included i artificial intelligence minority report terminal war worlds munich set early 60s movie tells story frank abignale leo dicaprio how he impersonated airline pilot secret agent doctor finally county prosecutor before he was 21 years old unfortunately he also made lot money passing bad cheques this brought him attention carl hanratty tom hanks fbi bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across united states finally france pursuit becomes personal contest between them although rapport develops it is still high stakes game however film has surprising outcome perfect close movie that is enjoyable many levels its long movie but it doesnt outstay its welcome spielberg gives movie light touch demonstrates genuine sense comic timing comparable john hughes frank oz or maybe even preston sturges although not necessarily comedy film is studded with genuinely funny moments much it generated by franks sheer audacity there are number scenes where spielberg holds back punchline we can fill it ourselves such as franks knock knock joke or when jennifer garner as high class call girl gives frank 400 change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque her we know something she doesnt between them dicaprio hanks spielberg make every bit business work without losing sight story which promises inevitable tragedy frank there is serious side story it tells how frank is at first dislocated by his parents financial troubles then shattered by their breakup he is also affected by behaviour his father frank abagnale snr christopher walken who seems believe that image is more important than reality these forces conspire push frank into pretending he is something he isnt film also reflects more naive time as far as security at airports banks is concerned frank capitalises peoples innate respect professions institutions but his actions hurt people not least himself course today frank would probably have perpetuate his scams online but anonymity internet doesnt require amount chutzpah that frank shows as he stands at counter his pilots uniform cash his rubbery cheques or concurs with his fellow physicians when posing as head emergency at hospital its that element daring that makes franks crimes entertaining rather than despicable i have seen this film quite few times like best movies reunion is always rewarding,0.6292171717171717,0.16901515151515153,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.54}"
8.0,I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400! Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film!",i havent read book just yet i definitely will now,this was entertaining fun piece film making ever reliable steven spielberg it is bit depart his usual full blown hugely epic pictures yet this does not detract at all fascinating story frank abagnale jr i was interested this man before id seen movie it only served increase my interest although it is important remember as with any such film that this is only inspired by true story not told word word one plot is fascinating keeps you laughing crying wondering until end frank abagnale jr is astounding interesting character real life abagnale originally said that he did not believe dicaprio be suave enough play role but he certainly does pull it off dicaprios acting is superb totally believable as man who could lie deceive con everyone he met without once losing any his charisma or charm hanks is also excellent he plays role obsessed fbi agent well also with likable quality interaction between these two characters was great it was interesting see budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another i loved look film it was refreshing blast see 60s portrayed such vivid colorful way whole setting atmosphere film gave it wonderful almost i hesitate use word magical sense this tone appealed me much more than darker tone might have however film is rife with moral ambiguity as much fun as it is watch dicaprio jumping one place identity next forging checks spending inordinate amounts money at whim film never really focuses morally bankrupt side story portion film devoted this at end still seems skim over fact that this man has stolen millions dollars it ends high note frank abagnale jr never fully spelling out wrongs he committed still this would probably bring whole film down sometimes its fun just enjoy bit escapism without being told off desiring such things i mean its hard be totally strict upright you have love it when dicaprios character swindles jennifer garners prostitute 400 overall this is fun film really enjoyable not as much epic masterpiece as some spielbergs other movies but still great film,0.5436207117255504,0.24338005632360477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,An Alternative World of Torn Labels,"Spoilers herein.Yesterday, I saw the first watchable Scorsese film in decades, and the same today with Spielberg. Something weird is in the wind.And yes, I know this isn't a `real' Spielberg movie and that he only stepped in after paging through a half dozen directors, and only to protect his investment as a producer, and only because he has no real project underway. Still, I'm surprised. The compact Spielberg usually demands of the viewer is that in return for allowing him to turn us into children, he will expertly push children's buttons. He has been consistent in this even as he plowed through `serious' matters of war and holocaust. All are steeped in juvenile sentimentality. His recent `AI' and `Minority' were solid attempts to escape himself. After all, he knows he will not be remembered well and wants to be before he dies.So even though this is something he stepped into late, I count it as a solid victory for the pressures from his peers to make a real movie, with an intelligent stance. He does. Its not a great movie, but it has smarts. And it is relatively original.The first thing is how he adopts the notion of making the film itself a character. Lynch did this first (to my knowledge) with `Velvet.' Most recently, Haynes did so with `Far from Heaven,' where the dynamics of the story occur not in reality but in the artificial reality of films of the era. So the limits of `society' were the action of the film as a force within the drama. So too here -- to denote this we have the colors of the stock of the era, we have the very air of the film world invading as smoke. And we have the director asking the actors to discard modern irony and act as if they were Michael Caine in the early seventies. `Pleasantville' was another in this line -- the production designer is from that project.The film is set up as a reverse con. We know in the first couple minutes what he did and how the con ends. The traditional con story is a film within a film, which gives the opportunity to make the inner film the character as already noted. It is a clever idea that only could be conceived by someone intimate with shaping film. It makes the outer film more genuine by making the inner one more counterfeit.Then we have the actors. The con artist is the most sought after role in all filmdom because the actor plays a character who is acting, something that allows them to exploit their own experience (often the only real experience these stunted lives have). Decaprio doesn't quite rise to the challenge. We've had one wondrous performance in `Gilbert Grape,' and another intelligent turn in Luhrmann's `Romeo.' Nothing of note since except occasional competence. He is competent here. Hanks gives us his regular routine: he's sinking fast, turning into another Morgan Freeman.The real acting here is by Walken, who exceeds Spielberg's shaping of the project so much that we suspect no one really noticed it made the others look bad. Amy Adams has a passion that Leo lost long ago.Incidentally, we have another filmworld jab at the French here. They really do have thuggish police who brutalize Americans when possible. Film `police' too. And the Mom in real life was a real tart who played a dumb soldier for US citizenship then sold herself to a higher bidder. But why introduce all this without developing it? The man in charge here has a special ax to grind, I think.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",alternative world torn labels,spoilers herein yesterday i saw first watchable scorsese film decades same today with spielberg something weird is wind yes i know this isnt real spielberg movie that he only stepped after paging through half dozen directors only protect his investment as producer only because he has no real project underway still im surprised compact spielberg usually demands viewer is that return allowing him turn us into children he will expertly push childrens buttons he has been consistent this even as he plowed through serious matters war holocaust all are steeped juvenile sentimentality his recent ai minority were solid attempts escape himself after all he knows he will not be remembered well wants be before he dies so even though this is something he stepped into late i count it as solid victory pressures his peers make real movie with intelligent stance he does its not great movie but it has smarts it is relatively original first thing is how he adopts notion making film itself character lynch did this first my knowledge with velvet most recently haynes did so with far heaven where dynamics story occur not reality but artificial reality films era so limits society were action film as force within drama so too here denote this we have colors stock era we have very air film world invading as smoke we have director asking actors discard modern irony act as if they were michael caine early seventies pleasantville was another this line production designer is that project film is set up as reverse con we know first couple minutes what he did how con ends traditional con story is film within film which gives opportunity make inner film character as already noted it is clever idea that only could be conceived by someone intimate with shaping film it makes outer film more genuine by making inner one more counterfeit then we have actors con artist is most sought after role all filmdom because actor plays character who is acting something that allows them exploit their own experience often only real experience these stunted lives have decaprio doesnt quite rise challenge weve had one wondrous performance gilbert grape another intelligent turn luhrmanns romeo nothing note since except occasional competence he is competent here hanks gives us his regular routine hes sinking fast turning into another morgan freeman real acting here is by walken who exceeds spielbergs shaping project so much that we suspect no one really noticed it made others look bad amy adams has passion that leo lost long ago incidentally we have another filmworld jab at french here they really do have thuggish police who brutalize americans when possible film police too mom real life was real tart who played dumb soldier us citizenship then sold herself higher bidder but why introduce all this without developing it man charge here has special ax grind i think teds evaluation 3 4 worth watching,0.46664206440325856,0.10110163468372424,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,Only the best chase film EVER!,"More people need to talk about this film because it is worthy of its 8.1/10 stars on IMDB and with your help of watching this movie you can increase it. This is how movies are supposed to be made, one of Spielberg's best of the 2000's and it has great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Amy Adams, Jennifer Garner and many more brilliant actors. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as real life con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. feels like the real thing, it feels like they casted the real Abagnale at the correct age and this is your performance.When you're watching a movie, you walk out of the theatre saying to yourself, 'What a great performance', but that is not what actors want, they want you to believe this could be a real person and DiCaprio accomplishes that beyond the shadow of a doubt. This movie is proof that DiCaprio can push out a brilliant performance and isn't just that pretty-boy from Titanic or Romeo & Juliet. It's actually one of the only times I agree with the Rotten Tomatoes common Sense Media, so I wouldn't necessarily consider this film to be underrated, just compared to his other films, this one is put far down on the list which I absolutely disagree with.Spielberg crafted my favourite war movie, my favourite action adventure movies, four of my favourite science fiction movies, my favourite motion capture movie, my favourite comedy of the 2000's so I went into this film with the highest expectations possible and I loved this film, it was excellent in every way possible. It tells the story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. and how he became rich and got away with everything he did.His dad (who also goes by the same name except Jr. played by Christopher Walken) and mum have a break-up one day and Frank has to choose whether he wants to live with his mother or father. It is a very frustrating and traumatic task so he decides to run away from home. He becomes a co-pilot by faking identity and paying checks instead of cash, he gets involved with a prostitute and finally meets his future wife played by Amy Adams. They meet at a hospital counter where they both flirt and finally she asks him if he wants to meet her parents, he accepts and they go there. Frank tells them he has multiple jobs and they eventually get married. Detective Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) and his fellow detectives go around to where Abagnale is having the wedding.Abagnale admits to Brenda Strong (Amy Adams) that he is a con-artist and all that money he has gotten by pretending he has a job. He tells her to keep the money and he jumps out of the window and runs away as fast as he can. He eventually gets caught by detectives and is brought to a filthy jail in France.

7.0,Worth catching,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Di Caprio) makes his way across America posing as a lawyer, a pilot, a doctor whilst all the while being chased by Carl Hanratty (Hanks) Based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. this ambitious crime caper is a turn for excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts of comedy in a dramatic construction of a man looking for a sense of mayhem and wealth, to live in his father's footsteps.Flowing with the energy you would expect from a Spielberg project alongside Oscar nominated scorer John Williams you would expect a ferocious appetite of crime shindigs and sharp tantalising scenarios across America and for the most part we see a relaxing and remarkable story that is hard and equally remarkable to believe really happened.Leo Di Caprio, in his first paring with Spielberg, stars as central character Frank, giving the conman an elusive personality whilst aiming to be na√Øve of the difficulties at home between his parents. Encoding uses of his father's charm and wit may seem corny but the resemblance between Di Caprio and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken is mirror like, giving the film a formidable consistency.Tom Hanks, in more of a supporting role, has his moments as the stubborn and driven FBI agent determined to catch Frank. Hanks uses the character's intelligence to his advantage to make his acts seem fruitless whilst all the while maintaining a key objective. Hanks even slides in some delicious deadpan expressions, the knock knock joke in the car for one arguably one of Hanks best ever comedy moments, which is quite something given the American's CV.The plot is the main drawback of the film's potential. Whilst the story itself is based on true events, there feels a lack of consistent believability, which is purely down to the messy structure placed upon it. Starting on a game show, it jumps back to Frank's youth, then to prison then forward to school years, then his fleeing, then forward to present and so forth and because of these Kangaroo style jumps there feels a reluctance to let us into the moment of the character and situation. We are just getting used to Frank being a pilot when the film shunts us to present day dealings and it is a real pain as if this film was portrayed in chronological order we would have had a flawless foundation for an endless chase without knowing the outcome.Williams' score is brilliant, especially the title sequence and Oscar nominated was a truly deserved. The title sequence matches the feel of the music so poignantly we are instantly engaged and ready for the off.The film collaborates usage of career mastery and unanswered questions to the eventual finale, that is worth catching and as mentioned, had this film gone from past to present with no flash back/forwards it would have been perfect. As it is, this is a charming often funny crime drama that is an enjoyable ride of a true story.",worth catching,frank abagnale jr di caprio makes his way across america posing as lawyer pilot doctor whilst all while being chased by carl hanratty hanks based true story conman frank abagnale jr this ambitious crime caper is turn excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts comedy dramatic construction man looking sense mayhem wealth live his fathers footsteps flowing with energy you would expect spielberg project alongside oscar nominated scorer john williams you would expect ferocious appetite crime shindigs sharp tantalising scenarios across america most part we see relaxing remarkable story that is hard equally remarkable believe really happened leo di caprio his first paring with spielberg stars as central character frank giving conman elusive personality whilst aiming be na ve difficulties at home between his parents encoding uses his fathers charm wit may seem corny but resemblance between di caprio oscar nominated christopher walken is mirror like giving film formidable consistency tom hanks more supporting role has his moments as stubborn driven fbi agent determined catch frank hanks uses characters intelligence his advantage make his acts seem fruitless whilst all while maintaining key objective hanks even slides some delicious deadpan expressions knock knock joke car one arguably one hanks best ever comedy moments which is quite something given americans cv plot is main drawback films potential whilst story itself is based true events there feels lack consistent believability which is purely down messy structure placed upon it starting game show it jumps back franks youth then prison then forward school years then his fleeing then forward present so forth because these kangaroo style jumps there feels reluctance let us into moment character situation we are just getting used frank being pilot when film shunts us present day dealings it is real pain as if this film was portrayed chronological order we would have had flawless foundation endless chase without knowing outcome williams score is brilliant especially title sequence oscar nominated was truly deserved title sequence matches feel music so poignantly we are instantly engaged ready off film collaborates usage career mastery unanswered questions eventual finale that is worth catching as mentioned had this film gone past present with no flash back forwards it would have been perfect as it is this is charming often funny crime drama that is enjoyable ride true story,0.5021488469601678,0.22212216504669333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.53}"
6.0,A Dishonest Movie,"!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! Much hyped as a true story on its release CATCH ME IF YOU CAN tells the tale of con artist extrodanaire Frank Abagnale Jr and FBI agent Carl Hanratty's attempt to catch him but the cold facts are this is not a true story - It's a Hollywood story inspired by real events and therefore the audience are required to do nothing more than pay their money at the box office , sit back and be entertained . Certainly they won't be expected to ask questions such as why is con man Abagnale being portrayed as some sort of misunderstood little boy lost Right from the outset we're shown Abagnale's ability to con people as being a force of good . Check out the scene in the school where he takes the class bully down a peg or two "" Ah "" thinks the audience "" Frank's a good guy , he's a man of morality "" but I'm afraid he's not because he's a con artist and the story telling technique doesn't allow much thinking to be done by the audience . What about the scenes where he passes himself off as an airline pilot . Can anyone explain to me how he did this for many months and was never ever suspected of being a fraud ? Didn't anyone ever ask him seriously technical questions about flying a jet that caused alarm bells to be rung ? These questions are never answered Abagnale also passed himself as a doctor where he falls in love with a young nurse lacking confidence called Brenda and this sub section of the story caused a few alarm bells to be rung in my head , so after I saw the movie I conducted some internet investigation only to find that while Abagnale was posing as a doctor a baby almost died under his care due to his own lack of medical knowledge . I ask you if the screenplay included this scene how would you feel about Abagnale then ? Exactly . All through the running time we're shown Frank Abagnale as some kind of cheeky chappie , a little bit naughty but hey he's a young good looking kid with no real harm in him . As John Ford said - "" Always print the legend "" I can certainly understand why people enjoyed CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and won't criticise them for it and I can also understand why Spielberg and company decided to make an entertaining movie that doesn't dare get involved in any type of morality . It is unfortunate however that the director and everyone else involved are involved in fundamental dishonesty themselves",dishonest movie,mild spoilers much hyped as true story its release catch me if you can tells tale con artist extrodanaire frank abagnale jr fbi agent carl hanrattys attempt catch him but cold facts are this is not true story its hollywood story inspired by real events therefore audience are required do nothing more than pay their money at box office sit back be entertained certainly they wont be expected ask questions such as why is con man abagnale being portrayed as some sort misunderstood little boy lost right outset were shown abagnales ability con people as being force good check out scene school where he takes class bully down peg or two ah thinks audience franks good guy hes man morality but im afraid hes not because hes con artist story telling technique doesnt allow much thinking be done by audience what about scenes where he passes himself off as airline pilot can anyone explain me how he did this many months was never ever suspected being fraud didnt anyone ever ask him seriously technical questions about flying jet that caused alarm bells be rung these questions are never answered abagnale also passed himself as doctor where he falls love with young nurse lacking confidence called brenda this sub section story caused few alarm bells be rung my head so after i saw movie i conducted some internet investigation only find that while abagnale was posing as doctor baby almost died under his care due his own lack medical knowledge i ask you if screenplay included this scene how would you feel about abagnale then exactly all through running time were shown frank abagnale as some kind cheeky chappie little bit naughty but hey hes young good looking kid with no real harm him as john ford said always print legend i can certainly understand why people enjoyed catch me if you can wont criticise them it i can also understand why spielberg company decided make entertaining movie that doesnt dare get involved any type morality it is unfortunate however that director everyone else involved are involved fundamental dishonesty themselves,0.5203194953194953,0.1247964997964998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"

8.0,Going Places,"Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of ""Catch Me If You Can"" convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.Indelible impressions are the sort of thing Frank Abagnale Jr. is good at, especially on the kind of phony checks that fool bank security. After his parents' divorce, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off in the Big Apple, making his way as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an assistant district attorney, all by means of fraudulent credentials and irresistible charm, not to mention the ability to stay one step ahead of the law, as represented by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).A film that owes a debt to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Henry Mancini, ""Catch Me If You Can"" zips along on its own kind of sneaky charm, making us root for a character who would probably steal our life savings if given half a chance. At the same time, Spielberg avoids the pitfall of relativism by making sure Hanks as Hanratty keeps some amount of our rooting interest, however much we feel for this crazy kid with his naive belief that, like the mouse stuck in a bucket of cream, he can churn his bucket into butter and crawl out. It's a trick every bit worthy of the subject of this engaging tale.From the opening moments of this film, featuring the best-ever Spielberg titles sequence (courtesy of Kuntzel-Deggas) and a very unusual but entrancing John Williams score that uses shushing sounds and finger snaps in place of his normal bombast, we realize we are in unusual territory for a Spielberg film. Right away, the theme of mistaken identity is introduced courtesy of a ""To Tell The Truth"" clip with host Joe Garagiola giving us three Frank Abagnales to choose from. We think we know which one he is, but we don't know as much as we think.""You know why the Yankees always win?"" asks Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). ""It's because the other team can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes."" Walken, like Spielberg, works against audience expectations. Sure, he's a criminal, much what we expect from Walken, but he's got a good heart and a beguiling innocence. He believes in the American dream, even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry to get what he wants. Ultimately he's a victim, and a lesson to his son about why the straight and narrow isn't the way to go.DeCaprio gives a solid, impressive performance, the best I've seen from him, playing a consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims. He finds the drama in his character, but also the comedy, in a film that shows Spielberg can be funny even when he involves us in a dramatic story. As we watch him fake his way aboard a cockpit, in an operating room, and even in a bedroom with an expensive callgirl played by Jennifer Garner, we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because he's succeeding.The film also benefits from an immersive sense of the period in which it is set. Williams' score, along with the costumes and set design, present us with a view of the 1960s in its more sophisticated adult form, with Dusty Springfield and Frank Sinatra providing the music rather than the pop and rock acts we think of when we think of the time.Does ""Catch Me If You Can"" go on longer than it should? Yes, I think tougher editing would have made it better. But I don't miss the mawkish attempts at uplift that pock Spielberg's lesser work, and the few poignant moments Spielberg throws in amid Abagnale's ruses ring true, especially a moment involving Frank and a little girl at a window near the end of the film that only Spielberg would try to get away with, because he can and does.No, this is not a great film, just a very good one that might have slipped past a few people on its first release, as it did me. But give ""Catch Me If You Can"" a chance, and you may find this as a con you not only enjoy being taken by, but wish to experience again just to see how the masters, Abagnale and Spielberg, make their plays.",going places,steven spielberg has what you might call d w griffith disease if he cant make monumental film he makes insignificant one i thought that anyway until second viewing catch me if you can convinced me i was wrong like many great artists spielberg doesnt have swing fences make indelible impression every time out indelible impressions are sort thing frank abagnale jr is good at especially kind phony checks that fool bank security after his parents divorce frank leonardo dicaprio sets off big apple making his way as airline pilot doctor assistant district attorney all by means fraudulent credentials irresistible charm not mention ability stay one step ahead law as represented by fbi special agent carl hanratty tom hanks film that owes debt alfred hitchcock by way henry mancini catch me if you can zips along its own kind sneaky charm making us root character who would probably steal our life savings if given half chance at same time spielberg avoids pitfall relativism by making sure hanks as hanratty keeps some amount our rooting interest however much we feel this crazy kid with his naive belief that like mouse stuck bucket cream he can churn his bucket into butter crawl out its trick every bit worthy subject this engaging tale opening moments this film featuring best ever spielberg titles sequence courtesy kuntzel deggas very unusual but entrancing john williams score that uses shushing sounds finger snaps place his normal bombast we realize we are unusual territory spielberg film right away theme mistaken identity is introduced courtesy tell truth clip with host joe garagiola giving us three frank abagnales choose we think we know which one he is but we dont know as much as we think you know why yankees always win asks franks father frank sr christopher walken its because other team cant stop staring at those damn pinstripes walken like spielberg works against audience expectations sure hes criminal much what we expect walken but hes got good heart beguiling innocence he believes american dream even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry get what he wants ultimately hes victim lesson his son about why straight narrow isnt way go decaprio gives solid impressive performance best ive seen him playing consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims he finds drama his character but also comedy film that shows spielberg can be funny even when he involves us dramatic story as we watch him fake his way aboard cockpit operating room even bedroom with expensive callgirl played by jennifer garner we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because hes succeeding film also benefits immersive sense period which it is set williams score along with costumes set design present us with view 1960s its more sophisticated adult form with dusty springfield frank sinatra providing music rather than pop rock acts we think when we think time does catch me if you can go longer than it should yes i think tougher editing would have made it better but i dont miss mawkish attempts at uplift that pock spielbergs lesser work few poignant moments spielberg throws amid abagnales ruses ring true especially moment involving frank little girl at window near end film that only spielberg would try get away with because he can does no this is not great film just very good one that might have slipped past few people its first release as it did me but give catch me if you can chance you may find this as con you not only enjoy being taken by but wish experience again just see how masters abagnale spielberg make their plays,0.5478321995464854,0.19417176870748298,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.46}"
