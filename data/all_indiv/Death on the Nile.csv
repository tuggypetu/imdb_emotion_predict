4.0,Once again Branagh opts for style over substance,"Hercule Piorot is holidaying in Egypt when he is invited aboard a cruise down the Nile. The host is the extremely wealthy, recently married, heiress Linnet Ridgeway. The journey is soured by the appearance of Jacqueline de Bellefort, the ex-flame of Ridgeway's husband. Ridgeway stole him away from her and she seems intent on extracting some sort of retribution. When Ridgeway is murdered suspicion naturally falls on de Bellefort but she has a cast iron alibi.I should have known better than to watch this having watched Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express. Everything about it seemed flat and listless: paint-by-numbers adaptation, minimal intrigue (especially for a murder-drama), subdued, uninspired performances (despite an all-star cast), mindless action scenes.Where Branagh did dial things up was on the cinematography and effects but even there it falls flat: all the effects just make everything seem fake. You can tell it's being filmed in a studio in front of green screen rather than out in the snow with a real train.Having watched the excellent 1974 version it was a definite sub-standard effort. It felt like the classic Christie tale had been dumbed-down for modern audiences and substance sacrificed for style.Murder on the Nile is largely more of the same: weak, dumbed-down adaptation, listless performances, style over substance. The graphics and cinematography at least feel less fake here and are in fact the only positive as they do provide a richness of colour and a vibrance to proceedings.The screenplay is cringy at times with all the unnecessary add-ons to the novel to accommodate modern viewers. Performances are shrill and irritating. Casting is off: so many dud choices. I assume Branagh only wanted French and Saunders in the film because he's a fan of them as a comedy duo, not because they were ideal for their roles (as they're not).Similar to how I ended my review of Murder on the Orient Express, watch the excellent 1978 Peter Ustinov version instead. Or watch the relevant episode in the brilliant David Suchet Poirot series. With those already in existence I don't know why this film was made.",once again branagh opts style over substance,hercule piorot is holidaying egypt when he is invited aboard cruise down nile host is extremely wealthy recently married heiress linnet ridgeway journey is soured by appearance jacqueline de bellefort ex flame ridgeways husband ridgeway stole him away her she seems intent extracting some sort retribution when ridgeway is murdered suspicion naturally falls de bellefort but she has cast iron alibi i should have known better than watch this having watched kenneth branaghs adaptation murder orient express everything about it seemed flat listless paint by numbers adaptation minimal intrigue especially murder drama subdued uninspired performances despite all star cast mindless action scenes where branagh did dial things up was cinematography effects but even there it falls flat all effects just make everything seem fake you can tell its being filmed studio front green screen rather than out snow with real train having watched excellent 1974 version it was definite sub standard effort it felt like classic christie tale had been dumbed down modern audiences substance sacrificed style murder nile is largely more same weak dumbed down adaptation listless performances style over substance graphics cinematography at least feel less fake here are fact only positive as they do provide richness colour vibrance proceedings screenplay is cringy at times with all unnecessary add ons novel accommodate modern viewers performances are shrill irritating casting is off so many dud choices i assume branagh only wanted french saunders film because hes fan them as comedy duo not because they were ideal their roles as theyre not similar how i ended my review murder orient express watch excellent 1978 peter ustinov version instead or watch relevant episode brilliant david suchet poirot series with those already existence i dont know why this film was made,0.5394291754756871,0.0647815362931642,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.25}"
4.0,Below average acting performances is one of it's weakest parts. And it's getting quite tedious. Better skip the first hour. Nothing happens.,"They tried, yes, they did, but what's most annoying about this movie is the below average acting performances. French and Dawn's appearance (not funny) dont make things any better.

It lasts a whopping 2 hours and a bit and this story only starts going after an entire hour. And even then it's quite tedious to watch.No humor. (not my kind) No suspense. Really none at all.

4.0,Not Good,"Alone the first scene is a fine example that many of today's movie producers, writers and directors too many times don't understand much about what they write about or produce (or they just don't care - I don't know what's worse): take the first scene, the attack in the war of the trenches. The French use gas to hide themselves and instead of putting on their gas masks (well, gas is dangerous, isn' it?) and taking preparation for an attack (the use of gas almost always indicated an immediate attack), the Germans just say, hey, I can't see a thing, just lets stare around a little bit more or just keep on eating your soup. Next scene, we get some Blues tunes that are fine but, well, the movie plays in 1937, but the first electrical guitar ever build was a Rickenbacker in 1936, and the Blues style played belongs to the 40s and 50s... I just give you that two little examples to illustrate why the whole movie just feels wrong and even dumb sometimes - the characters of course behave and talk also out of time and place. Anyway, watchable, if you like the starred actors but compared to the movie of 1978, this one looks weak.",not good,alone first scene is fine example that many todays movie producers writers directors too many times dont understand much about what they write about or produce or they just dont care i dont know whats worse take first scene attack war trenches french use gas hide themselves instead putting their gas masks well gas is dangerous isn it taking preparation attack use gas almost always indicated immediate attack germans just say hey i cant see thing just lets stare around little bit more or just keep eating your soup next scene we get some blues tunes that are fine but well movie plays 1937 but first electrical guitar ever build was rickenbacker 1936 blues style played belongs 40s 50s i just give you that two little examples illustrate why whole movie just feels wrong even dumb sometimes characters course behave talk also out time place anyway watchable if you like starred actors but compared movie 1978 this one looks weak,0.46125000000000005,0.025416666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"

It played no part in the plot at all, in fact the portrayal of Poirot was way off the mark.Sophie Okonedo was the best thing in it, she was superb and disappointing that she was wasted in this poor adaptation.Both the TV drama (2004) and the 1978 film were better than this attempt, both being shot on location with actual REAL locations.Watch the 1978 film, it is much better and follows the original plot far more closely.",no no no no no all is not as it seems,i suppose you could say this is fake film fake times it looked surreal because it was surreal yes it looked spectacular lavish but it was just not real just about everything was created computer no trip egypt required day will come when cgi is so good there will be no need actors actresses it will all be created by software rather than follow established story with same characters need force feed viewer with pc wokery had be catered first so we had characters left out characters introduced names changed genders changed nationalities changed ethnicity changed same sex relationship introduced what mess ironically outing same sex relationship by poirot reveal was callous cruel it played no part plot at all fact portrayal poirot was way off mark sophie okonedo was best thing it she was superb disappointing that she was wasted this poor adaptation both tv drama 2004 1978 film were better than this attempt both being shot location with actual real locations watch 1978 film it is much better follows original plot far more closely,0.5358974358974359,0.10576923076923075,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
4.0,Subpar,"By comparison, this is multiple levels below recent mainstream mysteries Knives Out and Murder on the Orient Express. The mystery has some intrigue but not much. The pacing is off and it takes a while (over an hour) before the mystery actually begins. I'm not a fan of the tone or the music.

,The real murderer is the writer of this remake,"Kenneth Branagh must not have liked the original story or characters much, given all the changes he made. This is a terrible movie on many levels.Poirot is a different character. He is now a former war hero with a lost love and a romantic side. Unforgivably, Branagh creates a major departure involving Poirot's signature moustache. There is an obligatory nod to Poirot's obsession with order and symmetry, but overall this is not the character in the Christie novels. Why didn't Kenneth Branagh just create a new detective named Branagh rather than rewriting Poirot? Agatha Christie herself found her most popular character insufferable, but she never changed him to make him more ""normal.""Then there is the miscasting. Gal Gadot, who is always appealing but who has neither a British nor American accent, is not even remotely believable as British heiress Lynette Ridgeway. In addition, her backstory includes an instance in which she summers in Kennebunkbort, Maine. Perhaps visiting the Bush family? So she's a New Englander too!In the novel, Ridgeway's lawyer is a childhood playmate and cousin named Pennington. In this movie, he is from India and named Katdhadorian. He's supposed to be family!? An elderly woman and her caretaker on board the ship (a spinster with her nurse in Christie's original), are in a lesbian relationship.A white character in the original novel, a British writer of terrible romance novels, is transformed into a great black blues singer, Salome Otterborne, whose daughter, Rosalie, we are told, is the irresistible love interest of a British toff. It's a good thing the script tells us this, because there is no evidence of sexual attraction or infatuation on screen. Poirot delivers a paean to here, filled with white guilt, and she replies with scorn. Both of their speeches are straight out of the woke wars of the present and have nothing to do with an Agatha Christie murder mystery.Rosalie also talks about racism she one experienced at a whites-only swimming pool in the US. So it's not just Death on the Nile. It's Death on the Mississippi Burning.Does any of this sound like Agatha Christie? Or is Branagh just using her name to get moviegoers to watch a different film? None of these problems are helped by the excessive length, slow pacing and bad CGI . A new remake should be an improvement over previous remakes, but so much of the scenery in this film is digitally created, it feels like animation.Avoid this.

,"3/10. Agree with metacritic consensus, this is the most lowbrow adaption of a Christi work","I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.There is over an hour of the film before the mystery even begins and that interminable hour consists of exposition that leave the characters as two dimensional as when it started. And half of the characters seem shoveled in with no purpose whatsoever. E.g. Sophie Okonedo. She is a great actress. Perhaps the best in this cast. I strongly recommend people see her Hollow Crown and Hotel Rwanda. But her character (or that of the character's niece) in Death on the Nile is what? Serves what plot purpose? (Answer: none)The actual ""solving"" of the mystery has to be the most predictable Christie adaption ever. It is a outright ""Cui bono?""

1.0,"Overblown, overproduced Branagh bastardization of the brilliant Agatha Christie","Kenneth Branagh has a lot to answer for - not the least of which is his hubris in thinking he can improve on the brilliant Agatha Christie stories and previous screen adaptations of some of her favorite novels. Worse, Branagh changes the fundamental traits and personalty of Christie's Hercule Poirot. Where the hell does he get off? Then, he tries to compensate with overproduced, overblown ""movie magic"" which may impress some but not true Chritie afficionados.

4.0,can we please stop hiring Gadot for roles that require her to speak? She's bad at it.,"Look, I really do think that Branagh is a compelling, entertainment-focused filmmaker and performer. He's usually fully committed, lively, and even somewhat imaginative. But when the material isn't good, those traits are nearly impossible to see behind his seeming obliviousness to the mediocrity on display. With Orient Express, the whodunnit plotting and characters are engaging; not so much here.",can we please stop hiring gadot roles that require her speak shes bad at it,look i really do think that branagh is compelling entertainment focused filmmaker performer hes usually fully committed lively even somewhat imaginative but when material isnt good those traits are nearly impossible see behind his seeming obliviousness mediocrity display with orient express whodunnit plotting characters are engaging not so much here,0.526388888888889,0.02664141414141415,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2.0,"I hope Agatha Christie is haunting the director, editors, and writers from beyond","I hope Agatha Christie is haunting the director, editors, and writers from beyond, for besmirching her good name. I don't blame the actors, but the first half of this way too long movie was awful. In one scene, a character info-dumped the backstories of every other character and described why they would be a suspect in a future murder that hadn't even happened yet, which was some of the worst show-don't-tell and infodump writing I've ever witnessed. The glitz and glam is gratuitous and detracts from the story at times... every frame seemed hyper-photoshopped, to the point of looking cartoonish. I don't know whether the pandemic or political tensions prohibited them from using a drone for aerial footage of Egypt, or if stock footage wasn't available, but the CGI landscapes were painfully noticeable. Dialog consisted almost entirely of pithy one-liners, and no real conversations between characters were there to help develop characters, their relationships, or the story. There were a lot of characters, and I felt connected to none of them.The second half of the movie improved a bit, but suffered from Poirot seemingly magically knowing information that hadn't been revealed to the viewers. If you show it to us and we don't catch on until Poirot explains it, that's on us and is part of the thrill. If you don't show it, or show it only in retrospect, then I fault the movie makers for making the movie seem far-fetched and for me losing interest.",i hope agatha christie is haunting director editors writers beyond,i hope agatha christie is haunting director editors writers beyond besmirching her good name i dont blame actors but first half this way too long movie was awful one scene character info dumped backstories every other character described why they would be suspect future murder that hadnt even happened yet which was some worst show dont tell infodump writing ive ever witnessed glitz glam is gratuitous detracts story at times every frame seemed hyper photoshopped point looking cartoonish i dont know whether pandemic or political tensions prohibited them using drone aerial footage egypt or if stock footage wasnt available but cgi landscapes were painfully noticeable dialog consisted almost entirely pithy one liners no real conversations between characters were there help develop characters their relationships or story there were lot characters i felt connected none them second half movie improved bit but suffered poirot seemingly magically knowing information that hadnt been revealed viewers if you show it us we dont catch until poirot explains it thats us is part thrill if you dont show it or show it only retrospect then i fault movie makers making movie seem far fetched me losing interest,0.5434210526315789,-0.09780701754385963,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.44}"
1.0,Waste Of Time,"Boring and pretentious interpretation of a great story.Death on the Nile is just another in a series of unnecessary productions that just shows that today's film industry has neither the quality nor the desire to make a good film that will intrigue the viewer and keep him in suspense.With a few solid actors and a few catastrophically bad ones, this film can't offer much. The script is bad, the dialogues are forced, and the actors seem to be bored.I didn't last until the end of the film, because it was simply boring and pretentious. Every movie looks the same, even those set in the past.Writers cannot refrain from destroying the classics. The film looks artificial, with visible CGI, the practical effects still look better. Everything seems forced and shallow, but that's how most movies look today.The script is bad, with hilarious dialogues and forced situations. I was expecting at least great set design, but even that looks too fake.

1.0,Stop messing with iconic characters!!!,"When will Hollywood learn? Stop and compare how often changing an iconic character works versus how often it ends in massive, colossal failure. If you want a different character, then feel free to create one. There are so many things I could criticize, but I probably could have overlooked most of them and given a decent rating. What I can't excuse is creating an idiotic back story for Poirot's mustache and then having him shave it off at the end. NO NO NO!!!! Not in any alternate universe would anything short of life and death convince Hercule Poirot to shave his mustache. While the term canon is often overused to refer to a fan's favorite version of a character, it does exist. And Poirot being a ""dandy"" (that means prissy, not gay) who's obsessively proud of his mustache definitely qualifies as canon. It is reiterated in every single Poirot story. And adding insult ti injury, it's for a woman who never existed in the books when every Poirot fan knows his only love ever depicted is the countess Vera Rossakoff. These stories were written by the brilliant Agatha Christie, who is one of the best selling authors of all time. Nearly a century after Poirot first appeared people are still reading his stories. They don't need to be improved upon. And even if they did, this wasn't it. This was a travesty. I may never watch another Kenneth Brannague film. I most certainly won't watch any future Poirot films he makes. This was an insult to the character, the author, and the tried and true Christie fans.",stop messing with iconic characters,when will hollywood learn stop compare how often changing iconic character works versus how often it ends massive colossal failure if you want different character then feel free create one there are so many things i could criticize but i probably could have overlooked most them given decent rating what i cant excuse is creating idiotic back story poirots mustache then having him shave it off at end no no no not any alternate universe would anything short life death convince hercule poirot shave his mustache while term canon is often overused refer fans favorite version character it does exist poirot being dandy that means prissy not gay whos obsessively proud his mustache definitely qualifies as canon it is reiterated every single poirot story adding insult ti injury its woman who never existed books when every poirot fan knows his only love ever depicted is countess vera rossakoff these stories were written by brilliant agatha christie who is one best selling authors all time nearly century after poirot first appeared people are still reading his stories they dont need be improved upon even if they did this wasnt it this was travesty i may never watch another kenneth brannague film i most certainly wont watch any future poirot films he makes this was insult character author tried true christie fans,0.5331413210445468,0.2054147465437788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
