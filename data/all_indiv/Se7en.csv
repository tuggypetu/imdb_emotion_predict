10.0,"A brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim, intelligent and disturbing","From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim intelligent disturbing,david fincher se7en is compelling brilliant postmodern film noir it is grim disturbing but it is also very intelligent daring what i did love about se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish beautiful dark cinematography dazzling landscapes really do add atmosphere very little murders are shown but we are appalled shocked by what we hear them action is tense climax is shattering there is also intelligent screenplay clever plot telling vicious serial killer who murders his victims gruesome way atone sins gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath he deems them have committed excellent direction acting is also superb morgan freeman gives another brilliant performance as disillusioned detective brad pitt is great as mills more meatier role than he has ever done gwyneth paltrow makes small yet significant appearance as mills uneasy wife while kevin spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as john doe despite fact he isnt film much overall brilliant film with adept performances direction style ambition 10 10 bethany cox,0.7765350877192981,0.22012061403508773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever.,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that. ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere. Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police captain. The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene. Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see. 10/10",dark disturbing thriller that will stay with you ever,rarely there has been movie with such good dark chilling atmosphere i even see this movie more as horror movie than as thriller because that se7en is unique many ways movies mood is already set right beginning movie starts dark intense chilling mysterious mood that is present throughout entire movie its very depressing watch i mean that positive way meaning word mood is set by good camera work lighting or better said lack it music acclaimed composer howard shore also adds chilling atmosphere unlike many other movies same genre movie is slow paced takes it time develop characters without falling into some obvious clich s two main characters played by morgan freeman brad pitt are presented as unlikely police couple that are different many ways each other but way that is also what makes them such great couple brad pitt once has opportunity play more than just pretty boy he does it with success kevin spacey truly plays bone chilling character almost just as legendary chilling as hannibal lecter i would very much like see two them put same room just see who would make it out alive further more it was great see r lee emrey again as police captain movie is filled with some truly gross sickening horrifying scenes this seriously aint no kids stuff movie has some most sickening murders i have ever seen featured movie but it arent just only gross scenes that are good there are also some scenes that are made with lots beauty profession such as library scene dark chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks ending which i will not spoil you real must see 10 10,0.587962400502723,0.04336807010194109,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Probably the greatest murder story ever,"Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters. The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.",probably greatest murder story ever,sevens quality puts it so far beyond most cops trail deranged killer genre that it comes out as true jewel cinema everything about seven is perfect it is art captured film this movie is bright spot all stars who worked it brad pitt never gets credit he deserves his acting because hes pretty boy press is lot more interested about how he jennifer are doing thats shame because he is talented actor that isnt afraid take chances with both roles that he picks characters that he plays that is quite rare list world morgan freeman is great actor you can always count him do what he does best which is play wise veteran that has seen it all kevin spacey is another great actor that has great range really puts life personality into his characters real talent this movie excluding actors that brought it life is director david fincher writer andrew kevin walker finchers talents making visually stunning film are now well known he often brings dark patina his work andrew kevin walker must have some incredible demons living inside him either that or one hell imagination bringing intricate story seven plan john doe life john does plan really is twisted i wont be spoiling it here suffice say i have never seen so evil complicated plan movie before or since cinematography film is dark but beautiful throughout film it is either night or raining or both except two very brief moments it is such emotional movie that you cant keep being caught up what is happening do you understand sympathize with what john doe is doing or do you think him mad killer that must be stopped bottom line if you havent had opportunity see seven yet then you must at least rent it it is so damn good that i know you will like it only reason you wouldnt is because youre just too damn fragile take something this hardcore,0.686036036036036,0.2506756756756756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"He's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered, give or take, and he still has Hell to look forward to.","Seven is directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.An unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.Having been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.""But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever""Seven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10",hes experienced about as much pain suffering as anyone ive encountered give or take he still has hell look forward,seven is directed by david fincher written by andrew kevin walker it stars morgan freeman brad pitt gwyneth paltrow kevin spacey r lee ermey music is scored by howard shore cinematography by darius khondji unnamed us city two cops are trail serial killer who kills his victims according which one seven deadly sins they have committed having been stung by studio interference negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film alien 3 david fincher waited three years before committing project that he had control over result was seven dark masterpiece unremitting creeping dread that showcased work clinically excellent director seven is not just movie its experience assault senses jolt brain trawl through dark recess some sick city where it always rains darkness holds many fears this is no boorish slasher movie its psychological discord 101 we only see aftermath crimes discussions which forces us delve deep into our own imagination fill blanks forcing us go where we dont want go you sense director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings but thats point we see deadly sin every street corner every home we tolerate it we tolerate it because its common its trivial we tolerate it morning noon night well not anymore im setting example what ive done is going be puzzled over studied followed forever seven is very much ultimate horror film really is there anything more scary than serial killer who is smarter than cops chasing him not only that but they are oblivious as they be part master plan this killer is not only unstoppable perpetrating his violent crimes he is as freemans weary retirement bound detective somerset says methodical patient its going end bad cops know it so do we thats when fincher walker stick their hands into our guts pull out last semblance solids deliver one greatest endings modern cinema ending fit grace any noir neo noir or smart ass psychological horror movie across ages with each viewing seven theres repeating wave bleak emotions that come as reversed end credits roll desolation disbelief sadness shock our trip through earthly hell is over but only psychical sense faultless cast performances no doubt eked out by what we now know is task master director photography that brilliantly brings light melancholic sheen decaying society howard shore score that crawls out speakers cloaks your body like some evil incubus or succubus seven masterpiece unease evil wrung out by master director 10 10,0.6698198198198198,0.017567567567567575,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A dark and disturbing masterpiece.,"It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.David Fincher's story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving. Somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. Mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. Before Somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and Mills are assigned to investigate. But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante's ""The divine comedy"".To begin with, Se7en appears to be a standard ""cops on the trail of a killer"" story which shouldn't be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. But as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold.The two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. The older Somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. Mills, who has no respect for Somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. The further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits.This film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957). Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.Se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. The killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point.A previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching Se7en and i completely agree. Eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.Director David Fincher didn't pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of Alien 3. Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. He stated: ""It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it"". For the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score.The Most disturbing message that Se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a Pyrrhic victory. But regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. We have no other choice.""The World is a fine place and worth fighting for."" I agree with the second part.",dark disturbing masterpiece,it is rarity film be completely unsettling yet unrelentingly gripping david finchers story takes place bleak constantly raining city never named where urban decay sleaze all forms are rampant coming up his retirement police force is detective lieutenant somerset morgan freeman who is tasked with breaking his replacement detective sergeant mills brad pitt before leaving somerset is world weary under no illusions about futility daily role he plays initially wants nothing more than escape grime violence city mills other hand is convinced that he is going make real difference having voluntarily transferred this precinct bringing his wife city with him before somerset can move homicide comes which he mills are assigned investigate but its only first string ritual murders that will be committed by killer who is basing his crimes seven deadly sins as depicted dantes divine comedy begin with se7en appears be standard cops trail killer story which shouldnt be too difficult audience get comfortable with but as we descend along with characters into merciless brutal world without hope that they inhabit you are left reeling at events that unfold two detectives enjoy uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them older somerset is educated astute gives impression being emotionally burnt out mills who has no respect somersets methodical investigating gets excited at thought solving murder firmly believes that good guys will win eventually further we get into action might evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits this film draws heavily biblical themes you can certainly see similarities with such films as seventh seal 1957 both films show price that good men have pay when they fight evil unsettling truth that rule book goes straight out window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all se7en shows us world which has been destroyed by its own sins wasteland which values are minimal killer having nothing but contempt this world sees it as his mission expose faults show everyone what they have become it is fascinating twist that when killers motives become clearer somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree empathy with him this is lost mills though whose level clarity never reaches same point previous reviewer mentioned that you begin expect unexpected whilst watching se7en i completely agree eventually if you think most obvious outcome any situation predict that opposite will happen it usually does even finale itself became kind predictable because by then you are conditioned not have any hope this is minor flaw though because story is so well so shockingly told director david fincher didnt pick up another script 18 months such was his exhaustion frustration following completion alien 3 apparently he agreed direct se7en after one reading andrew kevin walkers screenplay because he was drawn its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity he stated its psychologically violent it implies so much not about why you did but how you did it camera work specially altered film stock was used make visuals look as dark unsettling as possible which is complemented well by howard shores music score most disturbing message that se7en puts across is that fight against evil is destined be pyrrhic victory but regardless only thing we can do is fight whatever cost we have no other choice world is fine place worth fighting i agree with second part,0.5400793650793652,-0.012385531135531135,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,one of the best-made films of its era and genre,"Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",one best made films its era genre,despite clich s very depressing finale this is one best made films its era genre strengths film include odd relationship between two lead cops who seem loosely based two lead cops lethal weapon series but who thankfully never play laughs never really become buddies young cop is too arrogant older cop has too much experience which young cop refuses acknowledge two characters are also brilliantly acted by morgan freeman brad pitt probably his best performance theres one odd flaw film about half way through i found that i had learned expect unexpected film which meant that rest film was predictable bizarre way simply decide where expected move would be then expect unexpected move instead most obvious instance this is finale itself which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead time normally this would be formula disaster but fortunately high quality film making twists film into edge seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror one cops encounter with insanity pure evil i didnt want admire this film be honest i dislike brad pitt something fierce but im afraid i must very professionally made it delivers its promised suspense all way,0.5201991758241757,0.08637591575091577,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10.0,Modern Masterpiece!!,"Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career.

9.0,Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt).

Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating.

,Simply one of the darkest and best thrillers of the 1990's  but don't let anyone spoil it for you.....,"`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man. With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him. However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise. Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created. Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold. The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller. But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out. From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc. The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do. Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen. I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc. But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer. Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up. Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles. R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters. He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly. In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word. However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.",simply one darkest best thrillers 1990s but dont let anyone spoil it you,days retirement detective somerset is teamed with new city detective mills investigate murder that quickly becomes series somerset realises that killer must be smart is using classic literature model his killings seven deadly sins however mills finds hard see him as anything other than crazy man with killer close completing his work mills somerset begin close him however nothing is as it seems dark depressing city full moral degradation apathy when david fincher came onto scene with his debut feature alien3 world only paused scorn film that didnt fit with alien franchise yes it wasnt great film but i loved sense mood dark tension shadows that fincher created years later we have se7en fight club game at people are getting fincher se7en was his major break through where his dark visions also reaped box office gold story doesnt sound like much mismatched partners one young cocky reckless other few days retirement go after serial killer who is carrying out series twisted murders it sounds like lethal weapon meets straight video thriller but happily it rises above that by so much its unbelievable it certainly shows how story put good hands can work out start we are entombed mood city where it always rains uncaring people etc we begin find murders but fincher doesnt show us murders he lets us see aftermath shadows lets us imagine rest genius what you dont see is more gory than what you do meanwhile tension is cranked up fever pitch as race catch killer is accelerated when we meet killer film just gets better right up ending that is simply one most logical emotional gripping endings ive ever seen i promise youll leave cinema shell shocked freeman is excellent as somerset so good that its role hes tried do again kiss girls etc but here he is perfect foil both mills killer brad pitt is also superb he isnt allowed trade his looks here does very well film that has little opportunity him pander his female fans he spends lot it looking beaten up paltrow is ok with what she has but this isnt really film that focuses female roles r lee ermey is as good as ever its sign how good cast is that actors stature charles dutton john c mcginley are basically roles that barely count as cameos however best performance is kevin spacey years before he became oscar lovie stopped doing bad guys or dark characters he is only screen small portion film but his dialogue is superb he delivers it faultlessly scene where he shares car ride with mills somerset you literally hang his every word however alongside spacey fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given perfect story perfect actors at heart this is cop thriller but excellent performances excellent mood moral lesson excellent spacey make this quite simply most jaw droppingly excellent thriller 1990s,0.5730800584696689,0.23680496992185301,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,Top Serial Killer Movie,"Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) a deeply Intellectual Detective, with barely a week left until his retirement and Mills, (Brad Pitt) the new cop in town, who is a pretty weak detective, are thrown together to investigate what at first appears to be another Homicide.After a second Victim is found, Somerset realises that this is no open and shut case, and requests that he is relieved, in light of his impending retirement. Mills gladly takes over the case and plunges himself in way over his head.As the work of a Crimally insane genius continues, Mills grows more and more erratic, and Somerset simply has to remain, to guide his young partner through the case, which ultimately leads to one of the finest climax's in movie history.With Wonderful Performances from both Freeman and Pitt and a really dark and morbid direction from David Fincher, the movie is crammed with suspense, intrigue and Excitement.My Favourite scene is John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tearing into Mills in the car, driving towards the Climax, the acting is simply perfect as Pitt's character is torn apart by the genius of the Criminally insane, and Freeman interjects with insightful rationality, demonstrating his superior mind. The Scene Carries such intensity, and at the same time encapsulates the primary characters basic elements. Most actors can't achieve this level of character depth, but these are three of the finest actors of our time. 10/10",top serial killer movie,somerset morgan freeman deeply intellectual detective with barely week left until his retirement mills brad pitt new cop town who is pretty weak detective are thrown together investigate what at first appears be another homicide after second victim is found somerset realises that this is no open shut case requests that he is relieved light his impending retirement mills gladly takes over case plunges himself way over his head as work crimally insane genius continues mills grows more more erratic somerset simply has remain guide his young partner through case which ultimately leads one finest climaxs movie history with wonderful performances both freeman pitt really dark morbid direction david fincher movie is crammed with suspense intrigue excitement my favourite scene is john doe kevin spacey tearing into mills car driving towards climax acting is simply perfect as pitts character is torn apart by genius criminally insane freeman interjects with insightful rationality demonstrating his superior mind scene carries such intensity at same time encapsulates primary characters basic elements most actors cant achieve this level character depth but these are three finest actors our time 10 10,0.5156673881673882,0.14954545454545454,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Still manages to astound after 20 years of repeat viewings,"After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",still manages astound after 20 years repeat viewings,after his calamitous experience working his d but film alien 3 1992 david fincher took small genre picture that little did he know would revitalise his career become one greatest films 1990s se7en appears begin as your typical detective neo noir with cynical veteran naive rookie taking elusive serial killer seemed hell bent turning sin against sinner but set unnamed permanently drizzly american city se7en is meditation evil pessimists depiction modern world climaxing one bravest most memorable endings hollywood history detective somerset morgan freeman is verge retirement where he plans leave his inner city life behind him after years fighting side good his replacement is brash detective mills brad pitt optimistic young recruit eager learn who somerset takes under his wing their first homicide investigation involves obese man who has been fed at gunpoint point causing his stomach rupture with somerset ready leave force mills takes his first solo case murder rich attorney man forced cut pound flesh his own body murder scene has words greed written blood somerset eventually finds word gluttony etched grease apartment first victim he becomes convinced murders are connected that killer is murdering under guidance seven deadly sins genius se7en is rooted way movie keeps audience as clueless as detectives normally genre pictures such as this we either know who killer is eagerly wait investigators put pieces together or we have line up suspects red herrings decide here apart brief glimpses during thrilling chase scene we are devoid clues killer is always one step ahead somerset mills alluding idea that mysterious john doe is indeed having his work guided by higher power course he is not he is merely man but this helps gives se7en dramatic weight rather than it becoming nihilistic exercise cruelty when three quarters movie killer hands himself movie becomes masterclass writing slowly building into one greatest climaxes film somerset decent man who has devoted his life side good but has had fight slowly drained out him meets his nemesis john doe kevin spacey but as they talk does reasoning becomes clear shockingly almost sympathetic wanting people listen you cant just tap them shoulder anymore you have hit them with sledgehammer he says its about world gone s t view shared by mills wife tracy gwyneth paltrow who talks somerset diner about allowing baby be born into world after discovering she is pregnant cerebral gothic se7en transcends genre so many levels thanks some bleak yet stylish direction by fincher it still manages astound after almost 20 years repeat viewings www wrath blog blogspot com,0.5764705882352942,0.048284313725490205,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"""Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's""","The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10",se7en is well crafted ingeniously clever making it one greatest films 90s,movie se7en starring brad pitt morgan freeman gwyneth paltrow is by far one most inventive well written cerebral films recent history film blending well put together combination dark visual style intense plot development polished acting remains tight focused throughout beginning end never straying outwards into unimportant issues or resorting typical hollywood clich s se7en is uniquely its own suspense dramas as it both fuels need audience be drawn entertained by events unfolding remain uncompromising shocking thus satisfying initial vision director david fincher story surrounds hunt serial killer who inspired by dante alighieris seven deadly sins divine comedy sets out preach about mans impurity does so by targeting victims then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them se7en seemingly starts out as typical cat mouse detective story however it quickly develops into sort modern myth with good evil taking centre stage story is original all counts thrilling all levels most important aspect se7en however is that it keeps audience numerous steps behind its story as oppose other thrillers which become predictable bland by end by keeping audience dark film remains fresh original as it progresses se7en even dramatically turns tide at one point just as audience is finally getting comfortable asserted into gloomy atmosphere thus creating as much as fear uncertainty audience as it is with characters involved by films conclusion audience is as much apart film as characters themselves arrive at se7ens surprise ending without single clue it prior it occurring se7ens poetic ending which will not be given away says lot people behind movie showing they are not afraid going against grain rarity with films so nowadays directed brilliantly by david fincher skillfully written by andrew kevin walker se7en is well crafted ingeniously clever making it one greatest films 90s while se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as silence lambs se7en is undoubtedly as influential as any film date score 10 10,0.6416666666666666,0.13218954248366016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,Somerset's World,"Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (""This isn't going to be a happy ending"") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.",somersets world,seldom does film elucidate culpability our culture our society mayhem madness we often find everyday life according se7en our culture is drifting through darkness mouthpiece this thematic undercurrent is somerset literate man who also happens be detective man who can read clue this isnt going be happy ending or dantes inferno with equal aplomb he even provides films final thematic statement with quote hemingway his quirkiness perhaps outgrowth brilliant mind is no worse than that any prophet or seer old those harbingers biblical insight whom others always find kooky offbeat he is not well loved his cynical pessimistic outlook such that his consuming motivation is retire get out town however by end it becomes clear that it is somerset who sees our dark world with prophets particular clarity it is left his partner mills find this out hard way working us reinforce this world as somerset sees it is films astounding mise en scene disturbing film noir setting developed by director david fincher cinematographer darius khondji flashlights barely illuminate slimy walls roach infested tenement one victim dark bedroom another rain pours down buckets birds eye view shots downtown city is never named generic everymans kind place show dingy sooty rooftops grimy streets only films closing scene is bright sunlight which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint what we see happening this is somersets vision both inhabited described by him he finds surprising fellow traveler not his partner but elusive killer john doe doe shares vision provides unsettling echo rumblings teachings somerset if one looks at life through somerset lens one must admit that john doe has valid point he somerset have arrived at same conclusion difference between them being how they have responded somerset longs escape some otherworldly realm country doe has taken action though gripping fast moving this is not action film it holds our interest through workings horror mystery stark film noir detective piece except one tense pursuit through halls alleys pouring rain as well as bit ending action there is surprisingly little violence we see each murder save two after fact as crime scene this only makes final act that much more suspenseful this is very tight film elements within dialogue actions lighting setting all these tend reinforce one another paint solid picture it is perverse logic that makes final seventh sin complete perfectly circle events begun with first,0.5418650793650795,0.08733592796092797,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"

The back-and-forth between Somerset, Mills, and John Doe in the police car is one of the most intense and captivating scenes in the history of cinema. 8. The movie presents the interesting and complex moral quandary of: is it immoral to kill the immoral? Even if those immoral people adversely affect other people? And who gets to decide who is immoral, and what punishment should be meted out to them? 9.

10.0,One Of The Greatest Thrillers Of All-Time,"In 1995 David Fincher released a perfectly constructed modern masterpiece; Se7en. One of the most exhilarating experiences of all-time and a classic to come.A cop; Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) has just moved into the city with his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) in hope of finally settling down. Mills will take over the job of Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) an old cop who has seven days until his retirement begins. Both are dedicated to the badge. They are put together on the case of an obesity murder, in which a man has been forced to 'eat till he bursts'. This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it. This is just the beginning of a mass murder masterpiece crafted by the insane John Doe, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.Whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow. Se7en is far from it. Many scenes study civilisation; present civilisation. And its evil. Our society isn't a pleasant one. The film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work. Of course, its Somerset, the one with the most experience who has the best way. He tries to find out why. Why some man is killing these people using a specific punishment. While Mills tries, unsuccessfully, to find out how; by studying the crime scene for clues. He ends up bored. With the help of the library, Somerset gets closer to the murderer. It may seem as though the role of Tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything. She is the one who brings the men to being more personal with each other. Notice how in the dinner scene she is the one to introduce them by name. All making the climax tense and difficult.Mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch. He has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works. Somerset has never even fired his weapon. He sees the evil round him. And he wants to leave it. Though he is a cop so he has the permission to do something about it. But the problem is, he isn't doing anything about it. John Doe is. The reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin. There is now nothing stopping us. It has become a common factor of life. And there should be. That is why John Doe thinks his behaviour is OK. But the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there. This is the harsh reality we live in.There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Pride. Lust. Envy. Wrath. And seven ways to die.Kevin Spacey is amazing as John Doe, portraying insanity perfectly. One of the greatest supporting performances of all-time already. And he's only in it for half an hour. Brad Pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the Hollywood effect of the film though I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. Morgan Freeman played his role with the greatest concentration. Throughout he needed a look of woe on his face. And he did just that.The writing is extraordinary. The genius, Andrew Kevin Walker took an interesting subject and created an instant classic. But most credit has to go to Fincher. Who took aspects you wouldn't even think of looking at and filming it. Together they project a deep film on our screens that no-one should miss. In one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate. A feast for the brain. One of the most imaginative scripts of the 90s. Fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film. Whether it be steady-cam for the slow and easy parts or the hand-held camera for the adrenalin pumping scenes.The cinematography is what makes this an excellent movie. Everything is dark. The world out there is rough, raw, grim and gritty. It does just that. The effect it makes is astounding and truly works. The sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. As that's what the film tries to achieve. The opening credits are upon the greatest segment of film I have ever seen. The jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching. Every scene, due to the effort put in it, is masterful and is what makes the film a joy to watch and observe.Se7en reveals the best glimpse we have seen of the disturbing underworld.

9.0,"""This isn't going to have a happy ending.""","After years of experiencing dull, formulaic, clichèd so-called thrillers, it's always satisfying when a genuinely great movie comes along. I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher  after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien³'  firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint.The film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. Reserved and hardened Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. His replacement, impulsive Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). Both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, John Doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. As the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. Throughout the film, Brad Pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen.David Fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. Despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. The graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany John Doe's horrific acts of murder. The rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. Even as 'Se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act  shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines  the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before.Our villain is anonymously titled John Doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by Kevin Spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. Unlike your typical serial killer, John Doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. In one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. John Doe's entire life has been dedicated to Mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. John Doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. Spacey is very good in the role, though I can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had I not been familiar with much of his later film work.The most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when John Doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find Detectives Somerset and Mills waiting patiently outside his door. However, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are John Doe himself (""Envy"") and David Mills (""Wrath""). In order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as Mills had suggested during the car-ride, Doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of Tracy, and so enticed Mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting Mills to commit the seventh sin. Some have argued that, since Mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of Doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?",this isnt going have happy ending,after years experiencing dull formulaic clich d so called thrillers its always satisfying when genuinely great movie comes along i have absolutely no hesitation proclaiming se7en be such film with director david fincher after achieving somewhat mixed result his cinematic debut alien firmly proclaiming his place as one 1990s most promising new talents its somewhat surprising that movie had managed elude me so long since id been wanting see it while it was only last week that i managed get my hands dvd copy so without further ado i invited over friend who has equal partiality towards good thrillers enthusiastically promised him one best its decade se7en didnt disappoint film takes place dark gritty unnamed metropolis where it is always raining danger looms ominously every alleyway reserved hardened detective lt william somerset morgan freeman has seen it all his lifetime is finally preparing retire country away madness city his replacement impulsive detective david mills brad pitt has transferred here at his own request is eager make his mark even though his career choice could be harming wellbeing his lonely vulnerable wife tracy gwyneth paltrow both detectives are soon drawn into case serial killer john doe who is ritualistically murdering his victims according seven deadly sins gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath as murders begin piling up two detectives investigation becomes obsession inevitable outcome will drastically change lives both throughout film brad pitt provides most comic relief none which detracts at all horrors we are witnessing screen david fincher has unique visual style that is simply thrilling watch despite thematically dark tone story film itself is positively brimming with invigorating vibrantly contrasted colour lighting graphic murder scenes appear splash out screen before our very eyes enhancing feelings dread repulsion that accompany john does horrific acts murder rich highly stylised use colour also helps create memorable atmosphere sheer foreboding imagery is sure stay with you many years come even as se7en abandons gritty setting city final act shifting action starkly lit open field beside trail electric power lines film loses none its potency isolation climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless vulnerable than before our villain is anonymously titled john doe is played with delightful creepiness by kevin spacey who only agreed part under condition that he remain unbilled promotion opening credits film unlike your typical serial killer john doe is not crazy impulsive stupid mad man but something rather more terrifying he is intelligent patient methodical one particularly ghastly crime he keeps convicted drug dealer chained his bed entire year removing his hands his tongue regularly paying his rent so as not arouse any suspicions john does entire life has been dedicated mankinds obsession with committing sin through orchestrating his crimes he wishes preach society their transgressions john doe rather uniquely is given large portion films final half hour so he becomes character that we come know very well as opposed half constructed serial killers who usually turn up final five minutes only be shot by hero spacey is very good role though i cant help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had i not been familiar with much his later film work most exciting scene film is undoubtedly hectic foot chase that ensues when john doe arrives home his apartment only find detectives somerset mills waiting patiently outside his door however films climax is also well worth mentioning though many interpretations have been floating around my view is that final two victims are john doe himself envy david mills wrath order prevent himself being labeled hypocrite as mills had suggested during car ride doe allowed his own deadly sin envy result death tracy so enticed mills shoot him simultaneously becoming sixth victim prompting mills commit seventh sin some have argued that since mills didnt die he cant be perceived as one does victims but is being left alive these circumstances perhaps even more diabolical punishment,0.5771875856569733,0.12914546338015725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,The best thriller ever made,"Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing. Andrew Kevin Walker created one of the most original spec screenplays of all time, but it is the kind of story traditionally used more as a writing sample than actually made into a movie. But the creative team of director David Fincher believed in this extremely dark, uncompromising story, and made it just the way Walker wrote it.The story revolves around two extremely well-drawn characters, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman). In one sense their relationship is the ultimate cliché -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though Mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place). But the contrast between these two characters is played out not for laughs or cheap drama but as the real working out of a moral question. Somerset, the lonely, cynical older detective, cares about people but has seen too much of the dark side of life to have much hope for society. Mills is not as intelligent as Somerset (kudos to Pitt for being willing to play a character that frequently looks foolish), and he lives by a simplistic belief in the power of law enforcement to change the world.Throughout the movie, the two characters struggle with this conflict -- is human society basically rotten, and can one person do anything to make a difference? Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is. Mills is the kind of person who has never truly questioned the simple ""values"" he was raised with. Somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails.In the end, it is only John Doe, the serial killer, who can teach Mills (and by extension the audience) the truth -- that this world is very often shockingly vicious and senselessly cruel. Doe and Somerset actually have similar views of society and the world, up to a point. But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.This movie is about the investigation Mills and Somerset undertake of Doe's murders, his ""sermon"" to the world through serial killing. Ultimately, Mills and Somerset can only do so much to try to stop Doe; the killer always seems at least one step ahead of them, and stays that way until the very end of the movie. In a normal Hollywood film, Mills and Somerset would ""win"" in the end by catching Doe and setting the world right again. But Andy Walker had a quite different ending in mind, and Fincher and his team take the shocking conclusion all the way to the limit of tension and drama.This movie, like Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" was controversial for being violent and gruesome. Certainly there are a number of gruesome and disturbing images of murder victims' bodies, and many aspects of the story are very troubling, to say the least. But only one person is shown being killed on screen, and by far the worst of what happens in this story happens in the viewer's imagination. Unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, Reservoir Dogs or Silence of the Lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen. In direct contrast with, say Quentin Tarantino, who uses extreme violence for shock effect and to gain notoriety, Fincher actually shows less violence on screen and raises far more probing moral questions in the viewer's mind. I cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment.I cannot finish this review without a word about Mr. Fincher's extraordinary visual talents. This is a man who ranks with the top handful of directors of all time in his knowledge and grasp of film-making technique. Everything from set design to lighting, selection of film stock and processing techniques, camera movement, frame composition, and editing work together to create an entirely new level of visual brilliance. Fincher's use of technique brings to mind nothing more than the work of Steven Spielberg in the 1970s, the last time a director this extraordinary burst onto the Hollywood scene. A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties. Fincher uses every one of these tools to their utmost. The technical work and supporting actors are uniformly superb. This is a movie that works on every level. Andy Walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film. This movie will rock you to the core.",best thriller ever made,se7en is very complex deep movie while also being quite disturbing andrew kevin walker created one most original spec screenplays all time but it is kind story traditionally used more as writing sample than actually made into movie but creative team director david fincher believed this extremely dark uncompromising story made it just way walker wrote it story revolves around two extremely well drawn characters david mills brad pitt william somerset morgan freeman one sense their relationship is ultimate clich old veteran cop paired up with brash rookie though mills is not actually rookie just new unnamed city where movie takes place but contrast between these two characters is played out not laughs or cheap drama but as real working out moral question somerset lonely cynical older detective cares about people but has seen too much dark side life have much hope society mills is not as intelligent as somerset kudos pitt being willing play character that frequently looks foolish he lives by simplistic belief power law enforcement change world throughout movie two characters struggle with this conflict is human society basically rotten can one person do anything make difference somerset intelligent well read man is smart enough recognize truth however painful that is mills is kind person who has never truly questioned simple values he was raised with somerset tries educate him tries warn him but ultimately fails end it is only john doe serial killer who can teach mills by extension audience truth that this world is very often shockingly vicious senselessly cruel doe somerset actually have similar views society world up point but while somerset still cares about his fellow human beings doe hates them takes out his rage series gruesome murders based seven deadly sins this movie is about investigation mills somerset undertake does murders his sermon world through serial killing ultimately mills somerset can only do so much try stop doe killer always seems at least one step ahead them stays that way until very end movie normal hollywood film mills somerset would win end by catching doe setting world right again but andy walker had quite different ending mind fincher his team take shocking conclusion all way limit tension drama this movie like finchers fight club was controversial being violent gruesome certainly there are number gruesome disturbing images murder victims bodies many aspects story are very troubling say least but only one person is shown being killed screen by far worst what happens this story happens viewers imagination unlike most films that have high levels violence including example reservoir dogs or silence lambs this movie genuinely attempts grapple with moral implications what is being shown screen direct contrast with say quentin tarantino who uses extreme violence shock effect gain notoriety fincher actually shows less violence screen raises far more probing moral questions viewers mind i cannot think any movie that contains as much genuine debate discussion among characters about crime human morality as this one does while never becoming dull or preachy moment i cannot finish this review without word about mr finchers extraordinary visual talents this is man who ranks with top handful directors all time his knowledge grasp film making technique everything set design lighting selection film stock processing techniques camera movement frame composition editing work together create entirely new level visual brilliance finchers use technique brings mind nothing more than work steven spielberg 1970s last time director this extraordinary burst onto hollywood scene whole generation has passed since then there is new wave techniques tools available filmmaker nineties fincher uses every one these tools their utmost technical work supporting actors are uniformly superb this is movie that works every level andy walker having written mind blowing screenplay must have been stunned when he saw finished film this movie will rock you core,0.5514042465471036,0.0261273964131107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,"With over 900 reviews, mine is hardly necessary : ) Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V:10","First off, I KNOW that I'm gonna get grief and derision from most here because, I'm sorry, but I don't really think this film is the be all, end all that everyone thinks it is.YES, it is well made, directed, and acted; and the lighting is sharp which fits the nihilistic 'Noir'ish mood. And, yes, it was indeed pretty much the first of it's kind which set a gritty, dark tone for crime films to come. Fine... I really have no specific negatives about the movie. HOWEVER... At the end of the day did I personally really find it THAT entertaining...? Not really... Yes, the unexpected ending is both shocking and dramatic, but does it honestly make sense...? ***SPOILERS Keven Spacey clearly and explicitly states the reasons why he has committed these murders: That people are doing all these very bad things everywhere all the time and people just don't care; so, he is setting 'the example' of what people should be doing to punish these 'sinners'. Okay... Now we are supposed to believe then that out of the blue he kills a COMPLETELY innocent woman (who is also pregnant) which to me the SOLE purpose is for an (admittedly extremely dramatic and shocking) plot device to set up Mills to kill him...??? Come on... I don't buy it. It is TOTALLY contrary to the very motivation of Kevin Spacey's character. But yeah, what an ending, sure... *** END SPOILERSAnyway, the question is, what do we find truly entertaining about a film? Putting stylistic touches or technical competence aside (such as visual effects, special or moody lighting, excellent cinematography, sound design, etc.) to me it primarily is this: How engaging or absorbing is the plot or story? How does it carry us along as it develops? How involving and complex are the characters and how interesting is the interplay and relationships between them? Now, these are just basics for most films. I realize that there are special genres or styles that we enjoy individually simply because we like those types of films (1950's Sci Fi, Slasher Horror Films, Ultra-Cheeeeezy Kung Fu movies, etc.) But, with this film at the end of the day what do we have...? Sure, we have this ghoulish, creepy, dark story of a killer who is killing by way of the 7 Deadly Sins. Okay... Characters...? Well, yes, all the actors concerned do a fine job; no real complaints there. BUT...! How deep or complex are they? How fascinating are they really? How engaging and intriguing are their interactions? To me personally, I felt that both the plot and character development to be rather shallow and superficial. I mean, WHAT do we really know about them? How deeply are we drawn into their lives and relationships? I'm sorry, but to me I really don't see a whole hell of a lot going on here other than a bunch of neatly lit, dark and somewhat moody scenes with little or no real substance. And the overall 'message' we are left with? The quite trite, common, and ultimately boring 'No one cares because the evil that people do is so arbitrary and horrible, so what's the point?' Yeah, real depth there...So, yeah, the film is well put together and there's nothing really 'BAD' about it per se; but, I do not feel myself that after all is said and done that you walk away from it with much of anything. There are darker and FAR more entertaining Horror films out there; and there are also dark, gritty, and INFINITELY more complex and engaging crime films out there. Films where afterward you actually feel like you have either been truly entertained by a story that makes you think and guess and wonder and also with characters who make you feel and care MUCH more about them because they are portrayed in a better, fuller, and more complex way.So, do I like dark, ambiguous, moody films? YOU BET! Do I like the dark, even nihilistic overtones of period FILM NOIR? ABSOLUTELY! Do I even like films with little substance BUT have TONS of style and mood (a la David Lynch, say) YES SIREE!!! But to me, this film, although of good quality, honestly strikes me as a 'One-Note' simplistic film and I just do NOT quite buy into the ending at all; it is merely a completely nonsensical plot device to give us a slam-bang ending. I mean, just a random example that comes to mind, I've seen Sandra Bullock's crime film 'MURDER BY NUMBERS' like 3 times and I've fully enjoyed it each time. You have a main character that is extremely complex and engaging; you have antagonists that are thoroughly riveting and with a layered relationship that is completely fascinating. And, you have a story that as it unreels truly draws you into the psyche, feelings, and motivations of the characters. And this is just an off the top, fairly above average example; nothing Earth shaking or anything, but just a simple example of what a movie is SUPPOSED to be. Entertaining...But, I will say this though... It has to have probably THE best opening credit sequence and background song ever!!!For this film though, I seriously doubt that I would ever really have the desire to sit down and watch it again...*** EDIT (2015.02.14)Heh, I'm actually thinking about giving this another chance and watching it again... :) I'm curious if my impressions will still be the same...",with over 900 reviews mine is hardly necessary blu ray excellent 10 v 10,first off i know that im gonna get grief derision most here because im sorry but i dont really think this film is be all end all that everyone thinks it is yes it is well made directed acted lighting is sharp which fits nihilistic noirish mood yes it was indeed pretty much first its kind which set gritty dark tone crime films come fine i really have no specific negatives about movie however at end day did i personally really find it that entertaining not really yes unexpected ending is both shocking dramatic but does it honestly make sense

example what people should be doing punish these sinners okay now we are supposed believe then that out blue he kills completely innocent woman who is also pregnant which me sole purpose is admittedly extremely dramatic shocking plot device set up mills kill him come i dont buy it it is totally contrary very motivation kevin spaceys character but yeah what ending sure end spoilersanyway question is what do we find truly entertaining about film putting stylistic touches or technical competence aside such as visual effects special or moody lighting excellent cinematography sound design etc me it

walk away it with much anything there are darker far more entertaining horror films out there there are also dark gritty infinitely more complex engaging crime films out there films where afterward you actually feel like you have either been truly entertained by story that makes you think guess wonder also with characters who make you feel care much more about them because they are portrayed

tons style mood la david lynch say yes siree but me this film although good quality honestly strikes me as one note simplistic film i just do not quite buy into ending at all it is merely completely

9.0,So good it's a sin,"Bleak, gruesome, brilliant. These are a few of words that come to mind when I think of David Fincher's 'Se7en'. In lesser hands the concept (two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing stylized murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins) could've been nothing more than a gimmick, but here it's a deftly crafted game of cat and mouse that pulls you in, even as it makes you want to turn away. But that said, it's not what I'd call an exceptionally graphic film. More is implied than is shown, and we fill in the blank spots in our mind's eye. A far more effective technique than the cheap gross-out route.The cast is excellent, lead by the inimitable Morgan Freeman. I can't believe Freeman didn't get an Oscar nod. I would cite genre bias, but then I think of 'Silence Of The Lambs' getting everything but the kitchen sink just a few years before at the Academy Awards. Co-star Brad Pitt is no Freeman, but he more than holds his own with the veteran here and the two have an exceptional chemistry. The killer, whose identity I will not reveal lest I ruin the surprise for those who may not have seen it, is brilliant in his few brief scenes.It's not a pleasant film, and at the risk of spoiling it, there is no happy ending, but it's a filmmaking and storytelling clinic, and one Hell of a good movie.",so good its sin,bleak gruesome brilliant these are few words that come mind when i think david finchers se7en lesser hands concept two detectives trail serial killer committing stylized murders based seven deadly sins couldve been nothing more than gimmick but here its deftly crafted game cat mouse that pulls you even as it makes you want turn away but that said its not what id call exceptionally graphic film more is implied than is shown we fill blank spots our minds eye far more effective technique than cheap gross out route cast is excellent lead by inimitable morgan freeman i cant believe freeman didnt get oscar nod i would cite genre bias but then i think silence lambs getting everything but kitchen sink just few years before at academy awards co star brad pitt is no freeman but he more than holds his own with veteran here two have exceptional chemistry killer whose identity i will not reveal lest i ruin surprise those who may not have seen it is brilliant his few brief scenes its not pleasant film at risk spoiling it there is no happy ending but its filmmaking storytelling clinic one hell good movie,0.5966666666666668,0.17333333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,It doesn't get much more influential than this...,"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichéd characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time.",it doesnt get much more influential than this,two very different films about serial killers ruled hollywood 1990s 1991s silence lambs featuring anthony hopkins as infamous hannibal cannibal lecter this david finchers masterpiece about pair new york cops tackling perverted killer inspired by seven deadly sins se7en is extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens copycats like resurrection bone collector all films share gritty grimy style with depictions unflinching violence seedy backdrops sleazy characters whichever way you look at it se7en is great movie it has pair sterling performances relative newcomers brad pitt morgan freeman playing stock clich d characters young rookie older wiser cop verge retirement both pitt freeman overcome their characters conventions make them believable people their quarry is kevin spacey giving one his traditionally disturbed portrayals as sociopath with no inklings good or evil much film is made up police procedural elements with investigation crime scenes following leads at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through which finchers direction is top notch its also blessed with gruesomely dark twist ending which stays your head forever afterwards what its worth id pick se7en over silence every time,0.5572990777338603,0.1370882740447958,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"

,"An uncompromising story, filthy, grainy visuals and terrific performances make Se7en a modern classic","Se7En Se7en is just one of those movies that burrows deep under your skin and festers. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker have created a bleak, desolate world where there are no real heroes, only sinners. An uncompromising story, filthy, grainy visuals and terrific performances make Se7en a modern classic. Det. William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen the human spirit at its worst throughout his 34 years of police service. He finally realises he has had enough of the horrors of the world and he becomes ready for retirement. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a brash, hot-headed rookie cop who believes his big break lies in the murky, seedy unnamed metropolis. Amidst some cynicism, Sommerset takes on Mills as a partner for his last days. When two murders occur within two days of each other the duo realize that a serial killer is murdering his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. What follows is a terrifying and disturbing story of the dark side of human nature. Fincher's Noir York with endless rain, rain that fails to wash (to quote Travis Bickle) the filth off the streets, is a harsh look into urban life where decency is a rarity. Along with his cinematographer Darius Khondji, paints the screen with dark greys, blacks and yellow to hint at the rotting core of this environment. Freeman gives the film its most complex performance and moral core. His detective has grown weary of apathy and he slightly suggests an understanding of the despicable killer. On that note, Kevin Spacey delivers a chilling portrayal, a killer with a blankly human face and disturbing conviction. Writer Walker has written a cop-genre film with impeccable substance. Rather than a whodunit or an action movie, he has given birth to a story that pokes and prods at our psychic. It forces us to confront ourselves and question the next time we eat too much, or take too much time gelling our hair or even lash out in road rage.
