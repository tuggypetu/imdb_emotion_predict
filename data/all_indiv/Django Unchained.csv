8.0,It's not perfect but it's very good... and I'm not even a fan of Tarantino!,"I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in ""Inglorious Bastards"" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from ""Django"" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre.",its not perfect but its very good im not even fan tarantino,i just saw this film i confess that i am completely satisfied i am not admirer tarantino but i have little say about this film inspired by character sixties western spaghetti films mixing western with blacksploitation tarantinos style exaggerated showy extravagant excessive is all there before us but unlike other films i didnt feel that this was problem or transformed film into kind parody plot is about search that django former slave who is unexpectedly released becomes bounty hunter will do his wife slave who was sold disappeared he has help german responsible his release together they discover that she is at home rude slave owner called cotton candy who among other businesses profits death fights between slaves so they decide disguise themselves as experts field go his plantation try buy her freedom without candy realizing what they want film is very good despite being almost three hours long it has no dead moments entertains wonderfully however although tarantinos exaggerations histrionic vision were not problem this time there are some points that were really uncomfortable mainly concerning historical rigor which we already know is not something that he really takes seriously another reason why i dont like him as director begin with such mandingo fights never existed we are not ancient rome slave owners however bad they were did not like throw money out window kill pleasure their best pieces tarantino went get that silly idea another film he liked pasted it here another problem is use dynamite which would only be invented few years after period which film takes place clothes also do not match time or place action outfit clubs black maid with that miniskirt is particularly bad that it sexualizes character imports 21st century scent into middle 19th century i will not go much longer i think i proved my point another thing i have say is that this is very violent film tarantino style that is with ton blood each bullet spectacular shootings some nudity high doses brutality dialogues are also full racist insults profanity but i think that was something film asked support its own credibility short this is not movie anyone with tarantino this is often taken granted main role was given jamie foxx he is superb gives character strength toughness that i liked which contrast nicely with polite sensitivity dr schultz brilliantly played by christopher waltz this actor had already done extraordinary job inglorious bastards now he was even better with character that seems tailor made him i was particularly impressed with work leonardo di caprio who rarely manages make villains he is actor with rare talent has managed be worthy our contempt this film another actor who shines this film is veteran samuel l jackson role black butler so fond owner that he becomes more slavish than whites i also liked brief cameo honor franco nero actor who played django original films it was elegant honorable way tarantino bow actor work that inspired him much less impressive was performance kerry washington who has little time material show what is worth technically it is film full notable aspects that require our attention that large extent are part directors brand image it is case cinematography use strong colors slow motion footage action scenes features strong visual style that tarantino loves sets are good also costumes despite anachronisms that i have mentioned film has pleasant pace but first half was generally better yet more restrained it seems that tarantino gets lost his own style as he approaches most violent scenes soundtrack is great takes advantage several songs by various composers personally i enjoyed listening original song django by luis bacalov songs composed this film by ennio morricone name that will always be associated collective memory with great western spaghetti past it was careful effective honorable selection way it honors genre,0.5672365754812564,0.19382218844984803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Tarantino at his best,"(Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern & Samuel L. Jackson)Set in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.For a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I'll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes.

6.0,Revenge.,"I enjoyed this action/comedy movie because I hated the evil doers and wanted to see them die because of their brutal natures. I reveled in their pain. And that's the problem.I'm going along about half way on this one because the performances are as good as they are and I can appreciate Quentin Tarantino's collegial sense of humor. Two ""Django's"" shaking hands. Brunhilde and Siegfried coming out of nowhere. A musical score that is an homage to Ennio Morricone. The surprises that pop out of a man's mouth or his sleeve.Tarantino's earlier stuff was pretty good -- ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" -- and ""Jackie Brown"" was finely written and directed, a very nice piece of work. The ""Kill Bills"" was far too stylized for me.""Inglourious Basterds"" was a disappointment. It was much more violent than anything else he's done, and instead of comic internal conflicts, he'd chosen as villains the Nazis, the most evil people of the century, and their torture and murder could be endorsed without chagrin by the least sophisticated of us, the kind who think ""Don't just kill the enemy; torture them before killing them."" It was a kind of pornography for the millions.He's followed the same course here and I didn't like it much. Given the depraved character of the slave-owning Southerners, no punishment is too harsh, so Django can kill helpless and unarmed people -- including women -- at will. As a hero, the character of Django is not just flawed but practically turned inside out. Superman was a hero Roy Rogers was a hero. Django was a walking abattoir, savagely killing everyone he disliked -- and Tarantino has provided him with a the simple-minded excuse of hating that ""peculiar institution."" I don't want him as my hero. He's too Old Testament for me.The performances are good, though, and the production values high. Jamie Foxx has about two notes on his instrument but Christoph Waltz does a great job as the German bounty hunter. His accent doesn't sound German at all. It sounds like it came from somewhere in outer space. And Don Johnson is surprisingly chipper and colorful as Big Daddy, the plantation owner who gets splashily offed by Django's powerful rifle. (The squibbs seem to have had double charges.) Tarantino obviously has a lot of talent and a keen sense of humor. I wish he'd get back to his roots and lay off the easy targets.",revenge,i enjoyed this action comedy movie because i hated evil doers wanted see them die because their brutal natures i reveled their pain thats problem im going along about half way this one because performances are as good as they are i can appreciate quentin tarantinos collegial sense humor two djangos shaking hands brunhilde siegfried coming out nowhere musical score that is homage ennio morricone surprises that pop out mans mouth or his sleeve tarantinos earlier stuff was pretty good reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown was finely written directed very nice piece work kill bills was far too stylized me inglourious basterds was disappointment it was much more violent than anything else hes done instead comic internal conflicts hed chosen as villains nazis most evil people century their torture murder could be endorsed without chagrin by least sophisticated us kind who think dont just kill enemy torture them before killing them it was kind pornography millions hes followed same course here i didnt like it much given depraved character slave owning southerners no punishment is too harsh so django can kill helpless unarmed people including women at will as hero character django is not just flawed but practically turned inside out superman was hero roy rogers was hero django was walking abattoir savagely killing everyone he disliked tarantino has provided him with simple minded excuse hating that peculiar institution i dont want him as my hero hes too old testament me performances are good though production values high jamie foxx has about two notes his instrument but christoph waltz does great job as german bounty hunter his accent doesnt sound german at all it sounds like it came somewhere outer space don johnson is surprisingly chipper colorful as big daddy plantation owner who gets splashily offed by djangos powerful rifle squibbs seem have had double charges tarantino obviously has lot talent keen sense humor i wish hed get back his roots lay off easy targets,0.5174924012158055,0.0850709219858156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish","I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10.",brutally hilarious quite messy but total blast start finish,i only had one thought my mind this christmas see django unchained quentin tarantinos latest opus western set two years before civil war concerns former slave named django jamie foxx he is freed by bounty hunter dr king shultz christoph waltz order help him with bounty quite quickly shultz takes django under his wing trains him as his partner but he made him promise that he would rescue his wife plantation owned by ruthless calvin candie leonardo dicaprio rescuing her is not going be all that easy what pains me most about django unchained as die hard tarantino fan is just how sloppy it all seems i enjoyed every minute it but i could never shake feeling how messy thrown together it all feels portions film feel episodic search brittle brothers mentioned heavily trailers begins ends practically within minutes some scenes just seem play out just fun it another scene trailers involving lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added comedic purposes has no real point actually existing more than any his films before it django feels like tarantino simply making movie sheer pleasure with no outside motivations or controllers film threatens go totally off rails at any given moment lacks any real sense direction or focus it may sound ridiculous but loss editor sally menke confirms sneaking suspicion i always had about tarantino he needed steady right hand help encourage him as what was needed what was not i do not want criticize djangos editor fred raskin but it is obvious he is no menke that works against film heavily it lacks polish we have come expect is practically stripped glossy cool texture so prevalent tarantinos work up until now but then maybe that was his intention all along perhaps tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life film general django is deliberately shot film or at least print i saw looks very gritty messy at all times it is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked before borderline cartoonish kill bill included has very go broke attitude about itself film seems revel how brilliantly it can splatter all blood gore done through use squibs no digital how uncomfortably numbing it can make violence i know he does not care what people think his films but this movie especially seems like emphatically raised middle finger establishment all my complaints about how messy it all feels i was never once bored or felt like movie was dragging itself out staggering 165 minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine acting wise tarantino stacks deck with number recognizable character actors young old roles that vary size most have very few lines if any at all seem just stand by just as content as audience is watch action unfold it is little off putting especially with how important some these characters are initially made out be washington as broomhilda von shaft one most subtle references hes ever dropped does well as helpless victim frequent dreamlike object but she never really gets show off any her acting prowess outside her facial reactions they are increasingly effective especially during horrific flashback scenes but her work here feels ridiculously stunted comparison other leads samuel l jackson much like tarantino himself seems just be having fun his role as candies adviser stephen he plays every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with then amps it up near ludicrous state he is frequently hilarious but role seems border parody more than anything else surprisingly foxx takes very long time settling into leading role it may just be character but it is quite clear set that he is not very comfortable djangos shoes leads credence why will smith amongst so many others dropped out picture so quickly but once he finds his footing he does fantastic job walking thin line between empathetic sadistic it is not easy character play but foxx makes it his own bringing sense style grace that are virtually absent rest film course he gets all best lines waltz dicaprio are clear standouts however nailing every nuance their sadly underwritten characters while waltz plays straight man dicaprio is delightfully unhinged vicious both are playing directly against type yet are strangely comfortable roles watching them act circles around rest cast foxx included is true highlight film i just wish they were both given additional emphasis more do all its numerous faults i had blast watching django unchained it is hilarious it is lot fun is wildly enjoyable i genuinely think it could have been lot better if there was more focus direction but this is very clearly picture tarantino wanted make his own terms that i applaud him effort it is not his best work but certainly not his worst 8 10,0.5536636696636695,0.08773235098235098,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,Great Mix Of Action And Comedy,"Quentin Tarantino, one of the most iconic directors of the 21st (and late 20th) century, why? Simple. Because of masterpieces like this. Tarantino defies the laws of film, he shoots them in his own way, however he wants. Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However, Django Unchained is Tarantino's first look at the Western genre, his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo.Django Unchained tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter Dr King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The story follows on as Shultz takes on Django as his ""deputy"" during their tasks of bounty hunting, in return Shultz says that after winter he will help find Django's lost wife, Broomhilda. This takes them to a huge plantation in Mississippi owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), from here they plan up a scheme on how to get away with Broombilda.The cast boast out amazing performances, particularly Christoph Waltz (also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa). Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing. All three are able to add some light-hearted humour in the mix to make sure it doesn't stay too serious, as well as having comic actor Jonah Hill play a member of the KKK.There's a reason the film has been nominated for 5 Oscars.",great mix action comedy,quentin tarantino one most iconic directors 21st late 20th century why simple because masterpieces like this tarantino defies laws film he shoots them his own way however he wants tarantino has always focused upon action thriller genre reservoir dogs up until inglourious basterds however django unchained is tarantinos first look at western genre his first attempt at it he executed it beautifully scenes were shot perfectly alongside amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo django unchained tells story django jamie foxx slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter dr king shultz christoph waltz story follows as shultz takes django as his deputy during their tasks bounty hunting return shultz says that after winter he will help find djangos lost wife broomhilda this takes them huge plantation mississippi owned by calvin candie leonardo dicaprio here they plan up scheme how get away with broombilda cast boast out amazing performances particularly christoph waltz also famous his previous collaboration with tarantino inglourious bastards as colonel landa both foxx dicaprios performance are both equally amazing all three are able add some light hearted humour mix make sure it doesnt stay too serious as well as having comic actor jonah hill play member kkk theres reason film has been nominated 5 oscars,0.5518121693121694,0.3072222222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.15}"
9.0,Unmistakable Tarantino,"Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter.

9.0,"""D-J-A-N-G-O.... the 'D' is silent.""","After all the hype, all the articles and reviews, after all the controversy over the 'n' word, after all is said and done, Tarantino kicks butt again and comes up with a terrifically entertaining movie. Notice I said entertaining and not necessarily enjoyable. There are a number of scenes that are clearly not enjoyable, in fact, downright troubling like the dog attack of the black slave D'Artagnan (Ato Essandoh) and the hot box scene involving Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). But over all, Tarantino has fashioned a well told revenge tale modeled on the Spaghetti Western genre of the Seventies. And it begins immediately with a classy credit for the 'friendly participation of Franco Nero', the original coffin dragging gunslinger from the 1966 film who's name is resurrected here because frankly, it just sounds really cool.Now here's the problem I have with folks who find racism around every corner - when a movie depicts events or themes that have racism at it's core, it doesn't mean that the picture or the film maker is racist or is making a racist statement. The entire controversy in the media surrounding the use of the 'n' word here is a prime example of critiquing the movie as a racist film. Personally, whenever I heard it used in the picture, it sounded to me like part of the era's vernacular and not as a pretext for sensationalism. So here's a question I have for the critics - when will you put Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson on the spot for their participation in the project? Are they being racist, or are they artists? Or is it only Quentin who has to answer for the film's language and subject matter? What I didn't expect from the movie was the amount of humor and comedic dialog that came along with it. The bag head scene was surreally comic and just mind blowingly funny, but you really have to listen to the dialog to get it. The guy who was upset over the critique of his wife's working on the hoods was something one could easily relate to, and yet it sounded completely ludicrous even in context. I guess you have to be a little warped to come up with something like that, but warped seems to be right up Tarantino's alley. He proves it once and for all when he has Django blow himself sky high with the bag of dynamite. Priceless.As for the violence, well it's red meat bloody and about as visceral as it gets, so if you're on the squeamish side, there are a few scenes that may give you the heaves. It's one area where the director explicitly goes over the top and much of it is quite unbelievable. I have to admit though, the 'say goodbye' scene with Miss Lara Lee (Laura Cayouette) was the best, and it wasn't bloody at all. That was one of the times the picture entered 'Kill Bill' territory.As for a recommendation, you'll just have to guage your own preferences. I'm a Western movie and Tarantino fan and there was no way I was going to miss this. Casual movie goers with a low tolerance for gore and gratuitous shoot 'em up scenes should most likely stay away. Finally, for those hung up about the media's fascination with the 'n' word, I tried keeping up with the count as the picture progressed. I've read accounts that placed the number at well over a hundred, but I came up with seventy seven myself, realizing that I probably missed a few because it's easy to have your attention diverted by other elements in the story.

10.0,I like the way you die,"Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a well spoken bounty hunter who acquires Django (Jamie Foxx) to find and kill some men who are wanted, ""dead or alive."" Dr. Schultz isn't too keen on the ""live"" part.The film divides itself into two parts. After the bounty hunting episodes are through, our duo conceive a plan to rescue the wife of Django (Kerry Washington) by purchasing her from Candie Land plantation. Dr. Schultz has no stomach for slavery or slave owners. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't enter the film until the second part.Like Tarantino films it incorporates humor. The bag over the head scene was reminiscent of something we might have seen in ""Blazing Saddles."" The flashbacks are minimal and not confusing. There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first know usage of the word is the 1930s. It is speculated the phrase originated during slavery as a way to describe white owners who would take black mothers as comfort women. The phrase would of had a specific meaning and not used in the generic sense that Samuel L. Jackson tossed about.Tarantino fans will not be disappointed.

9.0,Beautiful and violent,"Sometimes the German equivalent of the MPAA can surprise us all. Not only did this movie get a rating (uncut), it also passed with a ""16"". I'm always happy, when they pass a movie uncut, so I won't complain. That doesn't mean, I'm not wondering what is going on in the heads of some of those people who decide what rating a movie gets. The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).Apart from those discussions, what can be said, is that Tarantino did it again. A great movie, with superb performances by everyone involved. Who'd have thought Kerry Washington would have to learn German for a role? Not me, but the inclusion of Waltz, Tarantino favorite and rightfully so, made this happen. And while Waltz almost steals the movie, it's still very much a Jamie Foxx picture.",beautiful violent,sometimes german equivalent mpaa can surprise us all not only did this movie get rating uncut it also passed with 16 im always happy when they pass movie uncut so i wont complain that doesnt mean im not wondering what is going heads some those people who decide what rating movie gets movie even got some heat america its violence then again it also got some heat because its male lead one party decided it wasnt good example white people be killed by black guy other side thought it was unfair its depiction black people so forth saying it lead people becoming violent apart those discussions what can be said is that tarantino did it again great movie with superb performances by everyone involved whod have thought kerry washington would have learn german role not me but inclusion waltz tarantino favorite rightfully so made this happen while waltz almost steals movie its still very much jamie foxx picture,0.6125724637681159,0.056050724637681154,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Tarantino-gasm!,"Merry Christmas to all you Tarantino fans out there. I hope you made a Tarantino checklist so here we go.Witty dialogue, check. Excessive profanity especially use the word 'nigger', check. Excessive violence including testicles getting blown off, check. Soulful musical score, check. Sometimes non-linear narrative, check. Shots of women's feet, check. Very great character driven plot, check. An actual spaghetti western, even though it takes place in the American South, check.There are four standout characters played by the top billed actors.Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter. Even though he is the titular character, he gets downplayed when in the presence of the other actors. Still he delivers a solid performance, in fact hes very convincing. We all know Jamie Foxx as this golden voice RnB singer and comedian with a very clean cut image. He was able to pull off the whole transitioning from a timid slave to a menacing bounty hunter. Not only that he had the whole look down too, with all the facial scarring and the messy hair.Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schulz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter who frees Django so he could help pursue his previous owners who are targets. Waltz is a very charismatic actor, and thats how he does this role. Presents every line with finesse.Leonardo Dicaprio is in his best yet. He plays a plantation owner, Calvin Candie, and is the owner of Django's wife. This is a very different role. We've seen Leonardo in gritty roles before but never did he play this lecherous antagonist. We were all used to Leo being this teen idol, who looked like a member of Hanson. Here he's this Southerner with discoloured teeth and a scruffy beard.Finally Samuel L. Jackson who plays Steve, a house slave who you could say is the secret antagonist here. For all the screen time that he has he dominates. Sam usually plays boisterous roles as a tough guy, but it was very interesting seeing him play a devious and manipulative old man.The only gripe here was that this film was a little too long exceeding the three act structure, but its an epic western film so I'll excuse Tarantino for that. Yet again he made another great film with a lot of flair and carried well by the four big hitter actors.

8.0,"Over indulgent, gross....but also terrific.","My biggest complaints about ""Django Unchained"" are ones that really won't matter to most people who see this film. After all, just about everyone knows that Quentin Tarantino's films are incredibly bloody, gross and self-indulgent. So, when you see a billion gallons of blood and bodies flying everywhere, you are not really surprised! This one does go a step further--there is some full-frontal male nudity and a few of the scenes were so gross and gratuitous that Tarantino has outdone himself. But still, you KNOW ahead of time that this is not a film to show your mother, Father Jenkins or your 6 year-old!! However, HOW far it goes will limit the film's appeal--you can be sure of that. Evan a large number of adults would be unable to stick with this one...it's THAT violent.The film is, in some ways, like an Italian western. I loved that much of the music was done by Ennio Merricone--the same guy who did music for such classic spaghetti westerns as ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". It was a major plus. I also liked seeing that one of the many wonderful cameos was by Franco Nero--the original Django. But, if you think that this is a modern Hollywood version of an Italian western, you are mistaken. PARTS of it are--most is not. In fact, despite the western clothing on so many of the characters (anachronistic, actually), the film is mostly set in the American South just before the Civil War. People just didn't dress that way at that time and in that place. The film is, at times, sort of like a blaxspoitation western in style as well.What did I like about the film? Well, it was never, ever dull. The film never really gives you a chance--even though it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes. Second, as I mentioned above, there were a lot of cool cameos--and some were real surprises, such as Tom Wopat and Bruce Dern! Third, although it was vile, the language was dead on--no politically corrected phraseology in this one! Nasty and blunt, that's for sure. Fourth, although it was really violent and gross, I will admit that there is something very satisfying in seeing all these racist jerks killed so violently. It appeals to the lowest instinct in us...but on a primal level is IS appealing. Finally, the acting was quite good.What didn't I like? Well, even for a Tarantino film it was violent---very violent. Also, I definitely agree that the first hour or so of the film was MUCH better. It was better paced, less indulgent and more enjoyable. The film did become a bit of a free-for-all blood-fest near the end and the 'mandingo fighting scene' was unnecessarily nasty. Still, if you have the stomach for it, ""Django Unchained"" is a heck of an enjoyable film.By the way, I did a little research and there appears to be no such thing as 'mandingo fighting'.

10.0,Brace yourself for True Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained"" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie.

,Works really well despite so much of it seeming to be at odds with itself,"Beyond the name and a cameo by Franco Nero, the story here has nothing in common with the original film series being referenced, although the genre and the design do of course have a lot of common ground. The story here sees a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter freeing a slave who can identify three men who have a considerable bounty on their heads. Despite being an one-time deal, the partnership works so well that the two stay together for more work, although the slave (Django) only has one overall goal – to find his wife and buy her freedom.The film opens with all the tropes that tell you that this will be an exploitation-style western; the music is of its time, the credits are blood red in that wonderfully gaudy manner and the camera movement is knowing but effective, and indeed this is what we get from the film as a whole – a bloody exploitation western that refers the grindhouse films that Tarantino idolizes so much. However to suggest that this is all the film does is to somehow miss the fact that it does so much more. Despite being trashy in some regards, it is brutally unsettling in others – some scenes of cruelty to slaves are very hard to stomach. On top of this we have the usual dialogue scenes that Tarantino is very good at – just like Inglorious Bastards had some incredibly tense scenes of just talking, Django has many great dialogue scenes – some are conversations with a bubbling tension, others are monologues delivered to camera in such a way that you are gripped by what the character is saying. Then we have the other thing Tarantino – sudden bloody violence, and it is very bloody here – excessive, OTT and very well executed. And just in case this mix isn't convoluted enough, the film also takes the time to have plenty to laugh at whether it is the flamboyantly written characters or the comedy set-pieces which include a clan raid having wardrobe issues. It really shouldn't work – I have seen other films trying to do several things in the same film and not make it work but yet here it does, and remarkably so.Credit to Tarantino because he really doesn't put a foot wrong here (aside from casting himself when he can't act). He delivers a great exploitation film that, much like Inglorious, allows the audience this bloody fantasy retribution with the underdog hero, but also has scenes of genuine tension, scenes of great dialogue and others of genuine hilarity – and most importantly none of them seem out of place. The length of the film put me off a bit because the cinema releases ahead of awards ceremonies all seem to run long as if that counts in their favor – but in the case of Django the time really flew. It helps that it is really well filmed too; the camera movement is powerful, the shot selection good and With such material to work the cast all give great performances – again despite so many of them having different aspects to deliver on. Waltz is a great presence, as he was in Inglorious – he fits the dialogue really well and captivates with his colorful character. Surprising to me was how much I liked Foxx – he downplayed when he needed to but yet was also able to step up into the exploitation hero when required. Di Caprio captures real smiling menace and again I was surprised by how well he did it. Samuel L Jackson isn't in the film till the final hour or so, but when he arrives he joins a very crowded screen of people all commanding attention – but his house slave is brilliantly loathsome and convinces as a man so long surviving that he has forgotten this is what he is doing. Washington has less time but she sells the emotional part of the film by being so convincingly brutalized. The supporting cast is almost too heavy in famous faces, but mostly they do not distract but rather add with their various turns.I was taken by surprised by how much I enjoyed this film and how the time flew. It mixes so much together that should clash and damage itself, but yet it all works really well (even the mixing of genre music and modern hip-hop!).

6.0,A Little Too Much,"Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it, but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive, this is it. It's a decent film, with plenty of action, some very funny scenes, and three of the best performances of the year: Jackson's house slave is almost as good as Washington's performance. He's an interesting and complex character, somehow who we can't even imagine existed. He's the darker twin of Scarlet's mammy in ""GWTW"", way darker and just as fascinating. There's of course, another star turn by De Caprio, puzzling, magnetic, depraved, and ruthless, and Waltz creates another memorable character, a foreigner who can't comprehend what's going on in his world, but who doesn't stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.""Django"" is a hybrid of Westerns? and a very strange take on slavery, looking at it through Tarantino's special lens. He's unable to edit himself, and while he builds the tension and almost never loses our interest through Django and Schultz quest to rescue their ""lost princess"", I kept wondering why he overindulges all the time. Things don't clash here, they explode with such magnitude that I was wondering why wasn't 3-D involved in the process. I kept looking for guts flying and what happened to the NC-17 rating.There is much praise to give to the fact that he takes risks with his use of language, and there is not a boring conversation in the entire film, but when there is confrontation, you almost feel like ducking or you'll be hit by some of the flying organs. Much of the praise here should go to the way the Old West comes alive with the costumes and art direction. There is also the amazing job Robert Richardson does with his camera, making the film look and feel like one of those Spaghetti Westerns he's paying tribute to. I loved the way he brings in Franco (the original Django) and interacts with this movie's hero. There's of course, some Ennio Morricone, and a few other touches that show Tarantino's adoration of the genre.Is there a story? Well, barely. A lot of the film is about the feel of it, like getting on a ride without expecting much depth, and to be fair, there shouldn't be a IQ test or some confusing plot twist to ruin the entertainment, but I think Spielberg knew how to control himself in ""Saving Private Ryan"" by limiting the massacres to the first 20 minutes. A little restraint would have helped here. Who knows? Tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece.Another detail that is puzzling me. We're hearing all this praise for the movie, like it's the second coming of Peckinpah or the latest collaboration between Benton, Penn, and Carpenter. It's as much fun as the best '60's B movie, but I am not sure about those accolades out there. Where was all this praise for the ""Indiana Jones"" films? Maybe they should have included more flying body parts and some more colorful language? Still enjoy it for what it is... a ride that has plenty of movie syrup in it.",little too much,let me make it clear i did enjoy most it but i also found myself looking at my watch hoping it would end sooner if there was film this year that more than deserves adjective excessive this is it its decent film with plenty action some very funny scenes three best performances year jacksons house slave is almost as good as washingtons performance hes interesting complex character somehow who we cant even imagine existed hes darker twin scarlets mammy gwtw way darker just as fascinating theres course another star turn by de caprio puzzling magnetic depraved ruthless waltz creates another memorable character foreigner who cant comprehend whats going his world but who doesnt stop taking advantage situation without losing his soul django is hybrid westerns very strange take slavery looking at it through tarantinos special lens hes unable edit himself while he builds tension almost never loses our interest through django schultz quest rescue their lost princess i kept wondering why he overindulges all time things dont clash here they explode with such magnitude that i was wondering why wasnt 3 d involved process i kept looking guts flying what happened nc 17 rating there is much praise give fact that he takes risks with his use language there is not boring conversation entire film but when there is confrontation you almost feel like ducking or youll be hit by some flying organs much praise here should go way old west comes alive with costumes art direction there is also amazing job robert richardson does with his camera making film look feel like one those spaghetti westerns hes paying tribute i loved way he brings franco original django interacts with this movies hero theres course some ennio morricone few other touches that show tarantinos adoration genre is there story well barely lot film is about feel it like getting ride without expecting much depth be fair there shouldnt be iq test or some confusing plot twist ruin entertainment but i think spielberg knew how control himself saving private ryan by limiting massacres first 20 minutes little restraint would have helped here who knows tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece another detail that is puzzling me were hearing all this praise movie like its second coming peckinpah or latest collaboration between benton penn carpenter its as much fun as best 60s b movie but i am not sure about those accolades out there where was all this praise indiana jones films maybe they should have included more flying body parts some more colorful language still enjoy it what it is ride that has plenty movie syrup it,0.49823777129899566,0.21038386783284743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"
6.0,An Entertaining Mess,"Modern exploitation guru Quentin Tarantino serves up historical revenge once again. His last film, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, had the German Nazis getting theirs, and now, with a good German on board (in fact he's the villain from the last film) we're out to set things right in the American Deep South, two years shy of the Civil War Although the first half takes place on the road from Texas to Mississippi as bounty hunting dentist Dr. King Schultz recruits a slave named Django to help him find three outlaw brothers (Django alone knows their appearance). These are the more spirited and deliciously cutthroat segments as our heroes partner up and, as Django puts it, ""Kill white people for money."" Christoph Waltz (Schultz) and Jamie Foxx (Django) are a good team, and while making mince meat out of their targets, the bloodshed is something to marvel. But Tarantino throws in awkward bouts of humor, derailing the intensity of the moment. One particular scene where a group of rednecks complain about not seeing through masked eyeholes (including a very distracting cameo by Jonah Hill) feels like Mel Brooks clumsily intruding Sergio Leone.After Django helps Schultz with his job, it's time for the doctor to aid his more-than-capable partner rescue Django's wife Broomhilda, who resides at ""Candyland,"" an infamous Antebellum plantation run by the sinister though much too youthful Calvin Candie.While Leonardo DiCaprio has more than capable acting skills, and savors the gloriously tyrannical racist dialog, there could have/should have been a backstory on why the owner of a plantation looks fresh out of finishing school.For a man who's supposed to have a lifetime of seething venom oozing from his veins, those desperately piercing blue eyes seem more confused and frustrated than cold and calculating, making Tarantino's purposely overboard racism more of a crutch than weapon for the DiCaprio character (perhaps Don Johnson, who played a wily brothel owner in a previous scene, could have taken this role he had the age going for him and with that, soulless eyes that look like he's seen – and been through – pretty much everything).But Leo's not alone. He's helped along by the most wicked of Uncle Tom's played by Samuel Jackson, whose spitefully cantankerous Stephen figures things out before his boss. This is a nice role for the QT stock actor, who has sleepwalked through many roles post PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN. Although his feeble mannerisms often slow down the performance.The main problem with UNCHAINED is how long Tarantino stretches scenes with dialog. While the actors, especially Waltz and DiCaprio, have a blast with colorful monologues, you'll often forget there are other characters on board – and most of the speeches fail to serve the plot. That being: the duo pretending to buy Mandingo slave fighters when they really want the girl.With all the deals and discussions going on, the much-anticipated reunion of Django and Broomhilda is lost in the mix. Not even Django's surreptitious trigger finger (whenever she's treated badly) adds worthy suspense, which, during this overlong stint at Candyland, is very much needed.But there's not all downtime at the mansion: a particular Candie lecture involving a slave's skull does successfully perk things up, providing DiCaprio a good five minutes of sheer unapologetic villainy. Then, after a shocking twist, it's Django alone who must save his girl.Jamie Foxx, having played a quietly brooding second fiddle to Waltz so far, makes up for lost time with heated gusto. This third and final act involving a group of Australians being duped by Django, who's learned the art of waxing poetic, is replete with the bare-knuckle action we've anticipated all along: although the large chunks of bloody guts flying off each gunshot victim seems like Tarantino doing an imitation of himself. There are some really neat montage sequences and beautiful locations, but some of the music, especially that of the rap nature, seems too modern for the time portrayed. And the editing feels somewhat limp without QT's longtime collaborator Sally Menke, who died a few years back: Particular flashbacks and hallucinations are often confusing and awkward.A pretty good ride, much better than Quentin's last two films (BASTERDS and DEATH PROOF), yet there needed a much tighter/sharper vehicle for our title hero to deserve the fanfare of the literally explosive finale.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",entertaining mess,modern exploitation guru quentin tarantino serves up historical revenge once again his last film inglourious basterds had german nazis getting theirs now with good german board fact hes villain last film were out set things right american deep south two years shy civil war although first half takes place road texas mississippi as bounty hunting dentist dr king schultz recruits slave named django help him find three outlaw brothers django alone knows their appearance these are more spirited deliciously cutthroat segments as our heroes partner up as django puts it kill white people money christoph waltz schultz jamie foxx django are good team while making mince meat out their targets bloodshed is something marvel but tarantino throws awkward bouts humor derailing intensity moment one particular scene where group rednecks complain about not seeing through masked eyeholes including very distracting cameo by jonah hill feels like mel brooks clumsily intruding sergio leone after django helps schultz with his job its time doctor aid his more than capable partner rescue djangos wife broomhilda who resides at candyland infamous antebellum plantation run by sinister though much too youthful calvin candie while leonardo dicaprio has more than capable acting skills savors gloriously tyrannical racist dialog there could have should have been backstory why owner plantation looks fresh out finishing school man whos supposed have lifetime seething venom oozing his veins those desperately piercing blue eyes seem more confused frustrated than cold calculating making tarantinos purposely overboard racism more crutch than weapon dicaprio character perhaps don johnson who played wily brothel owner previous scene could have taken this role he had age going him with that soulless eyes that look like hes seen been through pretty much everything but leos not alone hes helped along by most wicked uncle toms played by samuel jackson whose spitefully cantankerous stephen figures things out before his boss this is nice role qt stock actor who has sleepwalked through many roles post pulp fiction jackie brown although his feeble mannerisms often slow down performance main problem with unchained is how long tarantino stretches scenes with dialog while actors especially waltz dicaprio have blast with colorful monologues youll often forget there are other characters board most speeches fail serve plot that being duo pretending buy mandingo slave fighters when they really want girl with all deals discussions going much anticipated reunion django broomhilda is lost mix not even djangos surreptitious trigger finger whenever shes treated badly adds worthy suspense which during this overlong stint at candyland is very much needed but theres not all downtime at mansion particular candie lecture involving slaves skull does successfully perk things up providing dicaprio good five minutes sheer unapologetic villainy then after shocking twist its django alone who must save his girl jamie foxx having played quietly brooding second fiddle waltz so far makes up lost time with heated gusto this third final act involving group australians being duped by django whos learned art waxing poetic is replete with bare knuckle action weve anticipated all along although large chunks bloody guts flying off each gunshot victim seems like tarantino doing imitation himself there are some really neat montage sequences beautiful locations but some music especially that rap nature seems too modern time portrayed editing feels somewhat limp without qts longtime collaborator sally menke who died few years back particular flashbacks hallucinations are often confusing awkward pretty good ride much better than quentins last two films basterds death proof yet there needed much tighter sharper vehicle our title hero deserve fanfare literally explosive finale more reviews www cultfilmfreaks com,0.4664544695071011,0.07197660818713453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,"Tarantino is not for every taste, but for lots of blood and interesting story-telling, he can be fun.","This movie is a tribute to the old Western genre, where the gunfighter is on a mission, and it often involves recovering his woman. As the movie begins with sweeping scenes and men on horseback, there is a very forceful song being sung, reminiscent of the ones Frankie Laine did back in the 1950s, for movies such as the original (1957) ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" (1957). Christoph Waltz is dentist Dr. King Schultz, but as we soon learn he hasn't actually practiced dentistry in years, his profession is bounty hunter. After we see him in action, in a slick barroom scene which ends in his shooting a wanted man, he heads for a bigger bounty in Mississippi. The problem is he doesn't know what the men look like, and he figures, correctly, that they have taken assumed names.So he needs help, and he looks for a certain member of a chain gang of slaves. He finds him in Jamie Foxx as Django , ""The 'D' is silent."" Django knows them, but also seeks to be reunited with his wife, who was sold as a slave to a different owner.They eventually find that plantation and slave owner, Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, and his place is called ""Candieland."" The wife of Django is Kerry Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft. (She had been raised by a German, and 'Broomhilda' is a corruption of the fictional German character 'Brunhilda'.) Candie is pretty easily fooled into thinking the two men wanted to buy a mandingo fighter (no real evidence that this sport ever existed) but his old slave Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen suspects something is up and correctly figures out Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the real mission is to take her away. All this results in about the biggest, bloodiest gunfight one will ever see.I will grant that Tarantino's films have their moments, but his insistence on violence and gore surpasses what most viewers welcome in a movie. Even though I knew it was all fake, and over the top, I still cringed. And maybe that is what he wanted the audience to do.",tarantino is not every taste but lots blood interesting story telling he can be fun,this movie is tribute old western genre where gunfighter is mission it often involves recovering his woman as movie begins with sweeping scenes men horseback there is very forceful song being sung reminiscent ones frankie laine did back 1950s movies such as original 1957 3 10 yuma gunfight at o k corral 1957 christoph waltz is dentist dr king schultz but as we soon learn he hasnt actually practiced dentistry years his profession is bounty hunter after we see him action slick barroom scene which ends his shooting wanted man he heads bigger bounty mississippi problem is he doesnt know what men look like he figures correctly that they have taken assumed names so he needs help he looks certain member chain gang slaves he finds him jamie foxx as django d is silent django knows them but also seeks be reunited with his wife who was sold as slave different owner they eventually find that plantation slave owner leonardo dicaprio as calvin candie his place is called candieland wife django is kerry washington as broomhilda von shaft she had been raised by german broomhilda is corruption fictional german character brunhilda candie is pretty easily fooled into thinking two men wanted buy mandingo fighter no real evidence that this sport ever existed but his old slave samuel l jackson as stephen suspects something is up correctly figures out django broomhilda know each other that real mission is take her away all this results about biggest bloodiest gunfight one will ever see i will grant that tarantinos films have their moments but his insistence violence gore surpasses what most viewers welcome movie even though i knew it was all fake over top i still cringed maybe that is what he wanted audience do,0.394991789819376,0.12405582922824304,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,Perfect spaghetti magic,"I'm fascinated by spaghetti westerns. How can Italian directors, many of whom never set foot on American soil, reinvent an entirely foreign genre, that of the Western? How can they take the basics of the John Wayne-style cowboy film and transform it into a world with no morality?All Italian Westerns owe a debt to the films of Sergio Leone. A Fistful of Dollars liberally borrows - steals - from Akita Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Its hero doesn't fight the two gangs in the film one on one in honor bound High Noon-style duels. Instead, Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name uses treachery and deceit to defeat both gangs, which depend on their terrorism of the populace to keep their position. Leone would move past simply remaking other films toward creating his own movies that were ripe for being ripped off.After Leone, arguably the best Italian Westerns came from Sergio Corbucci. The same director who'd go on to direct Bud Spencer and Terence Hill comedies like Super Fuzz was really known for some of the most brutal and violent films in the world, which is saying something, as the Italians do love their blood and gore.His main hero Django, who first appeared in 1966's Django. The character's name is a joke based on the guitarist Django Reinhardt's ability to play guitar despite not being able to use two of his fingers. In the film, the villains destroy Django's hands before he rises up to take them all out. According to Ruggero Deodato, the assistant director of the film, Corbucci also borrowed the idea of a protagonist who dragged a coffin filled with gold and weapons behind him from a comic book that he had read.There would be over thirty sequels to this film, many of which were completely unofficial and many of whom have nothing to do with Django at all, including One Damned Day at Dawn...Django Meets Sartana! Nero would only reprise the role once in 1987's Django Strikes Again, the only official sequel, which was produced with Corbucci's involvement.Throughout the films of Quentin Tarantino, the shadow of Sergio Corbucci looms. In his very first movie, Reservoir Dogs, the scene where Mr. Blonde slices the ear of Nash the cop is completely indebted to Hugo performing the same gory attack to Brother Johnathan. At the end of Kill Bill, Tarantino had a Rest In Peace notice for those actors and directors he saw as his most important influences: Charles Bronson, Lucio Fulci, Sergio Leone, Cheng Cheh, Lo Lieh, Lee Van Cleef, Willian Witney and, of course, Corbucci.Never has that influence been deeper than in this film, an indirect remake and remix of the Spaghetti Western, now back in American hands.In 2007, Tarantino said that he wanted to create a movie that dealt with America's sinful past, but not in a message movie. Instead, he wanted to make ""genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to."" He went on to explain that after starting to write a book about Corbucci, he was intrigued by how his films offered an evil and horrible version of America.There are also allusions to the films Mandingo and the snow scenes of Corbucci's The Great Silence. Even the title itself alludes to the American title of another Corbucci film, Hercules Unchained.The movie begins in Texas in the middle of the 1800s. Ace and Dicky Speck (James Remar and James Russo) are driving black slaves on foot toward an unknown destination. One of them is Django (Jamie Foxx), who has been separated from his wife Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), a house slave raised to speak German and English.Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist/bounty hunter, soon arrives and offers to buy Django to gain his knowledge over three men he has a warrant to bring in dead or alive. Ace tries to shoot him, but Schultz easily kills him and shoots Dicky's horse, leaving him trapped and at the mercy of his now freed slaves.Schultz isn't another slaver. Instead, he offers Django a chance to be a free man and teaches him the career of being a bounty hunter. He's a natural - he's able to pull off incredibly complicated shots with all manner of weapons. As they track the Brittle brothers, they make their way to the plantation of Spencer ""Big Daddy"" Bennett (Don Johnson). While the two men talk, Django finds two of the brothers - Big John and Lil Raj - whipped a slave. As he remembers them doing the same to him, he flies into a rage and murders the two men. The third brother runs but is easily stopped by Schultz.Later that night, Bennett and the local Klan raid the campsite of our heroes, but a combination of poorly made hoods, explosives and skill allow Django and Schultz to escape. Afterward, Schultz relates the German tale of Siegfried and his epic rescue of Broomhilda. Realizing that he has at last met a real hero, Schultz feels honor-bound to help Django reunite with his wife.Some months later, Django and Schultz travel to Mississippi and the Candyland plantation, whose owner Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) now keeps Django's wife. Schultz and Django meet Calvin at a gentleman's club where he stages Mandingo fights and attempts to buy one of his fighters, which is all a ruse so that they may purchase Broomhilda.Over dinner, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort. This makes Calvin's loyal house slave Stephen (Samuel Jackson) suspicious, so the villain changes the deal so that they don't get the fighter, but only the woman. He thinks he's won, when truly our heroes have exactly what they've come for. However, he can't stop lording over Schultz and continually demands that they shake hands. A shootout ensues, with Schultz killing Calvin, Calvin's bodyguard Butch (also James Remar) killing Schultz and Django killing, well, everybody.However, our hero can't stop everybody and is captured, with Stephen forcing his surrender by threatening Broomhilda. Django is nearly castrated by Billy Crash before being sold to the Australian-owned LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, who will soon work him to death.Django soon turns the tables on the mining company's escorts, played by Tarantino, Michael Parks and John Jaratt (Mick Taylor from the Wolf Creek films). He returns to claim Broomhilda's freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, kills every single one of Calvin's slave trackers (Zoe Bell, Michael Bowen, Robert Carradine, Jake Garber, Ted Neeley, James Parks and Tom Savini play the trackers at various points in the film) and then enters Calvin's mansion, where he murders everyone else as they return from the funeral. He saves Stephen for last, shooting him in the kneecaps so that he can't escape the house exploding as our hero rides into the sunset with his wife, or as happens in The Ring of the Nibelung, they renounce the world of the gods and together, they hail light-bringing love and laughing death.Spike Lee said he would not see the film, saying, ""American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them.""Samuel Jackson again defended Tarantino, replying to Vogue Male that ""Django Unchained was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than 12 Years a Slave, but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he's respected for making supposedly art films, it's held in higher esteem than Django, because that was basically a blaxploitation movie.""Since this is a Tarantino film, there are plenty of references to movies within and without the universe of his films. Django and his wife are meant to be the great-great-great-grandparents of the character John Shaft. And of course, Franco Nero shows up in a cameo role that made me raise my arms in triumph. When Tarantino first met him, he astonished the actor by knowing all of the dialogue and words to the songs from his films.There are also appearances by Dukes of Hazzard star Tom Wopat as U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum, Russ and Amber Tamblyn as Son of and Daughter of the Son of a Gunfighter, Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill and Lee Horsely - from The Sword and the Sorcerer - as Sherrif Gus.Happily, this film isn't the end of the story. A comic book sequel to the film, Django/Zorro, is supposedly going to be made into a film. Tarantino has also discussed plans to turn the movie into a longer mini-series, as well as a series of novels. One of those planned novels, Django In White Hell, eventually became The Hateful Eight.",perfect spaghetti magic,im fascinated by spaghetti westerns how can italian directors many whom never set foot
