10.0,An Epic in every sense of the word.,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10",epic every sense word,peter jackson truly outdid himself when creating lord rings fellowship ring he fails disappoint us 2nd part trilogy two towers shows us that he is not one hit wonder like so many directors are i actually think that two towers reaches same level as fellowship ring sometimes even surpasses it this film is biggest film trilogy what do i mean by that well this film has so many things going like amazing battle helms deep frodo sam journey mount doom destroy ring but one whos leading them through way is gollum he looks so creepy realistic that he doesnt feel disconnected us powerful performance by andy serkis as gollum he should been nominated oscar best supporting actor best part film is quite easily everyone knows it ending ending battle helms deep is quite breathtaking as gandalf white comes distance with another army defeat orcs when treebeard his army entz tear down isengard destruction battle is so immense size that you truly have see believe size scale peter jackson has truly redefined word epic he also pays attention small things that truly elevate this movie great amazing i definitely recommend this film everyone but you really should watch first movie truly understand whats going 10 10,0.4700462962962963,0.1960648148148148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Great,"The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.",great,two towers is worth watching just see battle helms deep it is one most impressive battle sequences hit big screen but then theres so much more than that this movie also features amazing special effects with gollum dramatic political tension rohan fantastic moments with ents this is probably my favorite chapter lord rings film trilogy,0.5708791208791208,0.34798534798534797,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,"""There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.""","""The Lord of the Rings"" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy, as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor, Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam (Sean Astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master, particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery, and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in ""The Two Towers""; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though, there was almost a comic element to it, whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film; I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The ""olyphants"" were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs, wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time, and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film, and repeated viewings are helpful, along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie, I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually, the books and the film complement each other nicely, even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that ""The Lord of the Rings"" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time, it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor, loyalty, friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.",theres some good this world mr frodo its worth fighting,lord rings continues its epic quest this second installment trilogy as original fellowship is disbanded its various members must continue good fight while frodo sam pursue their mission mordor pippin merry manage escape uruk hai into fangorn forest their own adventure with ents aragorn legolas gimli traverse riddermark into realm rohan one ring begins deepen its spell over frodo who questions his worthiness stomach mission this facet his character allows sam sean astin portray his devotion loyalty his master particularly when gollum makes his appearance becomes their guide gollums looks are rivaled only by his treachery duality his personality is given emphasis tortured conversations he has with himself i was bit surprised at way gollum was portrayed two towers his cameo appearance first film as slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled tolkiens description corresponded mental image i took away when reading about it at same time though there was almost comic element it whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed menacing but tortured creature even more fantastic creatures find cgi life film i found presentation ents be masterfully done olyphants were neat touch i was happy see them included course orcs wargs uruk hai all personify evil that befalls middle earth this dire time their presence instills fear dread heroes all along way theres lot going film repeated viewings are helpful along with understanding created by reading tolkiens story though not entirely necessary enjoy movie i feel it grounds viewer rich background characters locations actually books film complement each other nicely even though movie necessity must leave out some elements there is no doubt that lord rings has earned its reputation as one greatest epic films all time best fantasy film them all at same time it does wonderful job examining such themes as honor loyalty friendship love as its characters interact with each other find common ground against threat their very existence,0.5529346622369878,0.23255813953488372,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.",they accomplished near impossible,lord rings two towers is another excellent installment thus far excellent trilogy film picks up immediately where fellowship ring left off as elijah wood sean astin continue their long seemingly hopeless journey destroy one ring fires mordor they run into creature gollum played amazingly by andy serkis revolutionary character generation serkis motives are unclear as ring has literally run him insane created split personality that combats characters natural good side meanwhile billy boyd dominic monaghan have escaped dark forces that captured them but now are another dilemma as they try convince forest living moving trees support their cause good truth viggo mortensen orlando bloom john rhys davies receive more help likes bernard hills army his lovely niece mirando otto as all this occurs ian mckellen comes back rehashes role which seemed have expired late first film hugo weaving daughter liv tyler know that victory is not certain realize that they must leave their true homes forever protect themselves lives their people christopher lee continues create chaos with help highly disturbed brad dourif one flew over cuckoos nest fame end not one but two key battles will create sure be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all franchises final installment return king many view two towers as achievement even more impressive than its predecessor true film does go beyond technical faculties fellowship ring but it is hard me pick this installment over first which will likely always be my favorite this film is more intense you get feeling real danger peril throughout while first was more emotional experience due its nice elements friendship love personal sacrifice short lord rings two towers is amazing sequel it fits well with outstanding first film 5 stars out 5,0.6105063492063492,0.23739047619047615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",my personal favourite trilogy,i do love all three films lord rings trilogy all are visually stunning with wonderful music strong narratives two towers is my personal favourite three several reasons one thing it is less talky than fellowship ring pace is little more secure here also final battle is just breathtaking action direction its scope very compelling epic some characters are developed more here than they were fellowship ring primarily frodo aragorn who were played very well there but little bland comparison here when it comes scope two towers is possibly biggest trilogy cinematography is one strongest assets while scenery costumes lighting make up orcs look amazing are all gorgeous you can tell lot effort went into this it showed music is also darker perhaps more complex story is richer compelling dialogue is thought provoking people may disagree but i think two towers is best directed trilogy too acting is very good elijah wood is likable enough with stronger written character while sean astins bumbling persona suits sam really well viggo mortensson is as strong charismatic as ever ian mckellen christopher lee bernard hill are also perfectly cast but real revelation my view with this movie is gollum here gollum is designed superbly andy serkiss performance is absolutely phenomenal oscar nod worthy conclusion fine film me my personal favourite trilogy 10 10 bethany cox,0.5750387596899227,0.33042635658914726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"Absolutely, totally fantastic!","Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir, Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me, he probably is best know for his role as the captain in ""Titanic"" in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum/Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.I've never been really a big fan of the editing of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.A spectacular adventure action experience.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",absolutely totally fantastic,watching this movie is like watching 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence pace is incredibly high alright i have admit that extended edition lord rings two towers takes awful lot this pace away make some scenes unnecessary long scenes with treebeard are also bit dull long but still especially compared first that was just too slow at times this is huge improvement luckily there also are some welcome additions extended edition best addition are scenes with boromir faramir denethor osgiliath there also are some newly great characters actors david wenham is surprisingly talented young actor i think its great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like sean bean bernard hill also impressed me he probably is best know his role as captain titanic which he also already impressed me viggo mortensen probably still is best actor lord rings movies yes sure ian mckellen christopher lee are also more than great but mortensen really puts some passion effort his character i know sean astin is always being praised lot but i seriously dont think that he is such good actor any lord rings movies andy serkis also was really good as gollum sm agol i wouldnt had mind seeing him get oscar nod strange thing is that gimli legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters it was odd see but it works they provide some good comical relief at times most fantastic thing about movie is that its really action filled battle helms deep truly is fantastic see still favorite most powerful moment movie is when ents march war also scenes with riders rohan are true spectacle ive never been really big fan editing lord rings movies this one is no exception problem is that peter jackson shot way too many hours footage with as result that editors have difficulties picking right scenes length them but lord rings two towers is one those movies were pluses make more than up minuses spectacular adventure action experience 10 10,0.5928202947845804,0.3194175170068027,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A standing ovation for all concerned.,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.",standing ovation all concerned,it seems ridiculous want add my own comments slew others that are already imdbs records but i feel like i cannot sleep nor cease throbbing my chest until i release some what i have so recently seen peter jacksons lord rings is one bravest projects ever attempted by filmmaker mr jackson deserves every ovation he will receive every award every bit praise adoration that will be spoken written this second installment story is masterpiece every sense forget your prejudices about books they are another way looking at this beautiful story i know this is slightly against rules but i cannot resist saying that previous writers comment comment that compared lord rings films books difference between romeo juliet screenplay ballet formats was entirely accurate gollum was excellent amalgam so easily could he have been annoying jar jar binks alike instead way that jackson serkis doubtless many many others chose portray cgi incarnation smeagol was incredibly emotive powerful gollum is profoundly disturbing amusing almost lovable not even john ronald reuel himself could induce that range emotions smeagol me truly skin crawling performance by superb brad douris as evil grima wormtongue was just beyond words douris became wormtongue skillful fulfillment what was already inspired casting probably most definitive casting this film though was manchester born bernard hill as theoden king rohan casting two towers makes one shake ones head wonder retrospect whether anyone else could have filled these roles mr hills performance was truly first rate performance which contributed greatly battle helms deep scenes which were spinning tornado emotions viewer viggo mortensen goes strength strength his performance is visceral yet sensitive overriding emotion that tolkiens vision aragorn induced at least me was awe at his heroics mortensens portrayal jacksons frame brings new aspects aragorn character mortensens aragorn is emotionally dextrous go with his physical dexterity he is sensitive seemingly empathic warmer more fundamentally human yet super human presence charisma definitive is not strong enough word if you still view jacksons epic with scepticism i implore you put down your preconceptions your prejudices but most all put down books this is beautiful way see middle earth dont pass it up books are ultimate fantasy epic pictures you draw your head are better than anything you can imagine but lord rings two towers is one wonderful interpretation that epic story go laugh cry sit awe this cinematic treat,0.583170274170274,0.20717171717171717,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Sophomore effort shines as brightly as the first.,"After Fellowship, the world wondered if Peter Jackson could sustain the momentum. The Two Towers is the shortest segment and the story is split into parallel tales. More characters enter the story, including one of the most important. Can Jackson do it? Of course he can.Spoilers: Two Towers sustains the magic of Fellowship, while expanding the scope of the story. Gollum enters the picture, in full view not shadow, and is a triumph to behold.The story cuts back and forth between Merry and Pippin's encounter with Treebeard and the Ents; Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn and their attempts to locate the hobbits and free them; and Sam Frodo and Gollum as they move closer to Mordor. Each aspect is well covered, without losing track of the other story. Rohan provides the setting for the first great battle (aside from the prologue in Fellowship) and what a battle it is. Gandalf returns, much changed from his encounter with the balrog. The evil of Wormtongue appears, and Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer take the stage.There are many great moments, from the mounted battles to Gollum and Smeagol's dialogue, Legolas' surf archery to Theoden's cure. Helm's Deep is a spectacular segment that takes one back to the epic films of the past. Darkness looms for Frodo and Sam, as Frodo slips deeper under the spell of the ring. He finds new, and sometimes strange, allies; as well as new foes. His journey becomes more difficult with each step.The quality of the production continues. The Rohirrum are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost Anglo-Saxons. The battle scenes are engaging and terrifying. War is depicted with all of its consequences. Your heart is torn as you see the young separated from their parents, innocents are killed, and destruction abounds. At the same time, strength and hope come to those in desperate need and courage comes in the unlikeliest of moments. You find yourself in the lowest depths, as all seems lost; and then your heart soars, as hope comes at the last moment. This is storytelling at its finest.This is not a sequel, it is another chapter in an epic saga. As such, it builds on the previous chapter and advances the story. The pace quickens as the conflict rises. The stakes are higher and the danger greater. The audience is on the edge of their seat, as darkness looms, while the threads of hope begin to weave together. The stage is set for the final battle.",sophomore effort shines as brightly as first,after fellowship world wondered if peter jackson could sustain momentum two towers is shortest segment story is split into parallel tales more characters enter story including one most important can jackson do it course he can spoilers two towers sustains magic fellowship while expanding scope story gollum enters picture full view not shadow is triumph behold story cuts back forth between merry pippins encounter with treebeard ents gimli legolas aragorn their attempts locate hobbits free them sam frodo gollum as they move closer mordor each aspect is well covered without losing track other story rohan provides setting first great battle aside prologue fellowship what battle it is gandalf returns much changed his encounter with balrog evil wormtongue appears theoden eowyn eomer take stage there are many great moments mounted battles gollum smeagols dialogue legolas surf archery theodens cure helms deep is spectacular segment that takes one back epic films past darkness looms frodo sam as frodo slips deeper under spell ring he finds new sometimes strange allies as well as new foes his journey becomes more difficult with each step quality production continues rohirrum are sight behold do conjure images lost anglo saxons battle scenes are engaging terrifying war is depicted with all its consequences your heart is torn as you see young separated their parents innocents are killed destruction abounds at same time strength hope come those desperate need courage comes unlikeliest moments you find yourself lowest depths as all seems lost then your heart soars as hope comes at last moment this is storytelling at its finest this is not sequel it is another chapter epic saga as such it builds previous chapter advances story pace quickens as conflict rises stakes are higher danger greater audience is edge their seat as darkness looms while threads hope begin weave together stage is set final battle,0.49895104895104897,0.11233488733488733,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,My precious...,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period. Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie. The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year.

9.0,My Visit To The Cinema,"Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained****** SPOILERS ******I was entertained and more , but I later had some reservations . On a technical level TTT not only does not disappoint but it outdoes FELLOWSHIP in terms of both scope and scale but this doesn`t automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything Hollywood has done , but ironically by concentrating on spectacle TTT feels more like a Hollywood film than FELLOWSHIP . And all this spectacle causes a problem for Peter Jackson - How does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? The simple answer is he can`t ! As several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as Gandalf rides to the rescue of Helms Deep : Cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema , cut to the Ents attacking Isengard and then cut back to Helms Deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat , except they did so mainly off screen . It`s as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . Likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story .Of course you don`t notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at TTT as soon as the credits roll and that`s a lack of an emotional impact . Yes you`ll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you won`t burst into tears . Remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after Gandalf has confronted the Balrog or the departure of Boromir ? Remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? Of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . Unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in TTT . And the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like Boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between , though this is almost certainly the fault of Tolkien rather than Jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . Special mention goes to Andy Serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor , Brad Dourif who plays a very slimy villain , and Bernard Hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played Yosser Hughes in BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF 20 years ago . But I couldn`t help but miss Sean Bean and I suppose casting him as Faramir twin brother of Boromir would have been just too obviousBut despite my criticisms I enjoyed TTT immensely and for three magical hours I forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . No doubt the audience at the Rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . We laughed at the right bits , gasped at the technical achievements , but no one cried which means I can only award THE TWO TOWERS 9 out of 10",my visit cinema,don t you just hate cinemas no matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as events screen 30 seconds before they happen if we re after running commentary we ll buy dvd thank you very much add this unattended mad mental kids running around wild fact many years ago our local newspaper saw no holds barred letter complaint about screening 3 men little lady which referred foul mouthed juvenile delinquents audience top all this i m chainsmoker cinema chains don t allow patrons poison themselves or others with nicotine so as rule i don t visit cinemas but it s rule i broke order see two towers because i was literally dying see it so i booked my ticket well advance premier screening rothesay 26th january popped into cinema that night demanded be entertained spoilers i was entertained more but i later had some reservations technical level ttt not only does not disappoint but it outdoes fellowship terms both scope scale but this doesn t automatically make it as some people have claimed better film battles helms deep isengard are truly breath taking out do anything hollywood has done but ironically by concentrating spectacle ttt feels more like hollywood film than fellowship all this spectacle causes problem peter jackson how does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces simple answer is he can t as several reviewers have mentioned fractured storyline comes rescue director much same way as gandalf rides rescue helms deep cut most breath taking calvary charge history cinema cut ents attacking isengard then cut back helms deep where our heroes have snatched victory jaws defeat except they did so mainly off screen it s as if director has used fractured storyline order get himself out corner likewise reviewers this site have noticed story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing disappearing story course you don t notice these flaws at time due awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at ttt as soon as credits roll that s lack emotional impact yes you ll gasp cheer feel your heart race but you won t burst into tears remember scenes first film where fellowship escape into mountains after gandalf has confronted balrog or departure boromir remember how your throat tightened you nearly had tear run down your face course you do because these two scenes are amongst most moving heart wrenching cinema history unfortunately there is no similar equivalent ttt film also cries out flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like boromir story where everyone is either good or evil no between though this is almost certainly fault tolkien rather than jackson who does manage get best out his cast film lacking character development special mention goes andy serkis who alas seems have missed out nominations best supporting actor brad dourif who plays very slimy villain bernard hill who made me forget that this is same actor who played yosser hughes boys blackstuff 20 years ago but i couldn t help but miss sean bean i suppose casting him as faramir twin brother boromir would have been just too obviousbut despite my criticisms i enjoyed ttt immensely three magical hours i forgot all about my nicotine addiction world outside no doubt audience at rothesay cinema felt same way as me as we watched this film hushed silence we laughed at right bits gasped at technical achievements but no one cried which means i can only award two towers 9 out 10,0.4542588108689805,0.11700430454667744,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"

After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.",magnificent epic,fellowship ring was monumentally entertaining film return king was amazing wrap up epic our times but most dramatic moment me came at end two towers after 3 hours sweeping vistas excellent shakespearean acting otherworldly sights sounds we are treated scene that still sends chills down my back rouses me like nothing since final scene rocky lone rider we all know who set against top hill massing legions horsemen behind him he appears just as heroes are losing all hope once he begins his descent down hill with his army behind him camera begins slow pan over top down with them showing size scale their forces evil army below looks up with surprise bright light fills screen camera focuses lead rider again we all know who who lets out wrenching battle cry music swells unbelievable heights i am swept away like ive never been before this is cinema at its very best,0.5856944444444444,0.15208333333333338,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,Hail The Heroes!,"Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for.

9.0,Tough to put on film but came out very well,"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers).",tough put film but came out very well,long before it came out i knew two towers would be toughest three lord rings books put film not only is it middle child but very structure book makes it hard craft linear story with all plot lines tact interesting but i think peter jackson company did very good job its not as strong as fellowship but is still outstanding all elements lotr films are here beautiful photography set designs costumes scenery special effects all amazing all brilliant all oscar worthy performances are terrific too bernard hill viggo mortensen elijah wood miranda otto all did great jobs supporting actors too it is sad that ian mckellans role is relegated almost cameo status but thats nature book biggest shame is christopher lee he has so little screen time this film i think he only says two or three lines camera rest is brooding such waste he is one great actors our time real joy watch scene stealer boot but stars piece have be gollum treebeard uruk army sequence with ents seeing destruction saruman wrought upon trees brought tears my eyes their revenge brought cheers my voice battle helms deep was probably too long but impressive nonetheless will probably be model epic battle sequences years come gollum what can be said about gollum that hasnt already been said we have entered into new age cgi like all great works art it has human soul great film 9 out 10 only items keeping it getting 10 are short shrifting christopher lee that some parts dont quite flow too well problem rooted jrr tolkiens novel not fault filmmakers,0.6205363155363154,0.2722810445727113,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,"Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!","I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series. Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall, ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie!

10.0,Fantasy greatness with one of the best sieges put on film,"Well, I'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies I've ever seen in my life. And am ever likely TO see in my life. Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render. Plus, Jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming.Where to begin with such a film? The characters, I guess. Jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely, offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama (I was astonished that three hours had passed by the time this was over – it felt more like just one hour). Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents is awe-inspiring stuff. Of course, a walking tree is a hard thing to portray, but with the aid of some outstanding special effects Jackson does it and does it so superbly. Then we have Frodo and Sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts – the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks, and Jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally CGI-created Gollum. Gollum is fantastic, a breath of life straight from the book; Andy Serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed, schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature.The main action, of course, comes from the whole Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline, mixing in plenty of incident and nasty creatures along the way. The bear-like Whargs are violent and unpleasant; the Oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the Nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. Visually, the film is always spectacular, splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied New Zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. Howard Shore's sweeping score is better than before and highlights the evocative nature of the movie, often threatening to overwhelm us with the sheer wonder of it all. This IS Tolkien.Of course, the movie finishes off with the battle of Helm's Deep, a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction, explosions, mayhem and might. It's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). I'll confess that I was close to tears at a couple of points – the white light streaming onto the battlefield, the breaking of the dam at Isengard – these flawless moments just choked me up and made me glad to be able to appreciate the true wonder of cinema. The cast is flawless – exemplary performances from the recurring cast members, kudos to newcomers Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban, and especial mention to Bernard Hill. Nothing more can be said. A modern classic I'm only too privileged to have seen on its opening night.",fantasy greatness with one best sieges put film,well ill be darned if this isnt one best epic movies ive ever seen my life am ever likely see my life following footsteps fellowship ring peter jacksons second instalment trilogy ups ante tenfold offering one amazing movie packed with heart action romance dazzling effects brilliant characters thankfully free time consuming introduction needed begin first part tolkiens trilogy jackson now has time focus developing characters perilous quests course out out action im action lover at heart so i was seventh heaven watching this movie everything you could want second book is here up screen even more amazing than tolkien could render plus jackson has done his magic inserted few memorable scenes his own so there are plenty surprises even those who know whats coming where begin with such film characters i guess jackson takes option cross cutting repeatedly between three different sets principal characters his method pays off nicely offering well rounded film that never lets up with drama i was astonished that three hours had passed by time this was over it felt more like just one hour merry pippins encounter with ents is awe inspiring stuff course walking tree is hard thing portray but with aid some outstanding special effects jackson does it does it so superbly then we have frodo sam crossing dead marshes complete with creepy corpse ghosts horror imagery is strong this movie folks jackson doesnt skimp splatter either meeting up with totally cgi created gollum gollum is fantastic breath life straight book andy serkis does wonders with his voice movements helps craft flawed schizophrenic psychology ugly but hugely sympathetic creature main action course comes whole aragorn legolas gimli storyline mixing plenty incident nasty creatures along way bear like whargs are violent unpleasant oliphants are amusing breathtaking equal measure nazgul their winged demons are fantastic behold visually film is always spectacular splendid sweeping it makes even better use varied new zealand countryside than last film which is no mean feat howard shores sweeping score is better than before highlights evocative nature movie often threatening overwhelm us with sheer wonder it all this is tolkien course movie finishes off with battle helms deep forty minute non stop barrage carnage destruction explosions mayhem might its easily one best battles ever put film special effects are entirely convincing as they are throughout ill confess that i was close tears at couple points white light streaming onto battlefield breaking dam at isengard these flawless moments just choked me up made me glad be able appreciate true wonder cinema cast is flawless exemplary performances recurring cast members kudos newcomers brad dourif miranda otto karl urban especial mention bernard hill nothing more can be said modern classic im only too privileged have seen its opening night,0.6167904491341989,0.23435707521645027,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,The Sequel That Dwarfs Its Predecessor...,"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was a fantastic start to Tolkien's epic tale. The only true weakness of The Two Towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child, in that it has no beginning and no end. Though it starts out where the first ended, The Two Towers begins with a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the Mines of Moria.The acting is just as great as the first, and with the addition of new characters, the film's atmosphere has gone from ""new and wondrous"" to ""grim and hopeless"". Needless to say, Andy Serkis as Gollum is one of the best performances of the new decade. Bernard Hill does a wonderful job as Theoden, as well as Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Karl Urban is a nice choice as Eomer, nephew of the king. Possibly the best of the new characters is Faramir, played by David Wenham. Unlike the passive-type as portrayed in the books, this Faramir is more troubled and only corruptible by the Ring because of his desire to be accepted by his close-minded father -- a nice change made by the writers. The character Treebeard is a reflection of the greatness of the CG work on Gollum; both are exquisite.The writing and directing equals The Fellowship of the Ring, in that the continuity remains, never feeling like we missed any key moments in the plot. The only real flaw, which is mainly due to pacing and events leading up to The Return of the King, is the vast expansion of Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor, aided by the insidious Gollum. The changes and omissions were once again necessary to provide a decent pace and focus on the ever-rising tension of what all leads up to: the battle at Helm's Deep. Yet, with the massive battle near the final 30-40 minutes of the film, there's plenty more to keep a viewer attached to the screen.Fully seeing the MASSIVE software at work, the special effects incorporated with the miniatures/bigatures still dazzle the eyes in flawless execution, as 10,000 Uruk-hai soldiers lay siege to a seemingly impenetrable fortress. From the Mumakil (elephants) to the Fell Beasts upon which the Ringwraiths ride, we are given the introduction of creatures that play major roles in the following film.Howard Shore's evolution with the leitmotifs he created from the first film have now been shifted towards a more explosive composition. Equaling The Fellowship of the Ring, the music for The Two Towers is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the theme of Rohan to the thundering might of Isengard, The Two Towers is full of rousing composition. There's also beautiful moments between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as some wonderful choral work for the last march of the Ents.Overall, while different from the text in terms of time-line, The Two Towers is an extraordinary sequel to a ""trilogy"" destined for greatness. While the film ends before the events in Shelob's tunnel, there's no doubt one will be amazed in what is to come.

9.0,The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.",battle middle earth is about begin,peter jackson himself has admitted two towers was hardest part trilogy achieve at least terms narrative structure since unlike fellowship ring it has no proper beginning no emotionally packed climax boromirs death fellowship was one that films most moving moments it picks up exactly where its predecessor ended fellowship is split three separate groups all with their own problems take care frodo elijah wood sam sean astin continue their journey mordor order destroy one ring find unexpected guide that items previous owner vicious creature gollum andy serkis aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom gimli john rhys davies reunite with reborn gandalf ian mckellen save dying kingdom rohan sarumans christopher lee evil clutch merry dominic monaghan pippin billy boyd have close encounter with ents ancient creatures which have unfinished business with certain bad wizard this second opus is less talking more fighting key characters are reduced cameos most notably galadriel new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles culminating 40 minute long combat at helms deep quite simply movies highlight if however you want more insight characters their motivations get extended cut whose additional sequences are essential understand pivotal moments third film helms deep aside movies most remarkable element is mad schizophrenic gollum hes got ambiguity unreliability written all over him as we see him struggle with his two personas one good fella he once was other filthy treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his preccciousssss back conversation between two personalities is one most beautiful scenes ever made he makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture has us thinking worst may happen return king not as good as previous part at least theatrical version which i rate 9 10 but still really good fantasy movie one best pictures 2002,0.49549567099567116,0.1066796536796537,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,If there was a spotlight for all time movie reviews it would be this trilogy-to-be-one film,I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that),if there was spotlight all time movie reviews it would be this trilogy be one film,i have say this film starting with fellowship was incredibly well made i know titanic received 11 awards but i think this whole trilogy should receive 15 this intro trilogy was extremely depth even had best prologue ever i enjoy being introduced characters thier origins learning about history one ring how it does evil upon middle earth even after saurons death be patient with action as is picks up as trilogys story unfolds it all depends what you see movies but this whole trilogy has quite bit everything that alone surpasses all movies 10 10 actually more than that,0.47272727272727266,0.19772727272727272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,The Greatest of the Three Rings,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for",greatest three rings,yes its true return king may have won more oscars as culmination peter jacksons magnificent cinematic achievement but history will fact adjudge two towers as greatest three rings if fellowship was road movie rotk was friendship film then two towers is unadulterated war movie heroic proportions peter jackson said he based it zulu we can see why it has dramatic intensity flow which none other films quite share good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers them ttt also has best score howard shore has produced it has best dialogue screenplay explains with barely disguised contemporary resonance what we are protecting western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish destroy it when sam tells frodo that there are some things worth fighting when merry tells pippin that there wont be shire unless they do something about it when king theoden laments that sun has gone down west this film could be entitled not two towers but twin towers it is miltonic its scope it is cinema as art yes one may quibble about certain entish details i know that elves werent supposed be at helms deem that faramir is little undeveloped but does this matter not at all extended version is better than original but does not need make such quantum leap as fellowship managed with its ee however it will be film that is seen as landmark cinema trilogy which may never be bettered reminder what we are all here,0.5135378510378511,0.2703678266178266,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,The Definition of Epic!,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a ripping roaring success. It's in the company of Great sequels that manage to match the original film in nearly every way. it doesn't quite have the narrative focus the Fellowship of the Ring has but it more than matches it in overall quality. The Film delves much deeper into the Lore of Middle Earth than the original film and adds a host of welcome additions to the awesome roster of characters. In short it's pretty much everything you can ever want and more.As reward for the abrupt ending of the original film The Two Towers picks up right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. Our heroes are divided and the narrative continuously switches back and forth between multiple storylines occurring simultaneously. For starters we have Frodo and Sam on the most important quest. The Ring bearer must still journey to Mordor and cast The Ring into the fiery pit of Mount doom but they are accompanied by a new companion. The creature Gollum acts as a guide for the two Hobbits and imparts his knowledge of The Dark Lord's minions. He is a vital part of the puzzle but one with a nefarious purpose and an unhealthy obsession with the Ring, one that will lead to his downfall.The Other primary story follows the remaining members of the Fellowship as they respond to the evil that has come to the great Kingdom of Rohan. We follow Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they grow closer to one another and their friendship tightens. It's not long until they are joined by a revived Gandalf who rides to the aid of King Théoden of Rohan. It is here where the subtitle of the movie is established. The Two Towers refers to the union and alliance between Sauron and Saruman. Between the evil forces of Mordor and Isengard. Saruman sends a Seemingly unstoppable army of ten thousand against The army of Rohan and the suspense builds, keeping the audiences glued to their seats until we arrive at the Battle for Helms Deep at the last half hour of the film one of the greatest War sequences in the history of cinema by far! Overall this is an Excellent movie that's almost neck and neck with the first film. The cast is once again perfect and the new additions to the roster are seamlessly interwoven in the narrative. Bernard Hill is nothing short of sublime as King Théoden. The scene when he breaks into pieces and cries over his son's death should have gotten him an Oscar Nom alone! A riveting performances! Miranda Otto is also rather stellar as The King's niece Eowyn and the affection and almost child like crush that she develops for Aragorn is very believable, tender and a sharp rival to the rich chemistry He has for lady Arwen who makes a brief return as well. Andy Serkis as Gollum was a scene stealer and most definitely was robbed of an Oscar as well. Absolutely love his character, Brilliant, Naïve and impulsive to a fault, this character has more dimension than what you can shake your staff at. He's learned and has an almost unlimited supply of knowledge though his mind is scrambled and poisoned by the ring, he's tender at times, vicious and duplicitous during others, playful and humorous yet frightening. Sinister and hideous while also being sympathetic. What Peter Jackson and company have achieved with this character is nothing short of remarkable. He is the perfect Anti Hero for a time and is only more believable as a full on 3D Villain by the reveal at the tail end of the film. There is nothing I can truly say to you that really does this character justice.This film is as relevant today as it was when it was released. Some of the most important lessons and themes about our world are discussed here. From the nature of Evil, addiction, Greed and corruption, the nature of Warfare. Hope in the face of insurmountable odds. The arc with Treebeard and the Ents is Great as well and is a poignant metaphor for nature vs industry. The scene when The Ents along with the brave Hobbits Merry and Pippin overtake Saruman's fortress is Inspiring as is the ending with Gandalf, Eomer and the Return of the Rohirram, saving Aragorn and ending the battle for Helms deep at the last minute. Sam's final Speech to Frodo about the good of this world being something worth fighting for ties all of the threads of the story in a neat little bow as does his proclaimation that their story may be one of the great stories that people will tell their children in years past. All in all The Two Towers is an instant classic and one that will leave audiences eager for the final chapter of this legendary trilogy",definition epic,lord rings two towers is ripping roaring success its company great sequels that manage match original film nearly every way it doesnt quite have narrative focus fellowship ring has but it more than matches it overall quality film delves much deeper into lore middle earth than original film adds host welcome additions awesome roster characters short its pretty much everything you can ever want more as reward abrupt ending original film two towers picks up right where fellowship ring left off our heroes are divided narrative continuously switches back forth between multiple storylines occurring simultaneously starters we have frodo sam most important quest ring bearer must still journey mordor cast ring into fiery pit mount doom but they are accompanied by new companion creature gollum acts as guide two hobbits imparts his knowledge dark lords minions he is vital part puzzle but one with nefarious purpose unhealthy obsession with ring one that will lead his downfall other primary story follows remaining members fellowship as they respond evil that has come great kingdom rohan we follow aragorn legolas gimli as they grow closer one another their friendship tightens its not long until they are joined by revived gandalf who rides aid king th oden rohan it is here where subtitle movie is established two towers refers union alliance between sauron saruman between evil forces mordor isengard saruman sends seemingly unstoppable army ten thousand against army rohan suspense builds keeping audiences glued their seats until we arrive at battle helms deep at last half hour film one greatest war sequences history cinema by far overall this is excellent movie thats almost neck neck with first film cast is once again perfect new additions roster are seamlessly interwoven narrative bernard hill is nothing short sublime as king th oden scene when he breaks into pieces cries over his sons death should have gotten him oscar nom alone riveting performances miranda otto is also rather stellar as kings niece eowyn affection almost child like crush that she develops aragorn is very believable tender sharp rival rich chemistry he has lady arwen who makes brief return as well andy serkis as gollum was scene stealer most definitely was robbed oscar as well absolutely love his character brilliant na ve impulsive fault this character has more dimension than what you can shake your staff at hes learned has almost unlimited supply knowledge though his mind is scrambled poisoned by ring hes tender at times vicious duplicitous during others playful humorous yet frightening sinister hideous while also being sympathetic what peter jackson company have achieved with this character is nothing short remarkable he is perfect anti hero time is only more believable as full 3d villain by reveal at tail end film there is nothing i can truly say you that really does this character justice this film is as relevant today as it was when it was released some most important lessons themes about our world are discussed here nature evil addiction greed corruption nature warfare hope face insurmountable odds arc with treebeard ents is great as well is poignant metaphor nature vs industry scene when ents along with brave hobbits merry pippin overtake sarumans fortress is inspiring as is ending with gandalf eomer return rohirram saving aragorn ending battle helms deep at last minute sams final speech frodo about good this world being something worth fighting ties all threads story neat little bow as does his proclaimation that their story may be one great stories that people will tell their children years past all all two towers is instant classic one that will leave audiences eager final chapter this legendary trilogy,0.5826352219209362,0.2244059511916655,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,The Best of 2002!!!! Another masterpiece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy!!!,"The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS, BABY!!!!!!!!!10/10!!! Highly Recommend!!!

10.0,The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films",two towers what is it answer is my precious,second part lord rings saga maintains style momentum integrity that made first film as brilliant as it is thus what peter jackson gives us is one best sequels ever certainly best film 2002 i prefer first film being closer book but i completely understand changes made book film i see why they are necessary keep films narrative flowing instead dropping dead film is not without few weaknesses mainly because it being middle part linking fellowship ring return king therefore not having obvious beginning or end this doesnt stop film being experience that people shouldnt be cheated out acting is like first film very good at times even brilliant viggo mortensen improves greatly provides more well rounded believable aragorn proves his qualities as actor especially quit moments which there are too few theatrical release this was remedied extended cut also elijah wood deepens his character considerably shows many darker sides his character film this provides some interesting exchanges between wood his faithful companion played by sean astin bernard hill is introduced this film along with method actor brad dourif both aforementioned are excellent their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies hills character compared character book these changes were obviously made dramatic purposes are very plausible ian mckellens character gandalf has been somewhat reduced second film but instead he steals every scene he is likewise hugo weavings character has been reduced but he is still very good keeps his character same style as first film orlando bloom john rhys davies returns as well i have comment choice make gimli into comic relief because while i understand necessity given that dominic monaghans billy boyds characters have taken turn towards more serious characters there had be someone relieve dramatic tension i found it shame that gimli had been reduced some bumbling clown fortunately most his comic remarks worked among other characters introduced are faramir played by david wenham gollum played beautifully by andy serkis ill get back faramir but now i have comment gollum gollum is quite simply most interesting film character last decade this relates both ground breaking special effects but also serkis performance which was most unfairly not deemed fit oscar nomination overall acting is excellent like first film all actors manages develop their characters ways that are at very least acceptable effects fight scenes this second film are among best ever is perhaps only bested by some effects third film series gollum character battle helms deep seem be excellent examples gollum is quite simply most stunning beautifully created cgi character all time he displays extraordinary emotional range as previously stated battle helms deep is among finest battle scenes ever created well paced choreographed above all editing between hectic battle sequences scared citizens provides some emotional depth as well something that was sorely needed battle sequences star wars episode ii this gigantic battle isnt only battle film there are many other interesting battles but im not going spoil them so youll just have see film yourself battles are consistent with style that was laid down first film they are simply much more epic scale some people have raved that changes made book film were too radical but i completely understand condone reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes especially david wenhams character has been criticized after watching it first time i was bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it changes character were at very least essential maintain narrative structure there are other examples but it would really be pointless mention them because reason is exactly same as case david wenhams character dramatic purposes overall two towers serves as excellent link between fellowship ring return king it deserves every bit praise coming it one very best films all time 10 10 my top 10 best films,0.4721978626434072,0.22656687097281153,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
