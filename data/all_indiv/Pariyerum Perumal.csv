10.0,The dark underbelly- Casteism,"Something we don't notice in our daily civil life, something we get to see only if the situation arises or if you live in a caste infested area. Amazing how this movie brings it out in the open, compel us to think and also keeps us engaged throughout. The story is not complex, yet it brings you to the edge of your seat at moments. It is filled with symbolism, especially a scene where it symbolizes that casteism commits suicide. Beautiful. It doesn't show oppression solely by creating sympathy and showing the oppressed class getting further and further oppressed unlike in some movies. You feel for the hero, you're with him and cheer for him. Overall, it's an important part of movie history about casteism.",dark underbelly casteism,something we dont notice our daily civil life something we get see only if situation arises or if you live caste infested area amazing how this movie brings it out open compel us think also keeps us engaged throughout story is not complex yet it brings you edge your seat at moments it is filled with symbolism especially scene where it symbolizes that casteism commits suicide beautiful it doesnt show oppression solely by creating sympathy showing oppressed class getting further further oppressed unlike some movies you feel hero youre with him cheer him overall its important part movie history about casteism,0.6142857142857142,0.17045454545454544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9.0,A riveting piece of cinema that enthralls you throughout,"This is one of the best Tamil movies in recent times, and is worth every praise that's coming its way.I watched this movie with no idea of what it was about or what to expect. Right from the first frame, the movie looked different, and by the time the first song played out, I was rubbing my hands in anticipation of something out of the ordinary. This movie grabs you by the scruff of your neck, shakes you out of your slumber, and keeps you rooting for the protagonist throughout the run-time. Your soul cries when he is hurt. Your mind gets angry when he is angry. And then, your heart aches when he bears all the torment single handedly, before his spirit gives him enough courage to stand up and fight for what is rightfully his.The fact that there is a very strong message of how casteism maims and kills humanity - literally and in spirit - is brought out inherently, and yet very strongly.Pariyerum Perumal also straddles the line dividing art-house and mainstream cinema without resorting to any formulaic solutions. Direction is top notch, as is the screenplay and editing. The songs are out of the ordinary, and downright wacky at times! It adds to what is already a good movie, making it even better. Art direction and cinematography is again beautiful and brings out the drama on screen very effectively. The production team has used colors and symbolism to match the story intrinsically. The role of Karuppi, the dog, as the flesh-and-spirit companion and metaphor for the hero is commendable.Kathir, as the protagonist, has done a stellar job and is well supported by all the other actors. Marimuthu, Lijeesh, Karate Venkatesan, Anthony Dasan, and others have all played their roles very well, and Yogi Babu adds a comic touch to the proceedings without the comedy track being any way detrimental to the story-telling.The one possible sore point to bring out is the portrayal of the female lead as someone who is very sweet and innocent and is kept completely isolated from all the raging violence and caste oppression. However, that portrayal forms the very basis of the story-line and gels well in the story. In her own way, the heroine is true to her heart and stands up for her beliefs without fear of ostracization or retribution, albeit in innocence. Also, without giving away too much in terms of a spoiler, the Director does not paint every character from the upper caste as being inhumane.This movie is as much about oppression as it is about optimism. Add this movie in your watch-list as a must-see.",riveting piece cinema that enthralls you throughout,this is one best tamil movies recent times is worth every praise thats coming its way i watched this movie with no idea what it was about or what expect right first frame movie looked different by time first song played out i was rubbing my hands anticipation something out ordinary this movie grabs you by scruff your neck shakes you out your slumber keeps you rooting protagonist throughout run time your soul cries when he is hurt your mind gets angry when he is angry then your heart aches when he bears all torment single handedly before his spirit gives him enough courage stand up fight what is rightfully his fact that there is very strong message how casteism maims kills humanity literally spirit is brought out inherently yet very strongly pariyerum perumal also straddles line dividing art house mainstream cinema without resorting any formulaic solutions direction is top notch as is screenplay editing songs are out ordinary downright wacky at times it adds what is already good movie making it even better art direction cinematography is again beautiful brings out drama screen very effectively production team has used colors symbolism match story intrinsically role karuppi dog as flesh spirit companion metaphor hero is commendable kathir as protagonist has done stellar job is well supported by all other actors marimuthu lijeesh karate venkatesan anthony dasan others have all played their roles very well yogi babu adds comic touch proceedings without comedy track being any way detrimental story telling one possible sore point bring out is portrayal female lead as someone who is very sweet innocent is kept completely isolated all raging violence caste oppression however that portrayal forms very basis story line gels well story her own way heroine is true her heart stands up her beliefs without fear ostracization or retribution albeit innocence also without giving away too much terms spoiler director does not paint every character upper caste as being inhumane this movie is as much about oppression as it is about optimism add this movie your watch list as must see,0.5502564102564101,0.2115628815628815,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8.0,Tamil Cinema is BLESSED to have such a Socially Powerful Classic film.,"Pariyerum Perumal (2018) : Brief Review -Tamil Cinema is BLESSED to have such a Socially Powerful Classic film. I remember watching Nagraj Manjule's ""Fandry"" for throwing a stone at many issues of the society and then ""Sairat"" for stunning classification of Honour Killing and Casteism. The reason i mentioned these two films is that i have not seen many filmmakers trying to make such cinema in all realiatic manners to showcase brutal reality from lower areas and try to stop it somehow by sending a tight slap through cinematic medium. Finally my wait seems to be ended with Pariyerum Perumal and if i can say so then this is an Intermediate version of those two films yet finding complete originality and credibility of it's own storyline. The film has a heartbreaking and disturbing concept causing anxiety towards how lower cast people bear so much humiliation and torture afterall. A law student from a lower caste begins a friendship with his classmate, a girl who belongs to a higher caste, and the men in her family start giving him trouble over this. This might seem highly repetitive concept but wait.. you have different problems, different conflicts, different issues and different society here to deal with so please try finding something new in it because it is there only somewhere hidden in small small nuances. I literally broke down while watching couple of scenes and some scenes made me jump out from my seat. I mean, it was so connective subject to any common man unless you belong to those evil tribe of inhuman creatures. Acting, writing, cinematography, dialogues, background score, lyrics, direction and overall presentation everything is top class here. I have no complaints to make except for the predictable positive climax being too generous. I think there could have been something stunning, sensational and mind shattering in the final scene which might have left our brain thinking over it for sometime. Rest, it's a Top Quality Classic from Tamil Cinema, yes the same industry who make cheap films in mainstream orientation.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",tamil cinema is blessed have such socially powerful classic film,pariyerum perumal 2018 brief review tamil cinema is blessed have such socially powerful classic film i remember watching nagraj manjules fandry throwing stone at many issues society then sairat stunning classification honour killing casteism reason i mentioned these two films is that i have not seen many filmmakers trying make such cinema all realiatic manners showcase brutal reality lower areas try stop it somehow by sending tight slap through cinematic medium finally my wait seems be ended with pariyerum perumal if i can say so then this is intermediate version those two films yet finding complete originality credibility its own storyline film has heartbreaking disturbing concept causing anxiety towards how lower cast people bear so much humiliation torture afterall law student lower caste begins friendship with his classmate girl who belongs higher caste men her family start giving him trouble over this this might seem highly repetitive concept but wait you have different problems different conflicts different issues different society here deal with so please try finding something new it because it is there only somewhere hidden small small nuances i literally broke down while watching couple scenes some scenes made me jump out my seat i mean it was so connective subject any common man unless you belong those evil tribe inhuman creatures acting writing cinematography dialogues background score lyrics direction overall presentation everything is top class here i have no complaints make except predictable positive climax being too generous i think there could have been something stunning sensational mind shattering final scene which might have left our brain thinking over it sometime rest its top quality classic tamil cinema yes same industry who make cheap films mainstream orientation rating 8 10 by,0.5204850988014252,0.03827230026209618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.15}"

10.0,"Caste, honour, relationship","In paper, this is a simple love story that shows the side of caste-based honour killings happening in India, but the way it is presented is just mindblowing. The film always looks grounded in reality yet the stylised songs, which are brilliantly shot with hard-hitting and to a point expository lyrics and the music that makes you feel the power of it, feels right with the rest of the film. The way the issue of caste is shown is also in a much fluid manner that defies any preachiness. Above all the violence and hopelessness shown in the film it still tries to end with a ray of hope about defining relationships and talking about what you want without any constraints but with an ironic tone. The last shot of the tea glasses is such a perfect ending that shows what is still left in this society, what defines people's lives here. Caste-based love stories or that which include honour killings have come before but the way this film deals with each and every aspect of the story, characters and technical side is unique. For a relatively simple storyline, in the 2.5 hours runtime there wasn't even a second that felt overlong, in fact, I would have loved to see more of it.",caste honour relationship,paper this is simple love story that shows side caste based honour killings happening india but way it is presented is just mindblowing film always looks grounded reality yet stylised songs which are brilliantly shot with hard hitting point expository lyrics music that makes you feel power it feels right with rest film way issue caste is shown is also much fluid manner that defies any preachiness above all violence hopelessness shown film it still tries end with ray hope about defining relationships talking about what you want without any constraints but with ironic tone last shot tea glasses is such perfect ending that shows what is still left this society what defines peoples lives here caste based love stories or that which include honour killings have come before but way this film deals with each every aspect story characters technical side is unique relatively simple storyline 2 5 hours runtime there wasnt even second that felt overlong fact i would have loved see more it,0.4729166666666667,0.22845238095238093,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,Best film in Indian Cinema,"Pariyerum Perumal, by the young filmmaker Mari Selvaraj, is one of the best Tamil films about caste discrimination and the suffering of the oppressed. This is highlighted because it is not a preaching and the filmmaker did not trust the message in his face. Mari Selvaraj has visibly described the cruel practice that exists in society and has let the public make the final decision. The film begins with a group of young people from the oppressed community who move around a pond in the village after another gang of the upper caste has approached the same place. A member of the oppressed community said that they should fight hard against the opposite side, but his friend said that nothing would change until they stop working under the superior caste. Then, we witness the brutal murder of Karuppi (dog) Pariyerum Perumal (Kathir), who belongs to the lower caste. Later, we learned that the director Mari Selvaraj establishes an analogy between Karuppu and Pariyerum Perumal. If Kathir's character has been represented as the face of all the youngsters from the oppressed community, there is an old man who executes honor killings as suicides and deaths, he has been portrayed as the face of the heartless animals in the society. Kathir has given his heart and soul to the film, some of the scenes where he gets beat up look very real. There are scenes where Kathir addresses important topics on oppression but it doesn't sound preachy mainly because of his realistic performance and solid writing of Mari Selvaraj. Anandhi looks pretty and homely as a small town girl, there is a brilliant emotional scene in the pre-climax where she scores extremely well as a solid performer. The old man who comes as the pride upper caste guy who converts honor killings as murders and suicides is menacing and create shivering moments. There are many shock values in Pariyerum Perumal, the death of the dog, the scene where Kathir gets beaten up and the revelation of his dad.",best film indian cinema,pariyerum perumal by young filmmaker mari selvaraj is one best tamil films about caste discrimination suffering oppressed this is highlighted because it is not preaching filmmaker did not trust message his face mari selvaraj has visibly described cruel practice that exists society has let public make final decision film begins with group young people oppressed community who move around pond village after another gang upper caste has approached same place member oppressed community said that they should fight hard against opposite side but his friend said that nothing would change until they stop working under superior caste then we witness brutal murder karuppi dog pariyerum perumal kathir who belongs lower caste later we learned that director mari selvaraj establishes analogy between karuppu pariyerum perumal if kathirs character has been represented as face all youngsters oppressed community there is old man who executes honor killings as suicides deaths he has been portrayed as face heartless animals society kathir has given his heart soul film some scenes where he gets beat up look very real there are scenes where kathir addresses important topics oppression but it doesnt sound preachy mainly because his realistic performance solid writing mari selvaraj anandhi looks pretty homely as small town girl there is brilliant emotional scene pre climax where she scores extremely well as solid performer old man who comes as pride upper caste guy who converts honor killings as murders suicides is menacing create shivering moments there are many shock values pariyerum perumal death dog scene where kathir gets beaten up revelation his dad,0.46687500000000004,0.07505208333333332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"

,Naan yaar,"Right from the beginning, with the fantastic+true tagline that the film tries to engage with in each sequence, followed by the dog sequences (including the fantastic Santhosh Naryanan track, Karuppi), this one grips the audience right until the last frame, in such a way that the best viewing experience (aside from watching it on a large screen) is in 1 sitting.It would be juvenile, nee, unfair, to dismiss this as just another love story (which many have already done), but I think this is much, much more, even perhaps what something like 'Sairat' aspired for.All performances are fantastic, aided in no small part by the fantastic characterization (they are not commercial flick staples) given to them by writer+director Mari Selvaraj (though one can also argue that this one's a quintessential Pa Ranjith flick, which is always a welcome thing). I also found the reveal about a key character in the 2nd half to be very well done (a preview of sorts is given in the track 'Naan Yaar'), and the movie is full of such moments (the 'devathai' conceit, to think of another similar example).Almost all tracks by SanNar (the aforementioned Karuppi, Potta Kaatil Poovaasam and Naan Yaar) are timely, and as is usual with SanNar tracks, contextual+memorable (tho 'Naan Yaar' might be disturbing for some, and in hindsight, even what is picturized around the dog)...And, to me, the most meaningful twist was in 1 character talking about truth and honesty, but (nobly, in hindsight) while not adhering to it in key sequences, with many key characters, for a larger goal, which kinda smacked of something bigger (something, to be fair, one can see coming), among the other rewarding twists/turns from the viewing experience.1 of the best in 2018, this is to be savored.",naan yaar,right beginning with fantastic true tagline that film tries engage with each sequence followed by dog sequences including fantastic santhosh naryanan track karuppi this one grips audience right until last frame such way that best viewing experience aside watching it large screen is 1 sitting it would be juvenile nee unfair dismiss this as just another love story which many have already done but i think this is much much more even perhaps what something like sairat aspired all performances are fantastic aided no small part by fantastic characterization they are not commercial flick staples given them by writer director mari selvaraj though one can also argue that this ones quintessential pa ranjith flick which is always welcome thing i also found reveal about key character 2nd half be very well done preview sorts is given track naan yaar movie is full such moments devathai conceit think another similar example almost all tracks by sannar aforementioned karuppi potta kaatil poovaasam naan yaar are timely as is usual with sannar tracks contextual memorable tho naan yaar might be disturbing some hindsight even what is picturized around dog me most meaningful twist was 1 character talking about truth honesty but nobly hindsight while not adhering it key sequences with many key characters larger goal which kinda smacked something bigger something be fair one can see coming among other rewarding twists turns viewing experience 1 best 2018 this is be savored,0.5606589147286822,0.2236987818383167,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,A war cry against casteism,"Prima facie, because of the IMDb summary, the viewer may end up believing that he is about to see another _Sairat_, story of intercaste love leading to _honor killings_. But the summary does no justice to this.It is a gavel designed to bludgeon societal assumptions about what you can and cannot do, basis the place or the background that you belong to. It is a war cry to never let go of your dreams and ideas.And it contains some of the most vividly disturbing scenes of recent times. These are not especially gory. But, the casual brutality that people indulge in, in the name of caste pride is shown in all its rawness and it is meant to shake you to your insides, which it successfully does.I couldn't make out the original words but the music and the songs , in their translation , are bold and thought provoking.It is *number 2* on the list of Indian films on IMDb. That may be a function of the fan boys ratings but it is truly special. It seems auto biographical at times and would stun you with its directness.The directors next, _Karnan_, is even better.Very highly recommended.",war cry against casteism,prima facie because imdb summary viewer may end up believing that he is about see another sairat story intercaste love leading honor killings but summary does no justice this it is gavel designed bludgeon societal assumptions about what you can cannot do basis place or background that you belong it is war cry never let go your dreams ideas it contains some most vividly disturbing scenes recent times these are not especially gory but casual brutality that people indulge name caste pride is shown all its rawness it is meant shake you your insides which it successfully does i couldnt make out original words but music songs their translation are bold thought provoking it is number 2 list indian films imdb that may be function fan boys ratings but it is truly special it seems auto biographical at times would stun you with its directness directors next karnan is even better very highly recommended,0.588981684981685,0.20372893772893777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.28}"
