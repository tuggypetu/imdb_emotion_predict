,The film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time,"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films, The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or, if it doesn't, the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy, but don't expect punchlines, gags, jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling. The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro, J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",film with highest rewatchability factor all time,its actually kind hard describe this movie whats so great about it people who dont already know it love it as with many cult films big lebowski will either speak you which case you will become fervent follower his dudeness abide by his code rest your life or if it doesnt film will either leave you completely indifferent or youll even downright hate it i believe its very funny film im sure it can be rightfully called comedy but dont expect punchlines gags jokes or slapstick its not that kind comedy if you want enjoy this film you have meet jeffery dude lebowski his terms hang out with him his bowling buddies follow them at their perhaps somewhat leisurely pace through this weird unbelievable tale about nihilism theft car more importantly creedence clearwater revival tape kidnapping abstract art porn course bowling story is actually kind simple you see some no good german nihilists urinated dudes rug this kind aggression just wont stand against dude with help his bowling buddies he will do everything his power get someone pay his rug or possibly get new one because that rug really tied room together so he embarks this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things fascinating people even jesus who is not messiah but very naughty man with jeff bridges leading role coen brothers have found perfect actor incorporate one most iconic characters that has ever been created but its not just dude that makes this winner whole film is such inspired folly simply inventive filmmaking at its finest hilarious dream sequence alone is worth price admission supporting cast is outstanding j turturro j goodman s buscemi among many others song choices are perfect dialog is funniest most quotable any comedy ive ever seen this me is without doubt film with highest rewatchability factor all time 10 stars out 10 favorite films masterpieces low budget b movies,0.666680089935904,0.2943727977448908,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,The Most Quotable Film of All Time,"Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (""The Dude"" to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens' output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face.

,My favourite Coen brothers movie and one of the most entertaining and original comedies ever made!,"My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn't shout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City', 'Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out.

,Simply Beautiful,"It's a travesty that most critics only read The Big Lebowski at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a Raymond Chandler potboiler. I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on the silver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism, the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (Jeff Bridges), Walter (John Goodman), Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendously endearing), and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger, who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges, which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile, an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter, who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers, but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens' Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible.",simply beautiful,its travesty that most critics only read big lebowski at its most superficial level called it modern take raymond chandler potboiler i simply cant begin perceive how one could sit down front this cinematic pop poetry as it plates gold silver screen not feel so incredibly alive dream sequence busbee berkley musical numbers are unique awe inspiring humor is rich subtle clever way it satirizes politically correct arrogance free flowing story avoids even pokes fun at nonessentials like plot points pay offs but what really makes this film such masterpiece such panacea is incredible humanism care that coen brothers put developing dude jeff bridges walter john goodman donnie steve buscemi tremendously endearing brandt magnificently played by phillip seymour hoffman looking at films use sam elliott play stranger who constantly rambles about many wonders dude among other things it is clear that film is ode dudist way life time where so many film promise that they have answer worlds problems end up as slick stylistic show off films what more could one ask than good hearted film like this not mention performance by jeff bridges which ranks among best performances nineties he has relaxed slouch goofy smile enthusiastic dance his buttons can only be pushed by walter who john goodman plays with charm fury coen brothers have always been considered cold filmmakers but there is nothing here but warmth humanity as is case with coens fargo what we have here is one greatest achievements modern cinema if you cant see that grab white russian hit bowling ally find your inner dude as soon as possible,0.5280599647266315,0.2511728395061728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10.0,The Dude Abides!!!,"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking.",dude abides,no movie has entertained me more last year than this film its delightfully written directed with poise acted with extravagance excellence i do admit that this is film that i had see six times get every time i watch it i learn something new genius film lies within game i think coen brothers play with their audiences there are touches masters many their films hudsucker proxy it was preston sturges frank capra raising arizona i felt touch sam fuller this film i felt many touches greatness but more specifically i felt john sayles or even john cassevettes spots camera was manipulated beautifully i felt tinge their talents lurking at many turn performances are astounding especially goodman as deranged bowler still living deep within jungles vietcong huddleston is also quite wonderful as title character turturro gives fine cameo as jesus coupled with rousing humurous version eagles hotel california done espanol i hope this is film that is looked at with more seriousness it is once you dig deep fine piece filmmaking,0.5956228956228956,0.389983164983165,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,"Pederasts, nihilists and rugs","Sounds like a Three Stooges short no? But wait and see: ""The Big Lebowski"" is an American 2-hour film from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is of course by the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers and even without gigantic awards attention, this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years. This is also thanks to the cast, not just to the script. There are three performers in here who won acting Oscars later in their careers, namely the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and of course Jeff Bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it, even if I might give the edge to John Goodman (Argo, Roseanne) here in terms of who I'd pick as the film's MVP. But there's also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like Tara Reid or RHCP's Flea. And then there's Coen regulars like Stormare, Buscemi (both Fargo) and Turturro (Barton Fink). A lot of fun for sure. The Coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavioral patterns. Very well done and this tendency has elevated many Coen films. And as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem, there is still something authentic to them. You never get the impression that you are actually watching actors in roles here, but they feel like actual people. Of course, on the other hand, not everything is perfect with this movie. The scenes with Julianne Moore didn't do too much for me, especially her early scenes. Sam Elliott I also could have done without. I like his narration voice, that would have been enough although his conversation with Bridges' character was also fine in the middle of the film and how they talk about cowboy looks, profanity etc. But with him saying the final words, the film did not exactly close at its best I suppose. Also kinda feel he has a tendency to always play the same character and it seems that back then he looked exactly the way he looks today. But for every negative criticism I have, there are at least five positive things for me to say about this film. The best example is really everything involving John Goodman. His scene with the gun was a riot, only the Coens can depict an actually dangerous situation in a manner as hilarious and entertaining as they did here. His scene in the car when they are about to give the money to the abductors is even better and how he keeps talking about beating the crap out of them. And it's no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into the three German nihilists. Poor Buscemi's character. Or, again about Goodman, his recurring words directed at Buscemi's character. Or how he keeps mentioning Vietnam to show how tough he is. And if we are talking about recurring references already, Bridges' character has his own too of course, such as how he keeps ordering the same drink, even if they may not be as good as Goodman's. The dialogue writing is top-notch here for sure and even if this is always the case with the Coens and their films, we should not take it for granted. Too many examples. One that stayed in the mind for me is the ""let me take another look"" (or something like that) when the bad guys keep pushing his head inside the toilet early on. What a cool dude. No pun intended.As a result, we get many hilarious scenes like at the bowling alley early on (e.g. the gun scene) or also all the scenes with the Dude and Lebowski. I had to laugh so hard at some of these. Yes the film maybe got a bit worse in the second half and maybe the story took two or three plot twists and roads that may have been too absurd, but at this point it doesn't really matter anymore as you are truly sucked in by the entertainment. It's also not a film where you really wonder what will happen to the protagonists or care about them deeply. Instead, you just enjoy the moment and what is happening to them this very instant. Good acting, strong writing, hilarious scenes that turn the eventual outcome into one of the very best of 1998, especially in the first 60 minutes. So of course I give it four stars out of five. I (highly) recommend checking it out if you are one of the very few who have not yet seen it. Also a must-see for bowling lovers. And as for the Coens' quality, just pick Tara Reid, whose career has gone down the drain considerably, but so talented people like the duo of writers and directors here effortlessly install her in a movie that has turned into a classic without any bad impact at all. Admittedly, this is also because of her looks of course because really she does not have a lot to put on display in terms of range and versatility. She has that conversation with the Dude early on at the mansion and finally we see her in the car and that's it, but maybe this lack of a challenge was why they picked her. I immediately had to think of another character in an early Tarantino movie. I am sure you know who I am talking about. Anyway, let's not drift away from this one as there is a lot more to say here. For example, I mentioned the scene in the car. This was one example of how effortless good the Coens are when it comes to storytelling. We find out that indeed she was never kidnapped. We also see she still has all her toes and we see where the actually severed toe came from in another scene in a bar (poor girl!) and this is also pretty unique how the Coens are so strong in depicting somewhat violent moments in comedic light, which always feels pretty unique with them. The only one who does it at least almost as good is again the aforementioned Tarantino. But while he was my favorite earlier and I still like him a lot, I am 100% Team Coen Bros now because honestly, it feels as if I love each and every single film they made. This one here is no exception. It took me until 2017 to watch it for the first time and it was already really good there, but now in 2020 I got the chance to watch it again, for the first time on the big screen of an open air cinema and this was when I really fell in love with this movie. Okay, that is maybe a bit too much to say, but I liked it really a lot and finally see why so many others do too. It has so many funny moments from beginning to end that stem from the great writing, but also equally good acting for sure. These cast members pulled it off perfectly. And with that, I am not just talking about those at the center of the story (also the rich Lebowski for example, sadly not too many know the actor, may he rest in peace), but also those that have very little screen time such as Turturro's character, who is still hilarious though and also the crass difference between his scenes as a colorful bowling starlet and the exact opposite how he has to ring at everybody's door and tell them about his past. Or the German nihilists. And just people who only have one scene. That is always the Coen's strength. They make every character so damn entertaining. And this film is also a success from the time/political perspective. Could they get away with the Saddam jokes today? And pay attention to how the Dude is considered the ultimate Cannabis consumer in popular media nowadays, but you never see him roll a joint. Times were different back then when it came to depicting drug (ab)use in the movies. But it also shows how progressive and ahead of its time the film and filmmakers were/are. So no matter what perspective you take, this is a movie you may not want to miss out on under any circumstance and I am glad hardly anybody did looking at how many have seen it. The story may not be perfect, but it never really is 100% about the story anyway. You forget quickly how the Dude and Goodman's character realize it was all a scam maybe a little too quickly because you are so in awe about all the wonderfully delightful and entertaining moments like the silent boy whose paper they find in the car etc. Like I said, mentioning everything that is funny in this movie is virtually impossible because I would run into the character limit soon and still not have listed half of it all. That is why you need to experience this wonderful film yourself. Actually it made me consider buying a rug again, one that really works the place. Nuff said. Highly, highly recommended. Also some wonderful use of music here I have to put on my player immediately, such as the Eagles song (sorry Dude, it's good), ""what condition my condition was in"" or a not too famous version of ""Viva las Vegas"". All gems. The Coens are really this good with music too in their works. And you also get the usual Jew reference (special occasion here) showing us they do not take themselves seriously at all, a tradition that mounted with full speed into the even better ""A Serious Man"" later on. A gem that movie as well. This one here too. What are you waiting for?",pederasts nihilists rugs,sounds like three stooges short no but wait see big lebowski is american 2 hour film 1998 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year it is course by oscar winning coen brothers even without gigantic awards attention this is definitely contender their most known as it has turned into real cult classic over years this is also thanks cast not just script there are three performers here who won acting oscars later their careers namely late philip seymour hoffman julianne moore course jeff bridges who plays central character here who is really good at it even if i might give edge john goodman argo roseanne here terms who id pick as films mvp but theres also people here that you would not necessarily expect like tara reid or rhcps flea then theres coen regulars like stormare buscemi both fargo turturro barton fink lot fun sure coens once again succeed writing even minor characters way where they stay mind thanks their mannerisms behavioral patterns very well done this tendency has elevated many coen films as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem there is still something authentic them you never get impression that you are actually watching actors roles here but they feel like actual people course other hand not everything is perfect with this movie scenes with julianne moore didnt do too much me especially her early scenes sam elliott i also could have done without i like his narration voice that would have been enough although his conversation with bridges character was also fine middle film how they talk about cowboy looks profanity etc but with him saying final words film did not exactly close at its best i suppose also kinda feel he has tendency always play same character it seems that back then he looked exactly way he looks today but every negative criticism i have there are at least five positive things me say about this film best example is really everything involving john goodman his scene with gun was riot only coens can depict actually dangerous situation manner as hilarious entertaining as they did here his scene car when they are about give money abductors is even better how he keeps talking about beating crap out them its no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into three german nihilists poor buscemis character or again about goodman his recurring words directed at buscemis character or how he keeps mentioning vietnam show how tough he is if we are talking about recurring references already bridges character has his own too course such as how he keeps ordering same drink even if they may not be as good as goodmans dialogue writing is top notch here sure even if this is always case with coens their films we should not take it granted too many examples one that stayed mind me is let me take another look or something like that when bad guys keep pushing his head inside toilet early what cool dude no pun intended as result we get many hilarious scenes like at bowling alley early e g gun scene or also all scenes with dude lebowski i had laugh so hard at some these yes film maybe got bit worse second half maybe story took two or three plot twists roads that may have been too absurd but at this point it doesnt really matter anymore as you are truly sucked by entertainment its also not film where you really wonder what will happen protagonists or care about them deeply instead you just enjoy moment what is happening them this very instant good acting strong writing hilarious scenes that turn eventual outcome into one very best 1998 especially first 60 minutes so course i give it four stars out five i highly recommend checking it out if you are one very few who have not yet seen it also must see bowling lovers as coens quality just pick tara reid whose career has gone down drain considerably but so talented people like duo writers directors here effortlessly install her movie that has turned into classic without any bad impact at all admittedly this is also because her looks course because really she does not have lot put display terms range versatility she has that conversation with dude early at mansion finally we see her car thats it but maybe this lack challenge was why they picked her i immediately had think another character early tarantino movie i am sure you know who i am talking about anyway lets not drift away this one as there is lot more say here example i mentioned scene car this was one example how effortless good coens are when it comes storytelling we find out that indeed she was never kidnapped we also see she still has all her toes we see where actually severed toe came another scene bar poor girl this is also pretty unique how coens are so strong depicting somewhat violent moments comedic light which always feels pretty unique with them only one who does it at least almost as good is again aforementioned tarantino but while he was my favorite earlier i still like him lot i am 100 team coen bros now because honestly it feels as if i love each every single film they made this one here is no exception it took me until 2017 watch it first time it was already really good there but now 2020 i got chance watch it again first time big screen open air cinema this was when i really fell love with this movie okay that is maybe bit too much say but i liked it really lot finally see why so many others do too it has so many funny moments beginning end that stem great writing but also equally good acting sure these cast members pulled it off perfectly with that i am not just talking about those at center story also rich lebowski example sadly not too many know actor may he rest peace but also those that have very little screen time such as turturros character who is still hilarious though also crass difference between his scenes as colorful bowling starlet exact opposite how he has ring at everybodys door tell them about his past or german nihilists just people who only have one scene that is always coens strength they make every character so damn entertaining this film is also success time political perspective could they get away with saddam jokes today pay attention how dude is considered ultimate cannabis consumer popular media nowadays but you never see him roll joint times were different back then when it came depicting drug ab use movies but it also shows how progressive ahead its time film filmmakers were are so no matter what perspective you take this is movie you may not want miss out under any circumstance i am glad hardly anybody did looking at how many have seen it story may not be perfect but it never really is 100 about story anyway you forget quickly how dude goodmans character realize it was all scam maybe little too quickly because you are so awe about all wonderfully delightful entertaining moments like silent boy whose paper they find car etc like i said mentioning everything that is funny this movie is virtually impossible because i would run into character limit soon still not have listed half it all that is why you need experience this wonderful film yourself actually it made me consider buying rug again one that really works place nuff said highly highly recommended also some wonderful use music here i have put my player immediately such as eagles song sorry dude its good what condition my condition was or not too famous version viva las vegas all gems coens are really this good with music too their works you also get usual jew reference special occasion here

10.0,"You can watch it a million times, and yet, it will never get old","The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny, and so clever, you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers, congratulate them personally for their unique talent, and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses ""tick"". The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent. I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long. But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors. The Big Lebowski is like no other film. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through.

,The Deadbeat Lebowski,"How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to, it's nice to know that there are fat, indolent, scruffy, pot smoking, beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone The Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn't matter. It's just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it's the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.Picking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility, but you'd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. ""I don't like your jerk-off name. I don't like your jerk-off face. I don't like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don't like youjerk-off."" And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude's head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.But another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make 'The Passion of the Jesus.') And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he's a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large, bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man  I also noticed, for the first time, that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he's not a small guy).But then there's the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). ""I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but"" And I also like the little dig at the porno film they're watching: ""The plot is ludicrous."" But the comment isn't really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn't matter  it's best to just let it wash over you.Mentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well, maybe there is, because even earlier in the film there's the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor, props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away, the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius! And Jackie Treehorn's brainless goons are brilliant too. ""You're not dealing with morons here."" Oh yes we are. But the film's all the better for it.But I'm not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again it's almost impossible to pick just one. But ""I still jerk-off manually"" would have to be up there, as would virtually every line Walter spews (""The Chinaman is not the issue""). However, if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose, I'd have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: ""Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regiment to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber."" And The Dude's reaction when Maude tells him that she's trying to conceive is magnificent.Yet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them, so Walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue, but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. ""Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?"" It's even better than: ""Fun you, melon farmer!"" Then there are the nihilists. ""We believe in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson."" But try as they might to intimidate, the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well, that and their obsession with the male member.But I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus, in the end, it's actually quite heartfelt  if the film's about anything, it's about friendshipwell, that and smoking pot, drinking beer, bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah, the world's a better place with The Dude in it.",deadbeat lebowski,how can anyone not dig dude world where energetic go getters are idolised looked up its nice know that there are fat indolent scruffy pot smoking beer drinking bums out there taking it easy or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone big lebowski is film where plot is entirely inconsequential it doesnt matter its just mere device set dude his way joy is watching him interact with all weirdos los angeles listening dialogue script is most quotable since withnail i therefore its perfect film just sit back absorb picking favourite scene film that is jam packed with great moments wonderful lines dialogue is near impossibility but youd be hard pressed beat scene with malibu police chief i dont like your jerk off name i dont like your jerk off face i dont like your jerk off behaviour i dont like you jerk off then cap it off he throws his mug at dudes head brilliant making it even funnier is scene that immediately follows it where taxi driver throws dude out his cab but another favourite is jesus he only has two scenes but both are hilarious i hope coens make passion jesus i love flashback where you see him knocking doors tell his neighbours that hes pederast especially good is way that large bearded man with dirty shirt answers door i always crack up at breath jesus takes when he sees man i also noticed first time that jesus that flashback is visibly showing his tight jeans hes not small guy but then theres scene where dude first meets maude lebowski excellently played by julianne moore im sorry if your stepmother is nympho but i also like little dig at porno film theyre watching plot is ludicrous but comment isnt really aimed at porno film film is talking about itself it knows plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesnt matter its best just let it wash over you mentioning porno has reminded me jackie treehorn is there better visual gag modern cinema than dude scratching notepad message or telephone number only find cartoon man with gigantic erection well maybe there is because even earlier film theres moment where dude spends long time making homemade device keep intruders out only him forget fact that his door opens outwards instead inwards he nails bit wood floor props chair up door handle keep people out very second he walks away door opens chair comes tumbling down pure genius jackie treehorns brainless goons are brilliant too youre not dealing with morons here oh yes we are but films all better it but im not sure what my favourite line film would be again its almost impossible pick just one but i still jerk off manually would have be up there as would virtually every line walter spews chinaman is not issue however if i was forced at gunpoint choose id have go with piece dude wisdom fortunately im adhering pretty strict uh drug regiment keep my mind you know uh limber dudes reaction when maude tells him that shes trying conceive is magnificent yet another brilliant scene is larry scene walter dude are trying get information out some kid but kid just stares impassively at them so walter destroys his car or what he thinks is his car now at this moment i could quote real dialogue but tv version dialogue is perhaps even better do you see what happens larry do you see what happens when you find stranger alps its even better than fun you melon farmer then there are nihilists we believe nothing lebowski nothing tomorrow we come back we cut off your johnson but try as they might intimidate only scary thing about nihilists is techno music they listen well that their obsession with male member but i could quote lines big lewbowski all day i just dig film so much because it puts goofy grin my face its stupidity is remarkably intelligent plus end its actually quite heartfelt if films about anything its about friendship well that smoking pot drinking beer bowling keeping hold your johnson yeah worlds better place with dude it,0.5986377635631368,0.20980514096185734,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.31}"

2.0,The Big Bust,"I recently saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with ""The Dude,"" the character he plays in this movie. He also noted that ""The Big Lebowski"" has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That, together with the high rating on IMDb, convinced me to give this a shot. Early on I realized that the story was not to be taken seriously. This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well, some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.I did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word. The positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.I guess one person's humor is another person's tedium.

9.0,A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!,"I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.Considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film, I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides, the plot, believe it or not, is not all that important. As a mystery film, the mystery is figured out early in the film. So, despite this, why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well, the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company, as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which, inexplicably, won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).What, in particular, did I like? Well, the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put, there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic, lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out, you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not, the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.Overall, a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack), but still well worth seeing. Oh, and by the way, the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly, I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed.",wonderful film with word f used 102030841 times,i tried watching this film tv few years ago but i made mistake doing so with my kids nearby first 10 minutes so i heard f word you are not allowed use even once imdb dozens times realizing that film was not family friendly i turned it off despite all very positive reviews id read it however considering ive seen all coen brothers films except this one i knew that eventually id get back seeing it nearly decade has passed i finally got around seeing this cult favorite considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews this film i wont bother discussing plot its been explained death besides plot believe it or not is not all that important as mystery film mystery is figured out early film so despite this why is film so good good enough that i gave it 9 many consider it their favorite film ever well coen brothers bizarre surreal style really make this film off top my head i can only think two their films i liked better hudsucker proxy their most underrated film oh brother where art thou their film that gets better with each viewing this is very good company as these two other films are absolutely brilliant i consider big lebowski be much more interesting that much ballyhooed fargo which inexplicably won two oscars despite not being among brothers best films because its way too normal sort like coen brothers film those who dont get more bizarre coen brothers films what particular did i like well characters were best part film as only coens can create such quirky unique characters simply put there is no one like lebowski any thousands thousands films id seen before uniqueness is something i value most film alcoholic lazy hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero youll ever see film usual quirky characters are here as well spades what i also loved were little movies within movie when lebowski got knocked out you got see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams particularly one later film that just killed me it was so funny stylish believe it or not dream is phallic filled song dance film directed by famous porno director though without actual nudity it just has be seen be believed only hudsucker proxy had stranger more entertaining interludes fact i found myself laughing out loud at this great scene few more overall highly imaginative wonderfully quirky film with very little plot gobs cursing not family friendly or film show your mother unless you do want give her heart attack but still well worth seeing oh by way version often shown tv recently is edited version with many expletives removed original actors provided alternative words f bomb its done reasonably seamlessly frankly i dont think it hurts film you still get hear words like penis which have not been changed,0.5812814400789086,0.2599055427694669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.18}"
6.0,"You see what happens, Larry?","It's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s.

10.0,"It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.""","Looks like while making ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998)– weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique and dry humor, sat back, laughed out loud, and had fun. ""Big Lebowski"" turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interactions, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story, of course, which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the movie.Some reviewers call Big Lebowski misfire and deranged mess, saying that the story is convoluted with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' ""Fargo"" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges).""Fargo"" could be Coens' masterwork but it does not make Lebowski any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. The time has proved the predictions wrong. ""The Dude"" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast ex-hippie, and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, ""more Jewish than Tevye"" Vietnam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, ""sweet prince"" Donny (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby- boomers.The Coen Brothers have made twenty films, and all of them are treasure, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime. I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, ""Burn after reading"" - The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies, because they don't know how. Their films, Including the cult favorite, Big Lebowski, should not be missed. They are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures.

But like many of the Coen Brothers films that I have watched I either like them or I don't.The ones that I liked usually have a strong story behind them, the ones that I don't like seem to be more of a ""day in the life of"" story about people who really don't seem to matter and about events that no one really cares about.Maybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters, making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are, but I need something deeper for intellectual stimulation.For my comedy, I don't need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh. Cynicism, witty dialogue, sarcasm, commentary and so on, not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funny.(which is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn't make me laugh at times...)

1.0,What's the Point? It isn't funny,"Spoilers ahead.I frankly do not understand why ""The Big Lebowski"" has been elevated to the point of being considered one of the best cult classics of all-time. Why this cult around the character of ""The Dude"", one of the blandest, flavorless, most uninteresting comedy protagonists ever to be put on celluloid? He's simply some dopey hippie who loves to hang around a John Goodman cardboard-cutout Vietnam vet gone loco (real Vets should raise their fists in anger over such an overdone, unfunny, disrespectful and insulting characterization) and a seldomly-seen Steve Buscemi, who doesn't really do much. The plot winds into so many different twists and turns and includes so many supporting characters, all of whom seek The Dude's bag of money, that trying to understand this movie is like trying to untangle the Gordian Knot by hand. What's the point of placing layer upon layer upon layer of weird, uninteresting characters to the point that you forget what the hell this movie is about? Nihilist German rockers? Some sicko Hugh Hefner clone? A gorgeous yet incomprehensible avant-garde artist who wants to have ""The Dude's"" baby? A strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort of Greek chorus? Stop it! ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" had an array of weird characters, but it succeeded because it had a straightforward plot and brilliant acting and writing. The Coen's monstrosity has little wit or signs of superb comic writing, and all of their characters, though weird, are totally boring and flavorless. For weird characters to work, they must act totally off-the-wall and twisted beyond realism. The weirdos in ""Lebowski"" are actually regular, and seem like a mish-mash of all-too-real rejects from a yuppie coffee bar.Who likes this stuff? I have just seen ""No Country for Old Men"", and, like ""Lebowski"", that was poorly written in terms of a smooth plot; and, like ""Lebowski"", lacked any interesting characters. I'll give ""Fargo"" a chance; otherwise, the Coen Brothers ain't reeling me in with their weird, clunky movies.",whats point it isnt funny,spoilers ahead i frankly do not understand why big lebowski has been elevated point being considered one best cult classics all time why this cult around character dude one blandest flavorless most uninteresting comedy protagonists ever be put celluloid hes simply some dopey hippie who loves hang around john goodman cardboard cutout vietnam vet gone loco real vets should raise their fists anger over such overdone unfunny disrespectful insulting characterization seldomly seen steve buscemi who doesnt really do much plot winds into so many different twists turns includes so many supporting characters all whom seek dudes bag money that trying understand this movie is like trying untangle gordian knot by hand whats point placing layer upon layer upon layer weird uninteresting characters point that you forget what hell this movie is about nihilist german rockers some sicko hugh hefner clone gorgeous yet incomprehensible avant garde artist who wants have dudes baby strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort greek chorus stop it pee wees big adventure had array weird characters but it succeeded because it had straightforward plot brilliant acting writing coens monstrosity has little wit or signs superb comic writing all their characters though weird are totally boring flavorless weird characters work they must act totally off wall twisted beyond realism weirdos lebowski are actually regular seem like mish mash all too real rejects yuppie coffee bar who likes this stuff i have just seen no country old men like lebowski that was poorly written terms smooth plot like lebowski lacked any interesting characters ill give fargo chance otherwise coen brothers aint reeling me with their weird clunky movies,0.5331479496113642,0.028963414634146343,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"

,Respectable Raunch,"The Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) are the most innovative and, perhaps, the best filmmakers working today. Or they at least rank along side the likes of Martin Scorsese and rising director star Quentin Tarantino. Think about it: ""Blood Simple"" was the best film of 1984; ""Raising Arizona"" was the best film of 1987; ""Miller's Crossing"" was the best movie of 1990; ""Barton Fink"" was the best movie of 1991; and ""Fargo"" was the best movie of 1996. Now comes their latest effort, ""The Big Lebowski,"" which, while it isn't in quite the same league as the above films, is still one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies of 1998.It tells the shambling story of a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself The Dude (Jeff Bridges). The Dude's apartment gets broken into and a thief urinates on his rug. He finds out that the criminals were not looking for him, but looking for the OTHER Jeff Lebowski, the disabled millionaire (played by David Huddleston). That's all I can tell you. The rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words; but it's bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the words.Still, what I'll remember most about ""The Big Lebowski"" is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances. Bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lie-about who just wants to be left alone. John Goodman is the real comic gem here as the forever-loudmouthed Walter, The Dude's bowling partner and best friend. Steve Buscemi co-stars as the dimwitted, bug-eyed Donny, the third bowling partner; there's a small but interestingly offbeat spot for Julianne Moore; and John Torturro stops in, as Jesus the bowler, for what is probably the best walk-on performance in years. If you are a Coen brothers fan or like humor that is distinctly offbeat, you have found your movie. As a rather avid moviegoer, I found the film to be a great excersise in pointless extremeties and respectable raunch.

9.0,A Perfect Strike !,"Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. ""The Big Lebowski"" remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence. Their farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges, as ""The Dude"" whose real name, Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake, played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address, rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the ""Big"" Lebowski chooses ""The Dude"" to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret. Twenty years has allowed me to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" a few times, and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special, in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who, if anyone, actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as ""The Dude"".... Mumbling and ""man-ing"" his way through the film, which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of. It is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of all time. Full of the Coen's regular acting troop, some of whom show up for just one or two scenes, make their memorable mark and then are never heard from again.

8.0,Coen brothers unabashedly out of control! A plethora of fun!,"The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter). I am very fond of their work. Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes. Their best stories evolve from kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona "" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites. I thought that film was fervently free. I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please. ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter. The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug. This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins. We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates. This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans. This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different. Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus!

10.0,"Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges","The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of ""meaning"", life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.On top of The Big Lebowski, at the core, one of the most odd, off-the-wall, and creative of the Coens' scripts, with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane, the casting is near perfect, if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors, and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint, Bridges, for lack of a better term, displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman, but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny, and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film, where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset, another strange, surreal, and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in. Throw in some unique production design, and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does, or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?), and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run, but not by much), yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans, but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact, I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older, depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way, think of the silliest, though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen, and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences, and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's, and has a toe-tapping soundtrack.
