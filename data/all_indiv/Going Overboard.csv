3.0,"If you hate Adam Sandler, you'll hate this movie. If you love Adam Sandler...you'll still hate this movie.","Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a ""movie""! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is ""no-budget"" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line ""Take my wife, please"" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in ""Billy Madison,"" the midget in ""Happy Gilmore's"" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in ""Mixed Nuts."" Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (""Titanic"") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the ""Rocky"" movies) has a significant role. This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so. My score: 3 (out of 10)",if you hate adam sandler youll hate this movie if you love adam sandler youll still hate this movie,even if youre huge sandler fan please dont bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie 7 99 assuming it has be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is it because i assumed some women would get naked judging by r rating scantily clad women cover well there are quite few scantily clad women but none get naked im not sure what point this was sandlers career but im guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one his home movies he might look back at cheesy movie like this reminisce about good ol times but we audience are left dry this is hardly movie sandler does lot talking camera even admits at one point that this is no budget movie thats right not low budget movie no budget movie so our job is pretty much laugh at quirky characters there is no steady plot its like extended sketch comedy show but crude badly written one that guy who played nasty comedian was completely annoying it was implausible first place that he would receive such mass audience sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying one classic henny youngman line take my wife please audience is floor im not even going try make any logic here sure sandlers current recent movies are not known making lot sense penguin billy madison midget happy gilmores happy place but comedy works this is strictly amateurish work even if youre curious about adams early days film you still wont be interested youre better off checking out his start snl or maybe his underrated role mixed nuts course sandman is not only actor wasted this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes short appearance billy zane titanic has supporting role great burt young rocky movies has significant role this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust 99 cent rental section your local video store rightfully so my score 3 out 10,0.5900646678424456,-0.034215167548500874,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.28}"
2.0,Yes it really IS that bad!,"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and not a ""no-budget"" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push.",yes it really is that bad,having decided some time ago collect films billy bob thornton strength class movies like sling blade simple plan man who wasnt there amongst others it was inevitable that there would be odd turkey there what i didnt realise however was that there could be one this bad ill give you idea how incredibly poor this film is funniest dialogue it goes like this knock knock whos there big stinking man big stinking man who big stinking man is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only it about two minutes i guess he needed work at that time his career rest movie is painful some reason though although its undeniably awful i dont hate it thats probably because i save my ire any high budget special effects laden junk like fast furious not no budget flick like this one 2 10 at push,0.5709285714285713,-0.22747619047619044,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,Wow! This was really bad!,"I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay, who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood.Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says ""Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in...."" My response is always ""Well now you can""",wow this was really bad,i will start this off by saying i couldnt get all way through it i picked it up rainy day walmart like rest reviewers this site i figured there wasnt any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who approved this project they need be forced watch this movie over over until end eternity thats only fitting punishment i can think releasing something this bad shooting reminds me movies i used make class projects big old vhs cam acting isnt much better i think only difference is that there are few cool cameos yay who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny ships comedian is even bigger loser thats about as much plot as i understood overall its worst movie ive ever seen i own it dvd have given it many co workers watch each comes back laughs says wow i didnt think id ever say i shut off adam sandler movie 15 minutes my response is always well now you can,0.5369565217391304,-0.034057971014492754,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.12}"
1.0,Wow...this is painfully unfunny and tedious.,"Considering that Adam Sandler was young and inexperienced, I guess you can't fault him too much for appearing in this terrible film. The amazing thing, however, is that this didn't kill his career once and for all! Why is this film so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy but it's amazingly unfunny. The story is about a guy who wants to be a stand-up comedian and features a supposedly professional comic in the film as well--yet there wasn't a single funny line in the film. It was as if they'd asked Mr. Spock or a robot to write the jokes. Additionally, the rest of the film is written so very poorly that there really isn't anything to recommend the story...nothing.The film is set on a somewhat dilapidated cruise ship. Adam Sandler is a lowly waiter and puts up with lots of abuse from everyone. Frankly, no one is this mistreated on any job and it's hard to find anyone who is a bigger loser than this character. He's just so pathetic that it makes you cringe. At the same time, he looks up to a comic on board the ship that has less charisma and charm than any undertaker! The guy is so obnoxious and untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get a real job on this planet or only in bad films like this. The answer is actually pretty obvious. I was surprised at this character, actually, as I don't think I've ever heard a character from the 1980s that curses and much or as colorfully as this guy...and yet we are expected to believe he actually gets paid to talk?! As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly a bunch of beauty pageant contestants, though you wonder WHAT sort of pageant this is. That's because some sport sashes that have the names of states or cities and some have sashes with names of countries--but often the women have no accent and look like they can't even spell the names of the countries, let alone having come from there. The best example is the blonde lady who has a typical American accent...and she's Miss Jamaica!? Additionally, the ladies have no charisma or personalities--they are just eye candy--just bodies to jiggle past the screen.So, we have semi-sexy beauty queens and comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoids--this is NOT a recipe for a good film! About the only thing even halfway likable is Sandler. He's unfunny but seems like a nice young man...a horribly stereotypically Jewish young man saddled with the awful name ""Shecky Moskowitz"". Wow, that was subtle!! The only other positive thing I can say about this film is that it makes you forget some of Sandler's other bombs, such as LITTLE NICKY. Oh, and if you are wondering, I did really enjoy many of his films (such as REIGN ON ME, WATERBOY and THE WEDDING SINGER). I just marvel, however, at how indiscriminate he is in his choices of film projects.Giving a film a 1, for me, is reserved for films such as those of Hershell Gordon Lewis, Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ted Mikels and the like. I don't give this score out routinely but I do think this film also deserves this score, as it is unlikable, cheap and stupid from start to finish and it's obvious why this film is currently ranked within the 100 worst films of all time on IMDb.",wow this is painfully unfunny tedious,considering that adam sandler was young inexperienced i guess you cant fault him too much appearing this terrible film amazing thing however is that this didnt kill his career once all why is this film so bad well biggest problem is that its supposed be comedy but its amazingly unfunny story is about guy who wants be stand up comedian features supposedly professional comic film as well yet there wasnt single funny line film it was as if theyd asked mr spock or robot write jokes additionally rest film is written so very poorly that there really isnt anything recommend story nothing film is set somewhat dilapidated cruise ship adam sandler is lowly waiter puts up with lots abuse everyone frankly no one is this mistreated any job its hard find anyone who is bigger loser than this character hes just so pathetic that it makes you cringe at same time he looks up comic board ship that has less charisma charm than any undertaker guy is so obnoxious untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get real job this planet or only bad films like this answer is actually pretty obvious i was surprised at this character actually as i dont think ive ever heard character 1980s that curses much or as colorfully as this guy yet we are expected believe he actually gets paid talk as rest cast its mostly bunch beauty pageant contestants though you wonder what sort pageant this is thats because some sport sashes that have names states or cities some have sashes with names countries but often women have no accent look like they cant even spell names countries let alone having come there best example is blonde lady who has typical american accent shes miss jamaica additionally ladies have no charisma or personalities they are just eye candy just bodies jiggle past screen so we have semi sexy beauty queens comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoids this is not recipe good film about only thing even halfway likable is sandler hes unfunny but seems like nice young man horribly stereotypically jewish young man saddled with awful name shecky moskowitz wow that was subtle only other positive thing i can say about this film is that it makes you forget some sandlers other bombs such as little nicky oh if you are wondering i did really enjoy many his films such as reign me waterboy wedding singer i just marvel however at how indiscriminate he is his choices film projects giving film 1 me is reserved films such as those hershell gordon lewis ed wood al adamson ted mikels like i dont give this score out routinely but i do think this film also deserves this score as it is unlikable cheap stupid start finish its obvious why this film is currently ranked within 100 worst films all time imdb,0.5545059842118665,-0.003823370257193783,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"
1.0,A no budget and unfunny film that looks horrible.,"With Adam Sandler.This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.86 mins. rated R for Language.",no budget unfunny film that looks horrible,with adam sandler this is without doubt one most idiotic films ever made its about cruise ship waiter shecky sandler wanting be comedian cruise ship first off there is not one funny or clever line entire movie honestly it is so unfunny its pathetic there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor but f word is plentiful budget is really low that also ruins film it takes place cruise ship but it seems they only had money rent out small boat only had money 10 ship extras one which is billy bob thornton opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply it is just pathetic i hate this movie everyone else that sees this will hate it too 86 mins rated r language,0.7629166666666667,-0.1325,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,Words fail me...,"Coming from a non-Adam Sandler fan, but liking his performances in Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, The Wedding Singer, Spanglish and Happy Gilmore, Going Overboard is down there with Jack and Jill and Little Nicky as the worst movie that he ever did, it really is that bad.It is difficult to pin point the worst thing about it, seeing as Going Overboard has no redeeming values whatsoever. Was it the camera angles, and I have to say this film had some of the most awkward and cheaply placed camera angles I've seen in any film? Was it the immature and painfully unfunny humour, down to the juvenile dialogue and jokes that make you cringe so much your face is aching still after watching the film? Was it the broken and predictable structure of the story? Or was it Adam Sandler's truly irritating performance, that makes his performances in Jack and Jill, Little Nicky and You Don't Mess With the Zohan seem award-worthy in comparison? Or the wasted, and I mean wasted, talents of Billy Bob Thornton? Or even the single most unlikeable and obnoxious characters of any film to have Sandler starring in it? Hard to decide, seeing as everything was as bad as the other.

1.0,This ship would have made the iceberg turn around and float away.,"I realize after the several dozen Adam Sandler movies I've seen that he is an acquired taste, and for the most part, I've enjoyed his movies and rated them accordingly for their watchability. This one ranks as the very least watchable and as one that I wouldn't mind seeing every print ""accidentally"" destroyed. It's a good thing that it was instantly forgotten, otherwise we wouldn't have his more watchable films, particularly the nearly half dozen he's done up to this point with Drew Barrymore.As a waiter aboard a huge cruise ship, all he does is comment on the various shipboard entertainers while desperately seeking his own chance at becoming a stand up comic. The shipboard comic is completely unfunny, having a laugh that instantly makes you want to reach through the screen and push him overboard, or in my case wishing that a giant shark would suddenly jump up and swallow him whole.Then there's the crude rock singer, a man with as much talent as a drum with a hole in it. He gets a bunch of disgusting moments with various groupees, eye rollingly hideous and embarrassing. The women themselves whom Sandler keeps getting rejected by get their own big introduction, and they are as funny as the worries of what happens to a piece of hard candy when swallowed whole. A 24 hour marathon of ""Out to Sea"" would provide more laughs than this. Sandler is rather cute in his debut, but 30+ years later, there should be a warning with him speaking that encourages the viewer to bypass this one and head directly to ""Mixed Nuts*.",this ship would have made iceberg turn around float away,i realize after several dozen adam sandler movies ive seen that he is acquired taste most part ive enjoyed his movies rated them accordingly their watchability this one ranks as very least watchable as one that i wouldnt mind seeing every print accidentally destroyed its good thing that it was instantly forgotten otherwise we wouldnt have his more watchable films particularly nearly half dozen hes done up this point with drew barrymore as waiter aboard huge cruise ship all he does is comment various shipboard entertainers while desperately seeking his own chance at becoming stand up comic shipboard comic is completely unfunny having laugh that instantly makes you want reach through screen push him overboard or my case wishing that giant shark would suddenly jump up swallow him whole then theres crude rock singer man with as much talent as drum with hole it he gets bunch disgusting moments with various groupees eye rollingly hideous embarrassing women themselves whom sandler keeps getting rejected by get their own big introduction they are as funny as worries what happens piece hard candy when swallowed whole 24 hour marathon out sea would provide more laughs than this sandler is rather cute his debut but 30 years later there should be warning with him speaking that encourages viewer bypass this one head directly mixed nuts,0.5603333333333333,0.10290476190476193,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.54}"

1.0,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I didn't believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldn't have been more wrong.What we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplish. You'd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. But no, it's just horrible. It's not ""so bad it's good"", its just bad. You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity.

1.0,Couldn't possibly be any worse,"A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole.

1.0,Going Nowhere,"Adam's warning in the beginning of Going Overboard on not to expect anything good or any budget should actually be a disclaimer for all his movies.Actually, that's just my personal opinion on how I really cannot stand Adam Sandler. Sure, there are many – millions? – that do adore him and more power to them. And I could easily suggest they watch this movie to prove my point on how incredibly untalented, unfunny and dumb this lucky sob is. Butin Sandler's defense (GULP,) anyone could have a shaky start such as this one. So, while this disaster of a film isn't really proof of muchit is a hint of what his movies will eventually become.I came home one night from work nearly two months ago – yeah, it's taken me awhile to finally write this – and all I wanted to do was watch an incredibly bad movie to laugh at and not with. Normally, I wouldn't select a Sandler film – they're typically so bad, my mouth is agape more than anything else, but when I learned of both the viewer rating on this (which is currently at 1.9/10 stars) and that it was his first film, I had to see it.This movie disgusted me more than made me laugh. Still, to this day, it's like sh|t is still on my clothes that I cannot discard and I am powerless to that awful smell. I am not kidding: this movie is that bad.It didn't help that the movie started off with the vilest of cartoon intros. If I was able to post pictures in this review, I would provide you with proof of how insane, repulsive and gross they are. And I am not talking about potty humor or body parts. I am speaking of poorly drawn cartoons of Sandler's dumb facial expressions.Had the rest of the movie continued as an animated feature with that cartoon caricature of Sandler, I surely would've turned off the movie. Well, I should've anyways, because it didn't get better.Yeah, the budget seemed like it was at near zero and Sandler, himself, warns us of there being no money, but the lack of any talent from anyone behind the camera, in front of it or even holding it is more disturbing to me than the money fronted to make this happen.Basically, and I am giving the plot too much credit with that word, Adam's jealous of another ""funny man"" on a cruise ship and spends most of the movie daydreaming his way into the spotlight.Nothing works here. Not a single line, not a single ""joke,"" not a single frame. I would say the movie was written by preteen boys with their horny minds, but even they would find this movie in offensively bad taste.Sure, I despise Sandler's work. This wasn't going to change my mind one way or another. But, nothing, NOTHING, could've prepared me for this train wreck of absolute garbage.* * * Final thoughts: #1 this movie came out in 1989in the SUMMER season. Why couldn't this have pushed his future career overboard?? #2, it *did* have a budget. Of $200,000. If you dare, and I highly recommend you don't, please, PLEASE, tell me where any of that was spent. #3, this doesn't even fit in the ""so bad, it's good"" category.

I popped this DVD in, and to my surprise, I did not laugh once. I though it was kind of suspicious it was on the one dollar shelf. I thought it might just be because this movie's old, but after watching it, I found my real answer. I mean, who in their right mind watches this stuff? Sandler plays Schecky Moskowitz, an obnoxious, unfunny comedian. He decides to take a job as a waiter on a cruise ship. The thing in which Sandler talks to the screen, and explains what's going on in the movie, including him saying the only reason they made this movie was because they had access to a big boat and gorgeous babes does not score one laugh. I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually the only reason they made it. No one in their right mind would make this. No actor, no matter how bad they are, no one involved with this film, no matter how bad they are would read this script and think the movie's actually worth making.

1.0,A parallel of Sandler's early comedic style,"This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the film's ""jokes"" come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin Sandler's career.

1.0,"""Going Overboard""... Portrait of a Viewer's Descent into Madness...","I am going to offer a statement up front as a prologue for this review- I like Adam Sandler. I am a fan of his work, both comedic and dramatic. I always make an effort to see his films. In addition to supplying me with laughs, he also offers the occasional deep and moving performance in his serious work. So I am not coming into this review as a hater by any means. I just wanted to say that.Adam Sandler's first film, ""Going Overboard"", was a 1989 release, directed by Valerie Breiman. It follows the lead, Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler), a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. It is notable for its quiet release, and the fact that a whole lot of people don't know about its existence. It is also notable for it's exceptionally poor quality (being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), and at times painfully unfunny jokes. I tried to watch this film twice before today. Once by myself- in an effort that ended after less than 10 minutes. And a second time yesterday with two friends, this time making it 15 minutes in.And today, while writing this review, I forced myself to watch even more of this flick, in an attempt to make it at least one third of the way through, so I can be more fair and just with my analysis.The film is sloppily put together. For some reason, Shecky almost constantly breaks the fourth wall, and speaks to the audience. Now, this is a technique that can work if utilized properly, but here, it seems forced and contrived, and it never really adds to the proceedings. In fact, it makes almost no sense whatsoever. They attempt to expand this idea, with other characters (such as his best friend) noticing the ""camera"", or having other passengers (notably beauty queens on the ship) appear randomly to talk to the camera, but it doesn't feel natural. The comedy is extremely unfunny. An opening scene featuring Burt Young (how they got him in the movie is beyond me) makes an unfunny attempt at using porno-titles etched on the sides of video tapes for cheap laughs in a gag that is DOA. A barely animated opening title sequence tries to solicit laughs using a caricature of Sandler, but it fails miserably. Much of the humor is too drawn out, or too brief. And many of the gags fall flat as a pancake. An example that pops into my mind is a scene where we, for no reason, see the ""villainous"" character dancing on the deck in front of some sunbathing women for about a full minute while snazzy music plays in the background. It made no sense, yet looked like it was trying to play for laughs. I didn't laugh once. The most creative gag was Shecky giving a Bloody Mary to a patron which had been soiled by a seagull's excrement... and it wasn't even funny, just gross.The acting is uniformly abysmal, with Sandler alternating between trying way too hard in one scene, to looking bored and just reading his lines in the next. His rival, ""Dickie Diamond"" is portrayed as a lewd and vulgar comedian, and he's meant to come across as a bully that you hate, but the performance doesn't work, and makes you pity him and feel as though he may be handicapped in some way.The direction is unsuitable, and the film can't even muster the quality of a 70's television commercial in terms of visual aesthetics. (I have read that due to an error, the film had to be shot without vital lens and filter packs, which the crew had forgot, hence it's flat and cheap look.) There is no discernible story by any stretch of the imagination- reading a synopsis elsewhere, it is suggested that terrorists, thugs and other assorted villains will raid the ship later on in the film, but I can't see how or why. Literally nothing happened in the half hour or so I saw. The film has no guidance. The editing is also bad all around, and despite moving very quickly, it drags and drags... it's jarring yet also boring... It feels like snippets of a few dozen different skits strung together, with all of the punchlines removed. There's no flow, and nothing seems to make any sense, or contribute to any real effort at a story.Really, as much as it pains me to say this... this is the first movie I've encountered that I have been unable to sit through. It's literally painful to watch.I have to give this a 1 out of 10, and that's coming from a Sandler fan. It isn't the worst movie ever made... but it's up (or rather, down) there.EDIT: (June 8th) I have watched another half hour of the film. My review still stands as is.",going overboard portrait viewers descent into madness,i am going offer statement up front as prologue this review i like adam sandler i am fan his work both comedic dramatic i always make effort see his films addition supplying me with laughs he also offers occasional deep moving performance his serious work so i am not coming into this review as hater by any means i just wanted say that adam sandlers first film going overboard was 1989 release directed by valerie breiman it follows lead shecky moskowitz sandler struggling comedian working cruise ship it is notable its quiet release fact that whole lot people dont know about its existence it is also notable its exceptionally poor quality being imdbs bottom 100 list at times painfully unfunny jokes i tried watch this film twice before today once by myself effort that ended after less than 10 minutes second time yesterday with two friends this time making it 15 minutes today while writing this review i forced myself watch even more this flick attempt make it at least one third way through so i can be more fair just with my analysis film is sloppily put together some reason shecky almost constantly breaks fourth wall speaks audience now this is technique that can work if utilized properly but here it seems forced contrived it never really adds proceedings fact it makes almost no sense whatsoever they attempt expand this idea with other characters such as his best friend noticing camera or having other passengers notably beauty queens ship appear randomly talk camera but it doesnt feel natural comedy is extremely unfunny opening scene featuring burt young how they got him movie is beyond me makes unfunny attempt at using porno titles etched sides video tapes cheap laughs gag that is doa barely animated opening title sequence tries solicit laughs using caricature sandler but it fails miserably much humor is too drawn out or too brief many gags fall flat as pancake example that pops into my mind is scene where we no reason see villainous character dancing deck front some sunbathing women about full minute while snazzy music plays background it made no sense yet looked like it was trying play laughs i didnt laugh once most creative gag was shecky giving bloody mary patron which had been soiled by seagulls excrement it wasnt even funny just gross acting is uniformly abysmal with sandler alternating between trying way too hard one scene looking bored just reading his lines next his rival dickie diamond is portrayed as lewd vulgar comedian hes meant come across as bully that you hate but performance doesnt work makes you pity him feel as though he may be handicapped some way direction is unsuitable film cant even muster quality 70s television commercial terms visual aesthetics i have read that due error film had be shot without vital lens filter packs which crew had forgot hence its flat cheap look there is no discernible story by any stretch imagination reading synopsis elsewhere it is suggested that terrorists thugs other assorted villains will raid ship later film but i cant see how or why literally nothing happened half hour or so i saw film has no guidance editing is also bad all around despite moving very quickly it drags drags its jarring yet also boring it feels like snippets few dozen different skits strung together with all punchlines removed theres no flow nothing seems make any sense or contribute any real effort at story really as much as it pains me say this this is first movie ive encountered that i have been unable sit through its literally painful watch i have give this 1 out 10 thats coming sandler fan it isnt worst movie ever made but its up or rather down there edit june 8th i have watched another half hour film my review still stands as is,0.4134823848238482,-0.05392953929539296,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.37}"
