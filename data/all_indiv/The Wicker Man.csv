1.0,The True Nature of Sacrifice,"Prior to this release, Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: ""It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like, come on! You may not like the new one, but if that's your favorite soundtrack, I don't know if I *want* you to like my film."" Neil, a word. You might want to sit down for this too; as Lord Summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See, Neil, the thing about the original, is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson, and Bert Jansch, it practically kick-started the 1970s Folk New Wave. To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant, pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone's Get Carter.The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage ""disturbed for about two weeks."" So disturbed, during that fortnight's window, that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism. It's like some parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi? Or Gaspar ""Irreversible"" Noe remade Love, Actually?(Actually, I'd quite like to see that). Unfortunately, someone took this parlor game seriously: All LaBute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash, Cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor. Then he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (this one trades on name-homages for kudos), now living on the private island community of Summersisle  that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous'  and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.Summersisle, it transpires, is a female-dominated joint, conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here, the matriarchs observe the Olde ways, and the few males are near-mute breed-mules. It's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale. Summersisle's main export is honey  a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he's allergic to bees. ""Beekeepers!"" cries Edward. ""They seem to be everywhere on this island!"" Well, that's probably because Summersisle's main export is honey.While making his investigations, Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called ""the time of death and rebirth"". He discovers the previous year's crop failed; nearly dies from bee stings; and eventually comes to the conclusion (a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands) that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest. He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive, Sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man: ""The drone must die."" First, the good news: any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest: he toast. That's about it for the good news. ""This is a story whose chapters were carefully written"" intones Burstyn with sublime irony. Though retaining the basic cat-and-mouse premise (and credits typography), what's left subjects the original to a scorched-earth policy.Crucial to Shaffer's original screenplay was that his Christian copper, in accordance with ritual, came to the island of his own free will  and most importantly, was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing matters to a sexual, as opposed to a religious power-struggle, LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait, you honestly couldn't care less.And Cage is one of the very worst things in this; a lumbering, drawling donkey  an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth. ""Goddamit"" he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan, with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half-an-hour too early. One hopes it's his character's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state  alternately fatigued, then full of preppy, overbearing vim. If so, it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti-depressants. If notit doesn't bear thinking about. As Willow, the saucer-eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful, presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for themosthalf-hearteddelivery. While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf? Every element that made the original great  the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs, the ingenious score, the dialogue (Lord Summerisle's majestic ""You did it beautifully!"" has been replaced with the rather less attractive ""You did it excellently!"" Whoah, dude!)  have been substituted for a meandering battle-of-the-sexes thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop. Namely, walloping women; this is a LaBute flick, after all. Cage's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em, hyuk hyuk.The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché: in a bar, two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave, flirty-fishing for fresh martyrs. At the moment of their successful pick-up, you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.One more thing: keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count (anything up to 10) tend to be Not Much Cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.",true nature sacrifice,prior this release neil labute had this say about 1973 original its surprising how many people say its their favorite soundtrack im

4.0,Five reasons to watch The Wicker Man,"The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination, etc., but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, even though it's bad: 5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based.4. For a cheesy horror/thriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of his or not, it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a ""normal guy"". There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful kind of way.2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. ""See?"" you could write, ""this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!"" Also, the similarities between this ""Summersisle"" society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.1. If you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of ""highlights"" from the movie, including Cage running around in a bear suit, and of course, the infamous ""AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!!"" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety.I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out, it's about a dollar per reason. It's a pretty good deal.NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue, which features a cameo from James Franco.",five reasons watch wicker man,wicker man starring nicolas cage is by no means good movie but i cant really say its one i regret watching i could go about negative aspects movie like terrible acting lengthy scenes where cage is looking girl has hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by dream sequence with hallucination etc but its just not worth dwelling when it comes movie like this instead heres five reasons why you should watch wicker man even though its bad 5 its hard deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas it only problem is its cheesy unintentionally funny execution if nothing else this is movie that may inspire you see original 1973 film or even read short story which it is based 4 cheesy horror thriller it is really aesthetically pleasing its pretty obvious that it was filmed location instead using green screen or elaborate sets so we get see some very great scenery there are also many nicely composed shots it is very good looking movie 3 nicolas cage is not so much actor as he is force nature whether youre fan his or not it seems as if its impossible cage play normal guy there is always some kind eccentricity or nerdiness he brings characters he plays personally i am always fascinated by watching him any movie he does whether nicolas cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play he is never boring watch he is terrible wicker man but most wonderful kind way 2 student could probably write hell paper this movie as it seems be strongest anti feminist movie ever made see you could write this is what happens when women are allowed run society also similarities between this summersisle society bee colony are pretty interesting worth noting 1 if youre reading this theres probably good chance you may have seen youtube video that has become very popular collection highlights movie including cage running around bear suit course infamous aaghh bees my eyes line these scenes are hilarious out context they are still fairly funny while watching them films entirety i bought used dvd at blockbuster about 5 dollars when you work that out its about dollar per reason its pretty good deal note unrated version movie is best watch its better watch theatrical version just its little added epilogue which features cameo james franco,0.6884967320261437,0.16557189542483658,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
2.0,Hilariously Awful,"A phenomenal achievement in awfulness. It's actually hilariously awful.First off...Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the Over-Emoting Category in his acting class. Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a ""hero"" character that you have no vested interest in.I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all ""b****es"" a few times too. I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance (bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead) it seems like all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue, white, and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.This movie is so wrong-headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promising acting career in a ""brawl"" with Cage.Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.Nicholas Cage screaming ""Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?"" for no reason.Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear feet on) and then doing some karate moves to some villains.And you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement.Needless to say, if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send-up of ""hysteria"" films...only to be reminded when Cage would scream/shout/whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously.I think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again...just because it's so dreadful.",hilariously awful,phenomenal achievement awfulness its actually hilariously awful first off nicholas cage must now have made it finals over emoting category his acting class wearing new hair plugs with face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem be straining touch back he oozes not only sick smarmiess but creates hero character that you have no vested interest i dont know what it is with neil labute female characters he makes females out be totally deviant evil pays them back by having cage punch several them directly face call them all b es few times too ive enjoyed labutes early films few his plays but its strange fascination he has id give this film 2 out 10 solely based ellen burstyns performance by time she finally makes her appearance bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible her forehead it seems like all hope may be lost she deserves oscar right here now saying her lines with straight face when she appears wearing white mumu blue white gold face paint booming about wicker man you know that working with scorcese friedkin really prepped her this role dang well this movie is so wrong headed cuckoo that is has be seen be believed highlights include nicholas cage running away swarm bees then falling down hill nicholas cage stealing bicycle looking like ms gulch wizard oz riding around it nicholas cage running around island kicking down doors looking missing girl leelee sobieski plummeting once promising acting career brawl with cage ellen burstyn dancing around said while mumu nicholas cage screaming who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it no reason nicholas cage bear costume im not kidding running through woods taking off costume but leaving bear feet then doing some karate moves some villains you havent lived until you have seen final 15 minutes movie its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday your cousins basement needless say if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve medal there was actually point movie where i stopped snickering wonder if maybe this wasnt elaborate send up hysteria films only be reminded when cage would scream shout whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously i think this one is destined be cult film all over again just because its so dreadful,0.47760792448292455,-0.07368025493025493,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.32}"

,Insultingly rubbish,"A bad movie is a bad movie but a bad remake is something else entirely. This film doesn't just do a bad job of retelling the original story it takes everything that was good about it and replaces it with a witless and disjointed story.Nicolas Cage is well cast as a man addicted to some kind of over the counter drugs. I was sick to death of his muttering and dopey face within about five minutes, you might find his routine wearing thin a little faster or slower depending on your tolerance. I think he might have done a little too much preparation for his role. Watching Nicolas Cage mumble his way through the script is quite painful at times, like seeing an elderly dog trying to chase a postman on arthritic legs and not understanding why he can't quite do it anymore.The original story was quite chilling but here it's all kind of a joke. There's something really repulsive about a director remaking a film when they clearly haven't taken the time to understand the original. The plot is weaker than you would believe without seeing it and the whole war of the sexes thing is just not interesting.

3.0,Misguided rethink of a classic horror story is destined to be forgotten and a major misstep in the careers of most involved,"(Spoilers ahead) Neil LaBute continues his misogynistic ways with a retelling of Anthony Shaffer's classic horror story. The story of a policeman called to a remote island to investigate the disappearance of a little girl, only to find that there is more afoot has been re-imagined as the tale of a lost soul trying to find redemption in a matriarchal community.The changes LaBute has made have destroyed most of the thematic elements and under currents that have made the original resonate still 30 years after it was first produced. In place of the originals battle between Christianity and paganism we have a nightmare of clever woman doing terrible things to a man who wants to get his soul back. LaBute has made one of the ultimate women are evil films of all time. Some have found the changes empowering, I find them misogynistic since it clearly shows why he's made a career out of abusing women in his films: women will toy with you before destroying you. Its an ugly message.LaBute also made changes to the story that hobble it in the telling. One of the key changes is that the young girl maybe Nicholas Cages'. While this may give Nicholas Cage a reason to go, it creates some rather odd exchanges between Cage and the mother of the missing girl. Very little of what passes between them makes any sense at all. Its a mess, but then the restructuring of the society diminishes much of the tension because we are clearly somewhere else; its not, as in the original film a place that could almost be anywhere, until you peal off the layers. There IS a tension, but that comes from clearly being in a place one shouldn't. Granted the change does create a bit more fear at times (since the monster is clearly in view and we are waiting for it to strike), but it never achieves the real horror of the original which explodes at the end as not only the mystery is stripped away but also the beliefs of the central character. (And lets not even talk about the need for the 6 month later ending) As if the script wasn't bad enough the film is also badly acted. Nicholas Cage at times gives a performance that ranks among his worst, which is not an easy task since he is one of Hollywood best and worst actors of all time. Cage had me in tears of embarrassed laughter at times, so much so that I can end any discussion of the rest of the cast here since as bad as some of them are, they aren't that bad.On the plus side there are some striking images and some unease, due no doubt to the stories inherent power and to LaBute's refashioning the story to put monster front and center.Pluses or no this film is a major misfire. Its a really bad bad (unfun) movie that should be avoided. Its more proof that some times people who know better do bad things, not that anyone should have to go looking for more proof.",misguided rethink classic horror story is destined be forgotten major misstep careers most involved,spoilers ahead neil labute continues his misogynistic ways with retelling anthony shaffers classic horror story story policeman called remote island investigate disappearance little girl only find that there is more afoot has been re imagined as tale lost soul trying find redemption matriarchal community changes labute has made have destroyed most thematic elements under currents that have made original resonate still 30 years after it was first produced place originals battle between christianity paganism we have nightmare clever woman doing terrible things man who wants get his soul back labute has made one ultimate women are evil films all time some have found changes empowering i find them misogynistic since it clearly shows why hes made career out abusing women his films women will toy with you before destroying you its ugly message labute also made changes story that hobble it telling one key changes is that young girl maybe nicholas cages while this may give nicholas cage reason go it creates some rather odd exchanges between cage mother missing girl very little what passes between them makes any sense at all its mess but then restructuring society diminishes much tension because we are clearly somewhere else its not as original film place that could almost be anywhere until you peal off layers there is tension but that comes clearly being place one shouldnt granted change does create bit more fear at times since monster is clearly view we are waiting it strike but it never achieves real horror original which explodes at end as not only mystery is stripped away but also beliefs central character lets not even talk about need 6 month later ending as if script wasnt bad enough film is also badly acted nicholas cage at times gives performance that ranks among his worst which is not easy task since he is one hollywood best worst actors all time cage had me tears embarrassed laughter at times so much so that i can end any discussion rest cast here since as bad as some them are they arent that bad plus side there are some striking images some unease due no doubt stories inherent power labutes refashioning story put monster front center pluses or no this film is major misfire its really bad bad unfun movie that should be avoided its more proof that some times people who know better do bad things not that anyone should have go looking more proof,0.509039548022599,-0.05448446327683614,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,Neil Labute should have his member slathered in honey and laced with bees (Spolier Alert)....,"Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. I wasn't going to comment, but the film just bugs me so much, and the writer/director in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.I saw the original ""Wicker Man"" and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs. This said, I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example, I liked the original 1950's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is ""The Thing"". The original, as campy as it looks compared to today's standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie). So that small minority of people who like ""The Wicker Man"" re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make.This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives, wanting to make a serious thriller, would green light a product that is so anti-female. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy.The metaphor of bees, drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient (""The drone must die!""), especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers, and half of them seemed to be pregnant, the other half old and fat, and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs, so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones, why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (That movie was made already. ""The Stepford Wives"" anyone?) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens.The problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused, thus, an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage ""saves"" ultimately brings him death.The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen ""Law & Order"" and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery.So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey.

6.0,I don't get the hate,"Obviously, the 10-year-old ""The Wicker Man"" starring Oscar winner Nicholas Cage is not a perfect film by any means, but it looks a lot to me that this one has been voted down by pretentious retro intellectuals who think only because an original film was good, it must mean automatically that a modern remake is bad. This one here is not. It was written and directed by Neil LaBute and runs for 100 minutes. The core story is a cop who arrives at a mysterious island obviously controlled by a community of cult-like women. He is in charge of finding out what happens to a missing girl and gets involved deeper and deeper in the mystery of the island.There were a couple parts that did not work entirely for me, for example the part about him being the father to the girl and the masks in the end also looked a bit ridiculous, but we have to keep in mind that the women on the island were all complete lunatics and did not see how ridiculous their actions were as if they were on some drug or something. Anyway, the setting makes this one a fairly atmospheric watch and I thought most of the performances were pretty good. Cage always delivers basically, especially when he plays cop characters. And I also liked the ending somehow. It goes against the traditional idea of how films have to end happily or on a positive note at least and this one here is the exact opposite. The epilogue with James Franco was not really necessary, but oh well, it's not bad enough to destroy the film either.As a whole, do not be fooled by the rating here on IMDb or the film's reception by critics. This is far from a failure and has some really good moments occasionally, even if there is a bad one here and there too. But all in all, the good outweighs the bad and it is a decent watch if you are interested in mystery with a touch of supernatural and horror phenomenons. Or if you simply love Nicholas Cage.

The story made no sense, and the repetitiveness of the silence of the women on the island was just irritating...maybe it was the director's way of connecting Cage's irritation to that of the audience, but if that was the case, all he succeeded in was making the audience totally ticked off, especially at the end.",my review,wicker man nicolas cage travels commune far away island even though its washington find missing girl that his old fianc told him was missing course things arent that simple as he tries find answers dominantly female population hes led circles is being fed false truths which all cumulates climactic ending which involves nicolas cage bear costume yea bear costume wicker man would be good if it wasnt fact that it sucked story made no sense repetitiveness silence women island was just irritating maybe it was directors way connecting cages irritation that audience but if that was case all he succeeded was making audience totally ticked off especially at end,0.4978174603174603,-0.033333333333333354,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,The Worst Movie I've EVER Seen,"This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you'd probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never-the-less, it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these.From the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you are in for disappointment.""Why is it so bad,"" you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit ""on edge,"" frightened, or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.I am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, I just want to be surprised.

3.0,One poor re-imagination of the original pagan tale,"I actually came to watch this film with quite an open mind. I'm a big admirer of the original and have watched it more than once, and found the whole package quite exceptional. Sadly remakes are quite the fashion nowadays and in rare cases they can exceed or match the original. This one doesn't! They have re-written the original from its ""Christian v Pagan"" theme to some extreme feminist cult based in north-west USA. The acting is poor and Nicholas Cage is just annoying in the lead role (very unsuited to the part). The story is surprisingly boring and doesn't have the same creepy factor the original did.The settings are undeniably incredibly beautiful, but apart from that there is nothing of note in this film.

1.0,The Wicker Man vs The Lilith Fair Rejects,"The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind. YES it's really that bad. So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself ""If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes"" I might actually go for the red hot needles.Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind ""Yeah that's some bad direction right there"".I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line: ""Some Sacrifices Must Be Made"". Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. That's not a joke nor is it fictional. I've never been to a ""thriller"" and heard so much laughter through out the entire film. I can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater, anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia (soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, don't delay). At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show upoh how I wish.Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a d*ck for slamming Nic's acting, oh he's still a d*ck just lesser of oneyes Sean Penn's d*ck was lessened because of this film. Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks. You cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars. His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit (like the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear, but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around. Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!!

The plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out ""Rowan!?"" at the slightest noise. The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example, certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film.

3.0,A sorry state of affairs,"The most immediate and obvious word I'd use to describe this film is 'redundant'. I mean, after all, who would remake one of the best remembered British horror films of all time, considered by many to be the BEST of a varied bunch? It's not a film that has dated in any way and power still emanates from the screen as we watch Edward Woodward explore his doomed struggle. From the opening sequence in this film, a set-piece involving an exploding car, I knew it was going to be way off the ball.American films by Hollywood standards are bombastic, noisy, and clichéd. Producers love to give audiences what they want and expect, which is why there's little in the way of originality. Attempts to anywhere-near match the icy chills of the Robin Hardy classic were bound to be doomed from the start, but the makers of this weren't expecting to turn out one of the most derided films of recent years. It's really a combination of bad luck: we get Nicolas Cage having an off day, giving one of his worst, most over the top (in a bad way) performances. There's a script that flits between intense boredom and ludicrous scenes (Cage battling and beating up old women at the climax), a story utterly diluted of horror.Some poor acting from a frankly unbelievable supporting cast (Ellen Burstyn fairly laughable in the Christopher Lee role, the cute Leelee Sobieski utterly miscast as a villainess, and only Kate Beahan's good looks saving her from a similar fate), and frankly pretentious direction from Neil LaBute. All the interesting scenes are shot-for-shot in the original, and merely play out with a sense of déjà vu here. Instead of the gut-churning horror of the original's climax, viewers will just be itching to turn this one off as the credits roll.

5.0,"Don't build a house out of this ""Wicker""","In the recent vogue of remaking movies at a fair clip, writer-director Neil Labute has decided to turn his eye to the early 1970s minor cult classic The Wicker Man. The original has developed a following over the years and is generally well regarded. Unfortunately, the remake will probably be held in the same company. While not a terrible film, The Wicker Man is nevertheless not great by any imagination, occasionally sliding into the realm of unintentional self-parody.The film opens on police officer Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage), a motorcycle cop who is witness to a horrific traffic accident involving a young girl and her mother. Unable to shake the experience, Malus goes on an extended leave and then ends up receiving a letter from his ex-fiancée, Willow (Kate Beahan), that her daughter is missing and she needs his help to locate her. Malus travels to the remote island of Summersisle, a private commune that has developed a matriarchal hierarchy, where men are little better than pack mules. Malus is reunited with Willow and begins his investigation of the island, discovering a number of unusual habits and strange goings-on. None of the inhabitants acknowledge the existence of Rowan, Willow's daughter, even the leader of the group, Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn). After some investigation, Malus becomes more and more convinced that not only is Rowan still on the island, but she may be the eventual subject of a ritualistic sacrifice to the naturalistic gods the people worship.The Wicker Man falls apart in a number of different ways, but no more detrimental than in the performance of Nicholas Cage. Cage, an effective actor in other films, has been known for his somewhat unorthodox style at times, and here he turns in what may be one of his worst performances ever. He overacts the role of Edward Malus to the extreme, often bordering on the ridiculous. It is difficult to not hold back giggles at times in some of his more ""emotional"" moments as he pushes the bounds of seriousness almost beyond their breaking point. It is difficult to say whether this is all Cage's fault or if some of the blame lay at the feet of director Labute, but either way, Cage's performance is a serious hindrance to the success of the film.Cage isn't the only one in the film that is not quite up to par in the performance category. Many of the actors overplay their parts, seemingly to increase the ""weirdness"" factor of the film, but again causing little but bewilderment for the audience. The word subtlety is not to be found in the vocabulary of this film. The only semi-decent performance on record is that of Burstyn in the role of Sister Summersisle. She is low-key and effective in the role of the leader who has what appears to be ulterior motives to her actions.Aside from the acting missteps, The Wicker Man lacks much in the way of any real suspense. There is little in the film to raise the hairs on your neck, although the film seems to want to try every so often. A few scenes try to head in this direction, but they almost all fail to pay off. Also, when the twists and turns are finally alluded to, you find yourself questioning some of the significant leaps of logic the script makes. A few of its ""revelations"" are so difficult to swallow that it is hard to even believe the whole of the structure of the film.Even so, The Wicker Man has a sometimes atmospheric setting , there are some occasional bits of creepiness and the ending will most likely leave you a bit taken aback. If Labute had dealt with some of the performance issues and ironed out some of the logic in The Wicker Man, it may have been a decent little thriller. But, in the end, it just turns out to be just another forgettable remake.",dont build house out this wicker,recent vogue remaking movies at fair clip writer director neil labute has decided turn his eye early 1970s minor cult classic wicker man original has developed following over years is generally well regarded unfortunately remake will probably be held same company while not terrible film wicker man is nevertheless not great by any imagination occasionally sliding into realm unintentional self parody film opens police officer edward malus nicholas cage motorcycle cop who is witness horrific traffic accident involving young girl her mother unable shake experience malus goes extended leave then ends up receiving letter his ex fianc e willow kate beahan that her daughter is missing she needs his help locate her malus travels remote island summersisle private commune that has developed matriarchal hierarchy where men are little better than pack mules malus is reunited with willow begins his investigation island discovering number unusual habits strange goings none inhabitants acknowledge existence rowan willows daughter even leader group sister summersisle ellen burstyn after some investigation malus becomes more more convinced that not only is rowan still island but she may be eventual subject ritualistic sacrifice naturalistic gods people worship wicker man falls apart number different ways but no more detrimental than performance nicholas cage cage effective actor other films has been known his somewhat unorthodox style at times here he turns what may be one his worst performances ever he overacts role edward malus extreme often bordering ridiculous it is difficult not hold back giggles at times some his more emotional moments as he pushes bounds seriousness almost beyond their breaking point it is difficult say whether this is all cages fault or if some blame lay at feet director labute but either way cages performance is serious hindrance success film cage isnt only one film that is not quite up par performance category many actors overplay their parts seemingly increase weirdness factor film but again causing little but bewilderment audience word subtlety is not be found vocabulary this film only semi decent performance record is that burstyn role sister summersisle she is low key effective role leader who has what appears be ulterior motives her actions aside acting missteps wicker man lacks much way any real suspense there is little film raise hairs your neck although film seems want try every so often few scenes try head this direction but they almost all fail pay off also when twists turns are finally alluded you find yourself questioning some significant leaps logic script makes few its revelations are so difficult swallow that it is hard even believe whole structure film even so wicker man has sometimes atmospheric setting there are some occasional bits creepiness ending will most likely leave you bit taken aback if labute had dealt with some performance issues ironed out some logic wicker man it may have been decent little thriller but end it just turns out be just another forgettable remake,0.532981220657277,-0.006690140845070424,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"

,"If you want to watch Nicholas Cage hit women, this is for you.","Yet ANOTHER horror-film remake. This one is really quite bad. It has taken over the nonsense from the 1973 original  minus the great music and the atmosphere. So what are we left with here? With dull, badly acted garbage, with silly dialogues and even some unintentionally unfunny moments! The premise could be labeled more-or-less original  if only this weren't just a remake  but it is also a silly premise. The story is full of gaping holes in logic, there are many inconsistencies, the characters are not believable, and the director has failed to create a mood  which is essential for this kind of story to work on the screen. Cage is dull and uninteresting, and his character's detective work shoddy and even laughable. The rest of the cast isn't much better, but then again, they didn't have much to work with here. Check out Ellen Burstyn: she is barely recognizable, what with a half-dozen face-lifts that have turned her into something quite weird. Strictly for die-hard Cage fans, and people who are shipwrecked on an island, with only one movie to watch.",if you want watch nicholas cage hit women this is you,yet another horror film remake this one is really quite bad it has taken over nonsense 1973 original minus great music atmosphere so what are we left with here with dull badly acted garbage with silly dialogues even some unintentionally unfunny moments premise could be labeled more or less original if only this werent just remake but it is also silly premise story is full gaping holes logic there are many inconsistencies characters are not believable director has failed create mood which is essential this kind story work screen cage is dull uninteresting his characters detective work shoddy even laughable rest cast isnt much better but then again they didnt have much work with here check out ellen burstyn she is barely recognizable what with half dozen face lifts that have turned her into something quite weird strictly die hard cage fans people who are shipwrecked island with only one movie watch,0.5293010752688171,-0.03897849462365591,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
3.0,The Wicker Man : Possibly Nicholas Cages worst outing of the naughties?,"When a horror film evokes more laughs than scares you know the film is in troubled waters. This remake starring Nicholas Cage is bad. Very bad. Let me explain why.The script is uninspired and lacking in psychological or physical scares. Rather it evokes unintentional laughter through crass lines and silly scenes. He is a police officer who can't tell the difference in weight between a loaded gun and an unloaded gun. He runs around in a bear costume at one point to blend in with the local celebration. You'd be forgiven for thinking this was Scooby Doo.The film lacks tension and logic. After the film you're left wondering why the islanders didn't just knock him out when his back was turned rather than continue the elaborate missing girl plan until the very end.The only enjoyment I took away from this was how unintentionally funny some scenes were. The aforementioned bear scene, Nicholas Cage pointing his gun at an unarmed woman to apprehend her bike and telling her to ""step away from the bike"", the villagers and their cuckoo ways, it all adds up to some comedy gold.But make no mistake. This is poor stuff. You gotta wonder why Nicholas Cage agreed to appear in this. Maybe he thought there was potential. It evokes the 1998 Psycho as another pointless poor remake.",wicker man possibly nicholas cages worst outing naughties,when horror film evokes more laughs than scares you know film is troubled waters this remake starring nicholas cage is bad very bad let me explain why script is uninspired lacking psychological or physical scares rather it evokes unintentional laughter through crass lines silly scenes he is police officer who cant tell difference weight between loaded gun unloaded gun he runs around bear costume at one point blend with local celebration youd be forgiven thinking this was scooby doo film lacks tension logic after film youre left wondering why islanders didnt just knock him out when his back was turned rather than continue elaborate missing girl plan until very end only enjoyment i took away this was how unintentionally funny some scenes were aforementioned bear scene nicholas cage pointing his gun at unarmed woman apprehend her bike telling her step away bike villagers their cuckoo ways it all adds up some comedy gold but make no mistake this is poor stuff you gotta wonder why nicholas cage agreed appear this maybe he thought there was potential it evokes 1998 psycho as another pointless poor remake,0.5739648033126293,-0.16999999999999996,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.44, 'Fear': 0.18}"
