9.0,The Genius of Buster Keaton,"Probably Buster Keaton's best film, and oddly enough, it's not even a straightforward comedy  it's actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure. `The General', which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier. However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier. Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North. Johnny's efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl's love  become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal' film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression. Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye. While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well. His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldn't be made today. No amount of insurance would cover it. Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General' with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own. All these stunts are fantastic, but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.  `The General' is a lot more than slapstick. Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies  it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton  or, for that matter, a silent film  go find this one and watch it. It's a classic.

,Loco and Motive,"No one will top Keaton for physical risk, and risk is what deep film experiences are all about. This might be classed as a comedy, but for me it touches deeply enough. Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true. And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true. True to the spirit of the social compact, here displayed as the chummy south.He's always done stunts that amaze. Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off, he'd be seriously injured, or die. But this takes the cake. Its almost as if he started with the idea that he'd have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts. And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous. And so, so very effective. His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness. Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that 1) they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and 2) the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stunts.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",loco motive,no one will top keaton physical risk risk is what deep film experiences are all about this might be classed as comedy but me it touches deeply enough its about man who needs prove himself by taking risks being true its by man who takes even greater risks is more true true spirit social compact here displayed as chummy south hes always done stunts that amaze many his other films have things them that if timing were only little off hed be seriously injured or die but this takes cake its almost as if he started with idea that hed have three locos play with had year think up stunts stunts are so physical so dangerous so so very effective his trademark is deadpan face placed as sort innocent cluelessness its particularly funny when you see physical movements you know that 1 they take incredible preparation timing pull off 2 fellow you see that looks so puzzled by reality you see is guy that devised directed those stunts teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.5414761904761903,0.15669999999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Understated Perfection,"Buster Keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian, he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It's no wonder he adored trains, the most elegant of machines, and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton's former gag-writers loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War, he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this ""page of history"" to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be ""so authentic it hurts."" He even insisted on using historically accurate narrow-gauge railroad tracks, which he found, along with appropriate landscapes, near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove, Oregon.Most importantly, the area had stretches of parallel tracks, which allowed scenes of Buster on his train-agilely scrambling over the cars, balancing on the roof to scan the horizon, chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind him-to be filmed from another train running alongside. Buster, his train, and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Buster's hair while smoky pine-covered hills rise and fall around him. These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures, and they put to shame all later back-projection and process shots, models and computer-generated effects. The quality of Keaton's film-making is simply-pun intended-unparalleled. Every shot in The General is clean, fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional, just like the grave, masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniforms.The General's narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. Like a train, it stays on track, never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. Adapting the historical incident, Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train (Johnnie Gray), rather than one of the raiders. As he saw immediately, The General is one long chase, or rather two chases, structured like the flight of a boomerang. First Johnnie on a borrowed train, the Texas, chases his own stolen train, the General. He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines, pursued by the raiders in the Texas, who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.The General is not Keaton's funniest film, but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs. A number of the gags, like the box-car that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks, have a long build-up for a relatively modest payoff. But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe, and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings. The cannon attached to the back of Buster's train goes off just as the train starts around a curve, so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders' train coming out of the curve. Riding on the cowcatcher, Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks, striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way. A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his train's wheels, so lost in thought he doesn't notice when the train starts to move, carrying him up and down in gentle arcs: stillness in motion.I agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keaton's most personal film, the one that best captures his unique vision, spirit and personality. In many of his films, Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero. But his competent, ingenious and athletic character in The General, who is also modest, tireless, and underestimated, comes much closer to his real nature. There is a shot in The General of Buster's eye isolated on screen, framed by a hole in a white table-cloth, that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertov's kinoglaz, the ""camera-eye."" Keaton melds with his camera; there's no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies. They have the same silence, the same strictness, the same strange blend of gravity and humor.The General might be the most serious comedy every made, but it's not a tragicomedy. That, as in Chaplin's blending of pathos and low humor, was something people took to immediately. But no one knew what to make of The General. Original reviews accused the film of being dull, pretentious, unoriginal, and unfunny. Even today, people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing. The General is challenging because it doesn't flaunt its virtues; like Keaton's concise and economical performance, it holds a great deal in reserve. Take the movie's most famous shot, of a train crashing through a burning bridge, for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train. The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film: he doesn't dwell on it or hype it. Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience, never manipulates, never overplays. He doesn't show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents, nor does he play for sympathy. Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold. But for those who can see the expressiveness of Buster's so-called ""stone face,"" who get his peculiar dry humor, who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed, these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated. Buster Keaton always has more than he's showing; you can see it in his eyes.",understated perfection,buster keaton once said that if he hadnt been comedian he might have been civil engineer he was not

10.0,The Greatest War Comedy ?,"It is ""generally"" (or should I pun and say ""General Lee""?) said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keaton's career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL. Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects, it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past, but getting the correct rolling stock, costumes, weapons, and props to make it look correct. And it worked so well that Keaton never really could (despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR.) out-do it. In fact, the closest thing to his best sound film (or film that he influenced that was a sound film) was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE, where he returned to a Civil War theme.THE GENERAL (as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE) is based on the ""Andrews Raiders"" stealing of the Confederate locomotive ""The General"", and an attached train, which was used to damage tracks and bridges. The raid (in February 1862) was from northern Georgia into Tennesee. It only lasted 20 miles, as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced. Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial. Others went to southern prisoner of war camps. The effect of the incident far outstripped it's military success. The damage (after all) could be repaired. But like Jimmy Doolittle's Raid over Tokyo in April 1942, it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale. The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time, and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public. Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhile.Despite it being a brief incident of the war, the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten. The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south. When Lesney did it famous series of ""Models of Yesteryear"" the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was ""The General"".The story, however, was ultimately a downer. But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period. First he changes the viewer's perspective - it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men, but on the Confederates. Secondly, he builds up the story of Johnny Gray, a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected (the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier). Because Keaton's family and girl friend (Marion Mack) see he is not enlisted, they believe he turned coward.Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake ""the General"" from the raiders, and the film has actually two chases in it - first Andrews and his men stealing the train, and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it.Along the way are many comic classic moments, such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train, or when (at a moment of dejection) Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions. The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase, and finding Marion Mack there ""helping"" him, are wonderful - especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired (she throws away the ugly little ones). Keaton's reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful moment.The classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river, and the burning of the railroad bridge (with it's destruction of a second locomotive). It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history. By the way, the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest. He was Mike ""Turkey Strut"" Donlin, a frequent member (and starring player) of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the 20th Century. Donlin (who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases) left baseball to become a film actor (he had worked a bit in vaudeville). Keaton was a sports fan (and showed this in his film COLLEGE, where he shows his abilities in several sports) and hired Donlin. This was the latter's most famous performance - look at his reaction to the collapse.It must be regarded as Keaton's finest film, and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period. It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures.",greatest war comedy,it is generally or should i pun say general lee said that best comedy silent film career buster keatons career was his civil war epic general apparently planned with more care than any his other film projects it involved not only researching period history some sixty years past but getting correct rolling stock costumes weapons props make it look correct it worked so well that keaton never really could despite some great moments steamboat bill jr out do it fact closest thing his best sound film or film that he influenced that was sound film was his work with red skelton comedy southern yankee where he returned civil war theme general as i mentioned discussing disney film great locomotive chase is based andrews raiders stealing confederate locomotive general attached train which was used damage tracks bridges raid february 1862 was northern georgia into tennesee it only lasted 20 miles as coal train was used up not replaced andrews several raiders were hanged after trial others went southern prisoner war camps effect incident far outstripped its military success damage after all could be repaired but like jimmy doolittles raid over tokyo april 1942 it had tremendous effect hurting confederate morale area attacked was hundreds miles battlefronts virginia or kentucky northern tennessee that were current events war at time so was considered safe by confederate government public instead it had been shown quite easy northern raiders hit run awhile despite it being brief incident war locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten actual locomotive is still existence museum south when lesney did it famous series models yesteryear first locomotive that was included that series collectible toys was general story however was ultimately downer but keaton took basic tale made it comedy period first he changes viewers perspective it is not concentrating andrews his men but confederates secondly he builds up story johnny gray railroad engineer who tries enlist but is rejected twist logic failure script is that confederate draft board head does not bother explain johnny that he is more useful as engineer cause than as soldier because keatons family girl friend marion mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned coward johnny eventually is only person who tries retake general raiders film has actually two chases it first andrews his men stealing train then keaton sneaking into northern lines with mack retaking it along way are many comic classic moments such as keaton carefully standing cowcatcher carefully using physics knock off broken wooden ties that might derail train or when at moment dejection keaton sits connecting rod that links trains wheels finds himself pulled into locomotive barn while sitting positions situation fighting yankees during second chase finding marion mack there helping him are wonderful especially when she judges which lumps coal are pretty enough be used keep engine fired she throws away ugly little ones keatons reaction her stupidity is wonderful moment classic conclusion comedy is battle two sides at river burning railroad bridge with its destruction second locomotive it has been called most expensive sight gag history by way northern general who ordered locomotive across bridge is some special interest he was mike turkey strut donlin frequent member starring player old new york giants under john mcgraw christy matthewson first two decades 20th century donlin who got his funny nickname way he ran bases left baseball become film actor he had worked bit vaudeville keaton was sports fan showed this his film college where he shows his abilities several sports hired donlin this was latters most famous performance look at his reaction collapse it must be regarded as keatons finest film certainly best war comedy come out silent period it may also be best war comedy come out any period motion pictures,0.4728129013843299,0.16938834974549263,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9.0,It is more appreciated now than when it was released,"This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because ""Flesh and the Devil"" was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton's other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won't speak to him again until he is in uniform.Meanwhile, the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Buster's train. Unknown to Buster, his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft. Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train, still without the knowledge of his girl's captivity by the Union army.Forgotten with the arrival of sound, the film revived - often cut up from its original length - in the 1950's because Buster didn't preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today, often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment.Today The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films, and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too. SHERLOCK, JR. is clever. OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious. The General is both of these things. It's story driven, races to a climax, and is fueled by cute, clever, inventive gags.Buster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in ""A Southern Yankee"".",it is more appreciated now than when it was released,this film flopped when it was released late 1926 several reasons first its premiere was delayed because flesh devil was such sensation that it was held over extra couple weeks second people came movies see buster keaton comedian not buster filmmaker director which is more role he played here film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many keatons other films keaton plays railroad engineer living south title card declares he has two loves his girl his engine when civil war starts he tries enlist but is considered too valuable be army due his profession his girlfriend misunderstands thinks him coward says she wont speak him again until he is uniform meanwhile union forces have developed plan crush south that involves stealing busters train unknown buster his girlfriend is train at time theft buster starts out hot pursuit thieves retrieve his train still without knowledge his girls captivity by union army forgotten with arrival sound film revived often cut up its original length 1950s because buster didnt preserve his rights film it fell into public domain that is reason there are so many versions general out there today often with poor video hideous musical accompaniment today general is considered one best silent feature length films one few silent films not only be dvd but get blu ray treatment too sherlock jr is clever our hospitality is hilarious general is both these things its story driven races climax is fueled by cute clever inventive gags buster recycled these gags when he was writer mgm years later southern yankee,0.4504385964912281,0.14364035087719296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,"Wonderful Humor, Action, & Melodrama","One of the great masterpieces of cinema, Buster Keaton's ""The General"" combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama, all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed. It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching. As an extra bonus, it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era, with many realistic details, inspired by a historical incident.After a short opening sequence, the movie divides nicely into two halves. Johnny (Keaton) is a railway engineer, turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl. Continuing with the railroad, one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies, who also kidnap his girl. Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it, and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home. Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun, with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in. It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touches.Keaton is at his best, with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents.

,Richly inventive comedy with a logically impeccable plot that makes the hyperbolic slapstick seem plausible and inevitable; this is a work of art and a work of genius,"Buster Keaton's ""The General,"" about a man and his engine, puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen. From major comic situations to throwaway gags, ""The General"" always knows what to do.The story begins in leisurely fashion. A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray (Keaton) has two loves in his life: his engine and his girlrespectively, The General and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle, followed by two engineer-worshipping boys and, unknown to him, Annabelle Lee herself. He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs, slicks back his hair, and gently taps the door with the door knocker. Then he turns to notice Annabelle. Keaton's understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness. Any other comedian would have done an explosive double-take.Now Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor, but the boys are there, too. Johnnie stands up, puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave. The hero-worshippers are ready to follow, but Johnnie lets them out first, then closes the door on them. This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy. At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pants.Now the two are alone. Annabelle's father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon: the War Between the States has begun. Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist, then turns expectantly to Johnnie, who cocks his head like a confused puppy. She asks, ""Aren't you going to enlist?"" Realization hits him, and he leaps off the seat. Before he can run out the door, Annabelle kisses him. This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porch.Johnnie races to the general store, which is now a makeshift recruitment office. Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line. The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions, and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again. He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation, but the man rejects him. Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Later, Annabelle believes that Johnnie didn't even try to enlist. She refuses to speak to him again until he's in uniform. What follows is a classic moment: Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine. He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down, until just before the train enters a tunnel.Time passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General. When (nearly) everyone is off the train having dinner, the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine. Annabelle, a passenger herself, was still on board. She is now their prisoner.But Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen, possibly by deserters. He pursues the engine by taking another, The Texas. Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas, but the Unionists think they're outnumbered and continue to run. What follows is the true joy of the movie: two long chases (separated by an important plot twist). Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop action.I love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas. At one point, the car, which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track, reappears in front of the baffled engineer, only to disappear later just as mysteriously. We see the logical circumstances that lead to the car's seeming magic act, and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied, preventing him from seeing what we see.Comic logic is important to ""The General."" In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable. In a throwaway gag, Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack. Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for it.We move to the second chase, where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him. Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle Lee.Marion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen. She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it. Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around, trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was. She has hilarious moments. The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine. An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire. She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in. Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver, and she puts that in, too. Then, in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping, Johnnie grabs her and half-throttles her before kissing her instead.The final section, most of it a battle scene, includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge, only to crash into the river. Owing to Keaton's disdain of fakery (one of several reasons his works seem modern) he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge. The crash cost $42,000reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent film.A worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keaton's ingenuity. Johnnie's dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers. His remedy is only mildly funny. Is anyone complaining?

7.0,"""If you lose this war, don't blame me"".","I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film, but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number #17 on the 2007 version of AFI's Top 100 Movies of all time list. It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997, so even before seeing the picture, I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases, but I have to admit, I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion, but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy, so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side, I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either, so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.What I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. When Johnnie Gray (Keaton) dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army, and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod, the resulting visual was pure genius. The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnie's thoughtful reverie, and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.The other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge. For starters, I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film, and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb - unbelievable.Oh yes, and I can't forget the sequence where Keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks, flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a pre-CGI world, it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed, particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. For that, Keaton deserves accolades.In between all this clever film making however, I just wasn't inspired. The central plot element doesn't hold up for me - if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer, why wasn't he simply told the reason why. One could argue that then, you wouldn't have a picture, but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier, the picture might have taken a different approach, but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. Maybe I'm second guessing a master, but that's what I come away with.Conclusion - if this movie didn't make AFI's Top 100 Film List in 1997, I don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top 20. At the same time, Chaplin's ""City Lights"", in my estimation a superior silent film, fell OFF the list, while ""The Gold Rush"" moved up a few notches. I may not be a professional, but I know what I like, and this one just didn't do it for me.",if you lose this war dont blame me,i would have eventually gotten around watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when i saw that it had miraculously jumped number 2007 version afis top 100 movies all time list it didnt make cut at all original compilation 1997 so even before seeing picture i had wonder what might have affected movie critics intervening decade reach this conclusion i usually line up with majority most cases but i have admit i dont quite get it with this picture i found it entertaining enough occasion but i never got sense that it was one great comedy classics all time way its heralded dvd sleeve i dont think civil war lends itself much comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced keatons somber demeanor generally stone faced disposition dont help flip side i wouldnt have expected slapstick move story along either so at least i wasnt disappointed that regard what i did enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity when johnnie gray keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by confederate army pondered his situation while sitting trains connecting rod resulting visual was pure genius up down motion lent truly surreal juxtaposition johnnies thoughtful reverie was one highlights picture me other significant scene that gave me pause was when texas collapsed burning rock river bridge starters i found it unbelievable that wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough support locomotive then i came learn that scene was most expensive ever made silent film i have give keaton credit going out that kind limb unbelievable oh yes i cant forget sequence where keatons marksmanship is dead when he makes contact with rail tie blocking train tracks flipping it out way with well timed throw his own could that have possibly been done one take pre cgi world its difficult imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by actor who had no recourse but do his own that keaton deserves accolades between all this clever film making however i just wasnt inspired central plot element doesnt hold up me if johnnie gray was rejected as volunteer why wasnt he simply told reason why one could argue that then you wouldnt have picture but me it left story shaky footing if johnnie was more valuable as train engineer than soldier picture might have taken different approach but rest elements could have remained same he still would have come out hero maybe im second guessing master but thats what i come away with conclusion if this movie didnt make afis top 100 film list 1997 i dont understand what might have occurred intervening years suddenly have film critics vault it into top 20 at same time chaplins city lights my estimation superior silent film fell off list while gold rush moved up few notches i may not be professional but i know what i like this one just didnt do it me,0.5207323865218603,0.12285575048732941,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Keaton is in top form,"I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and that makes this review VERY difficult, because I really can't decide which of these two films is better. To me, they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed--at least when it comes to stunts and laughs. It's sad really, as just after these two triumphs came the sound era--and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career, as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material--pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante. This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the plot. And, for once, I have nothing critical to say about the film. No matter how many times I see it, it just seems perfect. This might just be my favorite silent comedy--period. It's that good. However, as this IS more plot-driven than most of his films, don't expect the rapid-fire laughs--there is a lot of set-up and story instead. This is NOT a complaint--just don't expect the pacing of his shorts--which, incidentally, you won't find in any of the full-length films.By the way, while all is practically perfect in every way about this film, this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film. While not as funny or filled with amazing stunts, OUR HOSPITALITY is an amazing film for its artistry. In addition to being the prettiest of his films, it also features among the best characterization for Keaton--with a full and rich plot. My advice is to see THE GENERAL and OUR HOSPITALITY and see two very different and probably equally great films from a master.",keaton is top form,i just wrote review steamboat bill jr that makes this review very difficult because i really cant decide which these two films is better me they are both nearly perfect represent best full length material keaton performed at least when it comes stunts laughs its sad really as just after these two triumphs came sound era seriously negative down turn keatons career as mgm repeatedly gave him terrible material pairing him with brash inappropriate humor jimmy durante this film is probably best his films when it comes concept consistency plot once i have nothing critical say about film no matter how many times i see it it just seems perfect this might just be my favorite silent comedy period its that good however as this is more plot driven than most his films dont expect rapid fire laughs there is lot set up story instead this is not complaint just dont expect pacing his shorts which incidentally you wont find any full length films by way while all is practically perfect every way about this film this is not my favorite keaton full length film while not as funny or filled with amazing stunts our hospitality is amazing film its artistry addition being prettiest his films it also features among best characterization keaton with full rich plot my advice is see general our hospitality see two very different probably equally great films master,0.62997150997151,0.32101139601139606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Deserves its reputation: a masterwork.,"Buster Keaton's love of history, engineering and operatic displays of action are put to their finest use in his masterwork, The General. However unwelcoming the concept of an incredibly accurate historical movie about the civil war may seem, or a title which refers to an army rank, rest assured that The General is imbued throughout with a wonderful sense of fun, as with all Keaton. The pervasive irony running through The General is the fact that little Buster is helping fight the civil war just by happenstance - all he really wants to do is save his girlfriend. The appeal of The General may lie in its ability to take you back to what it would have been like in frontier America, its remarkable visual beauty (incredible cinematography), or possibly Keaton's trademark operatic stunts, the climax of this movie which is one of his most impressive (the famous bridge scene was the most expensive shot in all of silent cinema).But the thing which makes this and all Keaton films a joy to watch is the irrepressible charm and appeal of his onscreen persona. You just can't help liking little Buster, and rooting for him in all the troubles he happens to fall into. 5 stars from me - one of the all time greats.",deserves its reputation masterwork,buster keatons love history engineering operatic displays action are put their finest use his masterwork general however unwelcoming concept incredibly accurate historical movie about civil war may seem or title which refers army rank rest assured that general is imbued throughout with wonderful sense fun as with all keaton pervasive irony running through general is fact that little buster is helping fight civil war just by happenstance all he really wants do is save his girlfriend appeal general may lie its ability take you back what it would have been like frontier america its remarkable visual beauty incredible cinematography or possibly keatons trademark operatic stunts climax this movie which is one his most impressive famous bridge scene was most expensive shot all silent cinema but thing which makes this all keaton films joy watch is irrepressible charm appeal his onscreen persona you just cant help liking little buster rooting him all troubles he happens fall into 5 stars me one all time greats,0.507051282051282,0.22980769230769232,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,The Greatest Comedy Ever Made,"THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished. From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique, THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy. Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story. The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier, but as a train engineer. However, his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform. After the war has started, the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keaton's train, and so begins the greatest (and funniest) chase ever filmed. For the next 75 minutes, the viewer is in Keaton's world.

8.0,Keaton Mans the Fort.,"The General (1926): Dir: Buster Keaton / Cast: Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender, Jim Farley, Frederick Vroom: High profile silent film about one's personal perspective. Buster Keaton plays locomotive engineer Johnnie Gray who desires to join the Confederate army alongside his fiancé's father and brother but he is refused when he becomes too important to his job. His fiancé, Annabelle is misinformed and claims that she will not marry him until he is in uniform. A year passes and her father is wounded. She travels to see him but the enemy takes over the locomotive and takes her hostage. Gray gives chase and many hysterical physical sight jokes occur. Keaton is a brilliant physical comic, as seen in his clever Sherlock Jr. He meets all obstacles on the track while also trying to prevent the enemy from conquest any further. Keaton performs stunts that are far beyond normal and prevails to huge payoff. Unfortunately he is carrying the film by himself because other characters are a bore. Marion Mack as Annabelle is the standard damsel whose personality is shallow given her reasons for splitting with him in the first place. The villains are just targets for prat falls and never emerge as frightening or interesting. That aside, Keaton creates a film with action, including massive chase scenes and explosive production values that were led into a future that had forgotten how it all began.

6.0,The Locomotion,"To me Buster Keaton is more unknown compared to his other silent era rivals like Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplain whose work were shown more often on British television. Maybe Chaplain is more appreciated in Britain because he was British.The General is an epic silent comedy and at the time was an expensive undertaking comprising of many extras, dangerous stunts and a steam engine falling from a burning bridge.Set during the Civil War Keaton plays a devoted train engineer called Johnny Gray who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girl and is turned down because he is more valuable as an engineer but no one tells him that was the reason.His girl think he is a coward who refused to join and will have nothing to do with him until he shows up in uniform. Some months later his beloved steam engine his stolen by Unionist soldiers and in a serious of escapades he tries to recover it and also rescue his girl.It is an elaborate chase film with for the time some clever sequences and slapstick. However it does go on too long as a chase film and despite some flourishes it does not showcase Keaton's acrobatic skills as much as I desired.The film was inspired by a true incident but to a modern viewer you still feel ill at ease that even 90 years ago the Confederate South was somehow being painted as heroic.",locomotion,me buster keaton is more unknown compared his other silent era rivals like harold lloyd or charlie chaplain whose work were shown more often british television maybe chaplain is more appreciated britain because he was british general is epic silent comedy at time was expensive undertaking comprising many extras dangerous stunts steam engine falling burning bridge set during civil war keaton plays devoted train engineer called johnny gray who tries enlist confederate army impress his girl is turned down because he is more valuable as engineer but no one tells him that was reason his girl think he is coward who refused join will have nothing do with him until he shows up uniform some months later his beloved steam engine his stolen by unionist soldiers serious escapades he tries recover it also rescue his girl it is elaborate chase film with time some clever sequences slapstick however it does go too long as chase film despite some flourishes it does not showcase keatons acrobatic skills as much as i desired film was inspired by true incident but modern viewer you still feel ill at ease that even 90 years ago confederate south was somehow being painted as heroic,0.47712962962962974,0.10342592592592594,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"

Wanting to join the Confederacy, he is instead turned down because the government believes he is more valuable as an engineer.

9.0,The Great Locomotive Chase,"THE GENERAL (United Artists, 1926), written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, is an acclaimed comedy masterpiece from the bygone silent era that is essentially a Civil War comedy, or, a comedy set during the Civil War reportedly based on the historic Andrews Raid. THE GENERAL isn't the military rank of Keaton's on screen character, but actually one of the two loves of his life: his locomotive called The General; and his girlfriend, Annabelle Lee (Marian Mack).In a prologue that begins in Marietta, Georgia, in the year 1861, Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) is a train engineer who finds time to court Annabelle Lee (Marian Mack). While at her home, her brother (Frank Barnes) barges in with the news that Fort Sumpter has been attacked, thus the start of the war between the states. Annabelle's brother rushes out to enlist into the Army. Expecting Johnnie to enlist for the Southern cause, Annabelle becomes disappointed with him when she is told by her brother that Johnnie didn't even bother to go on line, but in reality, has tried to enlist and was turned down for service because he is believed more valuable as a railway engineer. But poor Johnnie hasn't even been told of his rejection. Spurning him a coward, Annabelle breaks off her engagement with Johnnie. A year later, Captain Anderson (Glen Cavender), a Northern spy, makes plans on disguising himself as a Southern civilian, and, along with his followers, seize a Confederate locomotive to head North in order to destroy all communication lines along the right of way. The Union seize The General, and Annabelle, who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Being a witness to the abduction, the great chase begins when Johnnie pursues the enemy by taking another locomotive to rescue Annabelle, which takes him to enemy lines. After saving Annabelle and retrieving his own locomotive, the chase resumes in reverse when Johnnie finds himself being pursued by the enemy, later climaxed by a well staged gun battle with the Confederate Army by his side.What makes THE GENERAL so essentially remarkable is that it's a straight forward story based on fact, and listed among one of the greatest comedies of all time. Keaton takes actual occurrences and builds comic gags around it. While he and his co-star, Marian Mack, each play helpless individuals, both perform their roles seriously and succeed into making their characters both real and funny. Keaton's confused facial gestures are more than enough to make this a worthwhile ride of fun.THE GENERAL is full of memorable highlights, including Keaton's attempt to utilize a cannon to attack the enemy train ahead that slowly lowers itself into aiming directly at our hero; Keaton losing the use of his handcar and seizing a bicycle with a huge front wheel, and not going very far with it; and a tense moment where, while being pursued by the enemy, Keaton, who safely reaches the other side by riding his locomotive across a wooden bridge, gets off to set fire to it, with the fiercely Union general giving command to the train's engineer to proceed across the burning bridge, only to soon realize that it will not hold up under the crossing; among others. Reportedly filmed on location and not in a studio back-lot, THE GENERAL captures the period flavor from the Civil War era, providing laughter in what would not be common place for comedy.Also seen in the supporting cast are Charles Smith as Annabelle's father; James Farley as Captain Thatcher; Frank Hagney as the Recruiting Officer; and Joe Keaton as a Confederate Officer.THE GENERAL, hailed as Buster Keaton's personal favorite of all his movies, which was not critically acclaimed at the time of its release, became one of 13 selected feature films shown on public television's 1971 presentation of THE SILENT YEARS, hosted by Orson Welles, with a copy print from the Paul Killiam collection and piano score by William P. Perry. Over the years, THE GENERAL has stood the test of time, winning new viewers of appreciation to this now Keaton masterpiece. Later distributed on video cassette by various distributors (and later DVD), THE GENERAL can be seen in either in black and white or with color tints, different time lengths (the majority being at 76 minutes), and with different music tracks, ranging from organ to orchestra l scores.

8.0,Silent era comedy classic,"1862, Georgia, USA. The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting. He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army. This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle, who views him as a coward. Then his beloved engine, The General, is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines. Moreover, Annabelle is on board. Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his life.Great comedy from the silent era, directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era, Buster Keaton. This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thought-out and performed physical comedy and other sight gags. Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedy.The plot itself isn't overly profound, but crams in a lot of action and adventure, plus some romance.Very entertaining.",silent era comedy classic,1862 georgia usa american civil war is its second year johnnie gray is barred enlisting he is train engineer confederate army feel he is more valuable southern cause his current role than army this frustrates johnnie has estranged him his sweetheart annabelle who views him as coward then his beloved engine general is stolen by union spies is heading union lines moreover annabelle is board johnnie sets off after two loves his life great comedy silent era directed starring one greatest comedy directors actors that era buster keaton this is rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thought out performed physical comedy other sight gags some very clever use plot generate comedy plot itself isnt overly profound but crams lot action adventure plus some romance very entertaining,0.4722261904761905,0.26208333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.56}"
8.0,"""If you lose this war don't blame me.""","It was an early Saturday afternoon, and I was searching about for a light-hearted comedic adventure film to keep me amused until dinner was ready. My eyes suddenly fell upon 'The General,' starring the inimitable Buster Keaton, and released in 1927. I had never seen it before, but  having greatly enjoyed the absolutely hilarious 'Sherlock Jr.' of three years earlier  I was more than willing to give it a shot. On its initial release, 'The General' was a mammoth box office flop, by and large disparaged by the critics, though time has been kind to the film. Today, it is rightly considered a comedy masterpiece, and is often the first stepping-stone for newcomers to discover the treasure-trove of silent comedic classics released by ""The Great Stone Face.""Johnny Gray is Keaton's usual glum-faced character, a young man with courage, bravery and a thirst to prove himself, but ultimately without the means to do so. First in line to join the American Civil War to fight the Union, Johnny is turned away at the enlisting office due to his importance as a railway engineer, and he suffers the shame of not being able to fight with his fellow countrymen. Aside from his engine, The General  a type 4-4-0 steam locomotive  Johnny has but one love, Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). However, when she is wrongly told that Johnny never even stood in line to enlist, she believes him to be a coward, and refuses to be with him until he is in uniform.One year on, Johnny finally stumbles upon a means to prove himself, when Union Army spies (headed by prolific silent film actor Glen Cavender) hijack his beloved General, and Annabelle finds herself a prisoner at the mercy of a group of cunning and unpredictable soldiers. Determined to recover what he loves, Johnny single-handedly gives chase, acquiring another locomotive, The Texas, to assist in the cross-country chase, which is based on true events. Facing setbacks at every turn in the railway, Johnny must use every inch of intellect he possesses in order to outwit his adversaries, rescue his loved ones (both the General and Annabelle) and save the day for the Confederacy.Technically, 'The General' is a cinematic marvel. A considerable portion of the movie was filmed on an actual moving train (you'll find no miniature plastic models here), and the actors  especially Buster Keaton  do a remarkable job of completing their performances with the additional burden of wind, motion and the potentially fatal consequences of a single misstep. As in all his films, Keaton's dedication to the medium is instantly apparent, with his character completing a wide assortment of hair-raising stunts, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow moving train while holding a railroad tie, and running along the roof. The final climactic crash of the locomotive, in which a bridge crumbles as the Texas attempts to cross it, was the single most ambitious and expensive scene of the silent era.The laughs come thick and fast, with Johnny persevering forwards despite any number of obstacles that may come his way. The film does slow down a bit during its centre portion, namely because there is temporarily not a train in sight, but, once Johnny manages to reclaim his General, things get exciting again. The second half of the film is a complete reversal of the first, with Johnny now at the helm of the locomotive being chased. Some absurdly-dangerous stunt work, and some high-speed railway thrills, makes this ride a highly entertaining one.'The General' is currently sitting in the public domain. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows practically anybody to access a copy of the film, whether it be on DVD or the internet, increasing public awareness of Keaton's films and perhaps even inspiring an interest in the silent classics that are too often neglected. On the other hand, being in the public demand means that any distributor can digitize a poor-quality print and sell it as 'The General' to make a few quick dollars. The version I uncovered was decent enough, but the soundtrack was a rather random assortment of classical music, which was passable but not ideal. Needless to say, if I were to ever encounter a high-quality print of the film, I would have absolutely no hesitation in purchasing it.",if you lose this war dont blame me,it was early saturday afternoon i was searching about light hearted comedic adventure film keep me amused until dinner was ready my eyes suddenly fell upon general starring inimitable buster keaton released 1927 i had never seen it before but having greatly enjoyed absolutely hilarious sherlock jr three years earlier i was more than willing give it shot its initial release general was mammoth box office flop by large disparaged by critics though time has been kind film today it is rightly considered comedy masterpiece is often first stepping stone newcomers discover treasure trove silent comedic classics released by great stone face johnny gray is keatons usual glum faced character young man with courage bravery thirst prove himself but ultimately without means do so first line join american civil war fight union johnny is turned away at enlisting office due his importance as railway engineer he suffers shame not being able fight with his fellow countrymen aside his engine general type 4 4 0 steam locomotive johnny has but one love annabelle lee marion mack however when she is wrongly told that johnny never even stood line enlist she believes him be coward refuses be with him until he is uniform one year johnny finally stumbles upon means prove himself when union army spies headed by prolific silent film actor glen cavender hijack his beloved general annabelle finds herself prisoner at mercy group cunning unpredictable soldiers determined recover what he loves johnny single handedly gives chase acquiring another locomotive texas assist cross country chase which is based true events facing setbacks at every turn railway johnny must use every inch intellect he possesses order outwit his adversaries rescue his loved ones both general annabelle save day confederacy technically general is cinematic marvel considerable portion movie was filmed actual moving train youll find no miniature plastic models here actors especially buster keaton do remarkable job completing their performances with additional burden wind motion potentially fatal consequences single misstep as all his films keatons dedication medium is instantly apparent with his character completing wide assortment hair raising stunts including jumping engine tender boxcar sitting cow catcher slow moving train while holding railroad tie running along roof final climactic crash locomotive which bridge crumbles as texas attempts cross it was single most ambitious expensive scene silent era laughs come thick fast with johnny persevering forwards despite any number obstacles that may come his way film does slow down bit during its centre portion namely because there is temporarily not train sight but once johnny manages reclaim his general things get exciting again second half film is complete reversal first with johnny now at helm locomotive being chased some absurdly dangerous stunt work some high speed railway thrills makes this ride highly entertaining one general is currently sitting public domain this is double edged sword one hand it allows practically anybody access copy film whether it be dvd or internet increasing public awareness keatons films perhaps even inspiring interest silent classics that are too often neglected other hand being public demand means that any distributor can digitize poor quality print sell it as general make few quick dollars version i uncovered was decent enough but soundtrack was rather random assortment classical music which was passable but not ideal needless say if i were ever encounter high quality print film i would have absolutely no hesitation purchasing it,0.48857480580884854,0.06099459642012832,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,Good Show,"Enjoyed ""The General"" and it was a quick 70 minutes. Buster Keaton, of course, is from another era, when motion pictures were more visual (before sound). They relied on sight gags and optical wizardry and ""The General"" succeeds in spades.Haven't really seen much of Buster Keaton but his stunt work was impressive, even if his deadpan brand of humor is an acquired taste. The film is very good but I would stop short of calling it one of the all-time greats, as the TCM host claimed. But the story moved at a good pace and was interesting and absorbing.

10.0,Keaton shows why he was king of comedy stunts,"""The General"" is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era. It's among the best movies of the talented comedy actor, Buster Keaton. In this film, Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts. His physical antics on and off his train, The General, support his title as king of comedy stunts. All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy. And, many had daring, courage, and even madness at times. Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts. While there were some stunt men around in the early 1900s, it wasn't until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derring-do. And, while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts, nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own high-risk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors. The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Harold Lloyd, Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt. The latter two specialized in Westerns, and besides acting and doing stunt work, Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit. Lloyd was versatile in his venues, but excelled at high stunts on buildings, and sometimes with wild animals. Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts, sliding down the sails of ships, swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping (with the help of trampolines) into windows. Keaton was even more versatile. As a child actor in vaudeville, Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury. He called his technique, soft falls or landings. But even with his training and practice, his film roles with derring-do often left him bruised at the least. At other times, he had suffered injuries from slight to serious. Still, he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of ""The General"" in 1926, Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire. He suffered a broken ankle while filming the 1922 short, ""The Electric House."" And, he broke his neck during the 1924 shooting of ""Sherlock Jr.,"" but didn't know it until years later. This movie has an interesting plot, set during the U.S. Civil War. It opens with a scene and script that reads, ""The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia, in the spring of 1861."" The train seems to be traveling about 30 miles per hour. But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action, involving the train. There is an element of romance. The cast all are very good. The photography is superb. Much of the action with trains is filmed in West-central Oregon, from Eugene to Cottage Grove. There's no information about sound at all, so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing. It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day. This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better. The music seems to go overboard at times. This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of movie-making skills. It's a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy.",keaton shows why he was king comedy stunts,general is one great films treasures silent era its among best movies talented comedy actor buster keaton this film keaton shows athletic ability courage that made him one best early comedians who performed their own stunts his physical antics off his train general support his title as king comedy stunts all silent era comedy actors seemed have lots energy many had daring courage even madness at times those were actors who did all or most their own stunts while there were some stunt men around early 1900s it wasnt until last silent years dawn sound pictures that stuntmen were regular part cast films that required any amount derring do while small number actors today will still do some their own stunts nothing can compare actors old who performed their own high risk dangerous stunts sometimes those other actors five best early actors at doing stunts were buster keaton douglas fairbanks sr harold lloyd tom mix yakima canutt latter two specialized westerns besides acting doing stunt work mix canutt regularly rode performed rodeo circuit lloyd was versatile his venues but excelled at high stunts buildings sometimes with wild animals fairbanks excelled swashbuckler stunts sliding down sails ships swinging anything hanging aloft jumping with help trampolines into windows keaton was even more versatile as child actor vaudeville keaton learned how fall avoid injury he called his technique soft falls or landings but even with his training practice his film roles with derring do often left him bruised at least at other times he had suffered injuries slight serious still he had become known his physical resiliency during filming general 1926 keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire he suffered broken ankle while filming 1922 short electric house he broke his neck during 1924 shooting sherlock jr but didnt know it until years later this movie has interesting plot set during u s civil war it opens with scene script that reads western atlantic flyer speeding into marietta georgia spring 1861 train seems be traveling about 30 miles per hour but film is almost entirely about action comedy action involving train there is element romance cast all are very good photography is superb much action with trains is filmed west central oregon eugene cottage grove theres no information about sound at all so i assume music we hear with film is soundtrack that was added modern viewing it probably is meant replicate piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films theaters day this is one instance when i think piano playing would have been better music seems go overboard at times this is one early great films silent era that showcase talent early mastery movie making skills its fun movie with strong visuals that even modern family all ages should enjoy,0.3811127921997488,0.18924315619967788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,An instant favorite,"I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for a long time. The General is a silent comedy (mostly slapstick) about Johnny Gray, a train engineer with two loves: his engine and Annabelle Lee. Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War (they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer). Things are then sped up a year, where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan. As it so happens, they steal Johnny's engine, a big mistake.Buster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny. His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy. He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies (but, of course, less old). He is often ignorant of what is going on around him, leading to plenty of laughs. This also makes him a very charismatic character.There are countless train related jokes. The first one comes right at the beginning, when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman, in a line much like a train. The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train, either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers. The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful. The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment. The finale is explosive.The General was a lot of fun to watch. It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies, and had plenty of substance on top of that. This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever. After my first viewing, it instantly became one of my favorites. It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies.",instant favorite,i havent had so much fun watching movie long time general is silent comedy mostly slapstick about johnny gray train engineer with two loves his engine annabelle lee annabelle soon dumps him because his failure enlist into civil war they would not take him because he was too valuable as engineer things are then sped up year where we see some union commanders planning hijack train unleash highly sophisticated master plan as it so happens they steal johnnys engine big mistake buster keaton does phenomenal performance as johnny his face character is ideal this type comedy he reminds me lot leslie nielsen naked gun movies but course less old he is often ignorant what is going around him leading plenty laughs this also makes him very charismatic character there are countless train related jokes first one comes right at beginning when we see johnny being followed by two kids woman line much like train bulk movie is made up johnny running train either chasing or fleeing union soldiers movement maneuvering trains is beautiful stunt work is incredible accomplishment finale is explosive general was lot fun watch it gave me more laughs than most modern comedies had plenty substance top that this is enough me label it as one greatest comedies ever after my first viewing it instantly became one my favorites it is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested movies,0.5057823129251701,0.26292517006802724,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,One of the greatest silent pictures ever.,"One of the greatest silent pictures ever.It's a film that's mostly made on a train. The name of the protagonist is ""The General"". Well, the protagonist is non other than the train itself. So ""The General"" is the name of the train and not of our hero Buster Keaton who is named as Johnnie Gray.The storyline is pretty simple, it's a lover's test to prove his love. He applies for a job in military during the civil war of 1860's and is rejected. His girlfriend thinks he is unfit. He must disprove this and win his lover. The train acts a protagonist and the binding force in their love story. It's the one that brings them together. How? Well, go watch the film and I am sure you will have a laugh out loud them. I recommend that it's a must watch and please do it with all your family together. It's a laugh riot and a meaningful one. There are layers to this, emotions, love and above all a cute silliness that can be embraced effortlessly. Buster Keaton performs all the stunts by himself and stands tall in each one of them. Considering the fact that this was made in 1926, the content is original and we have seen only films inspired by this and made many years later. So this is one of the first films made entirely on a vehicle and the trip is not just fun, it's funny, lovely and supremely wonderful.I loved this film and will watch it many times over and will pass on to the next generation too. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films made in the history.

10.0,General Rapture,"Other viewers have pointed out this beautiful movie's visual, comedic, and dramatic strengths, so I'll just relate a particular moment. Keaton's character must keep the engine running at all costs, and he's furiously shoveling wood into the furnace. His girlfriend taps his shoulder, and idiotically hands him a tiny twig to feed it. He threatens, for a split second, to beat her senseless with it. Then he kisses her. Then he gets back to the immediate business of keeping the train going.Well, there you are. It's funny, it's tender, it's original, and I get teary thinking about it. Also note how visually sumptuous the movie is (as were a lot of late silents), like a series of Matthew Brady war photos in motion. Keaton never overdoes sentiment -- if anything, like his character, he shies away from it -- and yet it's an unusually heartfelt comedy, with the gravity of war and the sanctity of romance never very far beneath the surface.For what it's worth, the film wasn't that well reviewed at the time, and didn't perform very well at the box office.
