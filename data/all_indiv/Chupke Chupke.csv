,Sssssh - you have been framed!,"Decades before David Dhawan and Priyadarshan rediscovered comedy in Indian Cinema and began their barrage of outings, the undisputed emperors in this genre were Hrishikesh Mukhejee and Basu Chatterjee.Both relied heavily on creating a natural humour as opposed to what we witness today ie. mindless comedy/ situational comedy/ tongue-in-cheek comedy. And this very natural humour gives USP for ""Chupke Chupke"" repeat viewings.Dharmendra:: Dharmendra gets the lions share in ""Chupke Chupke"". He proves his versatility as an actor by doing comedy effortlessly. Om Prakash:: ""Chupke Chupke"" rests heavily on the performance from two actors namely Dharmendra and Om Prakash. If there was any short-coming from either, the entire proceedings would have fallen like a pack of cards. It goes without saying that it was fantastic performance from Mr. Om Prakash.Big B:: An extended special appearance compared to Dharmendra. The panic-attack prone professor and his inability to hold his nerves is brilliantly breathed to life by Amitabh. Lets not forget that this movie got released in the same year as ""Sholay"" and ""Deewar"" which casted his image of angry young man in stone. Talk about chalk-and-cheese!The rest of the star-cast namely Sharmila Tagore, Jaya Bhaduri, Asrani, David and Keshto lend adequate support. S D Burman's composition to Anand Bakshi's lyrics are a music for ears. As with most successful outings of Hrishda, Gulzar's gets involved to contribute his two-cents in the department of screenplay and dialogues and needless to say makes the movie flow seamlessly.Verdict:: Anytime is ""Chupke Chupke"" time!",sssssh you have been framed,decades before david dhawan priyadarshan rediscovered comedy indian cinema began their barrage outings undisputed emperors this genre were hrishikesh mukhejee basu chatterjee both relied heavily creating natural humour as opposed what we witness today ie mindless comedy situational comedy tongue cheek comedy this very natural humour gives usp chupke chupke repeat viewings dharmendra dharmendra gets lions share chupke chupke he proves his versatility as actor by doing comedy effortlessly om prakash chupke chupke rests heavily performance two actors namely dharmendra om prakash if there was any short coming either entire proceedings would have fallen like pack cards it goes without saying that it was fantastic performance mr om prakash big b extended special appearance compared dharmendra panic attack prone professor his inability hold his nerves is brilliantly breathed life by amitabh lets not forget that this movie got released same year as sholay deewar which casted his image angry young man stone talk about chalk cheese rest star cast namely sharmila tagore jaya bhaduri asrani david keshto lend adequate support s d burmans composition anand bakshis lyrics are music ears as with most successful outings hrishda gulzars gets involved contribute his two cents department screenplay dialogues needless say makes movie flow seamlessly verdict anytime is chupke chupke time,0.5362380952380952,0.11852380952380955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Hrishikesh Mukherjee shows his genius.,"Chupke Chupke is masterpiece by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, I love his style of story telling be it Bawarchi, Rang Birangi, Naram Garam, Golmaal, Khubsoorat, Buddha Mil Gaya, all of which are great movies. All his stories have very simple storyline, powerful cast, lots of human emotion and patriotism towards Indian culture and languages. Dharmendra is truly amazing, and so is Amitabh Bachchan and rest of the cast supports them well. Since most of the dialogs are in pure Hindi, some people may find it difficult to follow. Hrishikesh Mukherjee through his movies and characters always pointed to some aspect or the other of the lives of Indian people, and hence all his characters always feel very real and get deep inside your skin and you become a part of the act. The practical joke played by a Botany professor on his brother-in-law is the focus of the movie, as pointed out by other commenter. Chupke Chupke is a film in which the dialogs combine with the situations to collectively impart the comic momentum to the movie which persist till the very last minute, very very entertaining film, highly recommended for the entire family. If you liked this movie, then do give the movies mentioned at the beginning a shot, you would thank me later. :) also highly recommended.",hrishikesh mukherjee shows his genius,chupke chupke is masterpiece by hrishikesh mukherjee i love his style story telling be it bawarchi rang birangi naram garam golmaal khubsoorat buddha mil gaya all which are great movies all his stories have very simple storyline powerful cast lots human emotion patriotism towards indian culture languages dharmendra is truly amazing so is amitabh bachchan rest cast supports them well since most dialogs are pure hindi some people may find it difficult follow hrishikesh mukherjee through his movies characters always pointed some aspect or other lives indian people hence all his characters always feel very real get deep inside your skin you become part act practical joke played by botany professor his brother law is focus movie as pointed out by other commenter chupke chupke is film which dialogs combine with situations collectively impart comic momentum movie which persist till very last minute very very entertaining film highly recommended entire family if you liked this movie then do give movies mentioned at beginning shot you would thank me later also highly recommended,0.5407596371882086,0.20210884353741498,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,A brilliant comedy of secrecy,"A newly married professor implements an amusing plan for getting introduced with the family of his elder brother-in-law under false pretense. It is approved by his wife and actively supported by a few friends. The couple doubly enjoys the secrecy. They continue the whole plan of joking tricks until it becomes enough. Otherwise, they enjoy the desperate love relation in a climate of adventurous hiding.A prolonged play of secret humor--the broad connotative meaning of the title-- does not lose its relish due to the compact screenplay, the excellent performances of the casts, proper editing, wonderful music by Sachin Deb Barman and a few other supportive constituents of the film. Though the social composition of the characters, the social nature of turns and twists of the sequences focus on the educated urban Indian middle class, the lucid narrative seems to communicate a stable flow of comedian pleasure to all viewers. The final revelation of the true identities among the characters is accelerated because of the maturity of a new love relation. The narrative seems to challenge softly some insensible social norms. It also expresses its deep conviction about love and honesty of individuals and obviously its trust on the creative capacity of intelligent and humorous individual.Any regular Indian film lover would enjoy the nice acting of at least four film stars--Dharmendra, Sharmila Tagore, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri-- in simple social images and appreciate director Hrishikesh Mukherjee for another successful experiment. The film makes the spectator reminiscent of the genre, which rarely used the very close and the very long shots and rapid cuts. In spite of a theatrical design of the screenplay it could provide the actors and the actresses with the greater scope of establishing their performing talents. The use of bright light and sustained delight of the romantic characters in the family drama--initiated by an unconventionally sensitive, urban, academic personality--makes the film a bright entertainment.",brilliant comedy secrecy,newly married professor implements amusing plan getting introduced with family his elder brother law under false pretense it is approved by his wife actively supported by few friends couple doubly enjoys secrecy they continue whole plan joking tricks until it becomes enough otherwise they enjoy desperate love relation climate adventurous hiding prolonged play secret humor broad connotative meaning title does not lose its relish due compact screenplay excellent performances casts proper editing wonderful music by sachin deb barman few other supportive constituents film though social composition characters social nature turns twists sequences focus educated urban indian middle class lucid narrative seems communicate stable flow comedian pleasure all viewers final revelation true identities among characters is accelerated because maturity new love relation narrative seems challenge softly some insensible social norms it also expresses its deep conviction about love honesty individuals obviously its trust creative capacity intelligent humorous individual any regular indian film lover would enjoy nice acting at least four film stars dharmendra sharmila tagore amitabh bachchan jaya bhaduri simple social images appreciate director hrishikesh mukherjee another successful experiment film makes spectator reminiscent genre which rarely used very close very long shots rapid cuts spite theatrical design screenplay it could provide actors actresses with greater scope establishing their performing talents use bright light sustained delight romantic characters family drama initiated by unconventionally sensitive urban academic personality makes film bright entertainment,0.5039629675879674,0.1922310606060606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,No language is inferior,"Today is 14th September, known as Hindi Day as per the Indian constitutional provisions. On this occasion, I am reviewing a classic comedy whose theme is the usage of the two languages - Hindi and English whose propagators are mostly seen at loggerheads in India. Yes, no prizes for guessing. It is Chupke Chupke (1975) which is unarguably one of the best Bollywood commedies of all times.Chupke Chupke (quietly) is the story of Parimal Tripathi (Dharmendra), the professor of Botany who falls in love with a student of Botany - Surekha (Sharmila Tagore). After marriage, he comes to know of her fondness towards her brother-in-law or Jijaji (elder sister's husband) - Raghavendra (Om Prakash) who has not been able to attend their marriage. Just to prove himself before his wife, he masquerades as a driver speaking pure Hindi (without any use of English words) and enters Raghavendra's household. What follows is a two hours long laugh-riot for the audience in which, in addition to the mentioned ones, several characters get involved viz. Parimal's friend - Sukumar (Amitabh Bachchan), his another friend - Prashant (Asrani), Prashant's sister-in-law (wife's sister) - Vasudha (Jaya Bhaduri) and many more. Comic situations keep on coming before the spectators till the finale is reached with the truth being revealed before Raghavendra who acknowledges the wittiness of his brother-in-law, i.e., Parimal.Legendary director - Hrishikesh Mukherjee has directed this movie whose script and dialogues have been written by another Bollywood legend - Gulzaar. It's not a slapstick comedy. It's a situational one whose brilliant script makes it a winner. Right from the very start to the very finish, there is no dearth of laughs for the audience. And the perfect comic timings of the lead characters, especially Dharmendra complement the script to serve its purpose to make the audience laugh again and again.The inherent message is no less useful and worth remembering. No language is superior or inferior to any other one. Language is a medium of communication for the human-beings who have no business making fun of any language. The way Hindi is respectable, the same way English is. Each one of the two has its own positives (and negatives too) and it's in the interest of the Indians to appreciate the worth of both without mocking any of them. Sachin Da (S.D. Burman) has composed pretty good music for the movie. The best song is - Abke Sajan Saawaan Mein sung by Lata. Other songs are also apt according to the mood of the movie. Anand Bakshi has penned appropriate lyrics for them.Performance wise talking, this movie is definitely one of the best movies of Dharmendra. This versatile actor has proved quite emphatically that he is not only skilled in serious roles but he has no match in comedy also. Interestingly, Bollywood's most popular movie -Sholay which contains Dharmendra's another memorable comic performance was released in the same year. Dharmendra has left no stone unturned in making the audience laugh right from the beginning to the end. Om Prakash is the second best and Amitabh Bachchan is the third best in this work. Asrani, Sharmila Tagore, Jaya Bhaduri, David, Keshto Mukherjee etc. all have done their parts well and generated showers of laughter for the viewers.The technical and production value aspects of the movie adhere to the simplicity doctrine of Hrishi Da. Editing is good. Length is also perfect. Summing up, Chupke Chupke is a flawless movie.Surprisingly, Chupke Chupke was not a box office hit when released. However, now it is considered a classic comedy which has unlimited repeat value. The way, the admirers of Sholay can watch it umpteen number of times, the same way Chupke Chupke can also be watched countless number of times and every time the laughter is guaranteed for the viewer.",no language is inferior,today is 14th september known as hindi day as per indian constitutional provisions this occasion i am reviewing classic comedy whose theme is usage two languages hindi english whose propagators are mostly seen at loggerheads india yes no prizes guessing it is chupke chupke 1975 which is unarguably one best bollywood commedies all times chupke chupke quietly is story parimal tripathi dharmendra professor botany who falls love with student botany surekha sharmila tagore after marriage he comes know her fondness towards her brother law or jijaji elder sisters husband raghavendra om prakash who has not been able attend their marriage just prove himself before his wife he masquerades as driver speaking pure hindi without any use english words enters raghavendras household what follows is two hours long laugh riot audience which addition mentioned ones several characters get involved viz parimals friend sukumar amitabh bachchan his another friend prashant asrani prashants sister law wifes sister vasudha jaya bhaduri many more comic situations keep coming before spectators till finale is reached with truth being revealed before raghavendra who acknowledges wittiness his brother law i e parimal legendary director hrishikesh mukherjee has directed this movie whose script dialogues have been written by another bollywood legend gulzaar its not slapstick comedy its situational one whose brilliant script makes it winner right very start very finish there is no dearth laughs audience perfect comic timings lead characters especially dharmendra complement script serve its purpose make audience laugh again again inherent message is no less useful worth remembering no language is superior or inferior any other one language is medium communication human beings who have no business making fun any language way hindi is respectable same way english is each one two has its own positives negatives too its interest indians appreciate worth both without mocking any them sachin da s d burman has composed pretty good music movie best song is abke sajan saawaan mein sung by lata other songs are also apt according mood movie anand bakshi has penned appropriate lyrics them performance wise talking this movie is definitely one best movies dharmendra this versatile actor has proved quite emphatically that he is not only skilled serious roles but he has no match comedy also interestingly bollywoods most popular movie sholay which contains dharmendras another memorable comic performance was released same year dharmendra has left no stone unturned making audience laugh right beginning end om prakash is second best amitabh bachchan is third best this work asrani sharmila tagore jaya bhaduri david keshto mukherjee etc all have done their parts well generated showers laughter viewers technical production value aspects movie adhere simplicity doctrine hrishi da editing is good length is also perfect summing up chupke chupke is flawless movie surprisingly chupke chupke was not box office hit when released however now it is considered classic comedy which has unlimited repeat value way admirers sholay can watch it umpteen number times same way chupke chupke can also be watched countless number times every time laughter is guaranteed viewer,0.44378881987577645,0.35897170462387856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Evenly paced fun,"This film is evenly paced throughout, though it turns out to be a Dharmendra show! Prominent among the hilarious scenes are, when Dharmendra, as a chauffeur, seeks clarification from Om Prakash as to why 'go', 'so' are pronounced in the same way and why not 'to', and the other is that Amitabh Bachchan (English Professor) is shown memorising some aspects of Botany using a college botany textbook under dim-lit table-lamp, because he has to take 'botany tuitions' for his sweetheart (Jaya Bhaduri)!

8.0,A botanical farce!,"The wikipedia defines FARCE thus: A farce is a comedy written for the stage or film which aims to entertain the audience by means of unlikely, extravagant and improbable situations, disguise and mistaken identity, verbal humor of varying degrees of sophistication, which may include sexual innuendo and word play, and a fast-paced plot whose speed usually increases, culminating in an ending which often involves an elaborate chase scene.Was it Hrishi Da's intention to create a farce in Chupke Chupke? The situation was unlikely, the set-up improbable, there was mistaken identity, lots of verbal humor in many different languages, there was sexual innuendo and some quite explicit goings on for a Hrishikesh film. In fact except for the chase seen all other elements were in place.A few things that I found particularly hilarious: 1. The fixation on the Jeeja Saali relationship.2. The hilarious use of Botany - and particularly Corolla! LOL! Jaya wanted the Botany Prof to teach her about the corolla, and it took him all night to study that up! And everyone would walk about with a flower in their hand.3. The students who were most fascinated by corollas and by the handsome professor were ALL women. Was this Hrishi Da's wink wink nudge nudge at Botany being a pursuit for women? In fact a classy British store has a women's cardigan line called BOTANY! 4. Dharm was simply awesome. ""Main jab ghabra jaata hoon to haklaata hoon, aur haklaata hoon to Urdu bolne lagta hoon!' His comic timing was perfect.5. Amitabh was excellent too - his over-hyped nervous impersonator who studies up corollas all night and then starts off in a booming Shakespearean mode ""There are ten types of.."" only to be cut off by Jaya as she tell him she studied that part already! The film ended on a slightly unsatisfactory note but I don't know how else it could have culminated. All in all I gave it a 8/10, a lot of laughs and fine acting by the lead due.

,Chupke Chupke Bahut Hanssa Diya,"In contrast to his 'Anand' and 'Mili', Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 'Chupke Chupke' follows a more comedic track. 'Chupke Chupke' is about a recently-married professor of botany who pulls a prank to introduce himself to his brother-in-law. His wife agrees to the plan and, along with a few friends, they enjoy the trick as they successfully confuse both the brother-in-law and her sister and one prank leads to another, confusing everyone but the initiators, resulting in a series of comic events.The humorous situations acted out by the main cast is hilarious. The first half of the film drags a little but the comic tracks make up for it. As the film proceeds, the tension builds and it just becomes funnier and more enjoyable. There are a few songs which are quite beautiful and amusing. I love the title track.Mukherjee has extracted some fine performance from his cast. Dharmendra proves to be quite a competent comedic actor. Sharmila Tagore and Jaya Bhaduri have a wonderful presence and Amitabh Bachchan is hilarious, especially in the scenes with Bhaduri where he tries to refrain from teaching botany. Om Prakash and Asrani provide some of the most laugh-out-loud moments. Lili Chakravarty and Usha Kiran also contribute well.'Chupke Chupke' is a hilarious comedy that falls on the lines of Mukherjee's 'Golmaal'. For me, the film gets better with repeated viewing.",chupke chupke bahut hanssa diya,contrast his anand mili hrishikesh mukherjees chupke chupke follows more comedic track chupke chupke is about recently married professor botany who pulls prank introduce himself his brother law his wife agrees plan along with few friends they enjoy trick as they successfully confuse both brother law her sister one prank leads another confusing everyone but initiators resulting series comic events humorous situations acted out by main cast is hilarious first half film drags little but comic tracks make up it as film proceeds tension builds it just becomes funnier more enjoyable there are few songs which are quite beautiful amusing i love title track mukherjee has extracted some fine performance his cast dharmendra proves be quite competent comedic actor sharmila tagore jaya bhaduri have wonderful presence amitabh bachchan is hilarious especially scenes with bhaduri where he tries refrain teaching botany om prakash asrani provide some most laugh out loud moments lili chakravarty usha kiran also contribute well chupke chupke is hilarious comedy that falls lines mukherjees golmaal me film gets better with repeated viewing,0.5718749999999999,0.31966145833333337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6.0,"Pretty funny, though a bit dragged out","I love Hrishikesh Mukherjee's work. The man seems to be good at whatever movie he makes. He made a series of comedies, including ""Guddi,"" ""Bawarchi,"" and ""Gol Maal,"" all of which were funny and heartwarming. ""Chupke Chupke"" is pretty funny, too.The film follows the newlywed botany professor Parimal (Dharmendra) and his lovely wife Archana (Sharmila Tagore), the latter of whom can't stop talking about how wonderful her ""jijaji"" (Hindi for sister's husband, played here by Om Prakash) is. After 3 weeks of marriage, Parimal is sick of hearing about nothing but this doggoned ""jijaji"" and decides that he must stick it to him and Archana once and for all. ""Jijaji"" is supposed to be the most brilliant and perceptive man in the world according to Archana, so Parimal decides that the best way to stick it to them all is to somehow fool ""jijaji."" Fortunately for him, ""jijaji"" has asked Archana to help him find a chauffeur and so Parimal decides to go posed as the chauffeur instead. Archana decides to play along with this little scheme, as do Archana's older brother (David) and Parimal's friends Prashant (Asrani) and Sukumar (Amitabh Bacchan), the latter of whom is an English professor who will soon end up taking a hilarious fish-out-of-water role in the scheme.And they're off! From there, the movie follows a few too many twists and turns all the way to an ending that is a tad bit too convenient and a tad bit too short.The dialogue is well-written in ""Chupke Chupke,"" making heavy use of double entendres that really add to the humor. Added to that is the fact that ""jijaji"" is a stickler for purity of language and so Parimal, posing as the chauffeur, makes sure to speak in Hindi so dignified that he has ""jijaji"" baffled any time he opens his mouth. (It's a dialogue technique that Mukherjee would later reuse in ""Gol Maal."") Even though the movie drags out this joke a little too long and some might have trouble believing that dignified college professors can pull off such childish pranks, ""Chupke Chupke"" is entertaining and worth watching.",pretty funny though bit dragged out,i love hrishikesh mukherjees work man seems be good at whatever movie he makes he made series comedies including guddi bawarchi gol maal all which were funny heartwarming chupke chupke is pretty funny too film follows newlywed botany professor parimal dharmendra his lovely wife archana sharmila tagore latter whom cant stop talking about how wonderful her jijaji hindi sisters husband played here by om prakash is after 3 weeks marriage parimal is sick hearing about nothing but this doggoned jijaji decides that he must stick it him archana once all jijaji is supposed be most brilliant perceptive man world according archana so parimal decides that best way stick it them all is somehow fool jijaji fortunately him jijaji has asked archana help him find chauffeur so parimal decides go posed as chauffeur instead archana decides play along with this little scheme as do archanas older brother david parimals friends prashant asrani sukumar amitabh bacchan latter whom is english professor who will soon end up taking hilarious fish out water role scheme theyre off there movie follows few too many twists turns all way ending that is tad bit too convenient tad bit too short dialogue is well written chupke chupke making heavy use double entendres that really add humor added that is fact that jijaji is stickler purity language so parimal posing as chauffeur makes sure speak hindi so dignified that he has jijaji baffled any time he opens his mouth its dialogue technique that mukherjee would later reuse gol maal even though movie drags out this joke little too long some might have trouble believing that dignified college professors can pull off such childish pranks chupke chupke is entertaining worth watching,0.5379818594104309,0.21363945578231294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,An Eternal Indian Classic,"I have watched this movie so many times that i may have lost count. This is definitely one of the best comedies to come out of Indian Cinema. The movie scores at almost every level, Direction..Hrishi Da at his best, he has used the same trick (a character pretending to play someone else) in many movies but this time he took everything to another level, the way he handled the complex story in such a simple way, its commendable, you never feel bored,Kudos to the Great Screenplay....Music, Chupke Chupke has one of my fav song...""Ab Ke Sanam Sawan Main"", watch out for the naughty looks given by Sharmila Ji in this song and obviously Lata ji adds Gem to this composition..Also the ""Chupke Chupke"" song is wonderful. Lets come to the Acting Department...This was one of the first movies, where Dharmendra plays a comic role, one of the best in his acting career, with right amount of everything without overdoing anything or adding unnecessary gimmicks. He has always given his best with Hrishi Da(movies like Satyakaam, Anupama). Sharmila Tagore played her part really well, looks pretty and mischievous. Om Prakash is amazing, note some of his expressions even in some small scenes, thats how an actor registers screen presence. Amitabh and Jaya ji have smaller but memorable roles.Overall a great movie, a lesson to some new age Directors that how a simple movie can be so entertaining.",eternal indian classic,i have watched this movie so many times that i may have lost count this is definitely one best comedies come out indian cinema movie scores at almost every level direction hrishi da at his best he has used same trick character pretending play someone else many movies but this time he took everything another level way he handled complex story such simple way its commendable you never feel bored kudos great screenplay music chupke chupke has one my fav song ab ke sanam sawan main watch out naughty looks given by sharmila ji this song obviously lata ji adds gem this composition also chupke chupke song is wonderful lets come acting department this was one first movies where dharmendra plays comic role one best his acting career with right amount everything without overdoing anything or adding unnecessary gimmicks he has always given his best with hrishi da movies like satyakaam anupama sharmila tagore played her part really well looks pretty mischievous om prakash is amazing note some his expressions even some small scenes thats how actor registers screen presence amitabh jaya ji have smaller but memorable roles overall great movie lesson some new age directors that how simple movie can be so entertaining,0.4932251082251083,0.26586889301175015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"

He gets the support of his friends and his wife.Seriously now a days we miss such light hearted comedy films and this is undoubtedly one of the most finest and family oriented comedy films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. Apart from bone tickling comedy the film has mesmerizing music by the great Late S. D. Burman sung in the melodious voice of Late Rafi Sahab, Late Kishore Da, Late Mukesh and the Queen of Melody Late Lata Mangeshkar.The plot of the film is fresh and execution is superb, there will be constant smile on your face since the film starts with a dose of laughter in regular intervals.The acting is superb and the duo of Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan were marvelous and they were beautifully supported by rest of the cast, other highlight of the film was the legendry comic actor Om Prakash who was just hilarious in the role of 'Jijaji' (Brother-in-law).The screenplay of the film is terrific and will keep you engaged throughout and the film ends with a beautiful climax.

6.0,Western unbiased review!,"""Chupke Chupke"" is loved by it's country of origin and is regarded as one of the best cult Indian comedy movies. While I wouldn't write the movie off as bad, for a westerner it's tough fun because humor is not done by gags, but by word plays and talk. That's not bad by itself, but Om Prakash's reactions aren't really up to the task, but he somewhat makes up for it by has facial expression. Songs in the movie are old school Indian ear rape and don't provide anything worth remembering. All in all, ""Chupke Chupke"" isn't a bad movie if you can grab a friend willing to endure a two hour long Indian comedy movie and question life while watching it, but for other than that, ""Chupke Chupke"" really isn't a movie for western audience. 6.5/10!",western unbiased review,chupke chupke is loved by its country origin is regarded as one best cult indian comedy movies while i wouldnt write movie off as bad westerner its tough fun because humor is not done by gags but by word plays talk thats not bad by itself but om prakashs reactions arent really up task but he somewhat makes up it by has facial expression songs movie are old school indian ear rape dont provide anything worth remembering all all chupke chupke isnt bad movie if you can grab friend willing endure two hour long indian comedy movie question life while watching it but other than that chupke chupke really isnt movie western audience 6 5 10,0.3740196078431373,0.08447712418300656,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8.0,A Classic Comedy,"This film is much before my time, but I have heard quite a number of things about it. The movie started out a little confusing for me as I was wondering how the hero and the heroine of the film get married so quickly. That usually happens later in a Bollywood movie, doesn't it? But therein lies the story. I am not going to go in to explain the story, as I feel that wouldn't do the film justice.The acting was top-notch, with great actors at the helm. Dharmendra was very funny, Sharmila Tagore was beautiful, and the supporting cast were great in their respective roles. Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan didn't really have very meaty roles, but they were pretty entertaining nevertheless. I loved the other actors, who were the heart of the film. The screenplay and the dialogues were very entertaining and I am sure I will be watching this again.",classic comedy,this film is much before my time but i have heard quite number things about it movie started out little confusing me as i was wondering how hero heroine film get married so quickly that usually happens later bollywood movie doesnt it but therein lies story i am not going go explain story as i feel that wouldnt do film justice acting was top notch with great actors at helm dharmendra was very funny sharmila tagore was beautiful supporting cast were great their respective roles amitabh bachchan jaya bachchan didnt really have very meaty roles but they were pretty entertaining nevertheless i loved other actors who were heart film screenplay dialogues were very entertaining i am sure i will be watching this again,0.4912731481481482,0.2755208333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.26}"

,an excellent comedy for the entire family.,"This is vintage Hrishikesh Mukherjee for you. His forte is light comedies which can be watched with your entire family right from great-grand-father to great-grand-kid. And this one in particular is very funny. Amitabh and Dharmendra team up together once again after sholay(the biggest indian hit) to deliver another sterling performance as a team well supported by sharmila, jaya and ashok kumar. Film is too slow in first half at times but more than makes up for it in the second. Music is kind of disappointing though. But a good story, good dialogues (a little too incolloquial hindi though) and very good performance by the entire cast makes it a movie worth watching with family.",excellent comedy entire family,this is vintage hrishikesh mukherjee you his forte is light comedies which can be watched with your entire family right great grand father great grand kid this one particular is very funny amitabh dharmendra team up together once again after sholay biggest indian hit deliver another sterling performance as team well supported by sharmila jaya ashok kumar film is too slow first half at times but more than makes up it second music is kind disappointing though but good story good dialogues little too incolloquial hindi though very good performance by entire cast makes it movie worth watching with family,0.6051686507936508,0.3118005952380953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.18}"

I watched this movie as a child and then through my life many times and it's still a great entertainer. The dialogues are the backbone and so is the truthfulness of the characters. Each time you see it you discover a new funny reaction from a character.
