8.0,'Life's real joy lies in making others happy',"Guru Dutt was indeed a visionary, so many of his ideas are much ahead of not only those times but our times as well. Pyaasa is one of his most acclaimed movies. One can see why. This is the story of Vijay, an unemployed poet who struggles through his loneliness, lack of job, and 'good-for-nothing' image. Having left his house where his brothers maltreated him for the same, he wanders in the streets. He puts his heart and soul into writing poems but then no one takes notice of them and they remain unpublished. The story follows his acquaintance with a young prostitute named Gulabo and his renewed meeting with his college sweetheart Meena who left him to marry a wealthy man. What happens when an aimless and embittered Vijay generously gives his coat to a beggar is what takes the whole thing much further.Being a poet's story, the film is appropriately and incredibly poetic in tone, with amazing dialogues bringing so much depth and finesse to it. Today, some of them have become unforgettable sayings. Dutt's direction is excellent. He pays attention to the smallest of details, keeps the film consistently realistic, ultimately managing to build a wonderfully captivating and engaging picture. True to its musical style, the narrative is full of songs, and never do they take away from the efficiency of the script. They actually contribute to it as they either enhance the emotional impact or relieve the intensity. It is this rare mix of melodious numbers and serious, atmospheric proceedings that marks this film's success. The cinematography is very effective, and, just like the songs, it often manages to capture the characters' state of mind.One of the most impressive aspects about this film, among others, is the matter-of-fact style of story-telling, which is still missing in Hindi films today, as well as Dutt's portrayal of relationships. The character of Gulabo, a golden-hearted prostitute is very impressively atypical. She is neither exaggerated and vulgar nor over-generous. She is pretty much a real good-hearted person, who does have her share of toughness, but she is never presented as a poor victim. The interaction between Vijay and Gulabo is very credible as it is never saccharine or sentimental and it lacks any sort of 'love against all odds' clichés. We actually never see if he really loves her. She, however, loves him unconditionally which has got to do a lot with the fact that she's a fan of his poems and that he's one person who shows respect to her.Mala Sinha's Meena, however, is the complete opposite. As Vijay says, ""for her, love is a hobby and she can barter it for material comfort."" But I love this character, because she looks at life from a sane and practical perspective. She is greedy, but she is honest enough to admit it, something that suits her persona brilliantly. In the conversation scene, which is one of the very best in the film, she directly tells Vijay she did not want to marry an unemployed man without any future. She says the memorable line, ""in life, besides poetry and love there's hunger"". Whether you agree or disagree, that's true. Another highly precious and probably the most haunting aspect in the entire film is the portrayal of Vijay's relationship with his loving and caring mother. It is given very little screen time, and yet it's so strongly impactive and touching.Acting-wise, Guru Dutt is excellent in an author-backed role which only he could play given he had the idea of how it should have been done. He gets into the skin of the character, and remains thoroughly in-sync with it. Mala Sinha is brilliant as she is in probably every film and she displays the negative shades of her role as well as her inner compassion very well. It is Waheeda Rehman, however, who shines the most with a role that allows her to grow through the film and draw the audience's sympathy with her heartfelt and authentic portrayal. Rehman, Johnny Walker and particularly Leela Mishra as Vijay's mother, provide excellent support. ""Life's real joy lies in making others happy"", a memorable line by Dutt, and that's what this film is all about. Pyaasa is overall a poignant and moving classic, highly recommended.",lifes real joy lies making others happy,guru dutt was indeed visionary so many his ideas are much ahead not only those times but our times as well pyaasa is one his most acclaimed movies one can see why this is story vijay unemployed poet who struggles through his loneliness lack job good nothing image having left his house where his brothers maltreated him same he wanders streets he puts his heart soul into writing poems but then no one takes notice them they remain unpublished story follows his acquaintance with young prostitute named gulabo his renewed meeting with his college sweetheart meena who left him marry wealthy man what happens when aimless embittered vijay generously gives his coat beggar is what takes whole thing much further being poets story film is appropriately incredibly poetic tone with amazing dialogues bringing so much depth finesse it today some them have become unforgettable sayings dutts direction is excellent he pays attention smallest details keeps film consistently realistic ultimately managing build wonderfully captivating engaging picture true its musical style narrative is full songs never do they take away efficiency script they actually contribute it as they either enhance emotional impact or relieve intensity it is this rare mix melodious numbers serious atmospheric proceedings that marks this films success cinematography is very effective just like songs it often manages capture characters state mind one most impressive aspects about this film among others is matter fact style story telling which is still missing hindi films today as well as dutts portrayal relationships character gulabo golden hearted prostitute is very impressively atypical she is neither exaggerated vulgar nor over generous she is pretty much real good hearted person who does have her share toughness but she is never presented as poor victim interaction between vijay gulabo is very credible as it is never saccharine or sentimental it lacks any sort love against all odds clich s we actually never see if he really loves her she however loves him unconditionally which has got do lot with fact that shes fan his poems that hes one person who shows respect her mala sinhas meena however is complete opposite as vijay says her love is hobby she can barter it material comfort but i love this character because she looks at life sane practical perspective she is greedy but she is honest enough admit it something that suits her persona brilliantly conversation scene which is one very best film she directly tells vijay she did not want marry unemployed man without any future she says memorable line life besides poetry love theres hunger whether you agree or disagree thats true another highly precious probably most haunting aspect entire film is portrayal vijays relationship with his loving caring mother it is given very little screen time yet its so strongly impactive touching acting wise guru dutt is excellent author backed role which only he could play given he had idea how it should have been done he gets into skin character remains thoroughly sync with it mala sinha is brilliant as she is probably every film she displays negative shades her role as well as her inner compassion very well it is waheeda rehman however who shines most with role that allows her grow through film draw audiences sympathy with her heartfelt authentic portrayal rehman johnny walker particularly leela mishra as vijays mother provide excellent support lifes real joy lies making others happy memorable line by dutt thats what this film is all about pyaasa is overall poignant moving classic highly recommended,0.5765730337078652,0.30411516853932596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,..Like beautiful poetry...,"Dutt had been toying with the idea of making 'Pyaasa' for four years. Some of the film echos part of his life story but not as close as the tragedy 'Kaagaz ke Phool' did. It's also very similar to a recent movie I have seen, namely Ghose's 'Yatra'. Maybe Ghose made 'Yatra' as a tribute to Dutt's 'Pyaasa'. 'Pyaasa' is the story of a talented poet Vijay, who struggles through life trying to get his poems published. But, in this materialist world where money and fame rule, there is no one willing to give Vijay's poetry a chance, except one person, a streetwalker called Gulabo. Gulabo is captured by the beauty of his poetry but what can she can do to get the poems published?'Pyaasa' starts in an unconventional but beautiful way. We see Vijay lying on the park. The poet smiles as he's captured by a bee buzzing over a flower. The smile vanishes as a man's shoe carelessly squashes the bee. This already reflects society's careless attitude towards him. Even Vijay's former lover Meena dumped him because she preferred someone with more wealth.Murthy's cinematography is outstanding making 'Pyaasa' a visual treat. The songs and poems are beautiful and they are a powerful part of the narration as they reflect moments such as Vijay's love for Meena, Gulabo's love for Vijay's poetry, the brothel where people are traded and the devious society. There are so many wonderful scenes. The moments between Vijay and Gulabo are some of my favorites.The performances are top notch. Guru Dutt becomes Vijay and allows the viewer to feel his struggles. Waheeda Rehman is breathtaking and plays her part to perfection. Mala Sinha and Rehman do very well. Johnny Walker is hilarious.'Pyaasa' is Dutt's achievement on multiple levels. One of the best of Indian cinema and no wonder why he's recognized as one of the greatest filmmakers.",like beautiful poetry,dutt had been toying with idea making pyaasa four years some film echos part his life story but not as close as tragedy kaagaz ke phool did its also very similar recent movie i have seen namely ghoses yatra maybe ghose made yatra as tribute dutts pyaasa pyaasa is story talented poet vijay who struggles through life trying get his poems published but this materialist world where money fame rule there is no one willing give vijays poetry chance except one person streetwalker called gulabo gulabo is captured by beauty his poetry but what can she can do get poems published pyaasa starts unconventional but beautiful way we see vijay lying park poet smiles as hes captured by bee buzzing over flower smile vanishes as mans shoe carelessly squashes bee this already reflects societys careless attitude towards him even vijays former lover meena dumped him because she preferred someone with more wealth murthys cinematography is outstanding making pyaasa visual treat songs poems are beautiful they are powerful part narration as they reflect moments such as vijays love meena gulabos love vijays poetry brothel where people are traded devious society there are so many wonderful scenes moments between vijay gulabo are some my favorites performances are top notch guru dutt becomes vijay allows viewer feel his struggles waheeda rehman is breathtaking plays her part perfection mala sinha rehman do very well johnny walker is hilarious pyaasa is dutts achievement multiple levels one best indian cinema no wonder why hes recognized as one greatest filmmakers,0.6294444444444445,0.39999999999999997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Simply Superb,"Hindi cinema cops a lot of flak for its escapist fluff, and rightly so, when it churns out drek like MPKK, HSSH and HTHS with depressing frequency. It was, however, not always so. Pyaasa reminds us that the Golden Age of Hindi cinema was just that, truly golden. There is almost nothing at all to fault with this gem. I'm listening to Sar Jo Tera Chakraye while I type this, but the whole soundtrack is outstanding, and the story, both in design and execution is a great demonstration of the fact that commercial cinema _can_ be fine art, too.The evocation of atmosphere is well-done, and the main characters are well drawn. Johnny Walker is, as always, excellent in the comic relief. Some have said that they found him an intrusion, but for me, this very un-comic movie benefited from a little lightening touch from the inimitable Johhny. Subhaan Alaah that it wasn't Johnny Lever!I love every song in the soundtrack, and think that it is the best soundtrack from any of the 320 or so Hindi films I've seen. It is, in my opinion, rare to find a Hindi film in which the songs work very well both in the film AND on their own. Sometimes, there are boring films with great songs, like Swades, and sometimes there are unremarkable songs that work well inside the film, like Dhadak Dhadak from ""Bunty aur Babli"". In Pyaasa though, every song fits AND every song survives apart from its context in the film.However, the clincher for me the ending. There are maybe three or four Hindi films I've seen with almost perfect endings, in terms of being right for the film. I would say that they are, Dil Se (breathtaking and brave, but absolutely right for that film), Page 3 (the 21st century Pyaasa in its storyline, to me) and at the top of the heap, Pyaasa. The fade out to Yeh Duniya Agar is utterly perfect. I love this film to bits, and it was the ending that sealed it for me.",simply superb,hindi cinema cops lot flak its escapist fluff rightly so when it churns out drek like mpkk hssh hths with depressing frequency it was however not always so pyaasa reminds us that golden age hindi cinema was just that truly golden there is almost nothing at all fault with this gem im listening sar jo tera chakraye while i type this but whole soundtrack is outstanding story both design execution is great demonstration fact that commercial cinema can be fine art too evocation atmosphere is well done main characters are well drawn johnny walker is as always excellent comic relief some have said that they found him intrusion but me this very un comic movie benefited little lightening touch inimitable johhny subhaan alaah that it wasnt johnny lever i love every song soundtrack think that it is best soundtrack any 320 or so hindi films ive seen it is my opinion rare find hindi film which songs work very well both film their own sometimes there are boring films with great songs like swades sometimes there are unremarkable songs that work well inside film like dhadak dhadak bunty aur babli pyaasa though every song fits every song survives apart its context film however clincher me ending there are maybe three or four hindi films ive seen with almost perfect endings terms being right film i would say that they are dil se breathtaking brave but absolutely right that film page 3 21st century pyaasa its storyline me at top heap pyaasa fade out yeh duniya agar is utterly perfect i love this film bits it was ending that sealed it me,0.633296130952381,0.388374255952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,One of the best musicals I've ever seen,"A musical melodrama from the Hindi film industry of Bombay, now popularly known as ""Bollywood"", although it wasn't called that back then. Well this movie is certainly a lot better than any of the more recent ""Bollywood"" musicals I've seen, and it's probably even one of the best musicals I've ever seen from anywhere. What really stands out in Pyaasa in particular is how the music is often used to express serious themes and social critiques, which is something I've rarely ever seen in a musical. The ending was also quite unexpected and very moving. The last few scenes and dialogues in particular were powerful and had a lot of meaning to them.The star of the show here is Guru Dutt, who was not only the director and producer, but also starred in the film as the protagonist Vijay (a struggling poet from the slums), comparable to the versatility of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane. The two main actresses in the film, Mala Sinha as the married ex-girlfriend Meena and especially Waheeda Rehman as the prostitute Gulabo, were also impressive. In some ways, the story has some similarities to that of Moulin Rouge! (2001) but even better than that in my opinion. The music by S. D. Burman and his son R. D. Burman also has a timeless feel to it. I would highly recommend this movie to musical fans, or even if one is not a musical fan, I still think it's worth checking out.9/10",one best musicals ive ever seen,musical melodrama hindi film industry bombay now popularly known as bollywood although it wasnt called that back then well this movie is certainly lot better than any more recent bollywood musicals ive seen its probably even one best musicals ive ever seen anywhere what really stands out pyaasa particular is how music is often used express serious themes social critiques which is something ive rarely ever seen musical ending was also quite unexpected very moving last few scenes dialogues particular were powerful had lot meaning them star show here is guru dutt who was not only director producer but also starred film as protagonist vijay struggling poet slums comparable versatility orson welles citizen kane two main actresses film mala sinha as married ex girlfriend meena especially waheeda rehman as prostitute gulabo were also impressive some ways story has some similarities that moulin rouge 2001 but even better than that my opinion music by s d burman his son r d burman also has timeless feel it i would highly recommend this movie musical fans or even if one is not musical fan i still think its worth checking out 9 10,0.4128571428571428,0.21325892857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,Not typical B-town in any way,"If you are not familiar with the history of Hindi films and are led by the high ratings here to expect a big masala movie indicative of contemporary Bollywood films, you may come away from this film scratching your head and wondering where the high ratings came from--particularly if you are new to Hindi cinema ( as opposed to "" Bollywood"").HOWEVER, having said that, let me encourage those who are unfamiliar with what is known as the ""Golden Age"" of Hindi cinema and the historical times that gave birth to this film to do some reading and THEN watch it. 1951 was only 4 years after partition, but unfortunately, many Indians were already becoming disenchanted with the new government's ability, or lack thereof, to bring about the sweeping changes many had hoped would come with the new beginning for the new country. Pyassa came at a time of disenchantment and soul-searching as the new socialist, secular India struggled to find her footing. (Author Tejaswini Ganti does an excellent job illuminating this very different yet important time in Hindi Cinema.) It presents a very bleak picture of greed and corruption, and yet there is a small beacon of hope for understanding, for good to find a way to continue, for equality to stand against injustice, hope for the future. Understanding this is integral to appreciating WHY this is considered one of the greatest films in Hindi cinema history.

8.0,"Beautiful, timeless movie","Pyaasa does show its age. There are a lot of things that would perplex or annoy the modern viewer such as jumps in continuity and a simplistic set of characters. However, if one looks past that, then the movie reveals a rich story and a deep message. This is even more astonishing considering that the movie was made in the 50s.This film is a journey into the mind of Guru Dutt and shows the hurt that sensitive minds, such as those of poets', can feel in modern society. As such, its message transcends time and is still relevant today. Those with less sensitive dispositions, such as mine, will not feel left out and will surely appreciate the story too.The dialogue is beautiful and the songs are sublime. This is a real pity for those who do not understand Hindi since the subtitles (although decent) rob the words of much of their beauty. I know from other reviews on this site that non-Indian viewers often rightly skip the much-disliked song sequences. I still recommend that they sit through them with the subtitles, of course, turned on. This will convey some sense of the beauty of the songs. There are several moments when the movie seems idiosyncratic. On both occasions that Abdul Sattar (Johnny Walker) broke out into song, the sudden ""change"" in his voice seemed absurd. Similarly, several bits of dialogue were almost comical when they were meant to be serious, especially in the case of the first publisher. The video itself looks jaded and the sound leaves a lot to be desired. But as I stated earlier, one must look past this to truly enjoy this splendid movie.One of the striking things about the movie that I must mention is how much India seems to have changed since 1957. Perhaps this is because of the way the movie was shot. The Indian city of the 50s seems very wide and open and even though it is shown teeming with people, there is certain spaciousness about the whole thing. This stands in stark contrast to the clustered urban environment of today.In all, I would highly recommend this movie to film lovers, both Indian and otherwise.",beautiful timeless movie,pyaasa does show its age there are lot things that would perplex or annoy modern viewer such as jumps continuity simplistic set characters however if one looks past that then movie reveals rich story deep message this is even more astonishing considering that movie was made 50s this film is journey into mind guru dutt shows hurt that sensitive minds such as those poets can feel modern society as such its message transcends time is still relevant today those with less sensitive dispositions such as mine will not feel left out will surely appreciate story too dialogue is beautiful songs are sublime this is real pity those who do not understand hindi since subtitles although decent rob words much their beauty i know other reviews this site that non indian viewers often rightly skip much disliked song sequences i still recommend that they sit through them with subtitles course turned this will convey some sense beauty songs there are several moments when movie seems idiosyncratic both occasions that abdul sattar johnny walker broke out into song sudden change his voice seemed absurd similarly several bits dialogue were almost comical when they were meant be serious especially case first publisher video itself looks jaded sound leaves lot be desired but as i stated earlier one must look past this truly enjoy this splendid movie one striking things about movie that i must mention is how much india seems have changed since 1957 perhaps this is because way movie was shot indian city 50s seems very wide open even though it is shown teeming with people there is certain spaciousness about whole thing this stands stark contrast clustered urban environment today all i would highly recommend this movie film lovers both indian otherwise,0.5377992724867725,0.12666666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Frustration of an Idealist,"Pyaasa is a crowning achievement, not only for Guru Dutt, but for whole of the Hindi and World cinema.Pyaasa is the story of a poet (Vijay played by Guru Dutt) who is an idealist. The world does not seem to care for him or his poetry. It opens with what probably is the best opening sequence in Hindi cinema. Vijay sees a beetle fluttering over flowers, awakening the poet in him. A poem is born, only to be rudely terminated by the beetle being stamped over.There are two women in Vijay's life. Meena (Mala Sinha) is his lover from college. She leaves him to marry a wealthy publisher. The other is Gulabo (Waheeda Rehman), a prostitute. She loves his poetry and through that, him. Both Mala Sinha and Waheeda Rahman have played roles which must have been real courageous in the 50s. They are women with negative shades. One is selfish and other is not virtuous, unlike how Indian audience wanted to see their women in films during that time.The theme of failure and frustration of an idealist runs throughout Pyaasa. The pain and anguish of Vijay is because of the materialistic world he lives in. Vijay's story is tragic and Guru Dutt consciously refrains from making a hero of him. Vijay's sacrifice is his revenge on the society. At the end, only Gulabo who is a romantic herself, stands by his side as Vijay prepares to run away from the society.The songs are a powerful device in Pyaasa to give voice to Vijay's frustration. The musical score from S.D.Burman is brilliant and an important part of the film. Sahir Ludhanavi's lyrics are timeless. He flexes his artistry in both Urdu and Hindi/Awadhi.Guru Dutt was a master in playing with lights and shadows. He made the colorless world of monochrome more enchanting than the real. To this end, he is brilliantly assisted by his d.o.p V. K.

10.0,Review # 600 : Greatest Indian Film By Legendary Indian Auteur Guru Dutt.,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Pyaasa is a 1957 Drama movie directed and produced by arguably the greatest Indian filmmaker of all time - Guru Dutt.In Pyaasa, Guru Dutt presents the poignant tale of a struggling poet ostracized by a hypocritical society that faces no qualms in immortalizing the dead, but finds it outlandish to exalt the living. Vijay, educated yet unemployed, epitomizes the hapless state of the Indian youth in the post-colonial India. A consummate artist, Guru Dutt was equally brilliant behind the camera as he was in front of it: his attention to detail as a director matched his ability to emote as an actor. Guru Dutt and his team were keen on casting the king of tragedy, Dilip Kumar in the lead role for Pyaasa, but Dutt himself had to fill in the shoes when an agreement couldn't be reached.Intense and thought-provoking, Indian cinema at its finest.

9.0,An intense drama,"Guru Dutt had the theme for ""Pyaasaa"" running in his mind for 4 years before he actually got around to making it. He followed the counsel of friends who advised him to make some money before venturing on such an offbeat drama and made such purely commercial, but thoroughly enjoyable, films as ""Aar Paar"", ""C.I.D"" and ""Mr & Mrs 55"" which were all commercially very successful.""Pyaasa"" starts brilliantly - a man lying down, staring at the sky, the flowers - all very happy. A bee starts buzzing over a flower and then, moves down to the grass. The smile on the poet's face is broken as a man's boot uncaringly descends on the bee. Thats more or less the theme of the film. The uncaring attitude of the society where the struggling ones are trampled over mercilessly. Laced through this is the whole romance triangle with one lady dumping her lover for a well-to-do businessman for the sake of money, and a prostitute who loves the poet truly.The film is filled with some memorable moments and lots of brilliant shots. My favourite is the sequence where Dutt tries to commit suicide is magnificent - there is no dialogue through that 3 minute sequence. But I think the scene would have been even more remarkable had there been no background music.V.K.Murthy does an outstanding job with the camera. I compare the Guru Dutt-Murthy combo to the Orson Welles-Greg Tolland combo that created ""Citizen Kane"". Murthy was even better in ""Kaagaz ke phool"" - but thats for later. This film is an absolute visual treat.S.D.Burman does a fair job with the music but it is really Sahir Ludhianvi's poetry thats the pride of the songs in this film. Stinging sharp, the words slam the devious ways of the world, the mercenary nature of the society. The climax, though a trifle melodramatic, is brilliantly conceived.All in all, this is a film thats worth preserving in your DVD collection. This was Guru Dutt's best film and that is saying a lot ! He is now usually touted as the greatest film director in the commercial world of Hindi films. He demonstrates how a film can be both artistically satisfying as well being throughly entertaining to the masses.",intense drama,guru dutt had theme pyaasaa running his mind 4 years before he actually got around making it he followed counsel friends who advised him make some money before venturing such offbeat drama made such purely commercial but thoroughly enjoyable films as aar paar c i d mr mrs 55 which were all commercially very successful pyaasa starts brilliantly man lying down staring at sky flowers all very happy bee starts buzzing over flower then moves down grass smile poets face is broken as mans boot uncaringly descends bee thats more or less theme film uncaring attitude society where struggling ones are trampled over mercilessly laced through this is whole romance triangle with one lady dumping her lover well do businessman sake money prostitute who loves poet truly film is filled with some memorable moments lots brilliant shots my favourite is sequence where dutt tries commit suicide is magnificent there is no dialogue through that 3 minute sequence but i think scene would have been even more remarkable had there been no background music v k murthy does outstanding job with camera i compare guru dutt murthy combo orson welles greg tolland combo that created citizen kane murthy was even better kaagaz ke phool but thats later this film is absolute visual treat s d burman does fair job with music but it is really sahir ludhianvis poetry thats pride songs this film stinging sharp words slam devious ways world mercenary nature society climax though trifle melodramatic is brilliantly conceived all all this is film thats worth preserving your dvd collection this was guru dutts best film that is saying lot he is now usually touted as greatest film director commercial world hindi films he demonstrates how film can be both artistically satisfying as well being throughly entertaining masses,0.5675474254742547,0.30176151761517617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Not a movie review,"Saw this movie recently - Pyaasa (1957). I know I should have seen it earlier, but just happened to watch it now. While the beauty of the movie lies in its making, direction, acting, music, lyrics and all other departments, the soul of the movie focuses on the human thirst 'Pyaas' (trivia tells me they intended to name the Pyaas previously). When a man (or woman) has nothing with him, then everybody may dessert him. Friends, to lover, to family member, to society at large, everybody show this man his 'place in society' - a good for nothing being who nobody cares about. And the few who do feel for him, can't do much for him, because invariably they are also weak (at least that's what they tried to show in the film).After hitting absolute rock bottom, this man thinks he has seen all the betrayals, every dejection, the last bit of cruelty by the world around him, but ironically and unfortunately, the worst is yet to come. It is when this man perhaps decides to die, and the world believes about his (fake) death, that reality eventually strikes. His one true love stakes everything she has to get his poetry published, which turns him into an overnight posthumous sensation. What follows then is surreal. The estranged brothers have never been prouder, the friend ready to 'sell' their friendship for money, the people who never believed in him making a fortune off his life, and the public at large lapping up legendary poetry that they rejected with dismay earlier.Never have I seen a more beautiful climax of a movie, with Guru Dutt starting to sing on his death anniversary celebration ""Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hai"" - a song that anybody who even indulges in an iota of introspection will readily relate with. The movie finally ends on a 'happy note', with the poet giving up all the fame and success that he craved all his life, only to start afresh, realizing this 'duniya' isn't meant for him.Now I don't know what got me talking so far, and I didn't mean this to be a movie review. But this movie, tells and teaches you a whole lot about the world around you. Through its exaggerated account, it explains to you how politicians function, how relationships change, why money matters, how 'pyaar is also a vyapaar', the class divide in society, the cost of fame, the feeling of success and then the true meaning of success.The answers to life's biggest questions are often found in movies. If you, unfortunately like me didn't get a chance to watch this masterpiece so far, then do check it out online. A movie made in 1957 is just as relevant today, and will remain one forever, because of its timelessness.",not movie review,saw this movie recently pyaasa 1957 i know i should have seen it earlier but just happened watch it now while beauty movie lies its making direction acting music lyrics all other departments soul movie focuses human thirst pyaas trivia tells me they intended name pyaas previously when man or woman has nothing with him then everybody may dessert him friends lover family member society at large everybody show this man his place society good nothing being who nobody cares about few who do feel him cant do much him because invariably they are also weak at least thats what they tried show film after hitting absolute rock bottom this man thinks he has seen all betrayals every dejection last bit cruelty by world around him but ironically unfortunately worst is yet come it is when this man perhaps decides die world believes about his fake death that reality eventually strikes his one true love stakes everything she has get his poetry published which turns him into overnight posthumous sensation what follows then is surreal estranged brothers have never been prouder friend ready sell their friendship money people who never believed him making fortune off his life public at large lapping up legendary poetry that they rejected with dismay earlier never have i seen more beautiful climax movie with guru dutt starting sing his death anniversary celebration yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye kya hai song that anybody who even indulges iota introspection will readily relate with movie finally ends happy note with poet giving up all fame success that he craved all his life only start afresh realizing this duniya isnt meant him now i dont know what got me talking so far i didnt mean this be movie review but this movie tells teaches you whole lot about world around you through its exaggerated account it explains you how politicians function how relationships change why money matters how pyaar is also vyapaar class divide society cost fame feeling success then true meaning success answers lifes biggest questions are often found movies if you unfortunately like me didnt get chance watch this masterpiece so far then do check it out online movie made 1957 is just as relevant today will remain one forever because its timelessness,0.5522534013605441,0.10117630385487528,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,A tribute to the melancholic art,"A thoroughly watchable movie specially for the weepy types. The direction , the cinematography are very good considering the times. The lighting and other cinematic effects are technically a cut above the rest for those times. Guru Dutt puts in his best for this movie , both in the fields of acting and directing, and the product doesn't fail the viewers expectations, rather it greatly exceeds them. The songs and the background score are composed by SD and one of the highlights of the movie. Everything has come together very well for this movie and Dutt has left no stone unturned to make this movie a masterpiece. This movie was released in the same year as ""Mother India"" another block buster, but Pyaasa managed to hold its own. The only drawback, if at all it can be called one, is the philosophy of the director cum hero. Dutt wallows in self sympathy throughout this movie, and views the world in an extremely negative light. If you are looking for to cheer the resilience and ultimate triumph of the human spirit then this one is not meant for you. But again this movie is a tribute to the forgotten art of poetry and the pearls of poetry are born out of the extreme pain and misery of the poets imprisoned in these shells.",tribute melancholic art,thoroughly watchable movie specially weepy types direction cinematography are very good considering times lighting other cinematic effects are technically cut above rest those times guru dutt puts his best this movie both fields acting directing product doesnt fail viewers expectations rather it greatly exceeds them songs background score are composed by sd one highlights movie everything has come together very well this movie dutt has left no stone unturned make this movie masterpiece this movie was released same year as mother india another block buster but pyaasa managed hold its own only drawback if at all it can be called one is philosophy director cum hero dutt wallows self sympathy throughout this movie views world extremely negative light if you are looking cheer resilience ultimate triumph human spirit then this one is not meant you but again this movie is tribute forgotten art poetry pearls poetry are born out extreme pain misery poets imprisoned these shells,0.4550714285714286,0.16085714285714287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Bollywood film with an attitude,"Well made Bollywood film by one of its exceptional filmmakers. The story seems to be based on the novel ""Devdas"" by Saratchandra Chatterjee, though not credited so (poor poet is still in love with his former girlfriend who has married for money, despite that he is himself loved by a selfless prostitute). The ending is different of course, as it is not tragic here but rather educative. The quite open and bold social criticism - especially in the song on prostitution - is also well worth noticing.The music by S. D. Burman is beautiful, the actors are convincing, especially Guru Dutt as the poor and misunderstood poet with an attitude and Waheeda Rehman as the prostitute with a heart of gold. It is interesting that the songs are often inserted in the story itself (many of them are REALLY songs sung in the story), and are not only musical picturizations of fantasies, dreams, etc., as it is often the case in (later?) Bollywood films. Though this also occurs of course, as in the Guru Dutt-Mala Sinha duet scene. Well worth seeing for lovers of heart-wrenching melodrama and vintage Bollywood music.",bollywood film with attitude,well made bollywood film by one its exceptional filmmakers story seems be based novel devdas by saratchandra chatterjee though not credited so poor poet is still love with his former girlfriend who has married money despite that he is himself loved by selfless prostitute ending is different course as it is not tragic here but rather educative quite open bold social criticism especially song prostitution is also well worth noticing music by s d burman is beautiful actors are convincing especially guru dutt as poor misunderstood poet with attitude waheeda rehman as prostitute with heart gold it is interesting that songs are often inserted story itself many them are really songs sung story are not only musical picturizations fantasies dreams etc as it is often case later bollywood films though this also occurs course as guru dutt mala sinha duet scene well worth seeing lovers heart wrenching melodrama vintage bollywood music,0.5213333333333332,0.19633333333333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.04, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,My favourite Movie till Date.,"My favourite Movie till Date.This is my first movie I am going to review coz this is the movie that changed my view my aim and defined me. It is the most special movie for me. It's the story of a jobless poet Vijay (Guru Dutt). His anguish his pain his hope and his wish for a better world. His vision is what is depicted. It's a vision of every true poet and its the pain that he has seen made him a better poet. He wants his poems to be published and they will never be taken by the publishers.No, no the story shall not be revealed but I would like to discuss the characters and the technicalities involved in the movie.Characters are endearing and realistic and relatable too. I can identify myself with Vijay, an abandoned poet. And putting myself in each one's shoes I realized that the way the character reacted, I too would react in the same way. The acting is just top notch with Waheeda Rehman playing Gulab, Mala Sinha playing Meena, Rehman playing Ghosh all are remarkable in performances.Abrar Alvi's dialogue, S D Burman's music and Sahir Ludhianvi's poetry (no not lyrics it is poetry of a very high degree) complement the magnanimous vision of Guru Dutt. And everything is perfect.Right from first frame till the very end, each frame seems to have a meaning much greater than I could comprehend. The lighting and the visuals just suit the vision and thus give a feel into the psyche of each character.Damn it. I am not reviewing, I am just praising it and no praise how great is equal than this movie being watched many times over.Rating: 5/5",my favourite movie till date,my favourite movie till date this is my first movie i am going review coz this is movie that changed my view my aim defined me it is most special movie me its story jobless poet vijay guru dutt his anguish his pain his hope his wish better world his vision is what is depicted its vision every true poet its pain that he has seen made him better poet he wants his poems be published they will never be taken by publishers no no story shall not be revealed but i would like discuss characters technicalities involved movie characters are endearing realistic relatable too i can identify myself with vijay abandoned poet putting myself each ones shoes i realized that way character reacted i too would react same way acting is just top notch with waheeda rehman playing gulab mala sinha playing meena rehman playing ghosh all are remarkable performances abrar alvis dialogue s d burmans music sahir ludhianvis poetry no not lyrics it is poetry very high degree complement magnanimous vision guru dutt everything is perfect right first frame till very end each frame seems have meaning much greater than i could comprehend lighting visuals just suit vision thus give feel into psyche each character damn it i am not reviewing i am just praising it no praise how great is equal than this movie being watched many times over rating 5 5,0.46518831168831165,0.37806926406926405,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.47}"

9.0,A lovely story--too bad the DVD isn't particularly good.,"I have a harder time evaluating ""Pyaasa"" than someone watching it in India. That's because here in the States, we are pretty much stuck with whatever DVD copies we get of Indian films. Some have wonderful translations and some are horrible and unwatchable. While ""Pyaasa"" is not horrible, it's not particularly good and I would love to know if there is a better company making this disc in English. Eros Video's copy does what some annoying DVD producers do--they provide no translations of the songs--so you only can guess as to what they are saying. While it's easier with Indian films to fill in these blanks than with films from most other countries (since the songs are about the action taking place immediately before and after the songs), it still is wrong not to translate them--and does an injustice to the filmmakers. Additionally, a few times the translations are a bit scrambled. It's a shame--but STILL I recommend you see the film because it's very, very good.Vijay is an educated man. However, despite his ability to make money and live the life of a middle-class man, he is a poet by trade and in his heart. Though he'll starve, he'd rather create art and sees life through very romantic eyes. Through most of the film, he's an undiscovered genius. He also has two problematic relationships---one, his ex-girlfriend who has chosen to marry for money and security (and who has broken his heart) and another who is a prostitute who ADORES him and his art.About halfway through the film, however, the film makes a HUGE change in direction. I loved this, as the first half of the film was only mildly interesting. After the twist, the film REALLY came to life. You see, through some odd circumstances, people think Vijay has died. And, like some great artists, after his 'death' he's discovered and adored by the masses! What's next is completely unpredictable and clever--and well worth seeing. I'd say more but I really don't want to spoil the film. It's a classic and well worth seeing. A truly unique and enjoyable plot about love, success and art.",lovely story too bad dvd isnt particularly good,i have harder time evaluating pyaasa than someone watching it india thats because here states we are pretty much stuck with whatever dvd copies we get indian films some have wonderful translations some are horrible unwatchable while pyaasa is not horrible its not particularly good i would love know if there is better company making this disc english eros videos copy does what some annoying dvd producers do they provide no translations songs so you only can guess as what they are saying while its easier with indian films fill these blanks than with films most other countries since songs are about action taking place immediately before after songs it still is wrong not translate them does injustice filmmakers additionally few times translations are bit scrambled its shame but still i recommend you see film because its very very good vijay is educated man however despite his ability make money live life middle class man he is poet by trade his heart though hell starve hed rather create art sees life through very romantic eyes through most film hes undiscovered genius he also has two problematic relationships one his ex girlfriend who has chosen marry money security who has broken his heart another who is prostitute who adores him his art about halfway through film however film makes huge change direction i loved this as first half film was only mildly interesting after twist film really came life you see through some odd circumstances people think vijay has died like some great artists after his death hes discovered adored by masses whats next is completely unpredictable clever well worth seeing id say more but i really dont want spoil film its classic well worth seeing truly unique enjoyable plot about love success art,0.5238652482269505,0.16552546744036106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.31}"

7.0,Guru Dutt's Pyaasa,"I saw Pyaasa appear in Time Magazine's list of the Top 100 films of the 20th century. The only other Indian entry was (predictably) Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy. My interest in Guru Dutt was piqued. It seems (along with, to some extent, Raj Kapoor) he was amongst the few film-makers of his time who could be appreciated as an auteur. One can (as many have) view this film as highly autobiographical. And it is not a bad film. I hate to add the age-old qualifier ""by Indian standards"" but it is required here. Dutt and Ray films might be apples and oranges, but clearly Ray's work can compete with foreign auteurs, whilst Dutt can as best be seen as the closest Bollywood came to generating a cross-over talent.Anyways, about the film itself, it has some stellar performances, not least by Dutt himself. Johnny Walker provides his trademark comic relief, as does Tun Tun. The female leads are alright, and the supporting cast (Rehman and Mehmood especially) adds much to the film. The song sequence Dutt portrays (decrying prostitution) while drinking is a tour de force. The fluid camera movements that pepper the length of the film are marvelous. The last act of the film, however, is highly derivative of Preston Sturges' ""Sullivan's Travels"", and seems to drag on longer than it should.Ultimately, I am impressed enough to seek out more of Guru Dutt's work, including ""Kaaghaz Ke Phool"" and ""Sahib Biwi aur Ghulam"".",guru dutts pyaasa,i saw pyaasa appear time magazines list top 100 films 20th century only other indian entry was predictably satyajit rays apu trilogy my interest guru dutt was piqued it seems along with some extent raj kapoor he was amongst few film makers his time who could be appreciated as auteur one can as many have view this film as highly autobiographical it is not bad film i hate add age old qualifier by indian standards but it is required here dutt ray films might be apples oranges but clearly rays work can compete with foreign auteurs whilst dutt can as best be seen as closest bollywood came generating cross over talent anyways about film itself it has some stellar performances not least by dutt himself johnny walker provides his trademark comic relief as does tun tun female leads are alright supporting cast rehman mehmood especially adds much film song sequence dutt portrays decrying prostitution while drinking is tour de force fluid camera movements that pepper length film are marvelous last act film however is highly derivative preston sturges sullivans travels seems drag longer than it should ultimately i am impressed enough seek out more guru dutts work including kaaghaz ke phool sahib biwi aur ghulam,0.39336021505376334,0.16,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.18}"
