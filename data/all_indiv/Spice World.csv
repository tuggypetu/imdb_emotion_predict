6.0,"Made me wanna zigga zig, ah!","To be a teenage girl when the Spice Girls were around, there was no better time to be 12. I admit it, I was such a fan of the girl power group. How could you not be? Admit it, you say you hated them, but secretly you had a poster of Ginger Spice in your closet. They were cute, they were fun, they were talented and before you knew it they were gone. But for 2 years, it was nothing but girl power! So out of the height of their fame we naturally had to see if the Spice Girls were good for something else and that meant a movie! The Spice Girls made a movie, to show how crazy their lives were at the time and let them just have fun with it and they did spice up our lives real good.The Spice Girls are enjoying their fame, but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. A sinister newspaper owner, Kevin McMaxford, is trying to ruin the girls' reputation in order to cash in on the headlines, and even dispatches a photographer to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Annoying film director, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth, who stalks the band along with his crew, hoping to use them as documentary subjects; at the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford, is fending off two overeager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon, who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' film. Amid this, the girls must prepare for a concert at the Albert Hall, their biggest performance yet. But between all this craziness, would they even want to continue to sing at the price of their friendships? You'll have to see, but I'm sure you could figure it out.I think a lot of people are a little too harsh on this film, the girls gave it a genuine try. You can tell they just had fun and wanted to do this for the fans. I think there were actually some really funny parts, like when they went through the spice boot camp. The whole last scene where they are going through their action scene in London, it's so random and just a good time. See, what I liked about this film was it's harmless nature. It was made for the fans specifically because we loved them so much. I admit that I'll watch it every once in a while still just to go back down memory lane and it still brings a smile on my face. The songs are so darn catchy, I can't help it. There are some very fun cameos that get a good giggle. The story is very predictable and the movie is over the top silly, but that is what makes it fun. I'm here to defend the film, I think people over analyze things way too much. Sometimes, you can't explain it, but you just want to let go of the real world and spice up your life a little bit. The Spice Girls may never win an Oscar, but they won the world's hearts for 2 short years, the girl power may have fizzled a little, but I'll take a trip down memory lane any time for Spice World.6/10",made me wanna zigga zig ah,be teenage girl when spice girls were around there was no better time be 12 i admit it i was such fan girl power group how could you not be admit it you say you hated them but secretly you had poster ginger spice your closet they were cute they were fun they were talented before you knew it they were gone but 2 years it was nothing but girl power so out height their fame we naturally had see if spice girls were good something else that meant movie spice girls made movie show how crazy their lives were at time let them just have fun with it they did spice up our lives real good spice girls are enjoying their fame but they become dissatisfied with burdens it sinister newspaper owner kevin mcmaxford is trying ruin girls reputation order cash headlines even dispatches photographer take pictures tape recordings girls annoying film director piers cuthbertson smyth who stalks band along with his crew hoping use them as documentary subjects at same time girls manager clifford is fending off two overeager hollywood writers martin barnfield graydon who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas girls film amid this girls must prepare concert at albert hall their biggest performance yet but between all this craziness would they even want continue sing at price their friendships youll have see but im sure you could figure it out i think lot people are little too harsh this film girls gave it genuine try you can tell they just had fun wanted do this fans i think there were actually some really funny parts like when they went through spice boot camp whole last scene where they are going through their action scene london its so random just good time see what i liked about this film was its harmless nature it was made fans specifically because we loved them so much i admit that ill watch it every once while still just go back down memory lane it still brings smile my face songs are so darn catchy i cant help it there are some very fun cameos that get good giggle story is very predictable movie is over top silly but that is what makes it fun im here defend film i think people over analyze things way too much sometimes you cant explain it but you just want let go real world spice up your life little bit spice girls may never win oscar but they won worlds hearts 2 short years girl power may have fizzled little but ill take trip down memory lane any time spice world 6 10,0.508525641025641,0.0568536324786325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,"Cheesy, Goofy, Silly, and lots of fun to watch","The Spice Girls.......what can be said about them that hasn't already been said? Well, for starters..none of them can act. Playing themselves (albeit slightly exaggerated) seems to be a stretch. The lone shining star as far as acting is Meat Loaf, who in his role as SpiceBus driver provides comedy release without being Jar-Jarish. The fact he delivers the line ""hey I love these girls, and I'd do anything for them...but I won't do that..."" without blushing is priceless.This movie has some of the cheesiest scenes in the history of film, with the aliens scene being among the worst, but when this movie hits with the goofiness, it hits well. I still laugh to this day when I think of the plastic SpiceBus jumping over the plastic London Bridge. Surprisingly, one of the best musical numbers is the cafe scene...where the girls show that they actually do have some discernible talent.This is the best summary of the movie I can give: I hated the Spice Girls until I saw this movie, and now I have to say that I actually own a CD of theirs",cheesy goofy silly lots fun watch,spice girls what can be said about them that hasnt already been said well starters none them can act playing themselves albeit slightly exaggerated seems be stretch lone shining star as far as acting is meat loaf who his role as spicebus driver provides comedy release without being jar jarish fact he delivers line hey i love these girls id do anything them but i wont do that without blushing is priceless this movie has some cheesiest scenes history film with aliens scene being among worst but when this movie hits with goofiness it hits well i still laugh this day when i think plastic spicebus jumping over plastic london bridge surprisingly one best musical numbers is cafe scene where girls show that they actually do have some discernible talent this is best summary movie i can give i hated spice girls until i saw this movie now i have say that i actually own cd theirs,0.5881578947368421,0.11578947368421054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
6.0,Nostalgic...,"When I was seven and this movie came out, it was the biggest thing around. Everyone wanted to be the Spice Girls. After they split up and weren't cool anymore, everyone forgot about the movie. But ho, ho, what's this? Years later, here I am cleaning out my old Disney and Barney videos and stumble across my old friend that I used to watch everyday. Even at my old age of fifteen, never failed to crack me up.Obviously, this isn't meant to be a contender for Oscars. Anyone can see that. But I can't find much to hate about a movie that's practically the visual to go along with the song ""Girls just wanna have fun."" That's all it is, fun. And a lot of good fun at that. It's just a guilty pleasure, and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyze. Recommendation: This movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up and down on a couch like a seven year old.",nostalgic,when i was seven this movie came out it was biggest thing around everyone wanted be spice girls after they split up werent cool anymore everyone forgot about movie but ho ho whats this years later here i am cleaning out my old disney barney videos stumble across my old friend that i used watch everyday even at my old age fifteen never failed crack me up obviously this isnt meant be contender oscars anyone can see that but i cant find much hate about movie thats practically visual go along with song girls just wanna have fun thats all it is fun lot good fun at that its just guilty pleasure its so much fun watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes wearing feather boas you just need keep mind that it was publicity their new record its not meant be one those heavy movies you over analyze recommendation this movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up down couch like seven year old,0.3705597643097643,0.03878367003367003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.0}"
,Entertaining silly fun,"I've liked the Spice Girls for years, but I'm not sure why. Ordinarily, I don't care for their brand of dance-pop fluff, but somehow they make it sound good. Regardless of what anyone says, they are talented singers and dancers, and they show that numerous times. They're also pretty and most of them wear outfits that show a lot. And while they're not accomplished actresses, they are simply adorable.I don't think anyone intended this movie to be taken seriously. It's just good clean (well, slightly naughty) fun. Roger Moore comes the closest to giving a good performance, in a role that appears to be spoofing Bond villains. Just in case we don't get the joke, he pets a long-haired cat. One of the funniest scenes has the girls complaining about people thinking they fit the stereotypical image people have of them. Of course, Emma says this while on a swing in a three-year-old's fantasy world.The girls actually show they have intelligence. Or do they? I thought Melanie B was the one with brains. She's no better off than the others!Another humorous incident: Victoria can't make up her mind whether to wear the short black Gucci dress or the short black Gucci dress. Emma suggests she wear the short black Gucci dress. Problem solved! Of course, the girls are being harassed by the tabloids, whose top personnel are shown being evil.And then there are the guys pitching their idea for a Spice Girls movie. Some of what we see is supposedly their imagination. Including a Dukes of Hazzard style incident with a bus, which was done so cheaply it's obviously not real. In the closing credits, the girls are actually more talented delivering dialogue because they are being themselves, not merely playing exaggerated versions of themselves. I've never seen communication with the movie audience quite like this! It's not for people looking for Shakespeare. But if you want to laugh and hear music that is bubbly and upbeat, this is pretty good.",entertaining silly fun,ive liked spice girls years but im not sure why ordinarily i dont care their brand dance pop fluff but somehow they make it sound good regardless what anyone says they are talented singers dancers they show that numerous times theyre also pretty most them wear outfits that show lot while theyre not accomplished actresses they are simply adorable i dont think anyone intended this movie be taken seriously its just good clean well slightly naughty fun roger moore comes closest giving good performance role that appears be spoofing bond villains just case we dont get joke he pets long haired cat one funniest scenes has girls complaining about people thinking they fit stereotypical image people have them course emma says this while swing three year olds fantasy world girls actually show they have intelligence or do they i thought melanie b was one with brains shes no better off than others another humorous incident victoria cant make up her mind whether wear short black gucci dress or short black gucci dress emma suggests she wear short black gucci dress problem solved course girls are being harassed by tabloids whose top personnel are shown being evil then there are guys pitching their idea spice girls movie some what we see is supposedly their imagination including dukes hazzard style incident with bus which was done so cheaply its obviously not real closing credits girls are actually more talented delivering dialogue because they are being themselves not merely playing exaggerated versions themselves ive never seen communication with movie audience quite like this its not people looking shakespeare but if you want laugh hear music that is bubbly upbeat this is pretty good,0.5916035353535354,0.1462121212121212,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.22}"

9.0,Just a Good Laugh!,"I love this movie simply because it's a good laugh. The acting is terrible, the plot is cheesy, but I love it all the same. You watch this movie, and you're going to think it's the worst excuse for a singing group promoting itself ever. And you'll be right. It is bad. But that's what makes it so great! It's a cheesy movie full of cheesy jokes. It's not supposed to be an academy award winner. It should be the first of the genre ""Cheesy for the sake of being Cheesy"". I mean, if Meatloaf voluntarily in this movie, we all know that it's not to be taken seriously.

10.0,Just what you expect from Brit-Pop low budget movie.,"I was very early tweens when the Spice Girls dominated the world, and I remember the film coming out to cinemas; counting down the days till I could go see it! As a child and massive fan I found the film entertaining as it was to cracked up to be, it was all the phenomenon of the time. Looking back now it was a great time for me enjoying it and themselves as a girl group enjoying massive success and this is why I can accept why the film may not be any BAFTA hands down winner, obviously the film was never meant to be! It was written by their managers wife! And has too many more than subtle references about Britain. The acting is cheesy but no way did it tarnish any of the many important actors/comedians/singers who cameo'd in this film because as I remember Richard E. Grant saying it was just so great to be part of the experience, it really was a time-line in history. Now who cares whether he was lying or being honest we know he is an actor who gets paid big bucks, but the fact Roger Moore was in this film and Meatloaf, I don't think you can call them all sellouts. Fact is Spice Girls did make an impact on us all, this is just a bit of history left to show their mark.",just what you expect brit pop low budget movie,i was very early tweens when spice girls dominated world i remember film coming out cinemas counting down days till i could go see it as child massive fan i found film entertaining as it was cracked up be it was all phenomenon time looking back now it was great time me enjoying it themselves as girl group enjoying massive success this is why i can accept why film may not be any bafta hands down winner obviously film was never meant be it was written by their managers wife has too many more than subtle references about britain acting is cheesy but no way did it tarnish any many important actors comedians singers who cameod this film because as i remember richard e grant saying it was just so great be part experience it really was time line history now who cares whether he was lying or being honest we know he is actor who gets paid big bucks but fact roger moore was this film meatloaf i dont think you can call them all sellouts fact is spice girls did make impact us all this is just bit history left show their mark,0.49471111111111105,0.20342222222222223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,Much better & much funnier than you'd think,"This movie is FUN. And the sad thing is that most people are too close-minded to see that. The general consensus seems to be: ""It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful!"" and either they never see the movie, or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them.Firstly, let me say that I am not, and was never, a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular, and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes, some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wide-open. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators', and while they didn't have particularly strong voices (except perhaps for Mel C), they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity, expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly, but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also, my 65-year-old father loves this movie, and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls, but not knowing their music at all. Yes, Spiceworld is an exploitation movie; BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager (brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant) saying ""It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars!"", when it's obvious that they're not, and everyone knows it - there's even a scene at the beginning where he says, ""Yes, but can they ACT?"" and his boss responds with, 'Who cares?"", or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act (some are worse than others; I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before, but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link), it's obvious that they're having fun with the script, and they don't do too badly at all.The script was another great surprise to me; it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the ""Chief"", who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager (Richard E. Grant), and every time we do he is stroking, in pure Bond Villain (or Dr Evil) fashion, a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal; first it's a cat, then a rabbit, a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic, senseless, but hysterical lines, like: ""When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy, it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not."" and: ""The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken."" I love that off-the-wall humour, and this movie is full of it. Of course, some people just don't GET that kind of humour, which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it.Other moments I love, which elevate this film from could-have-been-dodgy to funny, are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver, and then having him say lines like: {on fixing the clogged toilets} ""Hey, I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that!"" - which is, of course, a play on Meatloaf's hit song ""Anything for Love"". Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying ""It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress"", and Victoria responding ""Exactly!"", or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling ""This dress is dry-clean only!"", or Geri saying ""Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'?"" There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst.",much better much funnier than youd think,this movie is fun sad thing is that most people are too close minded see that general consensus seems be its spice girls movie its going be awful either they never see movie or they allow their prejudices judge movie them firstly let me say that i am not was never spice girls fan i was way too old their target market when they were popular whilst one or two their songs had catchy tunes some were downright annoying they were very cleverly manufactured girl band time when that market was wide open giving each girl distinctive character style was stroke genius part their creators while they didnt have particularly strong voices except perhaps mel c they didnt have particularly bad ones either ive heard far worse so i went into this movie purely out curiosity expecting it be somewhere between awful merely silly but i ended up enjoying myself thoroughly also my 65 year old father loves this movie he saw it only having heard vaguely spice girls but not knowing their music at all yes spiceworld is exploitation movie but it does excellent job at it what i loved most was way it poked fun at itself all way through character screenwriter pitching his idea girls manager brilliantly played by richard e grant saying its obvious us that spicegirls are movie stars when its obvious that theyre not everyone knows it theres even scene at beginning where he says yes but can they act his boss responds with who cares or similar i loved that while girls cant really act some are worse than others ive read that victoria was only one who had taken acting lessons before but i cant say it showed since i thought she was weakest link its obvious that theyre having fun with script they dont do too badly at all script was another great surprise me its full good lines funny characters that poke fun at themselves their stereotypes example this is great roger moore playing chief who is presumably big boss spice girls we only ever see him phone with clifford manager richard e grant every time we do he is stroking pure bond villain or dr evil fashion small white animal his lap but every time you see him he has different animal first its cat then rabbit tiny white pig etc i thought that was such great way poking fun at stereotype villain always having white pet then character himself has these fantastically enigmatic senseless but hysterical lines like when rabbit chaos is pursued by ferret disorder through fields anarchy it is time hang your pants hook darkness whether theyre clean or not headless chicken can only know where hes been he cant see where hes going do not be that chicken i love that off wall humour this movie is full it course some people just dont get that kind humour which is fine by me as long as it doesnt make them slam film because it other moments i love which elevate this film could have been dodgy funny are casting meatloaf as spice girls bus driver then having him say lines like fixing clogged toilets hey i love these girls ill do anything them but i wont do that which is course play meatloafs hit song anything love also parody stereotypical characters girls which course were made up them anyway like victoria not knowing what wear mel c saying it must be really hard you victoria trying decide whether wear little gucci dress or little gucci dress or little gucci dress victoria responding exactly or when victoria falls into thames continues scream help once shes been rescued yelling this dress is dry clean only or geri saying calm down havent you ever heard word compromisation there are scores these great moments but they really work better film than if i wrote them down here all im saying is that this movie is not ever million years as bad as everyone makes it out be yes its not greatest but then most films arent its so much funnier than youd think yes it has its cheesy moments but sometimes its supposed be cheesy thats where its funny i really dont understand why this film whose only aim was be fun this it succeeded more than admirably my opinion is imdbs worst,0.6035185185185188,0.05925359032501888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6.0,Better than expected,"Bob Spiers had worked in British TV for years - Bottom, Fawlty Towers and Absolutely Fabulous of the shows that he directed - before he was asked to direct the movie of the Spice Girls. He had no idea what they looked like and turned the job down until Jennifer Saunders told him that he should take it.If you want to be snooty and say that the Spice Girls didn't mean anything, they were the first act to reach number one with their first six singles, as well as the first to debut at #1 in the UK charts five times in a row. And this movie, despite critical savagery, is still the highest-grossing movie of all time by a musical group.At once embracing the pop culture that spawned them and thumbing their noses at it, Spice World is, well, about the Spice Girls avoiding bad press from newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries, who is also Dame Edna) and his photographer henchman Damien (Richard O'Brien). There's also a camera crew led by Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) and two constantly on-the-pitch Hollywood writers George Wendt and Mark McKinney) who want to make a movie about the band.The band is also playing Royal Albert Hall while making time for their mutual best friend, who is due to have a child any day now. That's really all it's about, but I'm certain that their audience was happy to come see the film and hear 15 of their songs in the theater.The reason for people who may not enjoy the band to see this is because it's so delightfully weird and well casted, with Roger Moore as the secretive head of their recording label and cameos from Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Bon Geldof and more.This movie also reunited Rocky Horror alums Meat Loaf and O'Brien, as well as O'Brien with his Shock Treatment co-star Humphries.Perhaps what's most interesting is what isn't in this movie. Any mentions of Princess Diana and Gianni Versace were edited out after their deaths, as was a cameo by Gary Glitter.Beyond having Moore in this, I kind of love that when the Spice Girls' bus jumps the bridge, a similar slide whistle sound as the jump in The Man With the Golden Gun is heard. Victoria also dresses up as Honey Ryder from Dr. No.Maybe you weren't around for the Spice Girls. Maybe you were and couldn't deal. Either way, you should still check this out.

2.0,This is reason the UK has gun control,"As I recall, just before this film was released, the laws concerning gun ownership in the UK were changed. This meant that literally thousands of automatic pistols and large calibre revolvers were removed from the hands of the general public. Coincidence? I don't think so. The government knew that the combination of Spice World and privately owned combat handguns would result in retaliatory strikes against both the countries film and music industries, by vengeance hungry members or the public. I don't own any guns, but I'd have probably joined in anyway, using a broom or a saucepan to dish out some Spice Girl inspired justice on the people that created this film.In hindsight, this could have saved us from the likes of Atomic Kitten and there would have been a good chance of sorting out Elton John as well.

8.0,To *HECK* with all the naysayers!,"SPICEWORLD is a good, enjoyable movie. It is NOT Cinéma Vérité, nor is it supposed to be. You want a deep, poignant movie? A thriller? An action-flick? Watch something else. This movie is a farce, and was intended to be only that, nothing more. You people who didn't like the movie are expecting LORD OF THE RINGS or something, and this will never reach that level. But for a fun, energetic, insane romp with countless nods to classic movies, stars, and actors, this is perfect.The Spice Girls had their time in the limelight and used it to produce essentially a theatrically-released extended music video. If you're old enough to remember M-TV when it was actually JUST a music video channel, this is what SPICEWORLD is (think of the classic Michael Jackson video/movies like THRILLER where it was music and a bit of story tossed in for good measure). Nope, not Oscar material by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable.Oh yes... one last thing: I saw this movie on PPV in 1998 and immediately fell in love with it and the Spice Girls. I was 28 then, and even though I'm 36 now, I still enjoy this movie for what it is.

1.0,"Vanity, thy name is Spice....","I'm not even sure if you can call SPICE WORLD a movie, per se. That's because instead of having actors and a plot, the film plays like a giant advertisement for this prefabricated ""super group"". In other words, the cynical folks who brought us this ""film"" were basically trying to squeeze every last drop from the franchise and sell more records. Fortunately for the world, the group was already on their way out and the film made much more of a fizzle than a sizzle at the box office (thank God).As with other vanity products, the actors really cannot act and have the charisma of cheese. While I know this may sound like sacrilege to some, this is a lot like Paul McCartney's vanity opus, GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADSTREET. Like this other film, lots of glitzy locales, special guest stars and noise were all used to try to hide the fact that the singers were not all that talented as actresses. Had all the glitz been removed, you would have been left with...well...nothing. So, instead there are a billion costume changes, crazy sets and pointless cameos--all to hide the utter vapid nature of the film.

1.0,"We're Sorry, World","Not sure why they included the word 'World' in their Spice World title when the girls occupy just two countries in this movie. Wait, backing up, why the hell would anyone think this was a good idea?It's hard to pinpoint the most ridiculous and awful part of this over-complicated, and yet, plot less film. Was it the aliens that the girls could understand because of the subtitles? Was it the doctor on holiday when a baby just appears after birth? Was it the toilet photographer? Was it the Dr Who bus? Was it the Rocky theme for a half a dozen steps? Was it the neglecting-the-pregnant-friend morning scene so they could train sing at fruity boot camp? Was it Bond's sad turn as Blofeld? Was it the dozens of called in favors from the guest appearances? Was it the girls breaking the fourth wall in the end credits and, incredibly, believing there were more than one person in the audience? Was it the two teen fans that looked even less interested in spending time with the Spice Girls than anyone watching this even when they're playfully thrown from a random boat?My excuse for watching this terrible plea to buy their CDs was that I listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast and it's all-but pointless listening to that hilarious podcast if you haven't seen the movie they make fun of on their show. I cannot wait to hear what they have to say about this. (I actually have a good idea as I watched this film.)Basically we have five girlfriend singers who are stalked by an amateur documentary maker, sabotaged by a tabloid editor, yelled at by their manager, fantasized by the movie-within-the-movie director/writer and made to feel guilty by a random, yet never explained, pregnant friend. Mercifully – not really, but I do try to be positive at times – the girls keep on rocking and remain BFFs for-eve-r!How on Earth did this make From Justin to Kelly look comprehensible?My guess, this movie began the downfall of the group and even if you're a die-hard fan to the end, spare yourself from this dreadful pile of donkey's discharge.* * * Final thoughts: Admittedly, I actually attended a Spice Girls concert once, back in the 1990s. Personally, I only liked 2-3 of their songs (still do,) but not enough to see them in concert. But, for a friend who absolutely loved them, I bought two tickets for us to go since he was feeling down. For whatever reason, he couldn't go and he sent me with his boyfriend who also liked them. It was literally one of the most painful experiences I've hadthat is, up until I saw this movie. After showing up a ton late, the girls played a dozen or so songs I'd never heard of, nor liked, and took – no kidding, 4-5 15-minute intermissions in between every 2-3 songs. It wasn't bad enough I didn't really want to be there in the first place, I was barely friends with the boyfriend replacement and I didn't care for their music as a whole, but they stretched it out as long as possible with far too many breaks.And still, I would rather go back to that concert than watch this again.",were sorry world,not sure why they included word world their spice world title when girls occupy just two countries this movie wait backing up why hell would anyone think this was good idea its hard pinpoint most ridiculous awful part this over complicated yet plot less film was it aliens that girls could understand because subtitles was it doctor holiday when baby just appears after birth was it toilet photographer was it dr who bus was it rocky theme half dozen steps was it neglecting pregnant friend morning scene so they could train sing at fruity boot camp was it bonds sad turn as blofeld was it dozens called favors guest appearances was it girls breaking fourth wall end credits incredibly believing there were more than one person audience was it two teen fans that looked even less interested spending time with spice girls than anyone watching this even when theyre playfully thrown random boat my excuse watching this terrible plea buy their cds was that i listen how did this get made podcast its all but pointless listening that hilarious podcast if you havent seen movie they make fun their show i cannot wait hear what they have say about this i actually have good idea as i watched this film basically we have five girlfriend singers who are stalked by amateur documentary maker sabotaged by tabloid editor yelled at by their manager fantasized by movie within movie director writer made feel guilty by random yet never explained pregnant friend mercifully not really but i do try be positive at times girls keep rocking remain bffs eve r how earth did this make justin kelly look comprehensible my guess this movie began downfall group even if youre die hard fan end spare yourself this dreadful pile donkeys discharge final thoughts admittedly i actually attended spice girls concert once back 1990s personally i only liked 2 3 their songs still do but not enough see them concert but friend who absolutely loved them i bought two tickets us go since he was feeling down whatever reason he couldnt go he sent me with his boyfriend who also liked them it was literally one most painful experiences ive had that is up until i saw this movie after showing up ton late girls played dozen or so songs id never heard nor liked took no kidding 4 5 15 minute intermissions between every 2 3 songs it wasnt bad enough i didnt really want be there first place i was barely friends with boyfriend replacement i didnt care their music as whole but they stretched it out as long as possible with far too many breaks still i would rather go back that concert than watch this again,0.5259123492994462,-0.005832518735744546,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"

1.0,Oh dear lord...,"Let's just be brutally honest here; this is a Spice Girls vehicle. No doubt about it. From the biggest hater of the film to the biggest fan of the girls, everyone might as well admit from the very beginning: this film was primarily (and, in the opinion of many, purely) made to promote the Spice Girls as well as their then-new album. The moment you realize/accept that fact is the moment that this film gets easier to sit through. However, it still is very, very hard to sit through, and the majority of the people I know wouldn't be able to sit through the entirety of this mess of a film, not even to satisfy the most basic human instincts of curiosity by finding out what happens in the end. The film pretty much plays like a 90-minute promotional video, or a compilation of music videos with pointless plot in-between each performance to keep the music from getting to be too much. Newsflash: the people who would willingly watch this would most likely be just as happy with a 90-minute compilation of music videos or live performances; they don't care about the film itself. I'm not saying that every single Spice Girls fan hated, or even disliked the film itself(I'm not even claiming that one single fan didn't enjoy seeing the girls being ""themselves""); what I am saying is that they wouldn't have cared if this feature was a 90-minute long music video, instead of the barely coherent mess that the movie is. But, back to the point I was trying to make; the film is a Spice Girls movie. Not a comedy, or a music movie, but a Spice Girls movie. Made entirely for the fans. This, of course, means that the movie is exclusively enjoyable for the fans... and now that the girl-band is no longer a hot subject, and it's no longer ""in"" to like them, their fan-base has been reduced to a minimum. Therefore, now, only seven years after the film was made(or a few years ago, for that matter; ever since they stopped being popular) the film will only appeal to those who are still fans. As you have probably figured out by everything I've written up to this point, I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of the girls. They are charming, sure, their songs are catchy(admit it, even you've hummed along one or two of their singles when it came on the radio), and they are, undeniably, quite attractive, but that's all there is to it... and that's certainly not enough to carry a feature film, once they're no longer famous. Of course, the director probably didn't think about that, and merely made the film to capitalize on their popularity. Oh well. The film now belongs in the same category as one of those films made about some famous guy/girl/group of people that people no longer care about... probably all inspired by The Beatles(unless someone came before them... I'm not sure if they were the first bands to do feature films). The thing is, The Beatles not only were popular back when they made their films, some 30-40 years ago; they still are popular. The Spice Girls aren't. They were merely the newest of the popular teen-bands... and they didn't last much longer than most others. Now, that's enough for the analyzing, on to the review. The plot is barely coherent and poorly paced, constantly throwing new characters into the story, that appear for a few minutes only to disappear again, as well as introducing subplots that are never used to full advantage. The acting is atrocious. The characters are tired stereotypes. The cinematography is forgettable and unimaginative. The humor is British humor at its worst(I think, at least; I haven't seen enough British comedies to determine if there is a lower level than this). All in all, the film have little to offer(apart from one or two clever references and some good self-parodying in one or two places) to anyone but Spice Girls fans. I recommend this exclusively to Spice Girls fans. It's to painful to sit through for virtually anyone else, even if it's just to laugh at the pure stupidity of it.

These are the greatest pop legends of the 90's, Girl Power shook the world and so of course they were gonna exploit it for all their worth, but the thing that makes this pop band movie so much better than any other are the cameos, the list is endless.Its got more start turns than an Austin Powers movie, and thats saying something, and great thing is everyone has a sense of humour about their own position, even the girls themselves.I grew up with the Spice Girls and was a major fan - I'm 19 now but watching it now i find it even funnier - cos now i understand the jokes that flew over my head 8 years ago, and i know exactly who all these brilliant actors and musicians who make their cameos.It has great lines, a great and beautiful cast and shows the lives of the spice girls at their most normal and bizarre at the height of their fame, for the young girls the world over who loved the spice girls this is a great film to bring back the memories of almost 10 years ago.A must for fans - avoid if you had no love for these girls",its fun movie no brains required,ive read comments about this movie being awful ok so its not something you have use your brains but its funny these are greatest pop legends 90s girl power shook world so course they were gonna exploit it all their worth but thing that makes this pop band movie so much better than any other are cameos list is endless its got more start turns than austin powers movie thats saying something great thing is everyone has sense humour about their own position even girls themselves i grew up with spice girls was major fan im 19 now but watching it now i find it even funnier cos now i understand jokes that flew over my head 8 years ago i know exactly who all these brilliant actors musicians who make their cameos it has great lines great beautiful cast shows lives spice girls at their most normal bizarre at height their fame young girls world over who loved spice girls this is great film bring back memories almost 10 years ago must fans avoid if you had no love these girls,0.6240384615384615,0.36778846153846156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.12}"
1.0,The oldest profession,"Once upon a time there were The Spice Girls. They introduced us to 'girl power', a thinly disguised effort to use sex to sell manufactured pop music, potato chips and fizzy drinks to little kids and morons. And then there was this travesty of a movie.This is very much like other exploitation movies made to cash in on popular music groups in the past, but with all the good elements removed. There is nothing redeemable about this whatsoever, it's pure trash, and since the 'music' of The Spice Girls has no longevity neither does this.If you want to pick this up along with the girl's entire back catalogue of CDs, I recommend checking out the bargain bins in charity shops. You shouldn't have a problem finding it all, and then at least something positive will have come out of this.",oldest profession,once upon time there were spice girls they introduced us girl power thinly disguised effort use sex sell manufactured pop music potato chips fizzy drinks little kids morons then there was this travesty movie this is very much like other exploitation movies made cash popular music groups past but with all good elements removed there is nothing redeemable about this whatsoever its pure trash since music spice girls has no longevity neither does this if you want pick this up along with girls entire back catalogue cds i recommend checking out bargain bins charity shops you shouldnt have problem finding it all then at least something positive will have come out this,0.5234965034965035,-0.004687812187812209,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.16}"
2.0,Spice Up Your World By Not Watching This Film.,"Spice World (1997): Dir: Bob Spiers / Cast: Geri Halliwell, Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm: Contributes absolutely nothing as something hailed as a musical. It presents a muddled premise that plays off many dimwitted subplots. Title regards influence as if the world really needs more Spice Girls. We see the Spice Girls in concert, bizarre movie ideas, unsatisfied reporters, media problems, signing autographs for aliens, and yes, a childbirth scene. Just what is this nonsense about? Directed like a bad music video by Bob Spiers who previously gave the world the horrible remake of That Darn Cat. With that film being a total waste of film it is obvious that lightning strikes twice and this poor sap gets struck with a second terrible film choice. The only difference here is that he gets to direct five reasonably attractive women who cannot act. The film is colorful to look at but not pleasant to experience. Despite their popularity The Spice Girls cannot act nor lip synch their own music. They are colorful in their flashy outfits as well as being attractive to boot, but that doesn't carry their performances above embarrassment. Plus we have a variety of celebrity cameos who had nothing better to do than sign onto this piece of crap. If you are looking to spice up your world then I recommend the weather channel and leave this film to suffer in its own defeat.

10.0,Simply the best!....(better than all the rest),"I really couldn't disagree more with everyone on this site. I think that The Spice Girls movie is one of, if not THE greatest film ever made. The seriousness of the entire movie as a whole, is overwhelming, The directors sheer ability to create a certain atmospheres when shooting is exciting and fresh.The capabilities of all five girls performance as independent actresses are presented professionally. The odd comical points throughout are clear, precise and witty. The scriptwriter must be very proud of himself/herself...(I'm not sexist) This isn't coming from a person who's never been outside and happened to watch only the spice girls movie, but I feel that I have a great and accurate movie judgement.I feel that the spice girls movie is seriously better than ""The Godfather""",simply best better than all rest,i really couldnt disagree more with everyone this site i think that spice girls movie is one if not greatest film ever made seriousness entire movie as whole is overwhelming directors sheer ability create certain atmospheres when shooting is exciting fresh capabilities all five girls performance as independent actresses are presented professionally odd comical points throughout are clear precise witty scriptwriter must be very proud himself herself im not sexist this isnt coming person whos never been outside happened watch only spice girls movie but i feel that i have great accurate movie judgement i feel that spice girls movie is seriously better than godfather,0.609920634920635,0.301984126984127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.56, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.2}"
