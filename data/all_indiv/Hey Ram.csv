9.0,"Bold, shocking, thought-provoking...","Hey Ram is the story of Saket Ram (Kamal Haasan), an archaeologist. He is on a dig in pre-partition Harappa with his buddy Amjad (Shah Rukh Khan) when communal violence erupts in the region and the dig is closed down. Saket Ram goes off to Calcutta to visit his new wife Aparna (Rani Mukherjee). Calcutta is in chaos with religious strife and Ram's wife is brutally assaulted and killed by some Muslim men a few days after his return. He becomes unstable and seeks out the perpetrators of the crime and deals with them. While wandering the streets Ram meets with Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni) who tells him that his family has suffered a similar fate and that the one man responsible for all this is MK Gandhi. Ram goes off to Tamil Nadu and after seeing Maithili (Vasundhara Das) agrees to marry her. All the time he is still traumatized by Aparna's death and planning revenge. When Abhyankar is paralyzed in a polo accident Ram vows to take his place as the killer of the Mahatma. He moves to Delhi and there he re-encounters his friend Amjad. Now hatred for Muslims and his prior closeness to Amjad are at war and Ram must choose his path - will it be the road to revenge or redemption? The story is excellent and the movie manages to retain its grip on the viewer for over three hours. The direction is for the most part very good. There are a few strange moments that seemed unnecessary to me - why is there the surreal stuff when Ram is shown with Maithili? The Marathi dance seemed unnecessary. Why were the bullets in a cartridge in a pre-partition handgun? Can one talk after one's throat is sliced open? But these are indeed minor quibbles in an overall excellent film.The background score is a bit intrusive, the songs not memorable. Maybe this is not the best of the Maestro Illayaraja. The beginning song/dance in the club is sort of silly, certainly not needed. Surely bonding between friends can be shown in other ways.Acting is very good throughout. For me the outstanding performance was given by Rani Mukherjee. She breathed life into Aparna and was at her most attractive and charming as a Bengali Bodhu! Kamal was very good. He showed love, passion, anger, rage, madness very well. And what looks at nearly age 50! The man is awesome. Shah Rukh gave a great performance as Amjad - a very restrained and balanced performance that in the end showed us which path Ram would choose and why. Atul Kulkarni was awesome as the fanatical Abhyanker. Vasundhara Das was luminous and did an excellent job playing Maithili. Naseer Shah as Gandhi, Hema Malini as the mother were all very good. In fact there was no bad performance in the film.This is a fine piece of movie making and deserves all the accolades it got.

10.0,Best and most mature of all India's nominations for Best Foreign Language Film for Academy Awards,"A Real Eye-Opener... and that's what its is. First of all I would like to inform that I haven't yet watched the original version of this movie which claims to be better than this Hindi version.That's the reason I can't compare both movies. This movie has it all,whether its Hard-Core Reality, maturity, direction, special-effects and most of all great acting and true-to-the-core screenplay which provides us with nothing but tough reality which can be bargained for nothing, NOT even for what everybody calls, Religious Tolerance. However one tries to ignore it,one cannot defy the hard truthfulness of the subject of this movie. As far as the plot is concerned it's imaginary but not impossible. The idea that there could have been more than one potential killers of Gandhiji is not impossible.But that is not what the talented Kamal Haasan want to present in front of us.Instead he wants to introduce the ACTUAL circumstances during the times of Indian struggle for freedom. he has truly depicted the life of an average Indian who truly loves his motherland and beautifully depicted the transformations he undergoes from an anti-Muslim, anti-Gandhi to a humanataranian. My personal favourite from the movie though is not Kamal's character but that of Atul Kulkarni's.The way he lives his life as tough as that,his inteligence,his intense love for his motherland which overrides his mind even in the eventuality of facing a physical disorder which he has to suffer and also as a result of which he get bedridden is truly inspirational.And most of all it was TRUE in those days! The visual-effects though not the greatest but are great. This script is what we can call a revolution in (1)typical Indian's thinking standards,(2)expression of hard-core reality. Also as a movie its simply great for its acting,visual effects, direction and most of all its Script. Truly, this movie enjoyed the well deserved nomination from India's part in the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards.And it well could have been the winner if only it could have been possible for Kamal Haasan to put much more necessary efforts in that direction. Finally,though not a completely perfect movie still I would give it a 10 out of 10 due to its TRUTHFULNESS. If the Always Talented Kamal Haasan makes a next movie even half good as this one I would like to watch it. Its unarguably the best of all Indian movies including Hindi ones.It's my personal Rank One among my top ten Indian (though not international)movies. The future would be great if more individuals would watch more mature movies like this. Also this is my first review of its kind so if possible forgive me for any misgivings.",best most mature all indias nominations best foreign language film academy awards,real eye opener thats what its is first all i would like inform that i havent yet watched original version this movie which claims be better than this hindi version thats reason i cant compare both movies this movie has it all whether its hard core reality maturity direction special effects most all great acting true core screenplay which provides us with nothing but tough reality which can be bargained nothing not even what everybody calls religious tolerance however one tries ignore it one cannot defy hard truthfulness subject this movie as far as plot is concerned its imaginary but not impossible idea that there could have been more than one potential killers gandhiji is not impossible but that is not what talented kamal haasan want present front us instead he wants introduce actual circumstances during times indian struggle freedom he has truly depicted life average indian who truly loves his motherland beautifully depicted transformations he undergoes anti muslim anti gandhi humanataranian my personal favourite movie though is not kamals character but that atul kulkarnis way he lives his life as tough as that his inteligence his intense love his motherland which overrides his mind even eventuality facing physical disorder which he has suffer also as result which he get bedridden is truly inspirational most all it was true those days visual effects though not greatest but are great this script is what we can call revolution 1 typical indians thinking standards 2 expression hard core reality also as movie its simply great its acting visual effects direction most all its script truly this movie enjoyed well deserved nomination indias part category best foreign language film at academy awards it well could have been winner if only it could have been possible kamal haasan put much more necessary efforts that direction finally though not completely perfect movie still i would give it 10 out 10 due its truthfulness if always talented kamal haasan makes next movie even half good as this one i would like watch it its unarguably best all indian movies including hindi ones its my personal rank one among my top ten indian though not international movies future would be great if more individuals would watch more mature movies like this also this is my first review its kind so if possible forgive me any misgivings,0.5200344611528822,0.21277673350041768,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,WOW.. a very powerful film,"I had heard that Kamal Hassan was a good actor, so I decided to check out Hey Ram. I knew nothing of the plot (best way to see a movie; no expectations...) and I must admit I was emotionally overwhelmed by the end of it. Kamal Hassan is an amazing actor who is not only passionate about his work but also about his country. And what a pleasure to see Shah Rukh in a minor part.Hey Ram is a film that every American actor, writer, and director should study. Few American films have had such an effect on me.

10.0,Quite an eye opener for an American with a Christian background,"What an emotional and eye opening journey regarding the dangerous mix of religion and politics. The same dangerous mix we still face today. How can we profess to be products of a creator when we malign and even kill each other for the sake of an interpretation of our creator's being, the love that must have been to create us in the first place. I have just watched the DVD and cannot quite crying for the waste of good lives - the same waste occurring today. Will we ever learn?! Just a note on Shahrukh Khan's role and performance in the film...it was very understated and very moving. Since he his a Muslim, wouldn't it be nice to see him more roles expressing his own beliefs? It's amazing what influence a popular celebrity can have on popular thought. During such a time of religious warfare, it would be nice to see more films such as this that leave one with the conclusion the religious wars are an abomination. That there really is no such thing as a righteous war. Killing in the same of our creator is much the same as killing our siblings in the name of our parents. Can you imagine them condoning such behavior? Not I.This was an excellent film on several levels including artistry, story line, and acting and direction.

10.0,Must See,"Gandhiji is said to be the father of the India. A Mahathma who lived his principles instead of just preaching. But why on earth someone would want to kill him? It is something that the politicians and religious fellows wanted to hide from the general public. Kamal Hassan takes a brave step in putting things on the screen for everyone to see. True that the film evoked anger at many sects, but none could stop the film as everything is history and hence cannot be denied. The film supports religious harmony and breaks a lot of myths (including the one that Gandhi said 'hey ram' after being shot). Every Indian should see the film (where he is a Hindu or a Muslim doesn't matter at all).

10.0,A slice of history as never told before!,"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is an idolized figure in India. He is one who is almost raised to the status of GOD by many. Films such as Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"" have glorified this figure repeatedly and rightfully so. However, this is only one side of the story. What Kamal Haasan shows through ""Hey! Ram"" is that Gandhi is a part of history and history cannot be changed and needs to be told as it was. Gandhi was not the ""glory"" that he is believed to be for everyone! There were numerous people who opposed him and his policies. Contrary to much of the controversy behind this film, ""Hey! Ram"" does not trivialize Gandhi, nor does it blame him. In fact, the main character, Saket Ram (Kamal Haasan in a powerhouse performance)learns to appreciate Gandhi by the end of the journey. The point of the film is not that he does learn to appreciate Gandhi despite being chosen as his potential assassin, but rather the way he makes his journey to that point. This journey is so masterfully and artistically directed by Kamal Haasan that one cannot help but sit back and be stunned at what this genius is capable of. What Haasan has created with ""Hey! Ram"" is not only an epic film but perhaps the biggest casting coup of the decade with actors like Nasseeruddin Shah (who makes a better Gandhi than Ben Kingsley), Om Puri, Shahrukh Khan, Rani Mukherji, Girish Karnad and many other prominent names of the Indian Film Industry. The cinematography is simply brilliant and Renu Saluja's editing is a work of art. Ilayaraja's music is a highly emotive score that effectively blends western orchestral arrangements with traditional carnatic sounds. ""Hey! Ram"" is one of the greatest Indian films ever made. It takes a lot of intelligence and passion to make and appreciate a film like ""Hey! Ram.""",slice history as never told before,mohandas karamchand gandhi is idolized figure india he is one who is almost raised status god by many films such as richard attenboroughs gandhi have glorified this figure repeatedly rightfully so however this is only one side story what kamal haasan shows through hey ram is that gandhi is part history history cannot be changed needs be told as it was gandhi was not glory that he is believed be everyone there were numerous people who opposed him his policies contrary much controversy behind this film hey ram does not trivialize gandhi nor does it blame him fact main character saket ram kamal haasan powerhouse performance learns appreciate gandhi by end journey point film is not that he does learn appreciate gandhi despite being chosen as his potential assassin but rather way he makes his journey that point this journey is so masterfully artistically directed by kamal haasan that one cannot help but sit back be stunned at what this genius is capable what haasan has created with hey ram is not only epic film but perhaps biggest casting coup decade with actors like nasseeruddin shah who makes better gandhi than ben kingsley om puri shahrukh khan rani mukherji girish karnad many other prominent names indian film industry cinematography is simply brilliant renu salujas editing is work art ilayarajas music is highly emotive score that effectively blends western orchestral arrangements with traditional carnatic sounds hey ram is one greatest indian films ever made it takes lot intelligence passion make appreciate film like hey ram,0.6086231884057972,0.25224637681159423,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,An Indian masterpiece.,Kamal Hasan is a truly great actor and with this film he has cemented his status a talented director. This is an epic film which is extremely thoughtful. It shows how a rationale man can turn into a prujudiced extremist. It shows that hatred for past tragic events will not solve feelings of loss of a loved one. It also shows that compassion and sacrifice are needed in politics rather that populist rabble rousing. This film has been criticized in many quarters for many reasons. People have said that the film focuses on Kamal Hasan too much and that it a self indugent vanity fest. This is unfair considering Mr Kamalji is one of the best actors in India. Also the film is about this person and the imapct on his thinking to tragic surrounding events. The film would not have worked without this intense focus. The film's storyline has been labeled inconsistent. It has been cited that the change to a anti-Islamic Hindu fundamenatlist in Kamal Hasan's character was not explained. If a muslim (who was a loyal servant and friend) had murdered your wife I think most people attitudes to your fellow man would change. The film has a consistent plot. The only critisicm is that perhaps the film was too long but overall a great film which is indeed an experiment with truth.,indian masterpiece,kamal hasan is truly great actor with this film he has cemented his status talented director this is epic film which is extremely thoughtful it shows how rationale man can turn into prujudiced extremist it shows that hatred past tragic events will not solve feelings loss loved one it also shows that compassion sacrifice are needed politics rather that populist rabble rousing this film has been criticized many quarters many reasons people have said that film focuses kamal hasan too much that it self indugent vanity fest this is unfair considering mr kamalji is one best actors india also film is about this person imapct his thinking tragic surrounding events film would not have worked without this intense focus films storyline has been labeled inconsistent it has been cited that change anti islamic hindu fundamenatlist kamal hasans character was not explained if muslim who was loyal servant friend had murdered your wife i think most people attitudes your fellow man would change film has consistent plot only critisicm is that perhaps film was too long but overall great film which is indeed experiment with truth,0.5873015873015873,0.22301587301587306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,In-depth movie!!,"This is a kind of movie where you will find a new details every time you watch it.The plot is set around the events in the time period between Direct Action Day (16 Aug, 1946) to Gandhi's assassination (Jan 30, 1948). This is definitely a wonderful watch if you know background of characters like Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Godse and Direct Action Day. The story proclaims itself as a combination of Fact + Fiction when the movie starts in the house of a bedridden old Saket Ram. And, except Gandhi, Suhrawardy, Godse other real characters from the Partition era are given least importance as the plot is about how the fictional characters, their family and friendship is affected because of this partition decision and the ensuing riots.There is also a small bit of alternate history, where Saket Ram hallucinates his wife saying - ""This is Vijaya Dasami Day... You are chosen to accomplish the mission.."" while in reality it was Muslim League who said ""Muslims must remember that ... it was in Ramazan that the permission for jehad was granted by Allah..."" and provocated the Direct Action Day riots.And, this is one of the boldest attempts in portraying Gandhi, where two sides of the character are presented. There are some who praise Gandhi and there are some who criticize Gandhi for his actions. And, this happens right from the starting till the last part.

9.0,A fine but brutal film.,"Before I discuss the film in depth, I want to talk about the distributor of this DVD--Eros Video. Despite the name, it is not a pornographic film company. But, I am less than impressed by their practice of forcing ads upon the viewer. When the DVD begins, it forces you to watch previews (you cannot hit the menu button to skip them). Then, AFTER you finally push the DVD button to begin the feature, it forces you to watch another ad! This is the only company I know which does this. They also do something else which is terribly annoying--they don't bother to caption the songs sung throughout the film! Come on Eros, are you deliberately trying to get potential customers to deliberately avoid your releases and look for other Indian films to watch instead?! I know that because there are thousands and thousands of Indian films out there, I sure will look for those from other companies first.The story is told as a giant flashback by Saketh Ram (Kamal Hassan) and is set in 1946--just a year before India became independent of the United Kingdom. While many in the West may not realize it, this was a VERY scary time in India, as partition into East and West Pakistan and India would help to bring a lot of suppressed hatred between Hindus and Muslims to the surface--and countless people (at least in the hundreds of thousands) would die in sectarian violence. Many more would be forced to immigrate because of this violence.Ram adores his new wife--so much so that his friends think he's a bit henpecked and make fun of him. When, in the midst of the violence that is overtaking his city, he sees a woman being attacked by a crowd he rescues her--but, as the expression goes, no good deed goes unpunished! Later, a crowd of Muslims storms his home--raping and murdering his wife! Not surprisingly, he now hates Muslims and joins a group of extremists--determined to kill as many of 'them' as he possibly can. However, he and his new 'friends' come to hate one person more than anyone else...Gandhi. Although a Hindu, Gandhi calls for peace and forgiveness--which enrages these radicals and he is their number one target....and Ram is their chosen instrument of revenge.You probably noticed my summary in which I called this a fine but brutal film. Now the brutality certainly is necessary--this film is about a very, very violent time in India and I think everyone should know more about this period in history. But it is NOT a film for the young. While it doesn't show the rape occurring (thank God), it has quite a few scenes of shocking brutality. You can't help but flinch at several scenes--I know I did. Plus, this DID make the movie more realistic and hard-hitting---so have some Kleenex nearby just in case. And what is to like about the movie? Well, a lot...that's for sure. To me one of the best things about the film was choosing Kamal Hassan for the lead. He not only did a good job but looked so ordinary--not the larger than life sexy leading man. This 'ordinariness' of Ram and his wife as well made the film much easier to connect with and appreciate. I also liked the story....with one minor exception. Although the film is told through flashbacks, sometimes you can't tell when it's in the 1940s or the present--and that is a tad confusing--as are some of the surreal dreams. But, these are minor complaints, as the overall film is entertaining, touching and informative.For another film about the same period, though told from a different viewpoint, try also watching Deepa Metha's ""Fire"". I don't think the film is superior to ""Hey Ram""--just different and quite touching.",fine but brutal film,before i discuss film depth i want talk about distributor this dvd eros video despite name it is not pornographic film company but i am less than impressed by their practice forcing ads upon viewer when dvd begins it forces you watch previews you cannot hit menu button skip them then after you finally push dvd button begin feature it forces you watch another ad this is only company i know which does this they also do something else which is terribly annoying they dont bother caption songs sung throughout film come eros are you deliberately trying get potential customers deliberately avoid your releases look other indian films watch instead i know that because there are thousands thousands indian films out there i sure will look those other companies first story is told as giant flashback by saketh ram kamal hassan is set 1946 just year before india became independent united kingdom while many west may not realize it this was very scary time india as partition into east west pakistan india would help bring lot suppressed hatred between hindus muslims surface countless people at least hundreds thousands would die sectarian violence many more would be forced immigrate because this violence ram adores his new wife so much so that his friends think hes bit henpecked make fun him when midst violence that is overtaking his city he sees woman being attacked by crowd he rescues her but as expression goes no good deed goes unpunished later crowd muslims storms his home raping murdering his wife not surprisingly he now hates muslims joins group extremists determined kill as many them as he possibly can however he his new friends come hate one person more than anyone else gandhi although hindu gandhi calls peace forgiveness which enrages these radicals he is their number one target ram is their chosen instrument revenge you probably noticed my summary which i called this fine but brutal film now brutality certainly is necessary this film is about very very violent time india i think everyone should know more about this period history but it is not film young while it doesnt show rape occurring thank god it has quite few scenes shocking brutality you cant help but flinch at several scenes i know i did plus this did make movie more realistic hard hitting so have some kleenex nearby just case what is like about movie well lot thats sure me one best things about film was choosing kamal hassan lead he not only did good job but looked so ordinary not larger than life sexy leading man this ordinariness ram his wife as well made film much easier connect with appreciate i also liked story with one minor exception although film is told through flashbacks sometimes you cant tell when its 1940s or present that is tad confusing as are some surreal dreams but these are minor complaints as overall film is entertaining touching informative another film about same period though told different viewpoint try also watching deepa methas fire i dont think film is superior hey ram just different quite touching,0.558513161922253,0.06385445362718091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Best and the most Mature of all India's Official Entries to the Academy Awards (even today).,"I had already said what I had to about this particular movie long ago in the previous version of my review of mine.Here I am going to clarify on a few aspects about this movie which some of the so called critics have put forward :1. Critic No.1 argues: What has Kamal Haasan shown so different in this movie ? This critic says, Kamal has shown Muslims at first, offending Hindus of all castes and types including the Sikhs,the South Indians,the Maharastrians and others AND this particular Hindu gets into the 5th gear, does an act of revenge and then blames this poor guy Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. According to the critic,Kamal instead could have shown the other way round.My reply, as a representative of those millions of fans of 'Hey Ram(2000)': I would recommend this Critic No.1 to watch movies like ""The Legend Of Bhagat Singh(2002)"", ""Veer Savarkar(2001)"", ""1947: Earth(1997)"". In the ""The Legend..."" the great Bhagat Singh has a foresight that this Congress is gonna do nothing. The only aim of Congress is to acquire power and then the sentiments of Indian public go to Hell. Now this Congress which believes in so called Equality of Religions in India always looked upon Muslims as nothing but a Vote Bank. M. K. Gandhi was no doubt genuinely interested in the welfare of people but politically protected the Muslims and deliberately overlooked the behaviour of his so called Muslim Brethren. Due to this political immunity the probability that in the freedom riots, the ratio of Muslims offenders to other non-Muslim offenders was 8 : 2 will be the most possible probability and nothing less than that.  In ""Veer Savarkar(2001)"" the great revolutionary Savarkar explains how this Khilafat movement is nothing but a joke, a farce. In fact, the Britishers knew that revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Veer Savarkar were the REAL danger compared to the moderate M.K. Gandhi. That was the reason why British tortured them like they were in hell ,like they were some pigs in a slaughterhouse. Meanwhile the sweet spotlight was on Mr. M. K. Gandhi and his fasts.Deepa Mehta's masterpiece ""1947:Earth"" reveals the attitude of the minority. But the other Star of the movie was of course the ever-talented Aamir Khan revealing his pure acting brilliance.Mr. Critic No.1 should pick any newspaper from any stall from any locality from any Country and he should find major news on the lines of rivalry between America-Iraq, India-Pakistan or Israel-Palastine, the Babri Masjid issue and other such news. You will notice that one of the rival pairs is always a Islamic MILITANT group.This problems have been existing since Mr. Mohammad Gajni, then Aurangzeb and Osama Bin Laden and Dawood Ibrahim today.2. Now this particular Critic No. 2 argues : This movie contains unnecessary sex.My reply,as a representative of those millions of fans of 'Hey Ram(2000)': Sex depicted in this movie is at least a lot better and REALISTIC than the UNrealistic rain-dancing of those idiot actors(???) and saree-clad actresses(???) in those nonsense '3 out of 5' star rated movies. Also let's not forget the running around trees in fully forced rain. Did somebody say Influenza ?This movie is only made for adults no doubt, but it is meant for ONLY MATURE THOUGHTFUL REASONABLE ADULTS.Sex is a nature's creation necessary for propagation of life and a KISS in particular is a universal symbol for expressing Love among living creatures including all animals but definitely NOT flowers as some Indian directors show in their nonsense '3 out of 5' star rated movies something UNNATURAL like flowers kissing each other instead of the hero and the heroine. All these efforts are to please our 70 years old censorship 'virtuous' members. The fact is : We don't need 'virtuous' censorship members but mature,scientific, understanding, reasonable thinkers. BUT one thing I admit : This movie is NOT meant for family viewing where teenagers or children of lesser age are present. Even some adults can be considered as children if they don't possess a proper scientific view while watching movies like this. If sex and violent scenes are removed from this movie it will become a truly visual effects family movie with a message at the end,middle and the beginning.In fact, I found a lot positive aspects in 'Hey Ram(2000)' :1. The technique used to show blood oozing out of Rani's throat was brutal but was a technical achievement in an Indian movie. The ONLY other time I observed the feat being used was in the legendary Steven Spielberg's Classic Masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan(1998)' starring the great Tom Hanks.2. Visual Effects during the marital bliss(Saket Ram/Maithili) and during the TWISTER scene were visual pleasure to watch.3. At the climax, Kamal shows a child representing all the riot affected children and their problems. It's a pity rioting demons don't spare even innocent children.4.The so called Astrological expert is blown to smithereens by Saket Ram. If every Indian follows his ideal, those 'Ponga Pandits' will never cheat us of our money.5.Even milk goes for a kick and a toss when Saket Ram explains how it was meant only for children and not adults. Then follows a truly hilarious joke by Maithili.6. One more myth like millions of others which was prevalent in India was buried that M.k. Gandhi uttered the words 'Hey Ram' moments before death. If a bullet traveling at a speed of 800 miles/hour is shot at you at a POINT BLANK range, your eyes will simply pop out. And here, M.K. Gandhi was a 79 year old man and he was shot by not one but TWO in the chest. If your lungs are that open forget about uttering any words at all.7. The only fault Kamal did was a technical one. He shouldn't have shown Gandhi flying backwards when hit by the bullets. FORENSIC STUDIES have positively proved that if a live body is hit by a bullet, the body will simply slump down to the ground.Some Other Things : Vasundhara Das, Atul Kulkarni and Shahrukh have performed in an OUTSTANDING way in a life-time role. Shahrukh doesn't over act and this proves Kamal's Effective Direction.And now for those who say that this movie is disturbing or controversial :All great masterpieces right from 'The Godfather(1972)' to 'Schindler's List(1993)' and to the recent 'The Sixth Sense(1999)' and 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' all had been controversial but TRUTHFUL EYE OPENERS.In fact, according to me, an individual should watch only TWO types of movies :1.TRUTHFUL EYE OPENERS : These types expose real facts but violence and sex are not necessities to be depicted. Examples:Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram(2000), Denzel Washington's Cry Freedom(1987), Al Pacino's Godfather(1972/74)series or The Insider(1999), Robert De Niro's The King of Comedy(1983),Morgan Freeman's SE7EN(1995),The Usual Suspects(1995) etc.2. PURELY FICTIONAL DREAMLAND FEEL-GOOD MOVIES : These type of movies relieve us of our daily stresses and tensions when watched for fun keeping our brains aside for a while. Example : Steven Spielberg's E.T. : The Extra Terrestrial(1982) or Hook(1991),Beauty and the Beast(1991),The Lion King(1994),Casper(1995), The Batman Movies etc.As for the remaining run-of-the-mill type of movies which do NOT belong to any of the above TWO types,I call them DUMB movies made for the similar types of individuals.Eg. The extremely torturous The Mummy(1999),MouseHunt,I Know What You Did Last Summer... etcThese movies are, as Saket Ram says, as SEMI-FICTIONAL as M.K.Gandhi's autobiography.    ... and I don't prefer semi fiction.",best most mature all indias official entries academy awards even today,i had already said what i had about this particular movie long ago previous version my review mine here i am going clarify few aspects about this movie which some so called critics have put forward 1 critic no 1 argues what has kamal haasan shown so different this movie this critic says kamal has shown muslims at first offending hindus all castes types including sikhs south indians maharastrians others this particular hindu gets into 5th gear does act revenge then blames this poor guy mr mohandas karamchand gandhi according critic kamal instead could have shown other way round my reply as representative those millions fans hey ram 2000 i would recommend this critic no 1 watch movies like legend bhagat singh 2002 veer savarkar 2001 1947 earth 1997 legend great bhagat singh has foresight that this congress is gonna do nothing only aim congress is acquire power then sentiments indian public go hell now this congress which believes so called equality religions india always looked upon muslims as nothing but vote bank m k gandhi was no doubt genuinely interested welfare people but politically protected muslims deliberately overlooked behaviour his so called muslim brethren due this political immunity probability that freedom riots ratio muslims offenders other non muslim offenders was 8 2 will be most possible probability nothing less than that veer savarkar 2001 great revolutionary savarkar explains how this khilafat movement is nothing but joke farce fact britishers knew that revolutionaries like bhagat singh veer savarkar were real danger compared moderate m k gandhi that was reason why british tortured them like they were hell like they were some pigs slaughterhouse meanwhile sweet spotlight was mr m k gandhi his fasts deepa mehtas masterpiece 1947 earth reveals attitude minority but other star movie was course ever talented aamir khan revealing his pure acting brilliance mr critic no 1 should pick any newspaper any stall any locality any country he should find major news lines rivalry between america iraq india pakistan or israel palastine babri masjid issue other such news you will notice that one rival pairs is always islamic militant group this problems have been existing since mr mohammad gajni then aurangzeb osama bin laden dawood ibrahim today 2 now this particular critic no 2 argues this movie contains unnecessary sex my reply as representative those millions fans hey ram 2000 sex depicted this movie is at least lot better realistic than unrealistic rain dancing those idiot actors saree clad actresses those nonsense 3 out 5 star rated movies also lets not forget running around trees fully forced rain did somebody say influenza this movie is only made adults no doubt but it is meant only mature thoughtful reasonable adults sex is natures creation necessary propagation life kiss particular is universal symbol expressing love among living creatures including all animals but definitely not flowers as some indian directors show their nonsense 3 out 5 star rated movies something unnatural like flowers kissing each other instead hero heroine all these efforts are please our 70 years old censorship virtuous members fact is we dont need virtuous censorship members but mature scientific understanding reasonable thinkers but one thing i admit this movie is not meant family viewing where teenagers or children lesser age are present even some adults can be considered as children if they dont possess proper scientific view while watching movies like this if sex violent scenes are removed this movie it will become truly visual effects family movie with message at end middle beginning fact i found lot positive aspects hey ram 2000 1 technique used show blood oozing out ranis throat was brutal but was technical achievement indian movie only other time i observed feat being used was legendary steven spielbergs classic masterpiece saving private ryan 1998 starring great tom hanks 2 visual effects during marital bliss saket ram maithili during twister scene were visual pleasure watch 3 at climax kamal shows child representing all riot affected children their problems its pity rioting demons dont spare even innocent children 4 so called astrological expert is blown smithereens by saket ram if every indian follows his ideal those ponga pandits will never cheat us our money 5 even milk goes kick toss when saket ram explains how it was meant only children not adults then follows truly hilarious joke by maithili 6 one more myth like millions others which was prevalent india was buried that m k gandhi uttered words hey ram moments before death if bullet traveling at speed 800 miles hour is shot at you at point blank range your eyes will simply pop out here m k gandhi was 79 year old man he was shot by not one but two chest if your lungs are that open forget about uttering any words at all 7 only fault kamal did was technical one he shouldnt have shown gandhi flying backwards when hit by bullets forensic studies have positively proved that if live body is hit by bullet body will simply slump down ground some other things vasundhara das atul kulkarni shahrukh have performed outstanding way life time role shahrukh doesnt over act this proves kamals effective direction now those who say that this movie is disturbing or controversial all great masterpieces right godfather 1972 schindlers list 1993 recent sixth sense 1999 artificial intelligence 2001 all had been controversial but truthful eye openers fact according me individual should watch only two types movies 1 truthful eye openers these types expose real facts but violence sex are not necessities be depicted examples kamal haasans hey ram 2000 denzel washingtons cry freedom 1987 al pacinos godfather 1972 74 series or insider 1999 robert de niros king comedy 1983 morgan freemans se7en 1995 usual suspects 1995 etc 2 purely

hook 1991 beauty beast 1991 lion king 1994 casper 1995 batman movies etc as remaining run mill type movies which do not belong any above two types i call them dumb movies made similar types

10.0,A look at the craft and the music of this excellent film from India,"An excellently crafted Indian film, the lead actor Kamal Hassan amazes me not only with his histrionics as the lead actor but also as a good writer and director. Technically brilliant, the story has many layers to it. I liked the idea of showing the story in the eyes of a dying old man (good use of prosthetic make-up on Hassan) for whom the past is vivid in memory and the present is bleak. So, the story of the past is in color and the present in Black and White... a novel approach indeed.It's a look at a fictitious character who could have been Gandhi's assassin. It's a look at the counter-effect of Gandhi's principles and his decisions (or the lack thereof) on the lives of some of the Hindus. It brings to light something Indian history books were embarrassed to talk about!The story itself covers 50 decades and has characters from every region of India, the hero is a Tamil Brahmin, his first wife a Bengali, his best friend a Muslim pathan, his 'guide', a Maharashtrian, and his target, a Gujarati! Rani Mukharjee and Shah Rukh excel in their small but substantial roles. Atul Kulkarni as Abhyankar and singer Vasundhara Das stand out in their debut performances.The highlight of the film of course is its background music by Maestro Ilaya Raja. I believe he is the only Asian to have composed a symphony, that too in 30 days flat!!!! There's no composer in India who can match up to this guy. Alas, the Hindi film industry these days encourages only mediocrity and has not recognized this gem from the South! I wish the movie's background music score is made available. Of the songs, there's one which kind of remained in the background for some reason, it is an excellent melody.. 'Har Koyee Samjhe' sung by classical artist, Ajoy Chakraborti.Cinematography and art-direction too are flawless. All in all a great film. If you are tired of watching candy-floss romances, inane comedies, garish family dramas and weddings... this is THE antidote! Go for it!",look at craft music this excellent film india,excellently crafted indian film lead actor kamal hassan amazes me not only with his histrionics as lead actor but also as good writer director technically brilliant story has many layers it i liked idea showing story eyes dying old man good use prosthetic make up hassan whom past is vivid memory present is bleak so story past is color present black white novel approach indeed its look at fictitious character who could have been gandhis assassin its look at counter effect gandhis principles his decisions or lack thereof lives some hindus it brings light something indian history books were embarrassed talk about story itself covers 50 decades has characters every region india hero is tamil brahmin his first wife bengali his best friend muslim pathan his guide maharashtrian his target gujarati rani mukharjee shah rukh excel their small but substantial roles atul kulkarni as abhyankar singer vasundhara das stand out their debut performances highlight film course is its background music by maestro ilaya raja i believe he is only asian have composed symphony that too 30 days flat theres no composer india who can match up this guy alas hindi film industry these days encourages only mediocrity has not recognized this gem south i wish movies background music score is made available songs theres one which kind remained background some reason it is excellent melody har koyee samjhe sung by classical artist ajoy chakraborti cinematography art direction too are flawless all all great film if you are tired watching candy floss romances inane comedies garish family dramas weddings this is antidote go it,0.5644607843137255,0.23921568627450973,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,Hey Ram : The Outstanding Experiment with the truth,"Kamal Hassan, one of the most popular & talented actors from South started his directorial debut with the funny & entertaining 'Chachi 420' where Hassan mastered the role of an old woman with ease. After a rib- tickling endeavour, Kamal Hassan grabbed the reigns to direct a powerful film of a completely new genre, 'Hey Ram' a film which displayed the communal instability in India post Independence in 1947. The words breathed last by the great leader of our country, Mahatma Gandhi itself reveals the fact that the film is based on a semi-fictional plot involved in the assassination of Gandhi. Gathering an ensemble cast from Bollywood, Hassan made it a point to make a very commercial approach to the film. The film starred Kamal Hassan as the protagonist while Bollywood actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Hema Malini, Naseeruddin Shah & Om Puri handled small but significant roles. The film commences on 6th December 1999 which marked the 7th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition which invited communal riots between Hindus & Muslims. On this date, in a dark dingy room lay 89-year old Saket Ram on his death bed with his grandson by his side. The film time- travels to the era of 1940's where Pakistan & India where being partitioned and that was the reason why two best friends Saket Ram (Kamal) & Amjad Ali Khan (Shah Rukh), who were archaeologists working for a British named Wheeler were told to stop their work & return back to their respective homes. Saket Ram returns back to Calcutta to his Bengali wife, Aparna (Rani) but tragedy follows after him as Aparna gets sexually assaulted & killed by Muslim extremists in the locality. A distraught & enraged Saket Ram meets Abhyankar, a revolutionary who convinces Ram that Mahatma Gandhi is solely responsible for this bloodbath. Succumbed to family pressure, Saket Ram marries a teenager Maithili (Vasundhara Das). The film displays some intimate scenes between Saket & Maithili. The scenes are so detailed that you find yourself astonished as why Censor Board did not intervene with their snipping tool.The film revolves entirely around Saket Ram's life as he collaborates with Abhyankar and Maharaja and offers to help them in the plot to assassinate Gandhi. Shah Rukh Khan as Amjad Ali Khan is entirely used as a commercial weapon by Kamal Hassan as inspite of having just 30 minutes in the film; SRK has successfully managed to uplift the standard of the film. He plays a Muslim Pathan who rescues Saket Ram who gets trapped in the communal riots in curfew-struck Muslim community in Delhi. The film indeed deserved more of Shah Rukh Khan's exquisite display of acting skills as his inclusion in Hey Ram poster must have promised the viewers a parallel role alongside Kamal. The film has some really advanced & subtle effects, the film although shot in 2000 makes you feel as if the film is shot in the early 60's. The 1999 India scenario is showcased in black & white to distinguish it well with the cinematic representation of happenings in past. Hey Ram is powerful as it deals efficiently with universal & contemporary themes set in the post-Independence India. Thanks to Kamal's creative mind & brilliance put into the film, film was chosen as India's official entry to Oscars to be considered as nomination in Best Foreign Film of the year. Hey Ram is story of fictional character whose life gets turned up-side down because of some real life incidents in 1940's that have changed the course of history. The film concludes admirably in a poignant mannerPeople having a fine taste for art films, Hey Ram will give you one of the best cinematic experiences of your life.",hey ram outstanding experiment with truth,kamal hassan one most popular talented actors south started his directorial debut with funny entertaining chachi 420 where hassan mastered role old woman with ease after rib tickling endeavour kamal hassan grabbed reigns direct powerful film completely new genre hey ram film which displayed communal instability india post independence 1947 words breathed last by great leader our country mahatma gandhi itself reveals fact that film is based semi fictional plot involved assassination gandhi gathering ensemble cast bollywood hassan made it point make very commercial approach film film starred kamal hassan as protagonist while bollywood actors like shah rukh khan rani mukherjee hema malini naseeruddin shah om puri handled small but significant roles film commences 6th december 1999 which marked 7th anniversary babri masjid demolition which invited communal riots between hindus muslims this date dark dingy room lay 89 year old saket ram his death bed with his grandson by his side film time travels era 1940s where pakistan india where being partitioned that was reason why two best friends saket ram kamal amjad ali khan shah rukh who were archaeologists working british named wheeler were told stop their work return back their respective homes saket ram returns back calcutta his bengali wife aparna rani but tragedy follows after him as aparna gets sexually assaulted killed by muslim extremists locality distraught enraged saket ram meets abhyankar revolutionary who convinces ram that mahatma gandhi is solely responsible this bloodbath succumbed family pressure saket ram marries teenager maithili vasundhara das film displays some intimate scenes between saket maithili scenes are so detailed that you find yourself astonished as why censor board did not intervene with their snipping tool film revolves entirely around saket rams life as he collaborates with abhyankar maharaja offers help them plot assassinate gandhi shah rukh khan as amjad ali khan is entirely used as commercial weapon by kamal hassan as inspite having just 30 minutes film srk has successfully managed uplift standard film he plays muslim pathan who rescues saket ram who gets trapped communal riots curfew struck muslim community delhi film indeed deserved more shah rukh khans exquisite display acting skills as his inclusion hey ram poster must have promised viewers parallel role alongside kamal film has some really advanced subtle effects film although shot 2000 makes you feel as if film is shot early 60s 1999 india scenario is showcased black white distinguish it well with cinematic representation happenings past hey ram is powerful as it deals efficiently with universal contemporary themes set post independence india thanks kamals creative mind brilliance put into film film was chosen as indias official entry oscars be considered as nomination best foreign film year hey ram is story fictional character whose life gets turned up side down because some real life incidents 1940s that have changed course history film concludes admirably poignant mannerpeople having fine taste art films hey ram will give you one best cinematic experiences your life,0.4148134571521669,0.18651840990550664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,Great Kamal Hasan in challenging film,"This is one of the few Hindi films to take head on issues related with India's partition and succeed. 'Hey Ram' features an impressive performance by Kamal Hasan. His role is complex and its hard to see how anyone else could have done better. There are lots of religious metaphors subtly woven into the script. Naseeruddin Shah is a memorable eccentric Gandhi. Shahrukh Khan has a small role but impresses. The film is very violent and some parts are quite difficult to watch, so beware. The period detail is effective. Ultimately, the film makes a strong plea for tolerance but does so without strident moralizing. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10",great kamal hasan challenging film,this is one few hindi films take head issues related with indias partition succeed hey ram features impressive performance by kamal hasan his role is complex its hard see how anyone else could have done better there are lots religious metaphors subtly woven into script naseeruddin shah is memorable eccentric gandhi shahrukh khan has small role but impresses film is very violent some parts are quite difficult watch so beware period detail is effective ultimately film makes strong plea tolerance but does so without strident moralizing highly recommended overall 9 10,0.6102380952380952,0.06277777777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Another Class Performance proving KAMAL IS WORLDS BEST ACTOR!!,"An excellent work by Padmasree KamalHasan! No:1 performance by Kamal proves once again , he is the best actor in the whole globe! The movie is a tribute to the society. Very well pictured.The movie is moving with slow pace through out. Though at times we get the feeling that its gonna pace up, but it still moves in slow pace which might have disappointed some viewers and hence the movie couldn't do well in box office!I think the background music ram .. ram.. hey hey ram ram.. should have been played through out the movie which would have made this more thrilling!Anyways this is a masterpiece!

,The best commercial Indian picture I've seen....,".....though I'm not a fan of the genre so I haven't seen many. I usually have to find another room to hide in whenever my sister's or mother watch them. One day I saw a scene from ""Hey Ram"" and was intrigued, so I decided that maybe I'll check it out. After seeing ""Sholay"", supposedly one of the greatest Indian movies ever made (maybe if you haven't already seen all the Westerns it stole from), and wasn't sure I could bare another one for a while. But I did, and I'm glad. It was far from perfect, but as other's mentioned, it was consistently watchable (it holds three hours of interest well), and features some bravura set pieces. I enjoyed the fantasy/nightmare sequences quite a bit. I think the first poster missed the point of the second sex scene.... it was meant to be more disturbing than sexy.... it occurs during the peak of Ram's decent into madness. I doubt Kamal Hassan meant for a women morphing into a gun to be sexy! Some of the fantasy stuff wasn't entirely successful, but I appreciated the experimentation. The main flaw with the film I thought, was the music.... and I'm not talking about the musical numbers, but the score, which was far too overbearing at times. But over all the film is quite powerful... the acting is sensational all around. Anyway, this is definitely a must see for anyone who (like I once did) that Indian commercial films never attempt to become works of art.",best commercial indian picture ive seen,though im not fan genre so i havent seen many i usually have find another room hide whenever my sisters or mother watch them one day i saw scene hey ram was intrigued so i decided that maybe ill check it out after seeing sholay supposedly one greatest indian movies ever made maybe if you havent already seen all westerns it stole wasnt sure i could bare another one while but i did im glad it was far perfect but as others mentioned it was consistently watchable it holds three hours interest well features some bravura set pieces i enjoyed fantasy nightmare sequences quite bit i think first poster missed point second sex scene it was meant be more disturbing than sexy it occurs during peak rams decent into madness i doubt kamal hassan meant women morphing into gun be sexy some fantasy stuff wasnt entirely successful but i appreciated experimentation main flaw with film i thought was music im not talking about musical numbers but score which was far too overbearing at times but over all film is quite powerful acting is sensational all around anyway this is definitely must see anyone who like i once did that indian commercial films never attempt become works art,0.5612962962962963,0.275,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Sheer Brilliance!!!,"Hey Ram!!! This movie defines class. Plot Review : Its truly engaging how Saket Ram(KH) after being a victim of the Bengal Riots is made to believe by Hindu Extremist(AK) that MK.Gandhi is responsible for all the Chaos. How the next sequence of events make Saket Ram realize by his own conscience, Amjad Ali Khan (SRK) that Gandhi is the only sanity remaining is the plot of the movie.Acting: Kamal Haasan portrays his character in such a great fashion hardly ever seen before : Jubilant, Grief Stricken, Innocent, As an Aveneger , In Severe Dilemma , Man Reformed the range is awesome. Atul Kulkarni as Shriram Abhyankar leaves a very strong impression and was very rightly awarded the National Award. Shahrukh,Saurabh Shukla, naseeruddin shah, Hema Malini, Girish Karnad, Rani Mukherjee , Vasundra Das and all the well known faces have given their best.Pros : Good Plot, Nice Acting, Technically Brilliant = Great Film.

8.0,A towering landmark of Millenial Indian Cinema,"image1.jpegk Hey Ram poster in Tamil HEY RAM! 2000, Starring, written, directed and produced by Kamal Haasan is both a landmark of the Bollywood cinema and a landmark in the career of Tamil superstar Kamal Hasaan. Basically an historical drama dealing with the background of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in early 1948 by a confused Hindu fanatic and an impassioned call for an end to communal strife between Hindus and Moslems in India, a never ending problem. In passing a call as well for an end to hostility between India and Pakistan, a single people separated by a line on the map.Saketh Ram is an archaeologist by profession. We see him at the beginning on a dig at Mohenjo Daro but the excavation is stopped as the violence of Partition breaks out. Next we see him at a drinking party with old friends in Calcutta which is followed by a playful and somewhat naughty sequence with some hot bedroom action with his lovely wife (a most enticing Rani Mukherji). However their domestic bliss is soon destroyed during the ""direct action day"" riot in Calcutta following the 1947 Partition of India when a raging mob breaks into the house raping and killing his wife.Saketh emerges hellbent on revenge and is soon convinced that Mahatma Gandhi who was against separation and preached tolerance of all religions including Islam is responsible for all the problems happening in the country. He is enlisted for the job of assassinating Gandhi by a young Hindu extremist, One of his best friends, Amjad Ali Khan (Shahrukh Khan) is a whiskey drinking Moslem and the two will have to protect each other later from raging Hindu and Muslim mobs as the film progresses. At the time of the film SRK was 35 and well established as the ""King of Bollywood"" whereas Kamaal at age 46 reigned in south India as the King of ""Kollywood"" (the Tamil film industry). Interestingly SRK agreed to take a secondary backup role in this film but though he has far less screen time than Kamal he just about steals every scene he is in. More over, whereas Khan usually plays a Hindu in Bollywood films, here he gets to be his real self as a Muslim. This is a trilingual film with interplay between Hindi, Tamil and English. Lots of English because the two main characters do not understand each others languages (Tamil and Hindi) so they have to resort to English which is in fact the real situation even today when Tamils and North Indians meet. A lesser known actress, Vasundhura Das, (better known as a singer) is compelling as Saketh's second wife Mythili. Other featured Indian stars are Hema Maliini (Sholy, of Tamil origin) and Nasureddin Shah, veteran of the Parallel film movement, as Mahatma Gandhi. According to popular legend Ghandi is reputed to have exclaimed ""Hey Ram"" (Oh God!) as he was shot. Kamal discards the legend but retains it as his title. Gandhi did however say,""I will gladly accept a bullet if it stops the strife between Hindus and Muslims"". He got his bullet but not quite his final wish. In the film the story is narrated by Ram to his grandson from his death bead half a century later on 6 December 1999, the 7th anniversary of the Destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, a landmark in Hindu hatred of Indian Moslems. The rest is flashback. Some concessions to the sing and dances of Masala films are made but this is overall a serious masterfully made historico-political drama that should be on the must-see list of any follower of the Indian cinema scene.
