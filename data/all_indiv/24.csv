9.0,Worth the TIME!!,"Vikram K Kumar is the real hero! All his work in making such a detailed script has payed off. The screenplay will be slightly hard to digest for the commercial movie lovers! But I loved the way he penned the screenplay. The Romantic part is well combined with sci-fi part, so it was very engaging and enjoyable one.Greatest comeback for Surya! If it's Theri for Vijay, it's 24 for Surya! He just basks the whole movie on his back and delivers a great performance! Aathraya role needs special mention as he literally steals the show with his sleek villainous role.! Watch out!ARR silently keeps the flow of the movie with his BGM and you won't get disturbed unlike others. The Art direction and cinematography completes the visual cycle beautifully! Special appreciations to them!Every character is given its own importance. Was waiting for such a sci-fi thriller in Thamizh cinema that has very good detailing that it takes some time to get a good look into it completely!! Although it's on the lines of Indru Netru Naalai, 24 is the movie to watch out, purely for its screenplay! Aathraya - highlight of the whole movie! Must watch in theater!!As it's a sci-fi in Thamizh, 9/10!!!!",worth time,vikram k kumar is real hero all his work making such detailed script has payed off screenplay will be slightly hard digest commercial movie lovers but i loved way he penned screenplay romantic part is well combined with sci fi part so it was very engaging enjoyable one greatest comeback surya if its theri vijay its 24 surya he just basks whole movie his back delivers great performance aathraya role needs special mention as he literally steals show with his sleek villainous role watch out arr silently keeps flow movie with his bgm you wont get disturbed unlike others art direction cinematography completes visual cycle beautifully special appreciations them every character is given its own importance was waiting such sci fi thriller thamizh cinema that has very good detailing that it takes some time get good look into it completely although its lines indru netru naalai 24 is movie watch out purely its screenplay aathraya highlight whole movie must watch theater as its sci fi thamizh 9 10,0.5029809523809523,0.31067619047619044,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,"""24"" is a brilliantly written film with some usual romantic clinches.","Note: the write-up is based on the 2 hours 34 minutes trimmed version that is currently being played in theaters.The film is trimmed, Well trimmed indeed. Right through the 154 minutes run time, The film is filled with lots of 'Disney' like fun moments that will be enjoyed by the kids and you wont be annoyed accompanying them.The 'Actor Surya' who has been lately trying hard to become 'Entertainer Suriya' seems to be back in a well executed film. Suriya trying to select different kinds of scripts was clearly evident through his previous films but the script which looked good in paper was never executed well in the screen and this is the only factor why 24 as a film is a well made comeback film. Talking about the execution, Suriya plays three different characters and each character seems to be a break up for three different kinds of audience.Mani- The jolly go lucky -romantic guy who is enjoyed by the family audience.Sethuraman- The typical 'for the critic' written guy who runs the plot of the film.Athreya- The stylish villain who keeps the boys excited throughout the run time.These break up of characters have done wonders in the film to satisfy whole of the audience and this is the reason why I call this as a 'Pakka Masala' product.(Taking about me calling this film a 'Pakka Masala product' and if you find this offensive try finding another alternative word for a Sci-Fic film like this containing some totally unwanted romance and misplaced songs, From Thani Oruvan i have been complaining about this and I'm already tired) Right from the film Manam director Vikram Kumar seems to never get the romantic scenes right. It will mostly end up has a half written and half swallowed lines but his brilliance as a writer is rightly shown in the place where he should be appreciated for. His writing and linking of each characters to the story shows his intelligence. Sometimes it makes you complain about the co incidence but believe me it is never easy to link all characters to one plot.There are different versions of Time travel and as time travel never been proved or experienced you are forced to accept the directors version of time travel. If you have a friend who sees different kinds of films and is comparing each film and finding faults, its high time you ask the nerd to shut up.According to my knowledge the directors version of time travel is simple, well written and presented. Leaving those love scenes aside the screenplay is well written and even a little bit of annoyance will make you miss some twists. Vikram Kumar seems to be playing a intelligent game with the audience, every time you expect the character to reveal something he fools you and shows you how intelligent his characters are. I bet you can never predict those 'I got it right' moments and it is one of the reasons why the film is never a bore.Samantha is adorable in each scene and Saranya as usual does the mother role at her best. Talking about the characters in the film, There are around 5 important characters and in which 3 of them are being played by Surya himself :P still you never get bored, Even the style of crying seems to be different for each character.Another brilliance in the movie is the visual effects. The moments of keys, the inside of the watch and the rain sequence (my favorite ) isn't an immature work. Kudos to the cinematographer and VFX TEAM.As said before you will never be annoyed watching this film in theater, until your nerd friend starts his theories. :P",24 is brilliantly written film with some usual romantic clinches,note write up is based 2 hours 34 minutes trimmed version that is currently being played theaters film is trimmed well trimmed indeed right through 154 minutes run time film is filled with lots disney like fun moments that will be enjoyed by kids you wont be annoyed accompanying them actor surya who has been lately trying hard become entertainer suriya seems be back well executed film suriya trying select different kinds scripts was clearly evident through his previous films but script which looked good paper was never executed well screen this is only factor why 24 as film is well made comeback film talking about execution suriya plays three different characters each character seems be break up three different kinds audience mani jolly go lucky romantic guy who is enjoyed by family audience sethuraman typical critic written guy who runs plot film athreya stylish villain who keeps boys excited throughout run time these break up characters have done wonders film satisfy whole audience this is reason why i call this as pakka masala product taking about me calling this film pakka masala product if you find this offensive try finding another alternative word sci fic film like this containing some totally unwanted romance misplaced songs thani oruvan i have been complaining about this im already tired right film manam director vikram kumar seems never get romantic scenes right it will mostly end up has half written half swallowed lines but his brilliance as writer is rightly shown place where he should be appreciated his writing linking each characters story shows his intelligence sometimes it makes you complain about co incidence but believe me it is never easy link all characters one plot there are different versions time travel as time travel never been proved or experienced you are forced accept directors version time travel if you have friend who sees different kinds films is comparing each film finding faults its high time you ask nerd shut up according my knowledge directors version time travel is simple well written presented leaving those love scenes aside screenplay is well written even little bit annoyance will make you miss some twists vikram kumar seems be playing intelligent game with audience every time you expect character reveal something he fools you shows you how intelligent his characters are i bet you can never predict those i got it right moments it is one reasons why film is never bore samantha is adorable each scene saranya as usual does mother role at her best talking about characters film there are around 5 important characters which 3 them are being played by surya himself p still you never get bored even style crying seems be different each character another brilliance movie is visual effects moments keys inside watch rain sequence my favorite isnt immature work kudos cinematographer vfx team as said before you will never be annoyed watching this film theater until your nerd friend starts his theories p,0.5672341269841269,0.12640674603174604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"

8.0,Best SCI-FI ever from India,"As a doctor who fan, I thought the time traveling elements in the show could one day be matched in Tamil film industry. This movie came very close to it. Excellent writing and acting pave way for a new darling for critics. I really liked Surya's Psychotic killer role than his other two. As the negatives, I could say the romance and songs killed my mood multiple times. Songs are pure time dragging (Yes I know it is ARR). But I do understand the need for commercial elements. They should have released a shorter version of the movie in oversees without all that romance crap for the international audience. Overall, this movie is gold and the best ever from the actor we all admire.

10.0,Best sci-fi ever from India,"By all means it's completely a Suriya's show with the brilliance of director Vikram K kumar, Suriya plays three roles, A terrific menacing villain Athreya, A charmer Mani & the scientist Sethuraman. This is one of a kind time travelling movie. Every shot in the movie has something to do with the forth coming scene which keeps It engaging, kudos to Vikram. Athreya's intro, bang on interval block , intelligent climax, makes you move to the edge of your seat. Samantha is so beautiful & has given a lovely performance as Sathya, Nithya menon gives a short but vital contribution to the movie. Saranya Ponvannan as usual loving caring mother with secrets. Vikram K kumars screenplay is the driving force of the movie, he has carefully placed all the twist and turns of the movie in perfect places.Cinematographer Thiru is the man who gets all the credit for the visual extravaganza we see & a very special mention to the production design team and the VFX team they deserve a big loud applause Suriya as a ruthless villain Aathreya gives a top notch performance. Suriya as a charmer Mani will make you laugh & love. Suriya portrays Sethuraman as an innocent scientist and a lovable husband.All the above follow the powerful writing of Director Vikram K kumar, his intelligence in screenplay will amaze you, thrill you & prove your prediction wrong.

10.0,Steal the Time,"As far as Indian film industry is concerned there are quite among a lot of films boldly take up the genre of science- fiction.Few do well at the box-office while others don't mainly due to the fact that they overpower the film with some magical theories.Hollywood had witnessed many time traveling based movies but Indian films have rarely witnessed this terminology.24 is a sci-fi movie based on time travel, excellently narrated by Vikram.K.Kumar and effortlessly carried out by Surya.Surya in fact, has made a debut as an arrogant(yet lovable) villain.He has played three characters(Sethuraman,Athreya,Manikandan). Female leads include Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Nithya Menon. Music and background score is by our ""Oscar Hero "" A.R.Rahman.The story starts with an experimental research on a time-travel device (a watch) carried out by a super nerdy scientist ,Dr.Sethuraman. The villain, Athreya who is the twin brother of Sethu was reaching out to rip the watch from his dear brother. Athreya with his devilish look, kills Sethu and his wife. Yet, Sethu manages to save his child. The story then moves forward to 2016, where we can see a young and energetic Mani. Mani is a watch mechanic by profession. When he finds out the mystery and magic inside the watch (Codenamed ""Project 24""), he just does childish tricks at first. Eventually, Athreya who remained passive in coma gets into action.The movie again gains its pace from Athreya.This time Athreya is more of evil and filled with the spirit of vengeance, though he's paralyzed. He manages to find the watch that Mani has got. The story is all about how Mani manages to move back to the past and change the scenarios.The stunning visuals and cinematography by Thirunavukkarasu was a visual treat obviously. A.R.Rahman's background music gave some goosebumps filled moments.On the whole, it is evident that this movie was carried out picture perfect by the entire crew.24 is undoubtedly a brain-child of the genius director Vikram Kumar.",steal time,as far as indian film industry is concerned there are quite among lot films boldly take up genre science fiction few do well at box office while others dont mainly due fact that they overpower film with some magical theories hollywood had witnessed many time traveling based movies but indian films have rarely witnessed this terminology 24 is sci fi movie based time travel excellently narrated by vikram k kumar effortlessly carried out by surya surya fact has made debut as arrogant yet lovable villain he has played three characters sethuraman athreya manikandan female leads include samantha ruth prabhu nithya menon music background score is by our oscar hero r rahman story starts with experimental research time travel device watch carried out by super nerdy scientist dr sethuraman villain athreya who is twin brother sethu was reaching out rip watch his dear brother athreya with his devilish look kills sethu his wife yet sethu manages save his child story then moves forward 2016 where we can see young energetic mani mani is watch mechanic by profession when he finds out mystery magic inside watch codenamed project 24 he just does childish tricks at first eventually athreya who remained passive coma gets into action movie again gains its pace athreya this time athreya is more evil filled with spirit vengeance though hes paralyzed he manages find watch that mani has got story is all about how mani manages move back past change scenarios stunning visuals cinematography by thirunavukkarasu was visual treat obviously r rahmans background music gave some goosebumps filled moments whole it is evident that this movie was carried out picture perfect by entire crew 24 is undoubtedly brain child genius director vikram kumar,0.5541666666666667,0.20286458333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"

7.0,Could've been better,"After a long time doing a movie review. Phew!!!!!!.......And after taking a long time in production, here comes the most anticipated Tamil movie - ""24"". Unlike the American and Indian TV shows of the same names, ""24"" is a sci-fi action-adventure movie, with the usual ingredients of a regular Tamil commercial movie. Namely:- a) A charming protagonist b) A dim-witted damsel c) Twist in the story (actually a lot of twists in the story) d) Soulful music and Energetic BGM (though I miss the old A. R. Rahman I knew) e) Scintillating cinematography, beautiful locales and bright colours.But the movie is not without its share of blemishes. And they're quite significant, which can never be ignored. But before I review this movie deeply (which includes spoilers), please read the synopsis.Sethuraman (Suriya), a scientist and a watch company owner, has just completed his dream project called,""Project 24"", which is - wait for it - a time-travelling watch. But his evil twin Athreya (Suriya) comes for 'his' watch, coincidentally on their (Sethuraman's and Athreya's) birthdays. In this process Athreya kills Sethuraman's wife (Nithya Menen), but Sethuraman saves his child and his invention, not without getting killed by his twin. Twenty six years later, Mani (Suriya) is a watch-mechanic, running his watch- repairing store, grew up with his foster-mother (Saranya Ponvannan), his goofy friend Saravanan (Sathyan) and a strange-looking wooden box. After a series of coincidences, Mani gets his hands on a strange-looking key, which unlocks the box and reveals the watch to him.Mani uses this watch to play time-freezing and time-travelling, click a picture with M. S. Dhoni, make the Indian team win a cricket match, and convince the dim-witted damsel (Samantha) that she is suffering from 'Imaginoromansophilia', while wooing her. What happened to Athreya? Is he still alive? Will the watch take a toll on Mani's life and also on other's lives, which are connected to Mani? These questions are answered in the film ""24"".Vikram K. Kumar, the man behind films like,""Yaavarum Nalam""/""13B"", ""Ishq"" and ""Manam"", is back with an almost-disappointing-yet-entertaining screenplay. It is so, because there are a few contrivances regarding a few scenes and the sci-fi element of this film, like:- a) We see Samantha's character boarding a train to Chennai city, from a village, for studying. But we never see her studying even a page of a book, nor do we see her even entering a college.b) Why can't we see a strong female character, apart from Nithya Menen's character (briefly)? Satyabhama (Samantha) was reduced to a dim-witted woman!c) The songs look so forced in the narrative. They just act as beautiful fillers, because the songs, especially ""Naan Un"" and ""Kalam En Kadhali"", are melodious and are shot beautifully.d) There are tons of cliché's and stereotypes, peppered with occasional misogyny.e) The climax is quite satisfying, yet appears quite abrupt.And so on.Yet, I must confess, I, personally, really liked the whole movie. Each and every twist is so meticulously written, and every principal character is justified.Screenplay (Vikram K. Kumar) was quite fast paced, despite the movie ticking 2 hours & 45 odd-minutes long. The story (Vikram K. Kumar), as I said, could've been dealt with more detail. The dialogues (Vikram K. Kumar) are a mixed bag. At times evocative, at times irritating and repetitive, at times appropriate.Cinematography (S. Tirru) is, as I mentioned, scintillating. The Make-Up (Clover Wootton and Preetsheel G. Singh) deserve a special mention, especially for Athreya character's make-up. Convincing and just flawless.Music (A. R. Rahman) is quite serviceable. But by Rahman's standards, it is quite disappointing. Only 2 songs were quite hummable, but are not quite memorable. Rest are just forgettable. Although, the BGM was quite evocative and lifts the mood of the scenes. The lyrics (Madhan Karky and Vairamuthu) are quite good, but not as good as their previous works. Though I must say ""Kalam En Kadhali"" by Vairamuthu suits each and every tune of the music provided. And ""Naan Un"" by Madhan Karky is quite romantic, and rendered as hauntingly melodious song by Mr. Rahman.Editing (Prawin Pudi) could've been better. Had the film been trimmed by around 20-25 minutes, the impact of the film would've been better, as the songs, as mentioned above, play as a spoilsport in the narrative.Stunts (Anbarivu) are choreographed as realistic as possible. Even the Dance Steps (Brinda, Raju Sundaram, Dinesh and Sridhar) are quite appreciable. Especially the dance steps in the song ""Kalam En Kadhali"", are quite apt.The Art WorK (Amit Ray & Subrata Chakraborty) is just marvellous.The Visual Effects (Julian Troussellier) are almost flawless, except for the concluding reels of the film, where the effects looked somewhat fake. The D.I. Colorist (Aashirwad Hadkar) deserves a special mention. Each frame looks great and rich in colours. My favourite one being the golden coloured frames, involving 2 Suriyas, one Nithya Menen and one Ajay, in both the initial and the concluding frames of the movie.Off the cast, Suriya, playing triple roles, provided his career's best performance till date. He played the three different roles of Sethuraman, Athreya and Manikandan with utmost perfection. Nithya Menen, though appears for a short period, leaves an impact. Samantha's character is reduced to a cliché'd caricature, which Tamil movie audience is habituated to. So are Saranya's and Sathyan's characters. Mohan V. Raman is wasted, so is Girish Karnad, although Girish gets a chance to emote, in an otherwise thankless role. Ajay, who plays Athreya's right-hand-man Mithran, played to the gallery.On the whole, as mentioned above, ""24"" could've been much better. Yet it is not totally bad. I give it a 7/10. Don't apply too much logic, and just flow with the tide.",couldve been better,after long time doing movie review phew after taking long time production here comes most anticipated tamil movie 24

6.0,Review – 24 (2016),"'24' by Vikram K Kumar is essentially a family drama centered around the idea of time-travel. However, the film also includes elements of romance, action and thrills in ample measures, even though the bulk of the screen time is spent on emphasizing the significance of familial bonds (Appa-Amma-Thaatha-Maama-Maami and so on).The director, who recently made the Telugu drama 'Manam' still seems slightly hungover from it. He has proved that he loves playing with the concept of time (13B, Manam). But the surprise in the screenplay here comes in the form of sci-fi elements. Tamil cinema (and Suriya himself of course!) has been churning out many sci-fi thrillers in recent times (Enthiran, Dashavathaaram, 7aum Arivu, Maattraann, Anegan, Indru Netru Naalai to name a few). Some of these were characterized by an overdone formulaic story replete with masala, while a few of them stood out for their innovative screenplays and seamless blend of sci-fi with other genres.'24' marks a return to the sci-fi genre for Suriya. Hats off to the man for taking up this expensive and ambitious project after many a recent failure (Maasss, Anjaan, Maattraann, 7aum Arivu) and funding it himself. I will not shy away from saying that the production values look top-notch and the CGI is mostly sans notable flaws. The sets boast of decorative extravagance and are mostly a treat to the eyes, at times resembling the lavishness of Shankar films. The cinematography by Tirru is nothing short of spectacular in the initial portions. It would also warrant special mention that different color-tones are attributed to different characters with respect to their portrayal in the film. For instance, the intelligent, yet tender (and at times, clumsy) Dr. Sethuraman (Suriya) and his wife (played by Nithya Menen in an extended cameo) gleam in lighter shades (of golden yellow) while his evil brother Aathreya is burnished in darker shades (of brown).The story is really not that path-breaking to be honest but still holds narrative interest owing to the director's firm grip on attention levels of the audience, by way of utilizing its star lead's boyish charm during the romantic interludes, as well as a welcome change of seeing him play the character of a psychotic antagonist. Aathreya wants his brother's time-travelling device (which happens to be a watch) by hook or by crook and is even willing to murder his brother and his family for the same. Suriya depicts the antagonist Aathreya in a style of his own and the actor seemingly looks like he had fun doing so. The devilish grin and the plain stares are placed at apt junctures by the actor. Suriya, the romantic charmer that he is, uses his potential to the maximum in the scenes with Samantha, although, however cute they may look initially, start to wear out and eventually end up bland. The romance is underplayed in the first half, with Mani (son of Dr. Sethuraman, again played by Suriya) using his time-travel watch to woo Sathya through various instances of play-pause-repeat. ""I'm a watch mechanic madam, enakku ithellaam sarva sadhaaranamaana vishayam"" is a line that brings both laughs and shrugs. Some of the wooing methods deployed here are fun to watch though, and this makes the first half a mildly entertaining affair. The amazing opening segment as well as intriguing interval block are admittedly where the writer-director scores brownie points.The film slows down considerably in initial portion of the second half with family sentiments (even though Saranya Ponvannan is consistently marvellous at her job of exuding maternal warmth!) and downright- silly romance segments thrown in simply for the purpose of extending the run-time. Thankfully, it does not take too long for the sci-fi element to bounce back and take its rightful position in the film and the viewer is rewarded with a feel-good (rather feel- great!) climax. However, it needs be bluntly accepted before and after watching the film that a lot of it works purely on coincidences rather than logic or situational coherence.A R Rahman's music+BGM is certainly a plus-factor although personally, I am of the opinion that a sci-fi film would be much better off without so many song-n-dance routines. If you, as a viewer, are able to forego these minor masalaic tropes and are okay with a run-time of 160 mins (editing dept. could have done better!), then you are in for a decently satisfying sci-fi treat!",review 24 2016,24 by vikram k kumar is essentially family drama centered around idea time travel however film also includes elements romance action thrills ample measures even though bulk screen time is spent emphasizing significance familial bonds appa amma thaatha maama maami so director who recently made telugu drama manam still seems slightly hungover it he has proved that he loves playing with concept time 13b manam but surprise screenplay here comes form sci fi elements tamil cinema suriya himself course has been churning out many sci fi thrillers recent times enthiran dashavathaaram 7aum arivu maattraann anegan indru netru naalai name few some these were characterized by overdone formulaic story replete with masala while few them stood out their innovative screenplays seamless blend sci fi with other genres 24 marks return sci fi genre suriya hats off man taking up this expensive ambitious project after many recent failure maasss anjaan maattraann 7aum arivu funding it himself i will not shy away saying that production values look top notch cgi is mostly sans notable flaws sets boast decorative extravagance are mostly treat eyes at times resembling lavishness shankar films cinematography by tirru is nothing short spectacular initial portions it would also warrant special mention that different color tones are attributed different characters with respect their portrayal film instance intelligent yet tender at times clumsy dr sethuraman suriya his wife played by nithya menen extended cameo gleam lighter shades golden yellow while his evil brother aathreya is burnished darker shades brown story is really not that path breaking be honest but still holds narrative interest owing directors firm grip attention levels audience by way utilizing its star leads boyish charm during romantic interludes as well as welcome change seeing him play character psychotic antagonist aathreya wants his brothers time travelling device which happens be watch by hook or by crook is even willing murder his brother his family same suriya depicts antagonist aathreya style his own actor seemingly looks like he had fun doing so devilish grin plain stares are placed at apt junctures by actor suriya romantic charmer that he is uses his potential maximum scenes with samantha although however cute they may look initially start wear out eventually end up bland romance is underplayed first half with mani son dr sethuraman again played by suriya using his time travel watch woo sathya through various instances play pause repeat im watch mechanic madam enakku ithellaam sarva sadhaaranamaana vishayam is line that brings both laughs shrugs some wooing methods deployed here are fun watch though this makes first half mildly entertaining affair amazing opening segment as well as intriguing interval block are admittedly where writer director scores brownie points film slows down considerably initial portion second half with family sentiments even though saranya ponvannan is consistently marvellous at her job exuding maternal warmth downright silly romance segments thrown simply purpose extending run time thankfully it does not take too long sci fi element bounce back take its rightful position film viewer is rewarded with feel good rather feel great climax however it needs be bluntly accepted before after watching film that lot it works purely coincidences rather than logic or situational coherence r rahmans music bgm is certainly plus factor although personally i am opinion that sci fi film would be much better off without so many song n dance routines if you as viewer are able forego these minor masalaic tropes are okay with run time 160 mins editing dept could have done better then you are decently satisfying sci fi treat,0.46220118569516144,0.14025148211895194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.3}"

I was expecting some paradoxes in the movie, some sort of predestined event that was inevitable, but nothing was there to wow. Perhaps happy ending made it bit boring. Could have been certainly better. Character of Sathya (Played by Samantha) felt useless and that character had little to no major affect on storyline. The reason for rivalry between the Brothers (Athreya & Shiva Kumar) is not mentioned in the movie. I expected more from this movie especially with Time Travel concept.

7.0,"A new era, but the past can never be forgotten.","Vikram K. Kumar, the director of non-regular flicks like Manam, Ishq and 13B has come with another exhilarating movie - 24. Not many Sci-fi movies are produced in Indian Cinema every year, so this comes in as a new taste for the already fed-up audience. Thanks to Surya for always trying to bring us some offbeat movies to improve the fate of Indian cinema.First of all, I'm glad to say that this movie, unlike most unorthodox movies produced in India isn't a copy of any Hollywood movie. Although it has a glimpse of BTTF, it cannot be cited as plagiarism in any way but rather can be called as a mere influence to develop this eccentric project. Second of all, let's forget logics while talking about such type of movies.The movie opens up with the past where Sethuraman invents a watch that could play with time. This scene alone can tell you how good a cinematographer Tirru is who did a similar job with Krrish 3. Just after achieving the glory, in comes the antagonist ""Athreya"", Raman's own brother who tries to nab the watch by threatening to kill his wife. Here's where the astute scientist mind comes into play who hands the watch to the new-born son and then the boy himself to a woman to look after him.Fast forwarding 26 years (to 2016) we have the young Suriya named Mani who works as a watch mechanic only under the guidance of his foster mother. In some surprising turn of events, he comes to know about the unprecedented capabilities of the watch and soon starts experimenting with it where at one point we experience the best shot of the movie. He then meets Samantha and as we expect he falls in love with her and makes her fall in love with him using some gimmicks as the rightful owner of the watch. These scenes are dragged a bit and we can see that this part of romance along with the non-essential songs are targeted at a specific set of audience to improve the reach. Not to forget, any such young fun- loving guy would experiment in the same way as he did that also lets him learn a lot about the watch.Just before the intermission, we can see the protagonist and antagonist facing each other after which the awe-factor of the watch is known that also justifies the name given to the watch. A lot of regular type of drama goes on in the second half which can leave some audience to boredom but the character of Athreya still leaves you glued using his witty tricks to snatch the watch. Albeit, sometimes even he does some stupid things that could never be spoken of. What happens later is better to be seen on the screen.Overall, 24 isn't a spectacular movie but is definitely worth a watch and does stand out among the heap of recipes we taste regularly. The cast and crew should well be appreciated with big names written all over it. The music by A. R. Rahman doesn't make a big impact on the movie although the background score is appreciable. As mentioned earlier, cinematographer Tirru has done a great job. The acting by Surya in the form of Athreya deserves applauds. As always, director Vikram K. Kumar should be appreciated to what he's trying to do in each and every movie. The flaws come in the form of the usual cliché-ridden scenes that still abide by the law of Indian cinematic rules. I felt like they could have done much better with this script. In fact, it could be made into a TV series as they've already planned a sequel to this film. I'd rate it 6/10 but +1 for letting us (Tollywood audience) watch a Sci-fi flick after a long time.",new era but past can never be forgotten,vikram k kumar director non regular flicks like manam ishq 13b has come with another exhilarating movie 24 not many sci fi movies are produced indian cinema every year so this comes as new taste already fed up audience thanks surya always trying bring us some offbeat movies improve fate indian cinema first all im glad say that this movie unlike most unorthodox movies produced india isnt copy any hollywood movie although it has glimpse bttf it cannot be cited as plagiarism any way but rather can be called as mere influence develop this eccentric project second all lets forget logics while talking about such type movies movie opens up with past where sethuraman invents watch that could play with time this scene alone can tell you how good cinematographer tirru is who did similar job with krrish 3 just after achieving glory comes antagonist athreya ramans own brother who tries nab watch by threatening kill his wife heres where astute scientist mind comes into play who hands watch new born son then boy himself woman look after him fast forwarding 26 years 2016 we have young suriya named mani who works as watch mechanic only under guidance his foster mother some surprising turn events he comes know about unprecedented capabilities watch soon starts experimenting with it where at one point we experience best shot movie he then meets samantha as we expect he falls love with her makes her fall love with him using some gimmicks as rightful owner watch these scenes are dragged bit we can see that this part romance along with non essential songs are targeted at specific set audience improve reach not forget any such young fun loving guy would experiment same way as he did that also lets him learn lot about watch just before intermission we can see protagonist antagonist facing each other after which awe factor watch is known that also justifies name given watch lot regular type drama goes second half which can leave some audience boredom but character athreya still leaves you glued using his witty tricks snatch watch albeit sometimes even he does some stupid things that could never be spoken what happens later is better be seen screen overall 24 isnt spectacular movie but is definitely worth watch does stand out among heap recipes we taste regularly cast crew should well be appreciated with big names written all over it music by r rahman doesnt make big impact movie although background score is appreciable as mentioned earlier cinematographer tirru has done great job acting by surya form athreya deserves applauds as always director vikram k kumar should be appreciated what hes trying do each every movie flaws come form usual clich ridden scenes that still abide by law indian cinematic rules i felt like they could have done much better with this script fact it could be made into tv series as theyve already planned sequel this film id rate it 6 10 but 1 letting us tollywood audience watch sci fi flick after long time,0.42282342657342664,0.15612373737373733,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,A time travel movie that works like a game of chess.,"I want to keep this review honest, spoiler free and as short as possible.Usually when dealing with complicated screenplay in Tamil movies the director will dumb down the story so that average Tamil audience can understand. However, doing so it reduces the raw intensity and takes the charm out of the movie.This is where 24 dares to think different. Director Vikram Kumar treats the audience as an intelligent person and sticks to the complicated screenplay that moves back and forth in time like a game of chess. This is probably the reason you see some of the negative reviews for this film.Suriya's portrayal of Athreya reminds me of Light Yagami (L) from the famous Japanese Anime Death Note. Well, there are two more Suriyas too and he has done a tremendous job of differentiating all the three roles. Sadly, Samantha is portrayed as the clichéd romantic interest and she is bearable at best and tedious at worst. Mani's (Suriya) antics to woo her shows us the kind of nerd director Vikram Kumar is.AR Rahman is the Best in the industry and this comes with a mountain of expectations from him. The songs are not up to the mark of ARR level even though he compensates for this with good BGM.The entire cast has done an above average job in the acting department. Editing is sleek, cinematography suits the genre well and it is a plus. Suriya's on screen presence holds the movie together and Vikram's screenplay keeps you engaged till the end with some twists, surprises and pleasant scenes.To conclude, this movie is so good that it could have been made into a standalone Hollywood movie. You can watch it once for Suriya and once more for Vikram Kumar.",time travel movie that works like game chess,i want keep this review honest spoiler free as short as possible usually when dealing with complicated screenplay tamil movies director will dumb down story so that average tamil audience can understand however doing so it reduces raw intensity takes charm out movie this is where 24 dares think different director vikram kumar treats audience as intelligent person sticks complicated screenplay that moves back forth time like game chess this is probably reason you see some negative reviews this film suriyas portrayal athreya reminds me light yagami l famous japanese anime death note well there are two more suriyas too he has done tremendous job differentiating all three roles sadly samantha is portrayed as clich d romantic interest she is bearable at best tedious at worst manis suriya antics woo her shows us kind nerd director vikram kumar is ar rahman is best industry this comes with mountain expectations him songs are not up mark arr level even though he compensates this with good bgm entire cast has done above average job acting department editing is sleek cinematography suits genre well it is plus suriyas screen presence holds movie together vikrams screenplay keeps you engaged till end with some twists surprises pleasant scenes conclude this movie is so good that it could have been made into standalone hollywood movie you can watch it once suriya once more vikram kumar,0.5835701085701086,0.09068491568491568,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Good Movie to watch,"Great Piece of work. The movie is a first of its kind in a Tamil cinema industry. This movie has beautifully executed the concept of time travel for a family audience.

The sci-fi film's screenplay is well made to make even a non-science savvy audience understand the script compared one of the actor's earlier venture ""7 am Arivu"".The hero has shown a lot of variations while acting in different roles of the film. Though,there are a few unwanted romantic scenes which reduces the pace of the movie, the overall movie is exciting for the audience. Venturing into a new dimension of film in the Tamil cinema, the movie is fully packed with humor,action, science and fantasy.",good movie watch,great piece work movie is first its kind tamil cinema industry this movie has beautifully executed concept time travel family audience plot movie is unique with twists throughout movie making audience excited about next scene movies screenplay is probably above par than most tamil movies last few years sci fi films screenplay is well made make even non science savvy audience understand script compared one actors earlier venture 7 am arivu hero has shown lot variations while acting different roles film though there are few unwanted romantic scenes which reduces pace movie overall movie is exciting audience venturing into new dimension film tamil cinema movie is fully packed with humor action science fantasy,0.43593073593073595,0.21839826839826837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Best ever Tamil film,"Thanks to the Director sir Vikram K. Kumar for giving such a best film in Tamil, this the best ever Tamil movie I've ever watched.. And the work of camera man is really nice that too in that rain drop scene I've mesmerized for a moment, it is awesome. About the music I don't have to say anything but.. Song are good, I thing the 24 team has not given the important to songs. But the background score, it can be done by only AR Rahman sir. Surya sir's acting is appreciable, especially with the ""Atharya"" character. You cannot expect any social message or something in this movie but it a complete package of a new journal. You will surprised minute by minute. you can watch this movie with family that is a common case in all Surya's movie and Thanks for that.Thanks.",best ever tamil film,thanks director sir vikram k kumar giving such best film tamil this best ever tamil movie ive ever watched work camera man is really nice that too that rain drop scene ive mesmerized moment it is awesome about music i dont have say anything but song are good i thing 24 team has not given important songs but background score it can be done by only ar rahman sir surya sirs acting is appreciable especially with atharya character you cannot expect any social message or something this movie but it complete package new journal you will surprised minute by minute you can watch this movie with family that is common case all suryas movie thanks that thanks,0.5221690590111642,0.3352472089314195,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.59, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.26}"
5.0,The editor went crazy cutting this film .....,"Dear Pudi Prawin (editor of 24),what is the average and median shot length of 24? I'm sure it would be one or two seconds. Definitely not more than two seconds. You obviously wanted to hit the audience on the head with a plethora of visuals each one not lasting more than three seconds at the most. Jeez man! Is this the future of big budget Indian cinema? Just a succession of gimmicks to prevent the audience from checking their Whats app messages?The film is like a 7 course dinner consisting of a mix of genres - sci-fi, action (its pretty gory), romance, comedy and even family. I'm sure feminists would come down pretty hard on the romantic track which they might deem to be creepy. The story and plot developments are quite imaginative. Vikram.K.Kumar is no dunce. I guess 24 has set new standards in what a big budget Indian sci-fi film ought to look like. Glossy visuals, loads of overhead shots, stunning locales and pretty standard but world class special effects. The audience in the theater where I watched this film were clapping at some of the special effects.I'm no fan of Surya. He plays three different roles in this film. The guy is so square jawed, it is pretty hard for him to disguise this and his muscularity. There is no vulnerability about him. He is especially bad in the role of the geeky scientist. I'm sure Aamir Khan would love to act in a remake of this film.Best Regards, Pimpin.(4.5/10)",editor went crazy cutting this film,dear pudi prawin editor 24 what is average median shot length 24 im sure it would be one or two seconds definitely not more than two seconds you obviously wanted hit audience head with plethora visuals each one not lasting more than three seconds at most jeez man is this future big budget indian cinema just succession gimmicks prevent audience checking their whats app messages film is like 7 course dinner consisting mix genres sci fi action its pretty gory romance comedy even family im sure feminists would come down pretty hard romantic track which they might deem be creepy story plot developments are quite imaginative vikram k kumar is no dunce i guess 24 has set new standards what big budget indian sci fi film ought look like glossy visuals loads overhead shots stunning locales pretty standard but world class special effects audience theater where i watched this film were clapping at some special effects im no fan surya he plays three different roles this film guy is so square jawed it is pretty hard him disguise this his muscularity there is no vulnerability about him he is especially bad role geeky scientist im sure aamir khan would love act remake this film best regards pimpin 4 5 10,0.5988940424654712,0.0774788703360132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.4}"
