,No winners,"Perhaps no other cinematic depiction of revolt against colonial rule is so detailed, vivid, and specific as the 1965 Battle of Algiers (La battaglia di Algeri, just reissued in a new print and having limited distribution in the US). It's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the French in Algiers in the late Fifties that shows how the French systematically eradicated that insurrection. It's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now, as then. But as I'm not the first to note, it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. It was therefore foolish of the Pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control Iraqi `resistance'/'terrorism' were to be found in it, and it has been equally foolish of the Black Panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. Those tactics did not succeed; but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement: the French won the battle but lost the war. A process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months, takes years to happen. The film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence, the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome. The insurrection The Battle of Algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold, methodical French Colonel Mathieu, who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance, `triangle' by `triangle', using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous `terrorists'/'partisans,' then killing the `head' of the `worm' their structure represents so it can't `regenerate.' Once this happens, after a merciless French campaign following a general strike, the sympathizers in the majority Algerian population are totally demoralized; but two years later a vigorous national independence movement `suddenly,' `spontaneously,' springs forth, and not long afterward France has to grant Algerian independence. It's at this point, rather than at the moment of Mathieu's momentary triumph, that the film ends. Gillo Pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader, Saadi Yacef, but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. We see as much of the French dissection of the situation and repression of it (by the police chief, then Colonel Mathieu) as we see of the `terrorists'/'partisans' planning and execution of their actions. We see Colonel Mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play, a shades-wearing, cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity, honesty, and panache; he himself has a `partisan' background. The `terrorist'/'rebel' leaders are serious, intensely committed men of various types, from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. There are no `heroes' here; or, alternately, if you like, they're all `heroes.'Mathieu appears before the press beside the captured `rebel'/'terrorist' leader - an unusual move in itself - and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. The `rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending `terrorist'/'rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. `Give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' Mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the `rebellion'/'terrorism'. After this explanation, the film, typically systematic at this point, begins showing a series of tortures of Algerians being carried out. The first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small, tortured Algerian man who's broken down and revealed where Ali `La Pointe,' the firebrand, the last remaining leader, is hiding. Then we see the `terrorist'/'terrorist' leader Ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway, their faces soft and beautiful. The splendid black and white photography works like William Klein's Fifties and Sixties images (he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically) to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the North African people and their gritty Casbah milieu. Much of the film's power comes from the way Pontecorvo was able to work, through Saadi Yacef, directly in the Casbah among the real people - as Fernando Meirelles worked in the favelas of Brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing City of God.The voices, which are dubbed, as was the fixed Italian filmmaking style, work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times, but the French is so analytical and the Algerians' Arabic so exotic-sounding (even to a student of Arabic) that they work, and the insistent, exciting music composed by Pontecorvo himself in collaboration with Ennio Morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.The fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of Algerian extras who swarm across the screen: it's in the crowd scenes that The Battle of Algiers really sings. There are many superb sequences of street fighting, of people massing at checkpoints, of the French victims innocently assembled in public places; and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as Algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. This is a film (again, like City of God) of almost intoxicating -- and nauseating -- violence, complexity, and fervor. Pontecorvo's accomplishment, though, is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. The evenhandedness of the coverage works a Brechtian `Alienation Effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.The sequence of three pretty Algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one -- but only one among many. First they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up French style and then they get past the checkpoint into the French quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar, a dance club, and an airport lounge. Again close-ups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing: first the innocent, vulnerable faces, then the explosions. Here our sympathies for the French victims are fully awakened. Another sequence of Algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of Christ's Passion. There's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator, because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. The Battle of Algiers is a final triumphant use of Italian cinematic neorealismo. The killing is observed neutrally, but with sadness, as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better - a stupid game observed with astonishing zest. Revived thirty-five years later in a new 35-mm. print, its grainy beauty pristinely vivid, The Battle of Algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of `terrorism,' repression, torture, revolt, and full-fledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. Like any classic, it's of its time and of all time. There's a lesson here, but it's not for partisans or colonialists: it's for all people.",no winners,perhaps no other cinematic depiction revolt against colonial rule is so detailed vivid specific as

,An unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.,"In 1962 after more than 130 years of French colonial rule, Algeria became independent. Gillo Pontecorvo's `Algiers' shows the decade leading to that liberation in a powerful story about Muslims asserting their rights through violence, hiding, and plotting in the Kasbah, a demiworld of narrow, winding, seemingly endless alleys that are the only protection the rebels have from the eyes of the French. The re-release of the 1965 black and white film is a convincing story of a people who do not want to be occupied and will give their lives so their families can one day be free.The story centers on a couple of Muslim leaders, the charismatic Col. of the French forces, and the bombings and shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day. The film's sympathy is for the Muslims, but the Colonel has moments of reflection that could be sympathetic, especially with the revelation that he was a member of the resistance in WWII and may have suffered in a concentration camp. The director shows the influence of Italian neo-realists like Roberto Rossellini (`Paisan') by shooting in documentary style on location, using non-actors (except for the Colonel), and generally avoiding an agitprop angle.But the film's sympathy in the end belongs to the occupied people. When 3 rebel women change appearance to look French, infiltrate, and plant bombs, the irony obvious to American audiences in their current struggle is a tribute to the strength of the narration and characterization and the universal dislike of occupation and subjugation.The torture of the Muslim prisoners is the most poignant relevance to the recent scandal in Iraq. The Colonel's justification for the practice to gain life-saving information is classic `ends-justify-the-means' logic still being used by great nations. In fact, the Pentagon reportedly had seen this film during the first days of the second Iraq War; some say they learned nothing from the film, which is an unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.",unforgettable study occupation defeat,1962 after more than 130 years french colonial rule algeria became independent gillo pontecorvos algiers shows decade leading that liberation powerful story about muslims asserting their rights through violence hiding plotting kasbah demiworld narrow winding seemingly endless alleys that are only protection rebels have eyes french re release 1965 black white film is convincing story people who do not want be occupied will give their lives so their families can one day be free story centers couple muslim leaders charismatic col french forces bombings shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day films sympathy is muslims but colonel has moments reflection that could be sympathetic especially with revelation that he was member resistance wwii may have suffered concentration camp director shows influence italian neo realists like roberto rossellini paisan by shooting documentary style location using non actors except colonel generally avoiding agitprop angle but films sympathy end belongs occupied people when 3 rebel women change appearance look french infiltrate plant bombs irony obvious american audiences their current struggle is tribute strength narration characterization universal dislike occupation subjugation torture muslim prisoners is most poignant relevance recent scandal iraq colonels justification practice gain life saving information is classic ends justify means logic still being used by great nations fact pentagon reportedly had seen this film during first days second iraq war some say they learned nothing film which is unforgettable study occupation defeat,0.45176767676767676,0.16893939393939392,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.35}"

When three Algerian women come down from the Casbah to plant bombs in the French quarter of the city, you can almost cut the tension with a knife. When the bombs go off, you think they must have been real bombs. And when you see the devastation they leave in their wake, you cannot fail to be moved. The massive rebellion in the streets at the end of the film also seems so real, you sit wondering how many extras must have been injured filming those scenes.""Battle of Algiers"" combines brilliant photography, crisp direction, an intriguing plot and some very fine acting.

,Great war movie? Yes---and maybe the best POLITICAL movie ever.,"I wish I could locate a videocassette of this film--subtitled, not dubbed. The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was a pompous disclaimer that ""not one foot"" of documentary footage had been used. But, in light of the finished product, it's a remarkable statement. If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to its credit that one never gets a sense of ""good guys vs. bad guys"" here--only of people trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which no escape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the ""heroic"" Algerian revolutionaries while booing the ""villainous"" French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint. This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, and beautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven't seen it and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--and pray that it's subtitled and not dubbed.

Even though you are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is at times hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and often unsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co production between Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turn itself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort of neutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled from individual demonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officers who fought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of their former enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that would kill their own people.

10.0,Powerful and Impressive Masterpiece,"In 1954, the National Liberation Front of Algiers shots many French policemen beginning a movement for the independence of their country; in return, the Chief of Police plants a bomb in the Arab quarter, killing many dwellers. The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command. In 1962, the Algerians finally achieve their aimed independence.""La Battaglia di Algeri"" is a powerful and impressive masterpiece about the fight that happened in Algiers in the period between 1954 and 1962 between the Algerian resistance and the French military forces. A couple of months ago I saw ""Mon Colonel"", another magnificent movie about this dark period of the mankind history. In both movies, we see no difference between the methods used by French in Algerian, or the Nazis in World War II, or the South American's dictatorships in the 60's, 70's and 80's, or by the American in Iraq, of the Chinese in Tibet. ""Liberty, Fraternity, Equality for us, but torture and abuse of the human rights for the others"" should be the correct sentence applicable to most nations. Therefore the writing of Machiavelli in ""The Prince"" about the behavior of the ""princes"" along history could be updated to the disrespect of human rights by powerful nations against weakest ones in the name of their best interests.

And I know what I'm talking about as I was there, in Algeria, during the 'Dark Decennial', while we were fighting against our own people whom turned terrorists in the name of Islam.So for those who will watch this film, please just remember not to judge any of the parties : Algerian /or/ French.

,Superb Treatment of Difficult Material,"Superbly done in all aspects. In years of movie viewing I've never seen staged events look so realistic. I don't know how Pontecorvo and Co. managed it, but they did. I first saw the movie in a packed LA theatre in 1967. The place absolutely rocked when the FLN vowed to continue their struggle— shades of the anti-Vietnam war then shaping up. I guess the colonial French learned their lesson in Vietnam and Algeria, a lesson neo-colonial Americans are still learning. Anyway, there's not much I can add to the hundreds of reviews already in place. That is, except to say that what stayed and still stays with me are the peasant faces, etched by years of hardship. Plus, the native quarters with their claustrophobic passageways that resemble a prison more than a neighborhood. No way Hollywood can duplicate these.

10.0,Best historical film ever?,"Battle of Algiers might well be the best historical film ever. It stands out as a splendid work of art, as an extremely accurate depiction of a specific time and place, as a political hymn to independence, and as a thought-provoking philosophical reflection on violence, and on the relationship between ends and means.It depicts the crucial years 1956-1957 in the Algerian war of independence from French colonial rule: the leaders of the independentist FLN decide to make Algiers a battlefield through strikes and terrorism in order to shake colonialism and to unite Algerians. The French respond to this urban guerilla with a ruthless control of space, separating European and Arab (the 'casbah') parts of the city, and with a brutal hunt of the FLN leaders through the torture of lesser militants. The French paratroops under gen. Massu, col. Bigeard and cdt. Aussaresses (blended in the film into a synthetic and fictitious character, col. Mathieu) eventually 'win' the battle of Algiers, but they end up 'losing' Algeria, as their repression has only fueled nationalism. The film therefore ends with the vision of Algerian crowds demanding independence ('Istiqlâl') as they march through the streets of Algiers in 1960.While this is an accurate enough analysis of such a complex war (even though interestingly de Gaulle is absent from the film as it intends to show how independence was conquered, not handed from above by French authorities) it is also a metaphor, as the film works on many different levels.It is a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. The combined use of space and music is stunning: when the french paratroops take possession of the Casbah, literally filling up the frame, gaining control of the streets, rooftops, hallways, courtyards, their superbly choreographed movements are underlined by a haunting theme by Morricone & director Pontecorvo. In these sequences he rivals not only Rossellini but Eisenstein.It is also strongly influenced by the New Wave in its manner of filming faces of protagonists. Some of the most beautiful moments in the film (as the beginning in Ali's hiding hole, or the scenes before the explosions in the bars) consist of protagonists' faces, victims, perpetrators, bystanders, shot in close up, in a beautiful black and white, without comment or voice-over: their common humanity is shown as well as the determination, the inner flame of those fighting for independence.I would disagree with other reviewers saying the movie is is unbiased: the film was commissioned and encouraged by the new-born Algerian state, and Yacef Saadi, a leader in the war of independence appears in prominent role. While the violence of both sides is coolly examined, the film justifies that of the Algerians, if only by showing (in a slightly dishonest way) that it always responds to the violence of the French. This question of precedence (who started to be inhuman?), though in the end quite pointless, has long poisoned mutual understanding between French and Algerian memories of the war. Another bias, explained by the FLN financing and staging, is the almost complete absence in the film of the middle ground, those neither in the terrorist FLN or in the paratroops, desiring to live in peace. They have existed, in both sides, as the examples of writer Albert Camus and his friend Mouloud Ferraoun show. This is quite understandable as it might not fit in the epic text depicted in realistic manner by Pontecorvo. However, in the film, the Algerians that are not committed to war are shown to be gangsters and pimps: this is a minor flaw of the film and its only touch of propaganda.All that said, the film is a stunning visual, historical and ethical masterpiece. Sadly and ironically, it capture a fiery desire for liberty at the very time (1965) a military coup by Boumediene overthrew Ben Bella in Algeria, repressing liberties for the decades to come. Most of all, it is one of the most potent depictions of and reflections on violence (in the twin and extreme forms of terrorism and torture) to be seen on screen.The most powerful image of the film remains the vision of a FLN militant broken by torture and forced to confess the hiding place of his chief. His haunted look, exhausted stance, empty eyes, grotesquely dressed in a paratroops' uniform, stand as an indictment of colonialism.",best historical film ever,battle algiers might well be best historical film ever it stands out as splendid work art as extremely accurate depiction specific time place as political hymn independence as thought provoking philosophical reflection violence relationship between ends means it depicts crucial years 1956 1957 algerian war independence french colonial rule leaders independentist fln decide make algiers battlefield through strikes terrorism order shake colonialism unite algerians french respond this urban guerilla with ruthless control space separating european arab casbah parts city with brutal hunt fln leaders through torture lesser militants french paratroops under gen massu col bigeard cdt aussaresses blended film into synthetic fictitious character col mathieu eventually win battle algiers but they end up losing algeria as their repression has only fueled nationalism film therefore ends with vision algerian crowds demanding independence istiql l as they march through streets algiers 1960 while this is accurate enough analysis such complex war even though interestingly de gaulle is absent film as it intends show how independence was conquered not handed above by french authorities it is also metaphor as film works many different levels it is masterpiece editing cinematography combined use space music is stunning when french paratroops take possession casbah literally filling up frame gaining control streets rooftops hallways courtyards their superbly choreographed movements are underlined by haunting theme by morricone director pontecorvo these sequences he rivals not only rossellini but eisenstein it is also strongly influenced by new wave its manner filming faces protagonists some most beautiful moments film as beginning alis hiding hole or scenes before explosions bars consist protagonists faces victims perpetrators bystanders shot close up beautiful black white without comment or voice over their common humanity is shown as well as determination inner flame those fighting independence i would disagree with other reviewers saying movie is is unbiased film was commissioned encouraged by new born algerian state yacef saadi leader war independence appears prominent role while violence both sides is coolly examined film justifies that algerians if only by showing slightly dishonest way that it always responds violence french this question precedence who started be inhuman though end quite pointless has long poisoned mutual understanding between french algerian memories war another bias explained by fln financing staging is almost complete absence film middle ground those neither terrorist fln or paratroops desiring live peace they have existed both sides as examples writer albert camus his friend mouloud ferraoun show this is quite understandable as it might not fit epic text depicted realistic manner by pontecorvo however film algerians that are not committed war are shown be gangsters pimps this is minor flaw film its only touch propaganda all that said film is stunning visual historical ethical masterpiece sadly ironically it capture fiery desire liberty at very time 1965 military coup by boumediene overthrew ben bella algeria repressing liberties decades come most all it is one most potent depictions reflections violence twin extreme forms terrorism torture be seen screen most powerful image film remains vision fln militant broken by torture forced confess hiding place his chief his haunted look exhausted stance empty eyes grotesquely dressed paratroops uniform stand as indictment colonialism,0.4611553030303031,0.10235321969696967,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"

4.0,"Cold, brutal and hard to connect with","The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a true-life event, they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.The cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point - it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually, but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic, so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it; except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for; The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt, it's not as potent as it could, and by rights should, have been. Due to the current state of the world, most notably the current mood in the USA, The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays, which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society. On the whole, I respect this movie for it's technical achievement and the fact that it offers an unbiased account of an important event in history. But I don't like it.",cold brutal hard connect with,problem with films like battle algiers is that while they offer stark portrait true life event they also lack any kind emotion so connecting with film is not easy film follows events revolution algiers but doesnt give you much story as why it happened so prior knowledge event is required viewer i know practically nothing about algiers so this wasnt very good aspect movie me through its lack emotional connection i cant help but think id have been better off watching news or documentary subject battle algiers is unpleasant throughout we watch as coffee shops are blown up french foreign legion tortures locals like henry portrait serial killer this film begs question its viewer namely why are you watching this however while henry had whole slasher craze its side help answer question events this film are far more brutal than those henry are also far larger scale not mention far more tragic as they definitely did actually happen couple this with its lack emotional side we have question indeed why are you watching this its not entertainment thats sure cinematography is very bleak offers stark portrayal events that film is depicting this is films major strong point it looks very nice none cast stands out individually but ensemble comes together nicely acting is extremely realistic so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage main backbone films substance focuses common war has no winners theme that hundred films have depicted before after it except even this is brought down by its emotional void while films such as lewis milestones all quiet western front gave you characters feel battle algiers has none even though its message is still felt its not as potent as it could by rights should have been due current state world most notably current mood usa battle algiers can easily be used as benchmark draw parallels with nowadays which way has given it new lease life todays society whole i respect this movie its technical achievement fact that it offers unbiased account important event history but i dont like it,0.511649546310563,0.03742895052217087,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"

The movie is so documentary-like as to seem like a stationary camera has been set up in the midst of turmoil. The French imperialists are the reason all this is happening. Obviously, years of ""rule"" make the day to day existence hard to change. Do all the Algerians want an overthrow of French rule? Probably not. Maybe not even a majority. As the rebels blow up restaurants and airport waiting rooms, the police are torturing the rebels. It becomes a cesspool of the lowest form of human degradation. And yet, what else can be the answer when a single entity has such a foothold and ultimate military power. As is usually the case, attrition does the job. With our current situation in the Mideast and Afghanistan, will we find ourselves reproducing what happened to the Russians? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers because the fight is against oppression. The kicker is that there is so much human and economic expense involved in these situations that often it takes centuries. We need to ask ourselves what is gained and one cannot put a price on the human soul.

10.0,Can A Mere Movie From 1966 Influence The 21st Century ? Maybe,"What everyone forgets nowadays is that the French contribution to counter insurgency warfare was "" The ink spot strategy "" which was very effective against the Viet Minh in the early stages of the French Indo-China conflict 1946-54 . The same strategy was used most effectively by the British in Malaya in the 1950s where it crushed a communist insurrection , though it was painfully ineffective when the Brits used it in Afghanistan 50 years later . We can all remember the hurtful comments about France being shouted from The White House during Dubya's era but didn't stop the irony - if not out and out hypocrisy - of the same politicians watching this film in order to pick up a few tips on counter insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan Before tonight I saw this almost 20 years ago and have never forgotten it . What I remembered most was the very even handed dealt out to both sides . This doesn't mean it tries either side as light gray , more like very very dark gray which neither side should be proud of . Based on the grim realities of the time . The French are happy to carry out black ops against the rebellion by blowing up innocent Algerian citizens making out houses are used for bomb factories and brutally torturing interned suspects while the Algerian rebels ( FLN ) blow up innocent civilians at coffee bars and sports stadiums , their victims not being the French military but innocent men woman and children . There are moments that can only be described as surreal irony where for example an Algerian child is stopped from being beaten to death by a French gendarme This is a political film that shows a neutral point of view . In this type of conflict nearly everyone is neutral . Both the French and FLN try and make a headway in to turning the neutral in to being on "" Our side "". Watching it in 2012 however you must be aware of one thing: The FLN are Muslims but they don't want to make a liberated Algeria in to a theocratic Islamic state - they're ( Relatively secular ) nationalists fighting again French colonialism . They're offering the Algerian people freedom from France not freedom from freedom . There's a subtlety to the ideas being put forward by both sides . The French realise not everyone is a terrorist whilst the FLN realise not everything can be solved by violence - revolutions need the will of the people . I could spend all day discussing the complex views put forward but there's a word limit of 1000 words . Just watch it and understand it There's some obvious flaws to the movie . One is that many of the deaths are a bit too bloodless . Another is that we never see what is happening outside of the Algerian capital though the war in the countryside is referred to . Perhaps the biggest complaint is that two years after the main action the story jumps forward where more violent demonstrations take place without the benefit of historical context but if you understand revolution it's because the occupying power hasn't provided any political gains to the wider Algerian population after temporarily beating the FLN . All insurrections are political in nature and if politicians can't bring a political carrot to the table after beating the insurrection to death with a stick then the violence will continue periodically and ultimately end in defeat . I do hope all politicians in charge of a NATO country realise this",can mere movie 1966 influence 21st century maybe,what everyone forgets nowadays is that french contribution counter insurgency warfare was ink spot strategy which was very effective against viet minh early stages french indo china conflict 1946 54 same strategy was used most effectively by british malaya 1950s where it crushed communist insurrection though it was painfully ineffective when brits used it afghanistan 50 years later we can all remember hurtful comments about france being shouted white house during dubyas era but didnt stop irony if not out out hypocrisy same politicians watching this film order pick up few tips counter insurgency warfare iraq afghanistan before tonight i saw this almost 20 years ago have never forgotten it what i remembered most was very even handed dealt out both sides this doesnt mean it tries either side as light gray more like very very dark gray which neither side should be proud based grim realities time french are happy carry out black ops against rebellion by blowing up innocent algerian citizens making out houses are used bomb factories brutally torturing interned suspects while algerian rebels fln blow up innocent civilians at coffee bars sports stadiums their victims not being french military but innocent men woman children there are moments that can only be described as surreal irony where example algerian child is stopped being beaten death by french gendarme this is political film that shows neutral point view this type conflict nearly everyone is neutral both french fln try make headway turning neutral being our side watching it 2012 however you must be aware one thing fln are muslims but they dont want make liberated algeria theocratic islamic state theyre relatively secular nationalists fighting again french colonialism theyre offering algerian people freedom france not freedom freedom theres subtlety ideas being put forward by both sides french realise not everyone is terrorist whilst fln realise not everything can be solved by violence revolutions need will people i could spend all day discussing complex views put forward but theres word limit 1000 words just watch it understand it theres some obvious flaws movie one is that many deaths are bit too bloodless another is that we never see what is happening outside algerian capital though war countryside is referred perhaps biggest complaint is that two years after main action story jumps forward where more violent demonstrations take place without benefit historical context but if you understand revolution its because occupying power hasnt provided any political gains wider algerian population after temporarily beating fln all insurrections are political nature if politicians cant bring political carrot table after beating insurrection death with stick then violence will continue periodically ultimately end defeat i do hope all politicians charge nato country realise this,0.37761695906432746,0.04030701754385965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,This film attains a level of importance that has never been achieved before,We all go to the movies because we love to be entertained and it's hard to argue that it's the greatest form of entertainment but when serious viewers talk about film in terms of being important you would have to expect this title to be instantly brought up. This film covers the years from 1954 to 1962 in Algeria when the Arab section of Algiers started an uprising to fight the French and gain their own independence. Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) is a petty thief and hustler and when he gets out of jail he teams up with El-hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef) and together they form the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in which they start terrorist attacks.*****SPOILER ALERT***** French authorities bring in Col. Mathieu (Jean Martin) to head the anti-terrorist unit and he uses methods of torture to slowly eliminate the insurrectionists who hide behind walls in apartments in the Casbah. Eventually Col. Mathieu kills Ali and it seems that everything will go back to what they were but two years later the Arabs take to the streets in huge numbers which causes the U.N. to take notice and in 1962 Algeria finally gained it's independence.This was made by Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo who shot this in the actual locations in Algeria and used mainly non-actors in his cast (Martin is the only professional) and the story is based on a book by Yacef who not only is a survivor of these true events but is cast in an important role. Pontecorvo has created a film that seems so real that he had to have a disclaimer put into the credits stating that no newsreel or documentary footage was used which is incredible because there are so many scenes in which it appears that real events were caught on film. The script does it's best to show both the positive and the negative of both sides of the French and the FLN but it does seem that Pontecorvo leans towards the side of the Arabs. This all takes place in a time when most American viewers were not aware of what terrorism was about and in 1965 it was probably easy to just point at the French and think they should just get out but now in our day and age audiences are a little more sophisticated to the world and it's politics. There are scenes that take place that we will probably never see done again because of the lack of safety especially the shots of the bombs exploding and the (so-called) actors scrambling for their lives. Another point in the film shows a French soldier bursting into an apartment to search it and accidentally stepping on a crying baby! There is no doubt that this is one of the most important films ever made not just because of the subject matter but in the skill that Pontecorvo applies to achieve his vision. In 1965 this may not have been perceived as a truly great film but now 40 years later it's looked at as one of the most important films ever made and one that is studied by military personnel and those in the Pentagon.,this film attains level importance that has never been achieved before,we all go movies because we love be entertained its hard argue that its greatest form entertainment but when serious viewers talk about film terms being important you would have expect this title be instantly brought up this film covers years 1954 1962 algeria when arab section algiers started uprising fight french gain their own independence ali la pointe brahim haggiag is petty thief hustler when he gets out jail he teams up with el hadi jaffar saadi yacef together they form algerian national liberation front fln which they start terrorist attacks spoiler alert french authorities bring col mathieu jean martin head anti terrorist unit he uses methods torture slowly eliminate insurrectionists who hide behind walls apartments casbah eventually col mathieu kills ali it seems that everything will go back what they were but two years later arabs take streets huge numbers which causes u n take notice 1962 algeria finally gained its independence this was made by italian filmmaker gillo pontecorvo who shot this actual locations algeria used mainly non actors his cast martin is only professional story is based book by yacef who not only is survivor these true events but is cast important role pontecorvo has created film that seems so real that he had have disclaimer put into credits stating that no newsreel or documentary footage was used which is incredible because there are so many scenes which it appears that real events were caught film script does its best show both positive negative both sides french fln but it does seem that pontecorvo leans towards side arabs this all takes place time when most american viewers were not aware what terrorism was about 1965 it was probably easy just point at french think they should just get out but now our day age audiences are little more sophisticated world its politics there are scenes that take place that we will probably never see done again because lack safety especially shots bombs exploding so called actors scrambling their lives another point film shows french soldier bursting into apartment search it accidentally stepping crying baby there is no doubt that this is one most important films ever made not just because subject matter but skill that pontecorvo applies achieve his vision 1965 this may not have been perceived as truly great film but now 40 years later its looked at as one most important films ever made one that is studied by military personnel those pentagon,0.4859702797202798,0.17255973193473195,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,"as fitting a tip-of-the-hat to Rossellini's post-WW2 work made in the 60's, and them some","A couple of times here and there watching Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, winner of the 1966 Golden Lion at Venice, I thought off-handedly (maybe with a smidgen of sarcasm), 'this is probably one of the top 5 favorite films of like Rage Against the Machine or something'. It's not without saying though that once the film was over, and watching a bit more on the extra features on the DVD (with other directors shining light on their opinions on the film), that most of what I saw sunk in a little deeper. This is one of the best kinds of documentary-style dramas made in its time and place in the world, and goes a bit further in the right direction from Roberto Rossellini's post-war trilogy. While it's not unlikely to see Pontecorvo's own influence from the neorealist maverick, it's also likely to see how Pontecorvo takes this very emotionally charged, as-factual-as-possible story of Algiers versus France in the mid 1950s with an assured balance of pathos and style. It also works tremendously as a kind of 'statement' movie, without at all pushing it down the viewer's throats. It does have a viewpoint, as do most films, and here and there it definitely does drive home the point of the Algiers' need for freedom from the militant oppression of France.But what struck me most about how Pontecorvo and his collaborators (both screenwriter and producer as the latter of which had complete first hand contact with the events and plays an acting part), is how he approached violence and its effect on an urban climate. Through Pontecorvo's camera, we see the ugly side to both sides, even the one that we should be rooting for. France is the (supposedly unintentional) oppressor here, and in this time frame had made them a colonial power for decades, and in order to sustain order and track down their 'targets' in 1957 they go from complete militarization (shown quite starkly and simply, and like a good would-be neorealist 'as it is if we are right there') to torture tactics. Their acts of violence and brutality are however given the other side of the coin in the scenes where the lieutenant Colonel of the French troops Matthieu (played by the great Jean Martin) talks to the press or lays out his point of view in scenes. Then the other side of the Algiers, those who are fighting back early on in the film with guerrilla-like terrorist tactics go to lengths to make their messages clear through seemingly random but daunting acts of violence. Pontecorvo's point in showing both sides is almost complex while seeming simple- neither side is right when it comes to committing violence against one another in this situation. It's a very powerful statement made that doesn't cut corners, of the truth that still permeates of a first-world power, already very adept in their military powers from past (proud) military conflicts who can't seem to let up from giving the people they say they want to help and provide some leeway in establishing their own government and freedom despite the fervent opposition. Sound familiar?At any rate, the real success behind this message- which could've been done on the flip-side with a lot of pumped melodrama- is by making it a kind of hybrid of doc and fiction. Unlike Memories of Underdevelopment, which would come out 2 years after this in Cuba, it's never exactly certain when the footage is even dramatized or not. And there are two aspects to what Pontecorvo covers in his purely cinematic style that totally serves his content. One is how he deals with crowds, with the dirty city life of the Arab section of Algiers where all the madness, chaos, and just frustration takes place, in range from the scenes of people walking by in burkas to reveal themselves as the ""enemy"" with guns, to those startling sequences of the revolutions and multi-militant post. The other one is how Pontecorvo deals with his 'subjects', as one might call them, as they are all save for one non-actors. Like directors before him (mentioned above) and after (like Fernando Meirelles) the filmmaker here is after the right look on people, and in going almost as a bystander at times getting these people. The guy playing La Pointe- the center of the film (an illiterate petty criminal turned major terrorist)- isn't particularly 'good', but he doesn't need to be. His face tells all. In maybe my favorite scene in the film, when a female from the Algiers section sneaks into a quasi-dance hall in the European section, we get various shots of the faces of the patrons as well as her own. None are professional, which obviously adds to the complexities of this scene. Who's innocent and who's guilty in this world? Sometimes there are some very brutal moments in the film, and then there are others that sometimes even work just as a usual, well, thriller. Here and there I almost felt like I was watching a more recent film without taking into account how it might have influenced a few directors over time. With one of his best early scores via Ennio Morricone, and some uncompromising details with the multiple deaths in the film, The Battle of Algiers does come quite close to being one of those 'essential' films of the 1960's, where a political attitude or need to put onto film a time and place in the world was captured. And if it has at least a little relevance for some military-style situations of the now (and I am not at all anti-US, but the comparisons could be made with bits in the film) its a credit to the filmmakers that its basically the film they wanted to make, with a freedom relatable to the doomed characters on the side of Algiers.",as fitting tip hat rossellinis post ww2 work made 60s them

8.0,France's illusion,"Told in a brutally realistic style The Battle For Algeria is the ultimate in docudrama. Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo made this film with a bit of distance between the French-Algerian War post World War II. Pontecorvo skillfully uses documentary footage to blend in nicely with the story he shot. You think you are getting an inside look at the war.Looking back this seems so ludicrous. Post the Napoleonic age France's colonial expansion took her to North Africa just across the Mediterranean and between Morocco, Tunisia, and the countries carved out of French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa she had one large chunk of the continent. By degree and somewhat hurried by the end of World War II. Except for Algeria and particularly Algiers it's capital city on the coast. For some inexplicable reason the French took a proprietary interest in the place and would not let it go.No hearts and minds were won by the French among the Moslem population. Especially after use of torture. Why they just didn't let them go with the rest is beyond me.The Algerian story is told from the point of view of freedom figter Braham Hadjaji. The French point of view is covered from high ranking officer Jean Martin. Martin's attitudes are frightening as his sense of propriety concerning Algiers.This is one great film with a lot of lessons to be learned about neo-colonialism.",frances illusion,told brutally realistic style battle algeria is ultimate docudrama italian director gillo pontecorvo made this film with bit distance between french algerian war post world war ii pontecorvo skillfully uses documentary footage blend nicely with story he shot you think you are getting inside look at war looking back this seems so ludicrous post napoleonic age frances colonial expansion took her north africa just across mediterranean between morocco tunisia countries carved out french equatorial africa french west africa she had one large chunk continent by degree somewhat hurried by end world war ii except algeria particularly algiers its capital city coast some inexplicable reason french took proprietary interest place would not let it go no hearts minds were won by french among moslem population especially after use torture why they just didnt let them go with rest is beyond me algerian story is told point view freedom figter braham hadjaji french point view is covered high ranking officer jean martin martins attitudes are frightening as his sense propriety concerning algiers this is one great film with lot lessons be learned about neo colonialism,0.38343358395989974,0.053032581453634084,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,learn from the history it conveys,"If one has not seen this film, one cannot begin to imagine Pontecorvo's extraordinary achievement. The acting is so natural and convincing that many viewers and even some critics assumed that the movie was a documentary. Only a master director could have taken this raw acting material and gotten such performances out of it. And despite his leftist viewpoint, Pontecorvo neither ridicules or demonizes the French, as does Michael Moore the Americans in his recent putative documentaries Bowling at Columbine and Farenheit 9-11 - though I do a disservice to Pontecorvo to compare his work to that of Moore.See this movie now that it has been released on DVD in the United States and learn from the history it so brilliantly conveys.",learn history it conveys,if one has not seen this film one cannot begin imagine pontecorvos extraordinary achievement acting is so natural convincing that many viewers even some critics assumed that movie was documentary only master director could have taken this raw acting material gotten such performances out it despite his leftist viewpoint pontecorvo neither ridicules or demonizes french as does michael moore americans his recent putative documentaries bowling at columbine farenheit 9 11 though i do disservice pontecorvo compare his work that moore see this movie now that it has been released dvd united states learn history it so brilliantly conveys,0.4741025641025641,0.1323931623931624,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Blueprint For the United States Future?,"Usually, films in foreign language with sub-titles are not something I'd watch. I am sure glad I watched this one. The film is based upon a true story.The story is of the French trying to hold on to their colony in Algeria in the late 1950's & early 1960's. The French keep trying the entire film to stomp out resistance in Algeria. It had been their colony for 130 years.Once the seed of independence is planted, no matter what the French do, their cost in troops & civilian deaths & destruction keep getting higher & higher. Considering the French have already paid a heavy price in Vietnam during this same period of history, you can understand in the end why they lost this one later. The French finally consider the cost of fighting this Algerian Independence movement too high. The scenes of torture in the film are so realistic & the scenes of violence & riots in the streets are so real, that you think the film makers were using real news reel footage in this film. It is amazingly, all staged.A lot of the parallel issues are here with our current dilemmas with Iraq, Afghanistan, & Kosovo. We are considering that these costs are too high to bear in our media. The mistake here is that the reasons are different. It is our medias hate of the current President that is fueling this hate. We are not attempting to make colonies here like the French were in Algiers. Still, this film does bring us into some interesting parallel issues.

9.0,An Astonishing and Authentic Examination of Terrorism,"Wow, ""The Battle of Algiers"" really could have been made today, couldn't it? I don't know if I should be comforted or disturbed that the events depicted in Gillo Pontecorvo's film so closely mirror those going on in the Middle East right now. On the one hand, it's comforting to realize that events and tensions that seem scary in the present day have been going on virtually forever, and that every generation has probably thought at some point that the world they lived in represented the human race at its lowest point. But on the other hand, it's disturbing to think that the same patterns have been repeating themselves for ages and we as a race just keep making the same blunders over and over again.""The Battle of Algiers"" chronicles in near documentary fashion the struggle of the Algerian Muslims against the imperialist French rule in the 1950s. Overwhelmed by the might and resources of the French military, a rebel group of Algerians resort to terrorist tactics to make themselves heard. Stuck in the middle are the everyday Algerian and French citizens, who die in bombings and attacks perpetrated by both sides, and are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working in their best interests.There's a scene mid-way through the film in which a French military commander lectures a gathering on the personalities and philosophies of terrorist cells. He explains the terrorist cell structure, and how the best way to kill the cell is to cut off its head. Sound familiar? Pontecorvo's film is engrossing, and one that will always (sadly) be relevant. His sympathies obviously reside with the Algerians -- the film ends with images of an Algerian uprising that occurred two years after the main events depicted in the movie, with Algerian people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and shouting cries of ""freedom,"" ""liberty"" and such. But we do see the human cost and dubious morality of terrorist warfare, and the film fairly showcases the brutality inflicted by both groups.""The Battle of Algiers"" has an astounding authentic quality to it that makes it almost impossible to believe that this is a fictional film and not a documentary.Grade: A",astonishing authentic examination terrorism,wow battle algiers really could have been made today couldnt it i dont know if i should be comforted or disturbed that events depicted gillo pontecorvos film so closely mirror those going middle east right now one hand its comforting realize that events tensions that seem scary present day have been going virtually forever that every generation has probably thought at some point that world they lived represented human race at its lowest point but other hand its disturbing think that same patterns have been repeating themselves ages we as race just keep making same blunders over over again battle algiers chronicles near documentary fashion struggle algerian muslims against imperialist french rule 1950s overwhelmed by might resources french military rebel group algerians resort terrorist tactics make themselves heard stuck middle are everyday algerian french citizens who die bombings attacks perpetrated by both sides are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working their best interests theres scene mid way through film which french military commander lectures gathering personalities philosophies terrorist cells he explains terrorist cell structure how best way kill cell is cut off its head sound familiar pontecorvos film is engrossing one that will always sadly be relevant his sympathies obviously reside with algerians film ends with images algerian uprising that occurred two years after main events depicted movie with algerian people celebrating streets waving flags shouting cries freedom liberty such but we do see human cost dubious morality terrorist warfare film fairly showcases brutality inflicted by both groups battle algiers has astounding authentic quality it that makes it almost impossible believe that this is fictional film not documentary grade,0.38400116144018576,0.12526132404181184,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"
