10.0,Forget Disney! We have movies like Your Name.,"Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!",forget disney we have movies like your name,your name is just good movie this movie felt long but not too long all way through i was asking what would happen next it was clever emotional left me crying after movie twist was done really well i almost wanted pause movie also animation is gorgeous you get see detailed images many angles perspectives there were hundreds animators credits didnt start out with cast like it usually would first thing you saw after black screen was hundreds names animators designers i watched this movie again i still felt my muscles ready let tears out i would not recommend this movie any less than next guy so what are you waiting get couple friends watch your name,0.41203703703703703,0.12407407407407407,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,could be the greatest love story of all time,"In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most basic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to do right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other. I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form.",could be greatest love story all time,truth most competitive area fiction is not invasions outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather most basic narrative all love story this is also most overcrowded field most difficult do right this film this story is extraordinary it reminds me my sassy girl love story asia that captured imagination world has almost become franchise its been copied so many times it also brings mind richard mathesons classic bid time return another love story ages that uses time juxtaposition done as movie somewhere time 1980 i already gave this highest rating imdb animation is stunning complimentary this one kind tale all things considered i would like avoid ongoing arguments about which japanese animation studio is better or worse than other i prefer simply be grateful that japanese anime exists at all because i cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving this powerful graphic form,0.5619472789115646,0.23818027210884352,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,"Once seen, never forgotten- truly magnificent","'Your Name' is not just one of the best animes in recent years (and there have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes ever from personal opinion.Will go even further, saying it's one of the best animated films in recent years, one of the best animated or otherwise films of the year and that it rivals the masterworks of Miyazaki. This is a huge compliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a bold claim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's' stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but never forgotten.The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully and intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own, serving superbly as music on its own.Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to say and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never lets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investing in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is deliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second half.Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written and developed, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters with no qualms.In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered for years to come. Deserves all the raves it's gotten, and deserving of even more. 10/10 Bethany Cox",once seen never forgotten truly magnificent,your name is not just one best animes recent years there have been some very good ones but one best animes ever personal opinion will go even further saying its one best animated films recent years one best animated or otherwise films year that it rivals masterworks miyazaki this is huge compliment any anime animated film or even any film bold claim that still stands much it is do with how your names stayed with me impact its had film once seen but never forgotten animation your name is stunning so beautifully intricately drawn with immaculate attention detail backgrounds simply breath taking array ethereal but also atmospheric colours music fits films atmosphere with no problem at all also works wonders as soundtrack its own serving superbly as music its own meanwhile script is thought provoking touching with much say explored expertly neatly with no heavy handedness storytelling engages throughout sucks one into its world never lets go immersing is enormously heartfelt really investing characters chemistry their love each other pacing is deliberate but never drags due emotional impact how well realised characters are even when noticeably slower second half characters films themes are brilliantly written developed voice acting is emotive fit characters with no qualms summary truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered years come deserves all raves its gotten deserving even more 10 10 bethany cox,0.5167619047619048,0.3619166666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,One of the greatest human stories ever...,"From an anime nonetheless.Much has been said about this great animation and most of it is true.

10.0,"Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful.","It's been a while since I've seen something outside of Studio Ghibli, being the most recent When Marnie Was There. I'm not familiar with Makoto Shinkai's work but this certainly encourages me to watch the rest of his catalog. I knew nothing about the film until only the day before seeing it, instantly attracted to the poster and the mini synopsis of two high school teens from opposite sides of the country, who periodically switch in their dreams. Gladly I didn't read anymore into it and just went to watch it as there's so much more to the intriguing story at face value. It's a little confusing at times bouncing between the two characters, but that doesn't deter the enjoyment and wonderment of the film. We follow quiet country school girl Mitsuha voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, going about her daily chores and traditions in a village shrouded by folklore and superstition with mayor-elect pushing for advancement. All this while we also follow rough-and-ready city boy, Taki, voiced by Ryûnosuke Kamiki, who is no stranger to voice acting, starring in Spirited Away at the age of eight and later in Howl's Moving Castle. The two become celestially bound to one another without fully understanding how, or even knowing who each other are, which leads them both on an adventure of discovery, comical annoyance and eventual romance. It's perfectly balanced between the two even with a number of interesting side characters, each adding something to the intricacies of the plot and supplying a lot of the light-hearted comedy. The scenery and animation is stunning, vibrant and beautifully breathtaking; with blinding lens flares and gorgeous landscapes that fill the entirely screen. It's superbly paced, perfectly edited so not to make a mess of the constant jumps. The score by the Japanese rock band, Radwimps is simply amazing, perfect for the film with a mixture of teeny pop/rock and pleasant instrumentals, with surprising tracks like ""Kataware Doki"" using soft pianos and strings. It's a score Final Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu would be proud of. There are some films that are not meant to be for live action, showcasing the stunning craftsmanship and elegant talent of the skilled animators and artists, this being one of those films. The actual anime capturing the magical essence of the heartfelt story that I don't believe can be replicated as good live. Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful. Certainly the best anime I've seen this year.

9.0,You wonder HOW the Academy didn't nominate this lovely picture...,"A few months ago when they announced the Oscar nominations for 2017, I was very surprised to see the French film, ""The Red Turtle"", among the nominees for Best Animated Feature. After all, this strange film featured a plot involving a man who falls in love with a woman who used to be a turtle.and has also earned less than a million dollars at the box office worldwide. At the same time, the Japanese animated film, ""Your Name."", earned over $350,000,000setting box office records throughout Asia for a Japanese animated movie. It has even earned more than any of the films from the terrific Studio Ghibli.home of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki!Fortunately, ""Your Name."" is now playing in select markets throughout the United States and I was in Philadelphia this week.where I jumped at a chance to finally see this record-breaking yet inexplicably snubbed movie. If it's playing near you, I suggest you consider also seeing this lovely and rather adult picture. Now when I say 'rather adult', I do not mean it has any objectionable content. However, parents should understand that just because it is a cartoon does not mean that younger children should see it. They simply could not be expected to follow the plot, as the film is complex and clearly designed for teens and adults.As to the story, for some time it's a tad confusing.and that's okay as it will eventually all come together. It seems that Mitsuha and Taki are somehow psychically linked. When Taki goes to sleep, he finds himself as Mitsuha.which is a bit embarrassing for him since he is a teenage guy and Mitsuha is a teenage girl! But why.why is he experiencing Mitsuha's life? And, the strange part is that he soon learns that what he's experiencing happened several years ago!! And what does a comet have to do with this as well? How can Taki's strange dreams possibly save Mitusha and her small village? I'd say more, but don't want to reveal too much about the story.The quality of this film is very, very nice. I would not say that the animation is quite as good as a typical Ghibli picture, but it is close. But what makes this a delightful film are that it never tries to be cute or formulaic.it's a wholly unique viewing experience. It also is very well written and kept my interesteven though I was suffering jetlag!

9.0,"What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.","Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word ""city"" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied.

10.0,Phenomenal,"Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It's a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years. Director Makoto Shinkai's artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were never ""just eye candy"". They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you're not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there's an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There's a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I'm pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me. Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters' relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking. Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There's rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It's so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed, I feel like I didn't even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece. I know I sound like I'm fanboying, but as a film student and anime fan for many years, I'm being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it. 10/10",phenomenal,kimi no nawa is up there with quality work studio ghibli makes its journey world breathing with atmosphere mystery visual wonder journey about growth resilience face overwhelming odds journey about human emotion that transcends space time as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate journey that might just be one most captivating anime movie experiences ive had years director makoto shinkais artistry is something people tend love or hate but this film is solid proof all his disdainful critics that his movies were never just eye candy they explore nature life relationships quiet ways rarely seen or discussed which is why most them are not fast paced or action packed why they are so beautiful but even if youre not fan this kind style with its major use metaphorical imagery mixture subtle explosive emotions definitely give kimi no nawa chance this is by far his most ambitious original movie many ways instance theres actual mystical element story apart his previous films that are set purely realism pacing is lot faster intense theres surprising amount humor script making chemistry between characters more light hearted comically entertaining than expected all this is done through narrative vision so emotional so brilliantly realized that im pretty sure everyone at anime expo world premiere screening was tearing up including me without spoiling what mainly drives this films story is dynamics our main characters relationship way these two interact is just so unique lovable premise itself allows them bond more personal level far more intriguing than usual teenage love story where boy meets girl boy likes girl boy gets girl eventually you become so invested their strange relationship that when all action goes down its no longer just suspenseful its almost heartbreaking editing sound design play huge role this immersion theres rarely single dull moment because how gripping emotionally driven timing every cut is sound design combined with beautiful music score is outstanding subtle moving when creating atmosphere powerful at times dramatic conflict fact same can be said pretty much all visual aesthetics which if i havent already mentioned are amazing this is prime example astonishingly jaw dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling kimi no nawa is not just any anime movie it has potential be viewed studied as art cinema its so beautifully crafted meticulously detailed i feel like i didnt even cover 80 its greatness this review do that i would have make spoiler analysis review do that i would probably have see movie again maybe couple more times before i can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece i know i sound like im fanboying but as film student anime fan many years im being fully honest here if director makoto shinkai keeps this kind quality up he is going be even bigger name anime industry years come remember your name long enough until its available your country if youre not seeing it japan theaters because trust me youre not going forget it 10 10,0.5884736064968622,0.24796280915466962,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Your Name,"This delightful Japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives; Mitsuha, a high school girl living in a rural area of Japan, and Taki, a similarly aged boy in Tokyo. They have never met but they somehow start switching places in their dreams. At first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but the following day as the 'dream' fades they are surprised when friends and family tell them that they had been behaving oddly the day before; not recognising anybody and not knowing where they are meant to be then each finds a note from the other. They continue to swap days until suddenly it stops Taki can't recall many details but he has a memory of the place Mitsuha lived and is drawn to find her. Armed with a sketch of the location he finds the village and learns a shocking truth it had been destroyed in a natural disaster three years previously and Mitsuha was amongst the five hundred people who died! He is determined to find a way to swap places again so he can save her.Anybody who has seen previous films from director Makoto Shinkai will immediately recognise the beautiful style of the artwork, with incredibly detailed backgrounds. Of course a good film must do more than 'look good' and this succeeds there too; the first half is a fun introduction to the characters and their situation. This is done with plenty of humour; the fact that they find themselves in bodies of the opposite gender is quickly handled in an amusing but not a crude manner. There are lots of delightful details such as while swapped they talk in different dialects and Taki talks like a girl of course this is better appreciated if you speak Japanese but is explained so non-Japanese speakers (like me) can realise that it is happening. The events that take place half way through the film come as quite a surprise and suddenly change to tone of the film. As Taki tries to find a way to save Mitsuha and her village it is far from obvious that he will be successful. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of good animation; the content isn't really unsuitably for younger viewers but it would probably be a bit confusing.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles; an English dub is also available on the DVD I bought.",your name,this delightful japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives mitsuha high school girl living rural area japan taki similarly aged boy tokyo they have never met but they somehow start switching places their dreams at first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but following day as dream fades they are surprised when friends family tell them that they had been behaving oddly day before not recognising anybody not knowing where they are meant be then each finds note other they continue swap days until suddenly it stops taki cant recall many details but he has memory place mitsuha lived is drawn find her armed with sketch location he finds village learns shocking truth it had been destroyed natural disaster three years previously mitsuha was amongst five hundred people who died he is determined find way swap places again so he can save her anybody who has seen previous films director makoto shinkai will immediately recognise beautiful style artwork with incredibly detailed backgrounds course good film must do more than look good this succeeds there too first half is fun introduction characters their situation this is done with plenty humour fact that they find themselves bodies opposite gender is quickly handled amusing but not crude manner there are lots delightful details such as while swapped they talk different dialects taki talks like girl course this is better appreciated if you speak japanese but is explained so non japanese speakers like me can realise that it is happening events that take place half way through film come as quite surprise suddenly change tone film as taki tries find way save mitsuha her village it is far obvious that he will be successful overall id certainly recommend this older fans good animation content isnt really unsuitably younger viewers but it would probably be bit confusing these comments are based watching film japanese with english subtitles english dub is also available dvd i bought,0.4077933673469388,0.17290391156462578,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,One of the Greatest movies i watched in my entire life.,"I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them really have a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He really know how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans who have followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during the entire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto's older works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki's spirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better than spirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his own stunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard? Even Spirited Away, When Marnie was There, and 5cm per second can't do that.

I tend to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the same time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible. Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going.
