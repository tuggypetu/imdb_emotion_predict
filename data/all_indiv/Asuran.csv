7,A Revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination and higher class oppression.,"Asuran (2019) : Brief Review -A Revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination and higher class oppression. Tamil Movie Asuran has 2 strong sides that can be the 2 big reasons to recommend this film. First, it's a revenge drama filled action which is sure shot safe bet for Masses and second it has explored some serious issues like Discrimination and honour killing for Classes. The film raises a voice against the traditional higher class oppression loudly and also makes it little emotional with the addition of family values. Although, it does not favour too much realism or quality filmmaking, the overall gesture is still at par. An action flick in Tamil Cinema is mostly about entertainment and mainstream masala but Asuran tried to do a little different from mainstream masala just to see whether or not this is the time for Films and audience to move on. Luckily, the film proves it's point that yes, audience is ready to accept such film which can spread awareness and also give pleasure of watching an Action flick at the same time. The high ratings by IMDb users and Public reactions are overwhelming, i didn't agree fully though. Yes i agree that Asuran is a Very Good Movie and one those of those rare actions films having hearth and brain at right place but somehow this is not Outstanding or Extraordinary. Maybe Tamil audience feel it new hence they were overwhelmed but for rest of the audience across the nation and the globe have been through with such films long ago (and i fall in this category). Dhanush, Manju and Ken Karunas are three names to be remembered for acting in this film, rest are okay-okay. Cinematography is bit dragged in action sequences otherwise no complaints. Vetrimaaran's attempt to do an action film with Social message is undoubtedly successful. Overall, A Nice and Definitely watchable film but not anywhere close to Classic tag.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination higher class oppression,asuran 2019 brief review revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination higher class oppression tamil movie asuran has 2 strong sides that can be 2 big reasons recommend this film first its revenge drama filled action which is sure shot safe bet masses second it has explored some serious issues like discrimination honour killing classes film raises voice against traditional higher class oppression loudly also makes it little emotional with addition family values although it does not favour too much realism or quality filmmaking overall gesture is still at par action flick tamil cinema is mostly about entertainment mainstream masala but asuran tried do little different mainstream masala just see whether or not this is time films audience move luckily film proves its point that yes audience is ready accept such film which can spread awareness also give pleasure watching action flick at same time high ratings by imdb users public reactions are overwhelming i didnt agree fully though yes i agree that asuran is very good movie one those those rare actions films having hearth brain at right place but somehow this is not outstanding or extraordinary maybe tamil audience feel it new hence they were overwhelmed but rest audience across nation globe have been through with such films long ago i fall this category dhanush manju ken karunas are three names be remembered acting this film rest are okay okay cinematography is bit dragged action sequences otherwise no complaints vetrimaarans attempt do action film with social message is undoubtedly successful overall nice definitely watchable film but not anywhere close classic tag rating 7 10 by,0.4663481568936113,0.1842499016135379,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.5}"

7,When violence hits too close to home! [+73%],"What we see at the beginning of Asuran is a father-son duo trying to flee from something/someone - we are not told why or what happened beforehand. Borrowing cues from Vetrimaaran's own Vada Chennai which had a somewhat similar opening sequence (albeit with a twist and a different backdrop), both films feel like two pieces of the same meat, cooked and conditioned differently.Power (in its simplest terms) in many of Vetrimaaran's films amount to possession of property and position in the political or caste hierarchy. It's pretty much the same in Asuran as well. The insatiable greed of upper-caste, land-grabbing rich men is the root cause of issues between Vadakkooran (Aadukalam Naren) and Sivasamy (Dhanush) that eventually spiral out of control. As was the case in Vada Chennai, lives are lost on both sides and it's time for redemption.DOP Velraj paints Asuran in various shades of brown and red, the two colours that define the flick in multiple ways. Red denotes spilt blood while brown denotes land. The film is a blood-soaked revenge saga - only this time, the violence strikes too close to home, and the man of the house (who's a pacifist) undergoes a massy, intense transformation. The pre-interval block conveys this quite well. It's an action set-piece that looks more refined than raw (Peter Hein handles the fight choreography, that speaks for itself) for a Vetrimaaran movie. It almost felt like Vetrimaaran built scenes up in his own signature style until then and then sat back and exclaimed: ""Well, here's a set-piece for the fans/masses"".Manju Warrier, who plays Pachaiyammal, is terrific in the screentime allotted to her. She can brandish a sickle the right way or the 'right-er' way when goaded. How she holds her own against a bunch of ruffians in a scene early on in the film, is a riot. Dhanush is superb whenever he's playing the senior (more restrained) version of Sivasamy. In the second half, his violent massiness is explained in a pretty lengthy flashback which also involves casteism and power conflicts. While effective, it's a far cry from the 'Rajan' flashback of Vada Chennai. Teejay Arunaasalam and Ken Karunas, as the children of Sivasamy, lend convincing performances. However, the need for voiceovers elucidating proceedings, at times, felt like a dampener.GVP's massy score for the fights is a total banger. He makes sure that viewers do not miss SaNa's compositions. Asuran is sprinkled with political undercurrents that many a commercial film (and filmmaker) usually tries to avoid. It's about redemption for the oppressed. For that reason alone, the film is worth a watch. Also, it ends with an Ambedkar-like statement - how education can be the biggest difference-maker! It may not be Dhanush-Vetri's absolute best effort, yet one of the best Tamil cinema likely has to offer this year.",when violence hits too close home,what we see at beginning asuran is father son duo trying flee something someone we are not told why or what happened beforehand borrowing cues vetrimaarans own vada chennai which had somewhat similar opening sequence albeit with twist different backdrop both films feel like two pieces same meat cooked conditioned differently power its simplest terms many vetrimaarans films amount possession property position political or caste hierarchy its pretty much same asuran as well insatiable greed upper caste land grabbing rich men is root cause issues between vadakkooran aadukalam naren sivasamy dhanush that eventually spiral out control as was case vada chennai lives are lost both sides its time redemption dop velraj paints asuran various shades brown red two colours that define flick multiple ways red denotes spilt blood while brown denotes land film is blood soaked revenge saga only this time violence strikes too close home man house whos pacifist undergoes massy intense transformation pre interval block conveys this quite well its action set piece that looks more refined than raw peter hein handles fight choreography that speaks itself vetrimaaran movie it almost felt like vetrimaaran built scenes up his own signature style until then then sat back exclaimed well heres set piece fans masses manju warrier who plays pachaiyammal is terrific screentime allotted her she can brandish sickle right way or right er way when goaded how she holds her own against bunch ruffians scene early film is riot dhanush is superb whenever hes playing senior more restrained version sivasamy second half his violent massiness is explained pretty lengthy flashback which also involves casteism power conflicts while effective its far cry rajan flashback vada chennai teejay arunaasalam ken karunas as children sivasamy lend convincing performances however need voiceovers elucidating proceedings at times felt like dampener gvps massy score fights is total banger he makes sure that viewers do not miss sanas compositions asuran is sprinkled with political undercurrents that many commercial film filmmaker usually tries avoid its about redemption oppressed that reason alone film is worth watch also it ends with ambedkar like statement how education can be biggest difference maker it may not be dhanush vetris absolute best effort yet one best tamil cinema likely has offer this year,0.528479204011119,0.2031700568934611,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10,Everything about this film is Amazing!,"At first I was a bit sceptical about this film as the last Tamil film that I had watched trusting the reviews was 'Pariyerum Perumal' and was extremely disappointed with it. I haven't watched many Tamil films, since I'm more into Malayalam films and love their style of film making. Having watched PP and seeing the high praises I felt that if this film that is being hailed as a 'masterpiece' and all sorts of bogus remarks, I did not have many expectations from Asuran, which also had high ratings. The only Tamil film that I watched apart from the usual Rajnikanth, Ravi Teja, Ram Charan masala films was Mandela. A film that I happened to like very much.Anyway coming to this film, I was completely amazed at how well made it is. This film has it all. A riveting story, beautifully drawn out character arcs, a really immersive screenplay, fantastic and realistic acting to mindblowing action sequences. The action of this film is soooooo good and so masterfully choreographed that I watched the entire film more than once. The plot is realistic, didn't find any plotholes as such. Something that I appreciate very much as they make a film hard to be taken seriously and make you feel stupid. Very realistic is there tone to this film and tackles some jarring issues faced in rural parts of the country.There's not a single thing to dislike about this film.
