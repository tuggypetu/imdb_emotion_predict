,"Wow, this brings back memories. Too bad nostalgia doesn't defend the realization of awfulness. What a stinker.","When I was a child I watched some very bad movies; some were so bad, they made Cool as Ice look like the original Rebel Without a Cause. I'm talking about grade-A quality garbage, here.Mac and Me was a film I frequently watched  an embarrassing, agonizing, shameless marketing scheme fueled by McDonalds featuring a plot ripped off of E.T. And I ate it all up  I used to love this movie.Watching it now is like a slap in the face. Wow, it's that bad. When I was younger I didn't notice the numerous references to Mickey D's and Coca-Cola  I just marveled at the sight of strange alien beings whistling to music that played only in my head. I considered Mac and Me to be the pinnacle of film-making. Or perhaps I'm discrediting myself  I wasn't that stupid, but I was naïve enough to believe, at least, that it was a fun movie, and unlike anything I had ever seen before.Well, at least one opinion remains -- it is unlike anything I've ever seen before  a rip-off so bad beyond words that it's almost as unbelievably awful as another shameless E.T. knock-off, Pod People, my choice for the worst film of all-time  and another 'so-bad-it's-good' gem that is actually so bad it becomes good, then bad again, where it continues in this cycle until it becomes downright petrifying.The film's protagonist is wheelchair-bound Michael (Jonathan Ward), an adolescent who moves to a new city and finds himself meeting up with a strange puppet  err, alien  named 'Mac' (I guess?), who waddles around like E.T. and is searching for his parents, who were picked up by a NASA space probe and are now out in California doing who-knows-what. Apparently they're not too eager to find their son since they spend the duration of the movie crawling at a snail's pace under the glare of the sun, stopping every now and again to emit sounds similar to that of a drunken elephant, making patterns in the air with their extended index fingers (now, where have I seen that in an alien-oriented movie before?).I could write an entire book on the faults of Mac and Me. To fit them into a single article almost seems ridiculous.Primarily it's just plain dumb, although it is also a horrendous mess from a technical standpoint. Its plot resembles that of RoboCop3  sloppy and vague. Direction is equal to that of a standard TV commercial, only one of the more boring sorts. The acting also compares to a television commercial, only in ads the people aren't always expected to actually say anything other than stare at the camera and smile like they're enjoying whatever product is being pushed. Some of that applies to Mac and Me since it is such a commercial, buy-this-product-after-you're-done-watching-the-movie sort of experience  unfortunately there is the odd moment where the movie doesn't focus on its bizarre alien creatures or Coca-Cola or Ronald McDonald or brand wheelchairs or space exploration companies and demands its so-called 'actors' speak their lines. I'd rather be stuck having to watch fake prosthetic extra-terrestrials quack and make weird noises than suffer through one more 'actor's' attempt at bringing life to the project. My guess is most of the cast were hired from a nearby McDonald's restaurant  seeing how McDonald's funded, promoted, and endorsed this movie, as well as the fact that their company logo is shown from beginning to end. It's about one hundredth as fun as those BMW commercials with 'The Driver,' and one thousandth as subtle.The dialogue is classic stuff. Conversations usually consist of at least one marketing plug, sometimes more. Here's an example of some great screen writing:Michael: Gee Mac, I don't know where your parents are. It's tough being in a wheelchair. I'm still adapting to this new home. By the way, in case you didn't get it by now, I don't have any friends except you! Where are your parents, Mac?Mac: Blurp! Beep! Weeeooop!Michael: Oh darn.Annoying Brother Ripped Off of the Brother from E.T.: Gee, how the darn are we gonna get Mac to his parents?Michael: I don't know. Let's go discuss it over a two-dollar quarter pounder with cheese at McDonald's. First one there's a Coca-Cola! By the way I heard that McDonald's is the number-one food chain in America with over one million restaurants nationwide! That's a whole lotta greatness! Hey look, it's a Krispy Kreme truck  I wonder if the driver, Mr. Shack, is still selling radios.Granted, that conversation doesn't appear in the film  because it's too good. What I just wrote would qualify for a an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay after being compared to 'Mac and Me.'Then there's the most memorable and infamous scene, which is when Mac is left home alone during a school day, and 'accidentally' throws a huge orgy with all the eager NASA scientists. Wait a minute, wrong movie. The best (or worst) part of Mac and Me actually takes place at McDonald's (!). It begins as a birthday party, becomes a dance competition, and ends as a frantic showdown between Ronald McDonald and a bunch of football players (?!) and, of course, Mac, doing flips through the air dressed as some sort of animal (another '?!'). Don't ask, because I don't think there's an answer, other than this: $$$The movie is one huge conglomerate of '80s conglomerations, if that makes any sense. What a wonderful film! (Not.) If you can put up with the wooden acting, bizarre (often downright confusing) screenplay, annoying stereotypical characters, and merchandising plugsthen you really are a sad pathetic waste of space and are exactly the type of candidate they're looking for to pen 'Mac and Me II: The Quest for More Money.' (I had to fit a Mel Brooks reference in there somewhere. After all, he paid me to. And I think that's the entire approach to 'Mac and Me.')",wow this brings back memories too bad nostalgia doesnt defend realization awfulness what stinker,when i was child i watched some very bad

,"Oh my, my, my...","Okay, I'm going to assume the makers of this film knew they were making a cheap knock-off of the infinitely better E.T., and anyone who does not agree with me on this should have their brains examined. Look at the facts people! The plot is essentially the same: Weird looking alien gets separated from family and happens upon a family where the kids take him in. Then there's the fact that the dad in the family is gone (dead? divorcee? the movie never explains), and that the older brother is named MICHAEL! We get a cute little girl to play the Drew Barrymore character, there are government agents trying to find the alien, but in the end the finale is totally different (albeit ridiculous, but more on that later). But, to give the film credit, it is hilarious. I loved how the Mom assumed her handicapped, wheelchair-bound son Eric had somehow dragged plants into the house. And we can't forget the grossly obvious product placement (apparently the aliens drink Coke on their planet), the insanely ugly main character MAC (a name which is never actually used in the film I think), and a very 1980's dance contest in the middle of McDonald's. Getting back to the aliens: who the heck came up with their design? They are INSANELY unappealing and ugly. Granted, E.T. wasn't exactly beautiful, but he's Carmen Electra compared to the silly putty potato sack that is MAC. Oh, and I couldn't help but study the scene where the aliens first break out of the NASA satellite since it is so similar to the scene in Independece Day. Think about it: the government agents are peering through the glass window, trying to get a good look at what is making the scientists freak out through a haze of smoke, when the alien jumps out at them. It's weird, let me tell ya. And I swear, if I had heard Michael screech, ""They're not gonna hurt anyone!"" ONE MORE TIME...rrr. Just what made these aliens so innocent, anyway? Their electrical powers destory everything in their path, and they blow up a supermarket! Sure, they brought Eric back to life after they BLEW UP THE SUPERMARKET, but you would think someone else died in that explosion (which you really have to see to believe). Other great moments?* Three bad '80s tunes in the span of 15 minutes. * The fact that none of the scenes had anything to do with the rest of the film. For example: MAC somehow hijacks a toy truck and gets chased by dogs. Another example: The hilarious scene where Eric's wheelchair goes out of control and flies down a ravine (!!!!!), leading his Mom to think he's suicidal (actual dialogue: Why would he do something like this???""). * Gigantic boom box and break dancers! YES! * The final scene, which defies comprehension.I can best compare this movie to Teen Witch, another ridiculous 80's family film. Although I would have to say that Mac and Me is the more insane feature. 4/4 for hilarity, 1/4 for quality.",oh my my my,okay im going assume makers this film knew they were making cheap knock off infinitely better e t anyone who does not agree with me this should have their brains examined look at facts people plot is essentially same weird looking alien gets separated family happens upon family where kids take him then theres fact that dad family is gone dead divorcee movie never explains that older brother is named michael we get cute little girl play drew barrymore character there are government agents trying find alien but end finale is totally different albeit ridiculous but more that later but give film credit it is hilarious i loved how mom assumed her handicapped wheelchair bound son eric had somehow dragged plants into house we cant forget grossly obvious product placement apparently aliens drink coke their planet insanely ugly main character mac name which is never actually used film i think very 1980s dance contest middle mcdonalds getting back aliens who heck came up with their design they are insanely unappealing ugly granted e t wasnt exactly beautiful but hes carmen electra compared silly putty potato sack that is mac oh i couldnt help but study scene where aliens first break out nasa satellite since it is so similar scene independece day think about it government agents are peering through glass window trying get good look at what is making scientists freak out through haze smoke when alien jumps out at them its weird let me tell ya i swear if i had heard michael screech theyre not gonna hurt anyone one more time rrr just what made these aliens so innocent anyway their electrical powers destory everything their path they blow up supermarket sure they brought eric back life after they blew up supermarket but you would think someone else died that explosion which you really have see believe other great moments three bad 80s tunes span 15 minutes fact that none scenes had anything do with rest film example mac somehow hijacks toy truck gets chased by dogs another example hilarious scene where erics wheelchair goes out control flies down ravine leading his mom think hes suicidal actual dialogue why would he do something like this gigantic boom box break dancers yes final scene which defies comprehension i can best compare this movie teen witch another ridiculous 80s family film although i would have say that mac me is more insane feature 4 4 hilarity 1 4 quality,0.5641067538126362,0.06663943355119824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,The Top Twenty-Four Ways Mac & Me is Cheesy,"1. The drinking game I played for every product placement I saw in Mac and Me was over within 20 minutes when I nearly died of alcohol poisoning.2. If the Special Olympics were as hilarious as when wheelchair-bound Eric rolled uncontrollably down a hill, off a cliff and into a body of water, I'd be someone's sponsor just so I can see it for myself in person.3. No, no, McDonald's. The line ""Why don't you stop by for a Big Mac?"" was completely subtle.4. As were: ""You know what I feel like?"" – ""A Big Mac?""5. Nice touch on the Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter overtones in the scoredespite being a kid's movie.6. Jennifer Anniston's acting debut was Mac and Me. Later, she starred in Marley & Me. Is Murdering Me coming soon?7. It shouldn't have taken two times for Mac to be sucked hard for us to get the hint the writers were trying to tell us something.8. I usually try to avoid spoiling movies, but E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. There you go.9. Mac gets stuck in a tree, dogs threaten to rip him apart and they cue the heart-felt music. I haven't laughed that hard since wheelchair-bound Eric plunged 50 feet into the water.10. Ironically, it does take a lot of coke to enjoy a feature like this.11. Code name: ""One Hundred X-Ray?"" Really?12. I waited the whole movie for the dance party inside and out of McDonald's and it was so worth it. Everyone was having a blast and I want my next birthday party there, too!13. Sometimes Mac can fly and sometimes he can control electrical objects, but when running from the suits, Mac chooses to ride on Eric's lap down another hill in his speeding wheelchair. ?? 14. Oh, and try not to be in tears from laughter after that chase scene's over.15. Skittles? Seriously? Stop.16. ""How long have you been in lingerie?"" might not be the best question to ask the most blatantly obvious sex offender working at Sears.17. There were more discounts in this movie than on McDonald's value menu. Like Discount Drew Barrymore, Discount Dee Wallace, Discount Henry Thomas.18. I'm probably taking the lines ""I sucked him upand then we blew him"" way out of context.19. Traveling billions of miles for a three-minute rock collecting experiment might sound like a waste of NASA's talent and money.20. And how they missed the straws the aliens used for mud slurping should get at least one of them fired.21. But, the genius of getting the spacecraft across the galaxy in less time than it takes the Enterprise, would probably get someone a raise.22. Maybe Joe Arpaio saw this movie and that's why he is the way he is.23. The end taught me three things: Ronald McDonald is a real person, aliens can reanimate life but not fix dead legs and the MacFamily will be back. Orso they promised before anyone actually saw this.24. The moral of the story is simple: You better be rooting for either the Chicago Bears (on WGN) or the Chicago Cubs while having a Coke. Only the weird neighbor roots for the Dodgers, but he probably eats at Burger King, anyways.",top twenty four ways mac me is cheesy,1 drinking game i played every product placement i saw mac me was over within 20 minutes when i nearly died alcohol poisoning 2 if special olympics were as hilarious as when wheelchair bound eric rolled uncontrollably down hill off cliff into body water id be someones sponsor just so i can see it myself person 3 no no mcdonalds line why dont you stop by big mac was completely subtle 4 as were you know what i feel like big mac 5 nice touch friday 13th final chapter overtones score despite being kids movie 6 jennifer annistons acting debut was mac me later she starred marley me is murdering me coming soon 7 it shouldnt have taken two times mac be sucked hard us get hint writers were trying tell us something 8 i usually try avoid spoiling movies but e t extra terrestrial there you go 9 mac gets stuck tree dogs threaten rip him apart they cue heart felt music i havent laughed that hard since wheelchair bound eric plunged 50 feet into water 10 ironically it does take lot coke enjoy feature like this 11 code name one hundred x ray really 12 i waited whole movie dance party inside out mcdonalds it was so worth it everyone was having blast i want my next birthday party there too 13 sometimes mac can fly sometimes he can control electrical objects but when running suits mac chooses ride erics lap down another hill his speeding wheelchair 14 oh try not be tears laughter after that chase scenes over 15 skittles seriously stop 16 how long have you been lingerie might not be best question ask most blatantly obvious sex offender working at sears 17 there were more discounts this movie than mcdonalds value menu like discount drew barrymore discount dee wallace discount henry thomas 18 im probably taking lines i sucked him up then we blew him way out context 19 traveling billions miles three minute rock collecting experiment might sound like waste nasas talent money 20 how they missed straws aliens used mud slurping should get at least one them fired 21 but genius getting spacecraft across galaxy less time than it takes enterprise would probably get someone raise 22 maybe joe arpaio saw this movie thats why he is way he is 23 end taught me three things ronald mcdonald is real person aliens can reanimate life but not fix dead legs macfamily will be back or so they promised before anyone actually saw this 24 moral story is simple you better be rooting either chicago bears wgn or chicago cubs while having coke only weird neighbor roots dodgers but he probably eats at burger king anyways,0.3962343802769335,0.07722053360351233,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.54}"
1.0,A hateful experience.,"This is without a doubt the single most atrociously insulting movie I can remember, and I mean that it insults the viewer in what amounts to an almost violently aggressive way. The fact that it rips-off ""E.T."" in almost every plot-point is bad enough; but did the filmmakers HAVE to turn the basic idea into a giant plug for a well-known burger franchise? Anyone who can't see the exploitation for what it is must be obtuse to the point of imbecility.The little alien is badly designed. It's incredibly ugly, and the only time when the aliens stand-out favorably is when they do their haunting whistling. Otherwise, forget it.The lead in this, Jade Calegory, deserves some praise. He never let his own real-life disability slow him down and he's actually a pretty accomplished actor. It's a shame that he had to be in this. If he ever had hopes of an acting career, it was effectively MURDERED by his appearance here. It had to be embarrassing for him, unless he's got thicker skin than I give him credit for.I do, however, have one wish: if anyone who is reading this can make it happen, PLEASE put this out on Region 1 DVD, at least!

10.0,A true cult classic,"You must see this movie immediately. It is so epically bad, that it's amazing. Every scene is just complete madness, it makes you think everyone involved in the movie must have been on hard drugs. The cliff scene, the McDonald's scene, and the 5 minute scene where Eric is jogging (well...) with his mom while a power ballad plays in the background. EVERY scene is a winner. After each scene, you can't wait to see what madness awaits in the next scene. You can't stop. You'll want to watch it again.

2.0,Why would I watch this? I am a glutton for punishment!,"""Mac and Me"" was one of the more infamous box office duds of its time. While this would dissuade normal folks from watching it, bad movie buffs like me naturally gravitate to it because it is such a legendary flop. The biggest reason it failed--the public quickly saw it for what it really was--a blatant rip-off of ""E.T."". And, this time even MORE corporate references are thrown in the viewer's face...with McDonald's and Coke references galore!! Instead of Reese's Pieces, they feed this god-awful corporate shill Skittles! And, to revive Mac's family who are on the edge of death, they feed them Coke!!!The film begins with an incredibly ugly family of aliens mysteriously getting sucked into a US space probe. They are then deposited on Earth and their baby, Mac, is lost and must find its way home. In the process it meets a nice disabled kid and makes his life complete. But, when it's no longer safe, he and Elliot, I mean Eric, go on a cross- country race to find his parents and get him home--and evade capture. And to do this, they dress him up in a Halloween-type costume! Need I continue?!So is the film any good? Well, if ""ET"" had never been made, sure it would have been reasonably entertaining to very young kids who didn't notice that the film was a giant commercial and who wouldn't notice the bad dialog and abounding clichés. But ""ET"" HAD BEEN ALREADY MADE several years earlier...so the film has zip when it comes to originality. You wonder how the folks associated with the film felt--they must have been really embarrassed at how blatant this was. And, at just about every turn it seems to do it worse than ""ET""...and often MUCH worse. It's a vacuous, soul-sucking corporate mess of a film in so many ways.When I saw this film tonight, it was decades after its original release and I was startled how ugly and expressionless Mac was. However, I had to remind myself that ET also looks pretty crappy when you see him today because we are used to much better special effects in 2015--though Mac is definitely crappier. The worst is when the dead, expressionless doll is riding on Eric's lap during the big chase! As for the outer space scene, however, I watched it on a very big screen TV and I was surprised because it looked so nice. This space scene along with actually hiring a disabled kid to play a disabled kid are about the only things that impressed me about the film. Otherwise, a pointless rip-off from start to finish---and not even bad enough to make bad movie buffs laugh. But enough overt corporate references to make this a GREAT film to use as a drinking game--taking a shot every time you saw these blatant ads! Believe me, you would get stinking drunk if you tried this!!By the way, the kid calls the hideous little alien 'Mac'--an acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature. In no way was this meant to be like 'ET' for the Extra-Terrestrial....yeah, right! Also, perhaps it's just me, but this might just be the most whitebread, corporate and uncool film ever made--especially during the god-awful McDonald's dance scene.",why would i watch this i am glutton punishment,mac me was one more infamous box office duds its time while this would dissuade normal folks watching it bad movie buffs like me naturally gravitate it because it is such legendary flop biggest reason it failed public quickly saw it what it really was blatant rip off e t this time even more corporate references are thrown viewers face with mcdonalds coke references galore instead reeses pieces they feed this god awful corporate shill skittles revive macs family who are edge death they feed them coke film begins with incredibly ugly family aliens mysteriously getting sucked into us space probe they are then deposited earth their baby mac is lost must find its way home process it meets nice disabled kid makes his life complete but when its no longer safe he elliot i mean eric go cross country race find his parents get him home evade capture do this they dress him up halloween type costume need i continue so is film any good well if et had never been made sure it would have been reasonably entertaining very young kids who didnt notice that film was giant commercial who wouldnt notice bad dialog abounding clich s but et had been already made several years earlier so film has zip when it comes originality you wonder how folks associated with film felt they must have been really embarrassed at how blatant this was at just about every turn it seems do it worse than et often much worse its vacuous soul sucking corporate mess film so many ways when i saw this film tonight it was decades after its original release i was startled how ugly expressionless mac was however i had remind myself that et also looks pretty crappy when you see him today because we are used much better special effects 2015 though mac is definitely crappier worst is when dead expressionless doll is riding erics lap during big chase as outer space scene however i watched it very big screen tv i was surprised because it looked so nice this space scene along with actually hiring disabled kid play disabled kid are about only things that impressed me about film otherwise pointless rip off start finish not even bad enough make bad movie buffs laugh but enough overt corporate references make this great film use as drinking game taking shot every time you saw these blatant ads believe me you would get stinking drunk if you tried this by way kid calls hideous little alien mac acronym mysterious alien creature no way was this meant be like et extra terrestrial yeah right also perhaps its just me but this might just be most whitebread corporate uncool film ever made especially during god awful mcdonalds dance scene,0.5378717098653808,-0.025871006630500296,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,"""Mac"" = Cheese.","I know it's a little silly to write a review of a film 15 years after its release. But this poorly done film made its way onto one of my cable movie channels last night, and I feel the need to have a violent, outward reaction outside of the projectile vomiting I experienced.People, this film is bad. Really bad. Bad like ""Showgirls"" bad, where it's so bad, it's both insulting and laughable simultaneously. And forgive me, but anybody who finds this 95-minute commercial for McDonalds and Coca-Cola to be warm-hearted or well done in any way knows not a thing about what makes a movie good, and needs a great deal of emotional counseling.First, let's reiterate that point about this being an extended commercial. Folks, it is. The product placement in this film is shameless. Next, there are basic things that make a film ""good,"" like strong acting, a well-written script, superior camerawork or quality special effects. ""Mac and Me"" has none of these. Wooden posts would have made for better actors. The script clunks and thuds with every ridiculous, uninspired line. And the alien creatures of the film, with their bug-eyes and protruding bellies, look about a life-like as melted candles.I also have to make a point of just how much of a rip-off of ""E.T."" this film was. Not only is the plot just a poor carbon copy, but even the title of this attrocity becomes an act of thievery when it's revealed that ""Mac"" stands for ""Mysterious Alien Creature."" I'm not even the biggest fan of uber-cutesy ""E.T."" either, but at least there the attempts at manipulation are somewhat subtle. Here, the filmmakers fell just short of subtitles at the bottom of the screen that said ""LAUGH HERE"" and/or ""CRY NOW.""And the cherry atop Stewart Rafill's bile sundae?

An E.T. rip off about 5 years too late. And not only that, it rips off a major moment from STARMAN, right down to the aliens walking through fire. The level of product placement is astounding. I haven't seen this much Coke on screen since BLOW (ah, boo yourself!). I counted 15 moments where characters offer up a Coke (Skittles and McDonalds get off light compared to that). Seriously, one could start a Coca-Cola drinking game with this but I fear people participating might have their teeth rot out by the end of the 90 minutes. I will say that I like the alien designs better than the horrifically ugly E.T., even if these aliens do look like Imogene Coca in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION.

1.0,A Brave Effort from our Capitalist Comrades!,"As is to be expected, in the wake of the very successful E.T., some massively derivative imitators were released. In '86 Flight of the Navigator used Paul Reubens' Pee-wee Herman voice as that of an alien ship which befriends a boy who just wants to get home. To be sure that was a smarmy, 2nd-hand effort. But by far, the other much worse product came with 1988's ""Mac and Me."" This was so much more appalling, that ""Navigator"" was instantly blown out of everyone's collective memory. Mac and Me is so heinous that it could melt the brains of the unborn.Remarkably, the movie is so burdened by wall-to-wall garbazh, that stealing the entire plot of another movie could be the least of it's problems.An unrelated movie, called ""East Side Story,"" came out in 1997. It's a sort of ""That's Entertainment!"" of Soviet era propagandistic musical numbers on topics as naff as productivity objectives, living in a workers paradise, ideological purity, etc.. Mmmm... delicious! That's what you get when the machinery of state has no natural competitors. But ""Mac and Me"" is what capitalism would be bringing you morning, noon and night if powerful fans of ca$h never had their avarice checked by people who know better; critics and people with taste. As one cynical remark goes: If Thomas Edison had an MBA he would have just kept making larger candles. This speed-course in half-assed, capitalist film-making includes, as noted, a plot lifted intact from a more successful movie (Why reinvent the wheel?), takes the form of a 90 minute McDonalds commercial (You want to lose 90 minutes of selling time?), interrupted by Coke commercials, has an alien that looks like a 4 dollar rubber fetus (because it is a 4 dollar rubber fetus), a (sym)pathetic hero in a wheelchair, and a script produced after sniffing the finest glue one could buy at the 99 cent store. Did $omebody $ay MAC-Donald$?Somehow the execs didn't imagine we'd notice the endless shilling, maybe 200 percent more than in a typical movie, while taking their express-elevator ride to profit hell. So let's acknowledge these brave geniuses, who strived to make capitalism safe for uh... more capitalism, by name so they make it into the history books; Producers Mark Damon, William B. Kerr, and R.J. Louis; AND so this review is inescapably linked to their names in internet search results.Of course there are questions that capitalism does't answer. Why do the aliens heads look like human scrotums? Why do they walk like babies with a load in their diapers? Why do they like whistling the first few notes of ""Happy Trails (to you)?""This is the lowest point in movie history, in any country, ever.

10.0,"A hilariously horrible blatant ""ET"" rip-off","A family of hideously homely aliens find themselves stuck on Earth. The family gets separated. One little boy alien named Mac (an acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature) befriends plucky crippled kid Eric (winningly played by real-life disabled kid Jade Calegory). Eric helps Mac get reunited with his family. Co-written and directed with staggering ineptitude by Stewart Raffill, with a syrupy, swelling ersatz John Williams orchestral mush score by Alan Silvestri, plenty of shameless product plugs for the fast food chain McDonald's (Ronald McDonald even makes a highly unwelcome cameo appearance!), a soundtrack full of dreadful power pop ballads, cruddy (far from) special effects, and loads of unintentional belly laughs, this awesomely atrocious abomination rates as a total four-star so-stinky-it's-strangely-sublime schlocky hoot. The cast turn in astoundingly awful performances: Jonathan Ward as Eric's jerky, obnoxious tool of an older brother Michael, Christine Ebersole as Eric's harried mother Janet, Katrina Caspary as hot teenage brunette Courtney, Lauren Stanley as spunky little girl Debbie, and George ""Buck"" Flower as a bumbling supermarket security guard. The aliens are truly freaky-looking buggers: With their shriveled-up prune faces, big, wide, googly saucer eyes, spindly limbs, bony builds, pot bellies, and wobbly walks, they are more creepy and ugly than cute and cuddly. Gut-busting highlights include Mac being fried by an electric fence, Eric rolling down a cliff and crashing into a lake, Debbie getting strapped to the back of an out of control vacuum cleaner, Eric racing through a street and a shopping center with Mac on his lap, and the jaw-dropping protracted dance party sequence at a McDonald's restaurant with Mac in a teddy bear outfit cutting loose with these pathetic herky-jerky rug-tearin' moves.

I have just encountered a movie so bad even as an ET rip-off, but I've also heard from Wikipedia.org that this was made to promote McDonalds to kids. Given the information, I understand why this movie got seriously panned by critics. The story is unoriginal and predictable not to mention plagiarizing elements from Steven Spielberg's classic ET. The dialog is terrible, the direction is messy and unfocused and the pacing is too sluggish for itself. The acting is not only over-the-top, but completely wooden with the exception of Jade Calegory for his emotional performance as the main lead. Even the script is lifeless with moments that are completely unfunny and lacks some wit, charm, and heart to it. The second saving grace, much like Jade Calegory's performance, goes to the music from Alan Silvestri. Not exactly his best score, but still pretty good.Overall, Mac and Me isn't exactly the worst movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible film that needs to be avoided.

,Odd,"While most of the comments made by other viewers deriding this movie areaccurate, does it really matter? It is just a very poorly made film. There is no more product placement than seen in many other films, but it is so poorlyintegrated I can understand why people see it as obnoxious. The rest of the film is disjointed and many scenes are superfluous, but there are plenty of movies aimed at the family market that are just as objectionable. I enjoyed watching it on cable last night for the first time (if only to laugh at it), but I can see why kids may have enjoyed it. I remember when it was theatrically released during mychildhood. Yet even at that time it looked ridiculous, lacking the camp appeal it has now.To respond to some of the site users who mentioned Alan Silvestri's score asbeing well done. He is not a bad composer, but he blatantly rips off a lot of his own work (or recycles it), such as his most impressive score (Back to theFuture). Not to mention, he rips off bits from Jerry Goldsmith's score to Gremlins (Gizmo's accompanying whistling noises now provided by Mac). This proveshow little originality existed anywhere in this film.I will agree with everyone that the aliens are awful looking: they are creepy, funny, and altogether unpleasant to see onscreen (even in clothing at the end of the film). As for the dance number, though it was ridiculous, the dancers were better than the majority of the actors in the film.Small note: It seemed a little odd that the doctor pulled out a half-used bottle of sedatives from his pocket and gave one to the lead character after the ravine incident.",odd,while most comments made by other viewers deriding this movie areaccurate does it really matter it is just very poorly made film there is no more product placement than seen many other films but it is so poorlyintegrated i can understand why people see it as obnoxious rest film is disjointed many scenes are superfluous but there are plenty movies aimed at family market that are just as objectionable i enjoyed watching it cable last night first time if only laugh at it but i can see why kids may have enjoyed it i remember when it was theatrically released during mychildhood yet even at that time it looked ridiculous lacking camp appeal it has now respond some site users who mentioned alan silvestris score asbeing well done he is not bad composer but he blatantly rips off lot his own work or recycles it such as his most impressive score back thefuture not mention he rips off bits jerry goldsmiths score gremlins gizmos accompanying whistling noises now provided by mac this proveshow little originality existed anywhere this film i will agree with everyone that aliens are awful looking they are creepy funny altogether unpleasant see onscreen even clothing at end film as dance number though it was ridiculous dancers were better than majority actors film small note it seemed little odd that doctor pulled out half used bottle sedatives his pocket gave one lead character after ravine incident,0.5518095238095237,0.028238095238095246,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
4.0,A Hilariously Bad Exercise in Product Placement,"Mac and Me has a reputation as one of the most infamous movies Hollywood has ever produced- and with good reason. It is utter dreck, a shameless rip-off of ET and an extended exercise in gratuitous product placement. The only original ideas it has are utterly insane. And the alien costumes are sure to give kids nightmares.The amazing thing is that for the most part this movie is not poorly made, at least from a technical standpoint. The acting is completely fine, even good by the standards of a children's movie. The directing and editing are perfectly competent. The photography is quite nice, with many good panning and aerial shots of the desert surroundings. There are some well-staged car chases and crashes that obviously required experienced stunt coordinators, and a number of entirely convincing explosions. This is clearly a movie made by professionals who knew what they were doing and had a decent budget to work with.Which makes it all the stranger that the alien costumes are so horrifyingly bad. Or that this movie turned out so awful. Or maybe not so strange when you consider the script they were working with. From its inception, no-one was under the illusion that Mac & Me was anything but a blatant rip off. The little alien being stranded on Earth, befriending a young child, revealing his magical powers, and the pursuit by frightening government agents in black suits; all directly copied from Spielberg. They also manage to shoehorn in scenes lifted from Poltergeist, and a plucky sidekick who looks and sounds suspiciously like Punky Brewster.And the entire time the product placement is blatantly front and center, until the whole project feels more like a series of advertisements than an actual movie. ET saw the alien take Reese's Pieces from a child's hand. In Mac and Me they pass packages of Skittles to each other. And drink Cokes nonstop. Seriously, several major plot points - including what can only be described as a resurrection- are driven by the aliens' overpowering need to acquire more Coca Cola.And in one of cinema's most infamous scenes, Mac and friends engage in an extended dance off at a McDonalds' with Ronald McDonald, members of a football team, and several of the employees. The ending credits even include a credit for ""Ronald McDonald, as himself."" If you look very closely during the dance off scene, you can actually see the director in the background, waving a handful of bills, because even he wants you to know what a cynical cash grab this movie is.Now by this point we've already seen adult sized aliens sucked face first into a vacuum cleaner, and our little protagonist fall off a cliff, wheelchair and all. But it's from the McDonald's scene onward that things really go off the rails into the realm of utter madness. In short order we're treated to the aforementioned resurrection via Coke, a shoot out with the cops, and a massive, fiery explosion in which half the cast appears to die. No points for guessing whether everyone is fine in the end. And I dare anyone not to burst out laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of the final scene, which takes place in a courthouse of all places.Now I've mentioned that the aliens are ugly, but I haven't said just how ugly. These things look like someone crossed ET with a deformed pig and a blow-up doll, then decided to add horns in case audiences couldn't already tell that these things are of the devil. I cannot fathom how such monstrosities were allowed into a children's movie.So yes, Mac and Me is absolutely awful. It is one of the most cynical cash grabs ever unleashed upon movie going audiences by Hollywood, and is pathetic in every respect except for most of its production values. And yet every minute of it is so gloriously inept, incoherent, and utterly insane that you can't look away. It is so perfectly awful and unintentionally hilarious that it can't possibly be the worst movie ever. This is an experience you have to see to believe.

1.0,"Nothing' worse than curling up with a six pack of coke, a Big Mac and a bag of Skittles and watching this movie with the ones you love.","In 1982, Steven Spielberg's film E.T. was released, and it was a lovely movie that gained critical attention, and did very well at the box office. Mac and Me seems to have the opinion ""Why not cash in on someone else's success?"" This is a bad rip-off if I've ever seen one. It probably would've been better if Mac and Me copied E.T. scene by scene, because though it would've been an even bigger rip-off, it would have at least retained some of the magic E.T. had. As it stands this is a weird flick, and in no way can it be qualified as magical.Some aliens are on their planet when a NASA spacecraft lands and vacuums them up. They end up on Earth, and all four of them escape. Three escape into the desert, and the youngest one, Mac, ends up in a suburban area, where he meets paraplegic Eric and his family. It's hard to come up with any more plot synopsis, as this film has no plot. The F.B.I. is after Mac, and they search high and low for him, from the busy streets, to the crazy dance hall known as McDonalds. Chaos ensues as Mac tries to find his family and the idiot F.B.I. agents try to find him.This movie has been criticized galore for it's constant references to products. Basically, this is a 90 minute long commercial. Coca Cola is constantly shown on screen, and some scenes play off as actual Coke TV spots. McDonalds is often mentioned, and this film is mother to the infamous synchronized McDonalds dance scene, which is as lame and corny as any other dance scene ever. Skittles also appear frequently and Mac loves them, so should you. Buy Skittles, buy McDonalds, buy Coca Cola and buy any other product we jam in your face. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth that Skittles, McDonalds and Coke would only worsen.The acting is OK. It's about standard for an average kid's flick, despite that this was well below average all together. The puppet of Mac was about as real looking as Kermit the Frog, if not less so. Mac, and his family, always had their mouth in the same circular position, and instead of walking, Mac seemed to roll along as though being wheeled around by a talentless puppeteer. Mac is an ugly puppet, as his family are downright scary looking.Dozens of mistakes can be seen throughout the movie, but this is a small thing compared to the incompetence of the rest of the movie. Start a drinking game where you take a shot every time you spot a Mac and Me mistake. I guarantee you won't make it to the end of the movie.Horrible writing...one awful line after the next! As Mac rides on a remote control car towards a girl and her mother, the mother asks, ""Is that guy crazy or something?"" Does a remote control car look like a guy? That doesn't even make sense. The little girl should have replied, ""No idiot! Are you blind?"" The little handicapped boy is blamed for messing up a room, yet he obviously cannot get out of his wheelchair, but still his mother punishes him. Nice woman, very practical thinker. Eric rides his wheelchair through the street with Mac on his lap as the F.B.I. chases him. Cars are crashing to avoid hitting him, and he just mindlessly rolls away. He should've been locked up for that. What a careless little creep.I like the musical score here. It's like a good rip-off of John William's score for E.T., but not as good. Still, it's the best part of the movie.Overall, this movie is just awful. The special effects are bad, the writing is horrendous and the commercials are plentiful. This is recommended only for enthusiasts of cinema that equals a long painful enema.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 99 mins.

3.0,Sheer Crap,"Mac and Me is one of those few movies that truly fly below the radar of most peoples' memories. I'm thinking that this is selective memory, because this movie makes such a crappy impression that it's hard to forget.This movie's first strike is that it's a blatant rip-off of E.T, and they couldn't even wait till the next decade to try and capitalize on it. E.T. at least was a good movie that kids and adults alike could enjoy, if for different reasons. Mac and Me is clearly aimed at kids, but it falls woefully short by virtue of the fact that it's no fun for kids and the aliens are very disturbing in appearance. There are no jokes or scenarios that adults (or kids for that matter) would find funny. As noted by other reviewers, there are numerous product placements made in such an obvious way that it's laughable any ad exec would want to take part. In fact, most people that do remember this film remember most vividly the McDonald's break-dance scene. A pack of perfectly choreographed kids manage to fend off government thugs trying to get ""Mac"" by busting into an 80's break dance. In McDonalds. What? The most irritating part is the alien family. They live on some moon that US spacecrafts can visit and return to earth from (this is set in the present day of 1988, mind you). They drink a dark liquid (Coke, evidently) out of the ground. Throughout the film, they never show any sign of thought above the level of sea slug, they just mope around looking dumb, drunk, and without genitals. They waddle when they walk. They have some sort of mystical power by which they can resurrect the dead (huh?). Then, at the end of the movie, when you think that surely they go away, NO, they are naturalized as US citizens and given driver's licenses so they can drive a pink Cadillac convertible around. The government thugs have reversed the short-sightedness of their plan to study the aliens, and decide that they will allow space aliens to live among us, so long as they wear clothes from now on. This movie is just so random.Thank god they never made a sequel to this (it appears that they wanted to - ""We'll be back!"") and thank God that this movie will sink to the bowels of society's collective consciousness. What makes this movie so bad is that it almost defies logic that such a bad film of total incoherence would come from a big budget release and a reputable studio.",sheer crap,mac me is one those few movies that truly fly below radar most peoples memories im thinking that this is selective memory because this movie makes such crappy impression that its hard forget this movies first strike is that its blatant rip off e t they couldnt even wait till next decade try capitalize it e t at least was good movie that kids adults alike could enjoy if different reasons mac me is clearly aimed at kids but it falls woefully short by virtue fact that its no fun kids aliens are very disturbing appearance there are no jokes or scenarios that adults or kids that matter would find funny as noted by other reviewers there are numerous product placements made such obvious way that its laughable any ad exec would want take part fact most people that do remember this film remember most vividly mcdonalds break dance scene pack perfectly choreographed kids manage fend off government thugs trying get mac by busting into 80s break dance mcdonalds what most irritating part is alien family they live some moon that us spacecrafts can visit return earth this is set present day 1988 mind you they drink dark liquid coke evidently out ground throughout film they never show any sign thought above level sea slug they just mope around looking dumb drunk without genitals they waddle when they walk they have some sort mystical power by which they can resurrect dead huh then at end movie when you think that surely they go away no they are naturalized as us citizens given drivers licenses so they can drive pink cadillac convertible around government thugs have reversed short sightedness their plan study aliens decide that they will allow space aliens live among us so long as they wear clothes now this movie is just so random thank god they never made sequel this it appears that they wanted well be back thank god that this movie will sink bowels societys collective consciousness what makes this movie so bad is that it almost defies logic that such bad film total incoherence would come big budget release reputable studio,0.5212606837606838,-0.005652680652680644,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,The worst thing humanity has ever created,"This movie will make you wish you'd never been born. Each minute that you continue to watch this movie you will find your will to live quickly being sucked out of you. If you haven't killed yourself by the time everyone busts out dancing in the McDonalds, that will surely send you into a hatred for life for which you may never recover. Unfortunately I don't own a gun or I would have taken my own life and saved myself from having to watch the second half. The scene where they drive Mac into the desert and he holds up his hands and does this stupid whistle to find his family which are almost dead in a cave made me start bashing my head against the wall in hopes that I would black out. Sadly I did not, and I now I must live the rest of my life with the nightmarish memories of this movie. I feel depressed and hopeless. I pray everyday that aliens really do exist and that they kill every last person on this planet. We don't deserve to survive as a species if we can make a movie like this.",worst thing humanity has ever created,this movie will make you wish youd never been born each minute that you continue watch this movie you will find your will live quickly being sucked out you if you havent killed yourself by time everyone busts out dancing mcdonalds that will surely send you into hatred life which you may never recover unfortunately i dont own gun or i would have taken my own life saved myself having watch second half scene where they drive mac into desert he holds up his hands does this stupid whistle find his family which are almost dead cave made me start bashing my head against wall hopes that i would black out sadly i did not i now i must live rest my life with nightmarish memories this movie i feel depressed hopeless i pray everyday that aliens really do exist that they kill every last person this planet we dont deserve survive as species if we can make movie like this,0.5697530864197531,-0.06818181818181818,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Hilarious,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it came out in 1988. ( I was eleven). I think i almost died laughing at the part when that kid in the wheelchair went rolling down the hill. I just remember crack ing up out loud. If you have somewhat of a cruel sense of humor, you have to rent this movie just for that part. It's hilarious! Other thenthat this movie pretty much bit the dust. Pretty obvious who sponsored this movie. You couldn't go five minutes without seeing somebody eating McDonalds or drinking Coca-Cola. Overall, I recommend this movie to any soccer mom you wants to promote bad haircuts,junk food, and night mares of gangly, demented looking aliens who are obsessed with pucker ing their lips to their kids.",hilarious,i remember seeing this movie theater when it came out 1988 i was eleven i think i almost died laughing at part when that kid wheelchair went rolling down hill i just remember crack ing up out loud if you have somewhat cruel sense humor you have rent this movie just that part its hilarious other thenthat this movie pretty much bit dust pretty obvious who sponsored this movie you couldnt go five minutes without seeing somebody eating mcdonalds or drinking coca cola overall i recommend this movie any soccer mom you wants promote bad haircuts junk food night mares gangly demented looking aliens who are obsessed with pucker ing their lips their kids,0.6378968253968254,-0.03432539682539682,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.22}"
1.0,A very bad film.,"I love kids movies. I have two children and have always enjoyed watching their movies along with them. I worked in an elementary school for several years and have seen a plethora of fantastic children movies.But this movie was terrible. In fact, I rate it as the worst movie I have ever seen. Why? Several reasons...1. It is a blatant attempt to ride the coattails of ET and similar alien-friend movies from this era. Unfortunately, I think it sat on the wrong coat.2. The film used pity tactics to attempt to draw in your emotions rather than effective writing or visuals, and those tactics failed miserably. 3. The special effects were horrible even for the time. I can relate to chronological limitations in relation to special effects and can respect a film that meets or exceeds the effects available for it's time. But there were plenty of good sfx films out by the time this film was released and this one simply didn't bother with any sfx budget. 4. The dialog was awful. This is an example where no amount of good acting could compensate for the dialog. 5. In relation to reason #4, there was no good acting to attempt to overcome the bad dialog. That might not even be the blame of the actors themselves, as there are simply times when you can't rise above your surroundings. 6. The cheesy marketing and glaring promotions within the film take an already terrible movie and turn it into a true mockery.7. I have seen B-Movies that were more enjoyable to watch. However, out of morbid curiosity, I watched this film from opening to closing credits.From start to finish, from effects to acting, from dialog to directing - Mac and Me is a very bad movie. Just because a film is made for children does not mean it's OK to be terrible. Children's films, just like any genre, have a majority of moderately enjoyable films, a number of gems, and their share of stinkers. This is a true stinker. And yes - my children thought this movie was horrible, too.",very bad film,i love kids movies i have two children have always enjoyed watching their movies along with them i worked elementary school several years have seen plethora fantastic children movies but this movie was terrible fact i rate it as worst movie i have ever seen why several reasons 1 it is blatant attempt ride coattails et similar alien friend movies this era unfortunately i think it sat wrong coat 2 film used pity tactics attempt draw your emotions rather than effective writing or visuals those tactics failed miserably 3 special effects were horrible even time i can relate chronological limitations relation special effects can respect film that meets or exceeds effects available its time but there were plenty good sfx films out by time this film was released this one simply didnt bother with any sfx budget 4 dialog was awful this is example where no amount good acting could compensate dialog 5 relation reason there was no good acting attempt overcome bad dialog that might not even be blame actors themselves as there are simply times when you cant rise above your surroundings 6 cheesy marketing glaring promotions within film take already terrible movie turn it into true mockery 7 i have seen b movies that were more enjoyable watch however out morbid curiosity i watched this film opening closing credits start finish effects acting dialog directing mac me is very bad movie just because film is made children does not mean its ok be terrible childrens films just like any genre have majority moderately enjoyable films number gems their share stinkers this is true stinker yes my children thought this movie was horrible too,0.5933618012422361,-0.12064052795031058,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.27}"

4.0,The Poor Man's ET,"A Mysterious Alien Creature (MAC) trying to escape from NASA is befriended by a young boy in a wheel chair (Jade Calegory).This is basically the same story as ""E.T."", except instead of Reese's Pieces we have Skittles, and instead of a bike we have a wheelchair. Same alien being chased by NASA. Same older brother, with the sister now being a neighbor.The movie is notorious for its McDonalds product placement. I had heard that the movie was one big McDonalds commercial, and that is not really a fair statement. However, there is about a five-minute scene featuring Ronald McDonald, many choreographed dancers, and McDonalds food galore. It really serves no purpose other than to make McDonalds look like a fun place to be (which it generally is not).",poor mans et,mysterious alien creature mac trying escape nasa is befriended by young boy wheel chair jade calegory this is basically same story as e t except instead reeses pieces we have skittles instead bike we have wheelchair same alien being chased by nasa same older brother with sister now being neighbor movie is notorious its mcdonalds product placement i had heard that movie was one big mcdonalds commercial that is not really fair statement however there is about five minute scene featuring ronald mcdonald many choreographed dancers mcdonalds food galore it really serves no purpose other than make mcdonalds look like fun place be which it generally is not,0.4107843137254902,-0.007843137254901966,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.53}"
