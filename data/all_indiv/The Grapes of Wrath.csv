10.0,Economic Dislocation,"John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.",economic dislocation,john fords film john steinbecks novel has deservedly classic film mirroring views both men times book was written filmed ford won his second oscar best director jane darwell was best supporting actress 1940 most america depression started with stock market crash 1929 but farmers it really began at end world war i those were good years agriculture war europe was boom agriculture but when farm prices dropped after armistice whole lot family farms went belly up lots people left farms big city industry jobs depression years unhappily coincided with some worst drought ever seen america this is what many families like joads were facing 1939 when book was written banks had foreclosed land that had withered dust any event folks like joads picked up moved elsewhere like california rumor prosperity jobs america was still changing agricultural industrial society back then that causes lot trouble people unskilled any industrial job training as country were going through something similar today many areas were moving industrial information based economy industry jobs are being lost other nations older poorer workers are suffering it its progress i guess but it takes its toll some factory worker who has lost his job any number reasons can identify some degree with joads especially if theyve lost home they owned joads it was worse because they made their living off land many generations identifying with it way that industrial workers could not henry fonda got his first oscar nomination tom joad get part which he knew he was so right he signed studio contract with 20th century fox that caused him many problems later but those are stories another film review tom joad is midwest country kid whole lot like fonda himself part story grapes wrath is tom himself trying figure out why these economic forces are crushing him his family way life hes known end when he leaves joad family hits open road hes not got all answers but hes asking questions tom hasnt figured it out but lot people with many letters after their names havent either he only knows that hes got get fight economic justice jane darwell was films earliest silent films mary poppins 1965 this became her career part mother role all time shes what holds joad family together good times bad thats what moms do get little recognition it except this case by motion picture academy john carradine has his career part this also another john ford favorite carradine plays casy defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with female parishioner after that preaching gospel didnt seem quite right when fonda meets carradine after fondas been released prison carradine is asking lot questions about what is mans place metaphysical scheme things hes developing what we would now call situational ethics carradines questions are higher plane but he certainly inspires fonda ask some answers himself grapes wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid crisis after being privately run agricultural camps where theyre treated like less than dirt joads happen upon camp run by department agriculture where at least theyre treated like humans as it turns out secretary agriculture was one henry wallace who was running vice president that year with franklin d roosevelt ill bet any number people saw grapes wrath saw message support fdr new deal given some problems american economy today grapes wrath though it appears dated isnt really all that much relic our past its both timeless book timeless classic film,0.4014164198374724,0.11566510974405715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,John Ford's stark portrayal of a poor family in the depression remains one of the most moving films in history.,"The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously, there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940, but especially today, the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way, because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today, this time-enhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time. Henry Fonda plays the part of Tom Joad, a young member of the family who is released from prison at the beginning of the film, only to find that his family has been driven from their home and is staying at his uncle's house until they can figure out what to do about their sudden homelessness. It is by pure coincidence that Tom was released early on good behavior, otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again. He finds them in a state of near desperation, as they begin more and more to realize the predicament that they are in. Their trek across half of the country, on their way to California to assume jobs that they've heard about, provides for a substantial portion of the plot and is extremely well-structured. The family encounters every hardship imaginable on this journey, from family members dying to their struggle to feed themselves to their rickety old truck constantly breaking down. They run into disillusioned people who claim that they've been to California and there are really no jobs there, at least not nearly as many as there are people going to look for them. They are periodically and derogatorily referred to as `Okies,' a term which places them in a broad category of poor folks driven from there homes in middle America who are traveling to the coast to get jobs that aren't there. There is so much doubt and hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs. The audience is never able to assume a happy ending, because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout the film. The struggles do not abate once the family reaches California and takes up shaky residence in residential areas that would be more accurately referred to as shanty towns, and the rest of the film is dominated by the family's efforts to survive in a new and unfamiliar place, while working for wages that are barely sufficient to prevent starvation. Ma Joad spends the majority of the film stressing the importance of keeping the family together, seeing it as the only thing that they really had left, but this is eventually set aside in favor of each member of the family not only surviving but also flourishing, which provides for one of the many powerful messages that the film delivers. The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge of your seat film, but it is a shockingly realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performances are flawless, and the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational. It's no secret that most people do not watch movies to learn, but there comes a point, at least once in a great while, when a person should watch a film that requires a little mental thought processing, and in such cases, The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent choice.",john fords stark portrayal poor family depression remains one most moving films history,grapes wrath is story joad family who are run off their land oklahoma because drought poverty i think that one most striking elements this movie is black white cinematography obviously there wasnt lot variation this particular subject 1940 but especially today lack color enhances feelings poverty desperation emptiness due familys loss their home this way because it would not be nearly as noticeable 1940 as it is today this time enhanced effect black white film stock has allowed films impact actually grow with time henry fonda plays part tom joad young member family who is released prison at beginning film only find that his family has been driven their home is staying at his uncles house until they can figure out what do about their sudden homelessness it is by pure coincidence that tom was released early good behavior otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again he finds them state near desperation as they begin more more realize predicament that they are their trek across half country their way california assume jobs that theyve heard about provides substantial portion plot is extremely well structured family encounters every hardship imaginable this journey family members dying their struggle feed themselves their rickety old truck constantly breaking down they run into disillusioned people who claim that theyve been california there are really no jobs there at least not nearly as many as there are people going look them they are periodically derogatorily referred as okies term which places them broad category poor folks driven there homes middle america who are traveling coast get jobs that arent there there is so much doubt hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs audience is never able assume happy ending because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout film struggles do not abate once family reaches california takes up shaky residence residential areas that would be more accurately referred as shanty towns rest film is dominated by familys efforts survive new unfamiliar place while working wages that are barely sufficient prevent starvation ma joad spends majority film stressing importance keeping family together seeing it as only thing that they really had left but this is eventually set aside favor each member family not only surviving but also flourishing which provides one many powerful messages that film delivers grapes wrath is not exactly edge your seat film but it is shockingly realistic portrayal suffering that so many people families experienced during great depression performances are flawless experience is not only powerful moving but also educational its no secret that most people do not watch movies learn but there comes point at least once great while when person should watch film that requires little mental thought processing such cases grapes wrath is excellent choice,0.49756849175863266,0.14114484889132775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"Not the Book, But Beautiful in Its Own Right","It's difficult on a first viewing of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the ""gee whizz"" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.Grade: A",not book but beautiful its own right,its difficult first viewing grapes wrath not be somewhat disappointed with it so much steinbecks beautiful novel is left out film its hard see his story characters wedged into gee whizz style film making so prevalent at time but once you get beyond comparison movie book you begin realize that john ford created beautiful piece work his own film inspires great deal admiration deserves credit its gutsiness at tackling story that wouldnt have gone down smoothly with film executives at time course most controversial parts book are left out like its final image example but ford still managed work around constraints forced upon him fashion hard biting film henry fonda is perfect casting tom joad never have his otherworldly eyes been used greater effect jane darwell is pitch perfect as ma joad she captures tough as nails dignity that character has novel whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer gregg toland who uses shadow reflection cast ghostly pall over everything indeed much what ford wasnt able include film as words he communicates instead through images isnt that what good book film adaptation should do one those films that feels ahead its time grade,0.6292966611932129,0.28130815544608645,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Everyone should see Grapes of Wrath and be thankful for what they have!,"In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the ""writing types"". A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the ""lies"" of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs. The cast, with Fonda at the helm, is wonderful as is the scenery, costumes, and careful direction to show the truth of a desperate situation.

10.0,A masterpiece...,"During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed ""Stagecoach"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" in less than 12 months. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10",masterpiece,during most decade 30s united states

,The First Great Film of a Great Decade for the Cinema.,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" was a huge novel so it only made sense to turn it into a feature motion picture. The result is one of the greatest films ever produced. Oscar-nominee Henry Fonda, his mother Jane Darwell (Oscar-winning) and their family have had it in the Dust Bowl. Thus they decide to leave the midwest of our nation's Great Depression and go to California. The film is an intensely dramatic affair that is first-rate in all cinematic departments. John Ford won his second Best Director Oscar with this movie and the landscape of the late-1920s and early-1930s has never been captured more fully.

10.0,Down but not Out,"Anytime you are tempted to feel down and out, watch this movie. I personally have seen it many times and are currently reading the book which I highly recommend. I cannot emphasize this enough. This is as down as you can get and still survive. We are taught to be grateful when watching this and to also consider the other guy, whoever he is and at the least, do not add to his burden. Actors are on their game as is the Director. Of course, none of this exists if it wasn't for John Steinbeck and his book. I thought about this movie during the recent Real Estate downturn and what the banks did in real life was indeed captured in this movie way back when. Indifferent, callous, and greedy while practicing their rights leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth and we bailed them out if that isn't the gall of galls.

10.0,"My experience of living the movie, its so true to life","This movie is so real..at least to this person, who lived these things that happened in the movie. I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the ThirtiesI think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hutthis was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.Gene McDaniel",my experience living movie its so true life,this movie is so real at least this person who lived these things that happened movie i will tell short version my personal life let you know how it affected me my own experience growing up thirtiesi think their must have been more then one car because ours was full stuff back seat clear up almost roof frankie bill me my brothers all was top stuff back seat had stay lying down was not enough room set up what i remember most about trip was it was awful hot when we went through arizona we had not much water water we had was canvas bag hooked front bumper help keep it cool we did not get much because dad was saving it car when car got hot mom told us suck pebbles we did it was bad time every where no jobs or anyway make any money we were going california because their was suppose be some picking work their after we got california we saw miles potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was white powder keep people taking them eat we found place pick plums that they used make prunes we lived quonset hut made corrugated metal setting concrete slab public toilets were near were we stayed joe his wife family friends had their own hut this was time that dad joe would sell tickets people watch them box each other ring at recreation hall property also they joined baseball team played baseball dad played left field we got watch them play free seems like frankie i played together lot dont think bill did because he was still baby his self doris dorothy my sisters was still crawling so bill could not have been very old at that time frank i would go pick up plums off ground we would bring them home doris dorothy would set box eat them you can guess what they would look like when mom dad got home their was no air condition back then so they would take hose squirt water tin quonset hut try cool it off some i know when we went west we looked like those grapes wrath folks movie that area was first time i ever saw frog walk it was hot them hop when they tried hop their bellies would touch ground gravel would burn them any way thats what we thought at that time i saw movie grapes wrath long time ago i remember it so well i cried most time it was because it reminded me hard time we all had back then i was born oklahoma it was just terrible time late thirties i would love see movie again its me history my family i am 71 1 2 years old now still remember it very clearly gene mcdaniel,0.46115477517651443,0.07567075436640654,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,"Wherever they're showing the Grapes of Wrath, that's where I'll be","Do I have your attention? Okay: Go out and watch this movie immediately because to not do so is, well, it's un-American. John Ford, with this nifty little film, made the greatest argument for populist/socialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island (or is it at the Statue of Liberty?) says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be, but, let's be honest, the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. The sweeping vistas, the excellent editing and pacing, and the acting are of the highest caliber, as befits a John Ford film. I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cry--his chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor, and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him, interestingly, the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad; no one would have that charm and charisma and, most importantly, that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing, don't misunderstand, but Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda--an actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be; he is the single most watchable actor of all time. And this isn't even my favorite John Ford movie! Nevertheless, it's a great film with a great message. Call me a pinko (it's been done before), but what's superb about this movie is its humanism. Yeah, the ideology promotes a type of socialism (ahem, I mean, let's not forget that that is basically what the New Deal was and if you think that system was a bad idea, then fine), but, really, the movie is about caring for people who don't have the resources to care for themselves. Grapes of Wrath is not a scathing indictment of anyone; it's a simple portrait of a family's struggles to overcome the Depression. It's uplifting and shows a real feeling for the downtrodden, and that's more than you can say about most American films that intend to deal with the poor and hungry.",wherever theyre showing grapes wrath thats where ill be,do i have your attention okay go out watch this movie immediately because not do so is well its un american john ford with this nifty little film made greatest argument populist socialist politics cinematic history this movie understands depression dust bowl poor hungry starving all those people that sign at ellis island or is it at statue liberty says that well take help it understands those people better than anyone or anything else i know steinbecks novel helps this movie get where it needs be but lets be honest grapes wrath is all john ford sweeping vistas excellent editing pacing acting are highest caliber as befits john ford film im amazed every time i see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality tom joads speech at end always makes me cry his chilly delivery word homicide at beginning continues give me prickly spine fonda was great actor he is certainly at top his game here without him interestingly film would have probably floundered no one else could have possibly played tom joad no one would have that charm charisma most importantly that voice rest cast is amazing dont misunderstand but henry fonda is henry fonda actor unto himself there is no one like him never will there be he is single most watchable actor all time this isnt even my favorite john ford movie nevertheless its great film with great message call me pinko its been done before but whats superb about this movie is its humanism yeah ideology promotes type socialism ahem i mean lets not forget that that is basically what new deal was if you think that system was bad idea then fine but really movie is about caring people who dont have resources care themselves grapes wrath is not scathing indictment anyone its simple portrait familys struggles overcome depression its uplifting shows real feeling downtrodden thats more than you can say about most american films that intend deal with poor hungry,0.5955300182273867,0.24162109820004554,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,Fine Cast & Production,"This classic adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" features a fine cast as well as a skillful production headed by director John Ford. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are well-remembered for their roles, which are among the defining roles in their careers. The only limitations that it has come from the original novel, with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story.Besides Fonda and Darwell, the supporting cast features plenty of good supporting players, including Charley Grapewin and John Carradine. All of them make their characters come alive believably. They also fit together well and complement one another's performances, which accentuates the themes involved in the struggles of the Joad family.For all that the Steinbeck novel is so revered, and for all that his story is an often compelling depiction of its characters, with whom many in the era could identify, it would have been better if it had not been so heavy-handed. Even given that the times were bad, more balance in the characters outside of the family, and in the Joads' experiences, would have made it an even better story. Certainly, this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many present-day movies and novels, which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film. Ford clearly appreciated the potential in the material, and he and the cast work together to make each character count, and to give meaning to each scene.",fine cast production,this classic adaptation grapes wrath features fine cast as well as skillful production headed by director john ford henry fonda jane darwell are well remembered their roles which are among defining roles their careers only limitations that it has come original novel with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story besides fonda darwell supporting cast features plenty good supporting players including charley grapewin john carradine all them make their characters come alive believably they also fit together well complement one anothers performances which accentuates themes involved struggles joad family all that steinbeck novel is so revered all that his story is often compelling depiction its characters with whom many era could identify it would have been better if it had not been so heavy handed even given that times were bad more balance characters outside family joads experiences would have made it even better story certainly this is barely even noticeable when compared with stories many present day movies novels which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility that does not stop this adaptation being worthwhile often moving film ford clearly appreciated potential material he cast work together make each character count give meaning each scene,0.48767006802721086,0.21211734693877551,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.5}"

9.0,The definitive Great Depression film,"Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake ""Hollywood"" dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichés. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. Every single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.9.5/10",definitive great depression film,classic hollywood films that tried tackle important issues or answer big questions typically were cheesy hard take seriously they had gratuitous overacting fake hollywood dialogue just general over dramatization since these films are typically over dramatized this way their attempts at having deeper or meaning or some sort message are ruined but not all classic hollywood films fall into this abyss clich s ones that dont are still remembered cherished this very day films like mr smith goes washington or modern times or 12 angry men faced serious social issues at time succeeded films like these are unforgettable many ways life changing john fords grapes wrath is one these precious films as im sure you all already know grapes wrath is adaptation john steinbeck pulitzer prize winning novel same name that was published only year before film was first released novel is one greatest 20th century i highly recommend that you should check it out film novel are both about tom joad played by henry fonda who collaborated with john ford several times who returns his familys home oklahoma after spending 4 years prison but unfortunately by time tom joad makes it out prison country has fallen into great depression joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers so course bank repossessed there home land joad family are forced head west california look work but as they get closer closer california things begin seem hopeless as they learn truth about what is going out west if i were choose one word describe grapes wrath it would be haunting so many scenes lines dialogue send shivers down your spine make tears grow back your eyes i wont spoil any these fantastic moments but dear god combination john steinbecks masterful writing actorss somber performances combine make these scenes lines dialogues absolutely devastating you will be thinking about them weeks after you watch film cinematography done by legendary gregg toland who also was cinematographer citizen kane is also outstanding shots deserted houses oklahoma wide open road highway 66 overcrowded filthy slums california all give grapes wrath bleak depressing atmosphere every single actor film gives it his her all jane darwell won oscar best supporting actress her role as ma joad henry fonda was nominated best leading actor while these two performances are just perfect every single roll film no matter how small is also perfect well except some minor child actor roles john ford is excellent actor director though so this should come as no surprise john ford also won oscar best director this was his second oscar his first was informer it is well deserved each scene is meticulously crafted dig real deep into audiences emotions not way that feels cheap by exploiting audience or something no instead going cheap shallow emotions way oscar bait movie would grapes wrath instead has characters that dont even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles there is no cheap manipulation this film it is 100 genuine john ford was strange person 20th century fox pick direct grapes wrath because he was politically conservative book film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes unions but john ford was definitely right choice see what i did there grapes wrath was one few american films that was allowed be released soviet union it was only allowed because it supported pro communist ideas but it eventually had be pulled soviet union when soviet audiences saw that even dirt poor begging americans could still afford cars 1989 grapes wrath was one first 25 films be added national film registry alongside films like citizen kane vertigo casablanca it deserves its spot there grapes wrath has become definitive great depression film should be viewed by everyone 9 5 10,0.5361299603174605,0.12111210317460322,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,A Triumph in Record Time,"They say that you should wait 20 or 30 years before attempting to capture an historical event on film. That is why it was remarkable that Oliver Stone was able to capture the ""feel"" of Viet Nam (in ""Platoon"") so soon (13 years) after America's withdrawal. Usually, an honest perspective takes more time to develop.But, when you consider that John Steinbeck and John Ford needed less than ten years to bring the 1932 ""dust bowl"" to life, you really have to admire their magnificent achievement.  Of course, in 1940, Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel. For example, the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon, who has milk to spare following the death of her baby. But, far from degradation, Rose of Sharon's gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her, and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen. Tom Joad may be an ex-con, but he is a good man. One of the commentaries (below) uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today's society. That completely misses the point. Ford, who was as conservative as anyone in Hollywood, even more conservative than John Wayne, used this movie to show that Man can triumph, despite the natural and human barriers that are put in his way.  This is ultimately a movie about hope and the human spirit.",triumph record time,they say that you should wait 20 or 30 years before attempting capture historical event film that is why it was remarkable that oliver stone was able capture feel viet nam platoon so soon 13 years after americas withdrawal usually honest perspective takes more time develop but when you consider that john steinbeck john ford needed less than ten years bring 1932 dust bowl life you really have admire their magnificent achievement course 1940 ford could not film much graphic squalor described novel example film cannot show starving hobo suckling at breast young rose sharon who has milk spare following death her baby but far degradation rose sharons gesture is reflection goodness that resides within her that quality is well illustrated character development seen screen tom joad may be ex con but he is good man one commentaries below uses this film rant about exploitation todays society that completely misses point ford who was as conservative as anyone hollywood even more conservative than john wayne used this movie show that man can triumph despite natural human barriers that are put his way this is ultimately movie about hope human spirit,0.49734848484848493,0.281060606060606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,A marvellous production of Steinbeck's epic.,"Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad captures perfectly the humanity and compassion of the Steinbeck character, an ex-con who breaks his parole conditions by joining his family in their epic journey across the southern US to a ""better life"" in California.This is not the usual Hollywood fare. Tragedy and betrayal beset the Joad family from the outset. But it is nonetheless an uplifting movie. Spirit, compassion and tenderness mark them out.

10.0,People That Live,"The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and ""we're the people that live."" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Casey the Preacher (John Carradine). Ma represents what Marx called ""false consciousness,"" the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws, to bad luck, or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde -- to hold the ""fambly"" together. Casey, on the other hand, discovers ""class consciousness."" It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic, and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism -- the government-run labor camp with its democratic ""sanitary units"", and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst (better known as Charles Foster Kane) who is described as have ""a mean face and a mouth like a a**hole."" There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film, just a few remarks about ""Who is these Reds, anyways?"" Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!No need for anxiety, though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up, and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot, note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly, without any cuts or dialog, through groups of wary, singularly ratty looking people, men and women, young and old, some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes, who ""don't look none too prosperous."" If nothing else, the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy.

9.0,Tom Joad will be there and so will this movie for you,"I'm will be there—to review John Steinbeck and his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, about the westward migration of people during the dust bowl in the Depression of the 1930's. It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are these it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country.

10.0,"""...I'll be there.""

Socialism/Communism was seen as an Alternative to the Punishing Poverty and Vanishing Opportunities by some and a Threat to Capitalism by the Capitalists.This is a Solid Background to the Story but Not the Backbone. The Skeletal Structure of the Movie, from John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize Winning Novel, is the Joad Family.Impeccably Acted by Henry Fonda (Tom Joad), Ma (Jane Darwell), and X-Preacher Casey (John Carradine), with Support from Charlie Grapewin (Grandpa), and John Qualen (Muley). The Remainder of the Strong Ensemble of Acting all do Excellent Work and the overall Verisimilitude of the Film is Striking.Gregg Toland's Haunting and Beautiful Cinematography Captures the Mood of Melancholy and the Film as a Whole is Widely Considered one of the Great Films.Some Film-Scholars even Rank it ""The Greatest"".

8.0,The most important word you'll ever hear : Family !!!,"Wow...this movie is just WOW !! I've been wanting to see it for such a long time but I never got the chance. Now, I finally did and it even goes beyond my highest expectations... I was prepared to see some class-A drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than I thought. This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California, it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. It's impossible not to get touched by the Joad family. All the characters are so sad but at the same time so brave. They don't give up and keep fighting...you just have to encourage them while watching this film. The Grapes of Wrath really makes you feel happy you live in this era and in this part of the world. You know stories like this really happened in the old days and they still do in some parts of the world. This kind of film is excellent to make you realize you have nothing to complain about.The dramatic highlights in this motion picture are countless : The flashbacks about how families are driven away from their homes, the grandfather's ""funeral"" , the mother and son conversation near the end... All these scenes and several other ones are indicators of great drama and brilliant cinema. The Grapes of Wrath received several prices and nominations and it deserved every single one of them. Every element in it is flawless. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is one of the most intriguing characters ever shown of the screen. He's absolutely brilliant. The highest possible recommendation isn't yet high enough to describe The Grapes of Wrath...If you ever have the chance: SEE IT !",most important word youll ever hear family,wow this movie is just wow ive been wanting see it such long time but i never got chance now i finally did it even goes beyond my highest expectations i was prepared see some class drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than i thought this famous movie milestone goes about joad family they have leave everything they own oklahoma behind them several other poor families are attracted by california because there is supposed be work place live long trip is filled with misery when they finally get california it seems that theyve been deceived once more theres almost no food 8 hungry mouths fill its impossible not get touched by joad family all characters are so sad but at same time so brave they dont give up keep fighting you just have encourage them while watching this film grapes wrath really makes you feel happy you live this era this part world you know stories like this really happened old days they still do some parts world this kind film is excellent make you realize you have nothing complain about dramatic highlights this motion picture are countless flashbacks about how families are driven away their homes grandfathers funeral mother son conversation near end all these scenes several other ones are indicators great drama brilliant cinema grapes wrath received several prices nominations it deserved every single one them every element it is flawless henry fondas portrayal tom joad is one most intriguing characters ever shown screen hes absolutely brilliant highest possible recommendation isnt yet high enough describe grapes wrath if you ever have chance see it,0.6278105590062111,0.18502823263692833,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,"California, Super Cool To The Homeless","The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.Yokels, rednecks, hillbillies - everyone's favourite punching bag. The Grapes of Wrath doesn't look down America's uneducated, rural white folk nor presents them as a caricature but that still doesn't change the fact that none of the Joad clan are the sharpest tools in the shed nor don't understand how the outside world works. Just as we are introduced to the family the youngest daughter Rosasharn is pregnant and married when still a teen while the family is dirt poor and huge as it is.Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad may be the pinnacle of his acting career. His stone face alongside the laid-back manner in which he walked and talked is mesmerising yet Joad is not someone I would fancy being in the vicinity off. Fonda's performance has a sinister edge to it and a sense of barely restrained violence. His proclamation to the truck driver near the beginning of the film when telling him the reason he was in prison, a simple uttering of ""homicide"" could come straight out of a horror movie. Jane Darwell on the other hand as Ma Joad is the other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre, tour-de-force performance as a character with one ultimate aim - keeping the fambly together.The amazing landscape shots, use of German expressionism and high contrast lighting give way for such unforgettable images from a car light driving along the horizon to silhouettes walking across a hill, thanks to cinematographer Gregg Toland. Take the scene at the campsite in which the characters discuss their present situation; it's so dreamlike with the odd, unnatural angles, it couldn't be more mesmerising. I also recommend watching the South Park episode Over Logging which parodies this scene (and the movie as a whole), right down to the black & white cinematography.Once the Joads arrive at the Farmworkers' Wheat Patch run by the Department of Agriculture it is a temporary relief to see something good happen to the family, after all, they have been through. When The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1940, the US Secretary of Agriculture was Henry A. Wallace, whom that same year was running for Vice President with Franklin D. Roosevelt; a message of support for FDR and the New Deal no doubt? At the government camp they are greeted by a seemingly genuine, honest man who looks like FDR and tells them they have washtubs with running water; a world away from the corporate run camps the Joads took residence earlier in the film - all sounds too good to be true? The government is the solution to the Joad's problems (temporally at least as they end up leaving at a later point), nor at any point in the film do we see any charitable organisations out to help the poor. It's fairly obvious that The Grapes of Wrath doesn't exactly lean to the right of politics; evil bankers running people off their land, corrupt police, capitalists treating people like dogs, total collapse of the free market, socialist camp run by the government is only decent place to be in which cops are not allowed to lines of dialogue such as ""people are going to win rich, people are going to die"". - A world of oppressor and the oppressed if there ever existed one. Regardless of one's politics, I still contend The Grapes of Wrath to be one of the most emotionally draining films in all of cinema.",california super cool homeless,grapes wrath was impressively released less than year following release novel yet within this short timeframe director john ford crafted one greatest motion pictures ever made number john fords movies have that foreign film feel feeling very raw lifelike emotion grapes warth itself is one most emotionally draining films all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings pity everything is rough dirty nor is there makeup any actors just take scene which depression ridden joad family their way california attempt buy bread dinner scene which really puts value money perspective emotion is one part humility other part pathetic yokels rednecks hillbillies everyones favourite punching bag grapes wrath doesnt look down americas uneducated rural white folk nor presents them as caricature but that still doesnt change fact that none joad clan are sharpest tools shed nor dont understand how outside world works just as we are introduced family youngest daughter rosasharn is pregnant married when still teen while family is dirt poor huge as it is henry fondas performance as tom joad may be pinnacle his acting career his stone face alongside laid back manner which he walked talked is mesmerising yet joad is not someone i would fancy being vicinity off fondas performance has sinister edge it sense barely restrained violence his proclamation truck driver near beginning film when telling him reason he was prison simple uttering homicide could come straight out horror movie jane darwell other hand as ma joad is other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre tour de force performance as character with one ultimate aim keeping fambly together amazing landscape shots use german expressionism high contrast lighting give way such unforgettable images car light driving along horizon silhouettes walking across hill thanks cinematographer gregg toland take scene at campsite which characters discuss their present situation its so dreamlike with odd unnatural angles it couldnt be more mesmerising i also recommend watching south park episode over logging which parodies this scene movie as whole right down black white cinematography once joads arrive at farmworkers wheat patch run by department agriculture it is temporary relief see something good happen family after all they have been through when grapes wrath was released 1940 us secretary agriculture was henry wallace whom that same year was running vice president with franklin d roosevelt message support fdr new deal no doubt at government camp they are greeted by seemingly genuine honest man who looks like fdr tells them they have washtubs with running water world away corporate run camps joads took residence earlier film all sounds too good be true government is solution joads problems temporally at least as they end up leaving at later point nor at any point film do we see any charitable organisations out help poor its fairly obvious that grapes wrath doesnt exactly lean right politics evil bankers running people off their land corrupt police capitalists treating people like dogs total collapse free market socialist camp run by government is only decent place be which cops are not allowed lines dialogue such as people are going win rich people are going die world oppressor oppressed if there ever existed one regardless ones politics i still contend grapes wrath be one most emotionally draining films all cinema,0.47850898758306143,0.10759277074091889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.48}"
8.0,"While a tad too sentimental and not always accurate historically, it's a very impressive and heart-rending film","This is an extremely sentimental and worthwhile film that fans of Hollywood's Golden Age should see at least once. While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as ""Ma"") was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as ""the Preacher""). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly made--though historically, some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book, one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and movie--coming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the ""Okies"" had when they arrived in California, that the exodus to California from most of America PRE-DATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma (though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably). This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist, but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement.

10.0,One Of The Best Films Ever Made!,"The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is a Drama History film in black and white starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. The film follows a poor Midwestern family during the depression who are being forced off their land. After being released from jail, Tom returns home to find it abandoned. He learns that the land is no longer producing enough crops to provide for their family and the whole family heads to California to look for work. The best parts of the film are the acting, the plot, and the cinematography. The acting and casting are excellent. The entire cast is full of life and they deliver their lines with perfect execution. When Tom Joad returns home to see his family, they are all lit up and full of smiles. You are able to see the happiness and utter joy that they are feeling to be reunited with a family member and you can sense the fear and anxiety that they are feeling regarding their upcoming move.The plot is riveting. Rarely do you see a historical film that is as much of a work of art as The Grapes of Wrath is. The story will take you into the Great Depression years ago and give you a glimpse at what a poor family during that time might have gone through. The timing of the script is great and will have you hoping for the main characters to be able to keep their home some way or at least find a nicer one. The plot allows for many emotional performances.The cinematography is excellent and professional. It proves that not only the cast and actors were perfect for the jobs, but the crew must have been as well. There are no shaky shots and there are no scenes where something is out of view that should be able to be seen by the camera and there are no scenes that were too zoomed in that you couldn't see anything. The camera pans between characters based on who is talking.I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys drama movies or anybody who is interested in history. Although this film is long (over 2 hours), there are no boring or dull parts in the film and it is definitely worth taking the time to watch it. Also, this film was made in the early 40s and it is in black and white. Even if you usually don't like or watch black and white films, I would recommend that you watch The Grapes of Wrath. This would also be an excellent film to show in history class when teaching about The Great Depression.The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent classic film that I would recommend to anyone regardless of whether or not they enjoy old films or black and white films. This film is worth the 2 hours that is takes to watch it because the acting, plot, and cinematography are phenomenal. The emotional scenes were executed to perfection and will leave you feeling sorry for the characters. The plot will have you interested in the beginning and the cinematography makes it easy to understand and see what is going on in the film. Overall this is an excellent film and deserves 10/10 stars.",one best films ever made,grapes wrath 1940 is drama history film black white starring henry fonda as tom joad film follows poor midwestern family during depression who are being forced off their land after being released jail tom returns home find it abandoned he learns that land is no longer producing enough crops provide their family whole family heads california look work best parts film are acting plot cinematography acting casting are excellent entire cast is full life they deliver their lines with perfect execution when tom joad returns home see his family they are all lit up full smiles you are able see happiness utter joy that they are feeling be reunited with family member you can sense fear anxiety that they are feeling regarding their upcoming move plot is riveting rarely do you see historical film that is as much work art as grapes wrath is story will take you into great depression years ago give you glimpse at what poor family during that time might have gone through timing script is great will have you hoping main characters be able keep their home some way or at least find nicer one plot allows many emotional performances cinematography is excellent professional it proves that not only cast actors were perfect jobs but crew must have been as well there are no shaky shots there are no scenes where something is out view that should be able be seen by camera there are no scenes that were too zoomed that you couldnt see anything camera pans between characters based who is talking i would recommend this film anybody who enjoys drama movies or anybody who is interested history although this film is long over 2 hours there are no boring or dull parts film it is definitely worth taking time watch it also this film was made early 40s it is black white even if you usually dont like or watch black white films i would recommend that you watch grapes wrath this would also be excellent film show history class when teaching about great depression grapes wrath is excellent classic film that i would recommend anyone regardless whether or not they enjoy old films or black white films this film is worth 2 hours that is takes watch it because acting plot cinematography are phenomenal emotional scenes were executed perfection will leave you feeling sorry characters plot will have you interested beginning cinematography makes it easy understand see what is going film overall this is excellent film deserves 10 10 stars,0.47711442786069647,0.26231343283582087,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.44}"
