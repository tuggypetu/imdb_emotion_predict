8,Tamil film industry's answer to the Neo Noir film making - Rock solid and sure not to be missed,"Pushkar Gayatri the husband wife duo directors hits the right chord to present an engaging, entertaining, gripping thriller. This is a Neo Noir movie which happens rarely in Tamil. Story is simple straight forward police and gangster cat and mouse or I could say hide seek game. The wow factor is the screenplay which is well crafted and characterisations are well etched. The perfect pace stands out first kept the audience thrilled and guessing till the end. Dialogues are sharp as knife and powerful as the gun shots in the movie. The BGM was rock solid which had added the feel to the play. Coming to the performances Madhavan as Vikram the protagonist a perfect police maintains his grip and emotes intensive emotions particularly when he feels he was used. Vijay Sethupathy on the other hand essays antagonist Vedha a most wanted leader of local gang pulling it off effortlessly seriously effortlessly like so much of assaultness the way he carries himself stands out unique particularly. Loved the in between short stories he threw. Both Madhavan and VJS with their exposed grey carried on their roles picture perfect. They present raw psychological thriller duo. All the other support characters were picked perfect. Varalakshmi's plays an extended cameo but stands out as well the new face lady who plays the lawyer and wife of Vikram. Subtle messages on guilt - revenge - emotions of gangster or the police were the special catch. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this Neo-Noir flick. Verdict : Don't miss it. Hats off to the team Vikram Vedha.

9,Vikram Vedha is one of the best movies of 2017 with mind blowing performances and direction.A Must Watch.,"Vikram Vedha (2017): Adapting an ancient story into film with the present world characters is not new to Indian cinema. Mani Ratnam's Thalapathy, Raavanan and Anurag Kashyap's Dev D are loosely based on Mahabharatham, Ramayana and Devdas respectively.Following the formula of these films, Pushkar Gayathri duo has made Vikram Vedha loosely based on the Vikramadityan-Bethala tale. In the original story, Bethala teaches a moral story to King Vikramadityan in each episode whenever he gets caught. Similarly gangster Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi) cleverly unmasks the real wrongdoers to the upright cop Vikram (Madhavan).Plot: A team lead by Vikram (R Madhavan), a ruthless, no-nonsense encounter cop, is on the hunt to capture/kill a dreaded gangster Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi). In this battle of good versus evil, as audiences we are left to pick a side but everything you see is not what you believe. There's always another side to everything in life and Vikram Vedha, in the most entertaining fashion, makes its viewers understand this philosophy.My Review: You know the story. We have all grown up with these characters. But how you present the same story is the question. We've had filmmakers who have tried several forms of storytelling. But re-telling a story with the same effect is perhaps the reason why Vikram Vedha stands out. Pushkar-Gayatri's version of Vikram Vedha is one such smartly-written thriller, which has a texture, well-developed character arcs and filmmaking gimmickry.Vikram Vedha is not just an ordinary adaptation but a perfect portrayal of morality conflicts.The film keeps pushing us to judge its characters, judge someone by their actions, judge someone by their upbringing and in the process proves how wrong we could be in our assumptions. The confrontation scenes between Madhavan and Vijay are easily the film's best moments as they end in fireworks.It's highly difficult not to love Vedha's character, thanks to his wisdom and never-say-die attitude.Vedha is one of the most fascinating characters written in Tamil cinema. He's smart, intelligent and extremely funny. While Vikram is naive and sort of represents the general public that easily judges one's character without knowing the entire story.Madhavan and Vijay have competed with each other in delivering intense and convincing performances but it is Vijay Sethupathi who deserves a award for sure.Cinematography by P.S.Vinod gave the movie a neo-noir look and BGM by Sam C.S. is terrific.So,Vikram Vedha is one of the best movies of 2017 with mind blowing performances and direction.A Must Watch.My rating 9/10",vikram vedha is one best movies 2017 with mind blowing performances direction must watch,vikram vedha 2017 adapting ancient story into film with present world characters is not new indian cinema mani ratnams thalapathy raavanan anurag kashyaps dev d are loosely based mahabharatham ramayana devdas respectively following formula these films pushkar gayathri duo has made vikram vedha loosely based vikramadityan bethala tale original story bethala teaches moral story king vikramadityan each episode whenever he gets caught similarly gangster vedha vijay sethupathi cleverly unmasks real wrongdoers upright cop vikram madhavan plot team lead by vikram r madhavan ruthless no nonsense encounter cop is hunt capture kill dreaded gangster vedha vijay sethupathi this battle good versus evil as audiences we are left pick side but everything you see is not what you believe theres always another side everything life vikram vedha most entertaining fashion makes its viewers understand this philosophy my review you know story we have all grown up with these characters but how you present same story is question weve had filmmakers who have tried several forms storytelling but re telling story with same effect is perhaps reason why vikram vedha stands out pushkar gayatris version vikram vedha is one such smartly written thriller which has texture well developed character arcs filmmaking gimmickry vikram vedha is not just ordinary adaptation but perfect portrayal morality conflicts film keeps pushing us judge its characters judge someone by their actions judge someone by their upbringing process proves how wrong we could be our assumptions confrontation scenes between madhavan vijay are easily films best moments as they end fireworks its highly difficult not love vedhas character thanks his wisdom never say die attitude vedha is one most fascinating characters written tamil cinema hes smart intelligent extremely funny while vikram is naive sort represents general public that easily judges ones character without knowing entire story madhavan vijay have competed with each other delivering intense convincing performances but it is vijay sethupathi who deserves award sure cinematography by p s vinod gave movie neo noir look bgm by sam c s is terrific so vikram vedha is one best movies 2017 with mind blowing performances direction must watch my rating 9 10,0.5353934047811598,0.15693626101789368,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10,Oru katha sollatta...?!,"What will happen when two star actors, who tend to give priority to stories more than their respective roles, join together in a movie...? Vikram Vedha happens...!A usual cop-criminal story, which is presented with a unique screenplay inspired by Vikramadithan-Vedhalam stories of folklore, where Vedhalam (Vijay Sethupathi) asks a tough riddle to Vikramadithan (Madhavan) to evade encounter. The movie starts with a huge difference between the characters, with Vikram - as an honest cop; and Vedha - as a ruthless gangster. The differences fades away as the movie progresses and goes through a complete karmic cycle, from evil vengeance to redemption, with the support of riddled flashback stories narrated by Vedha. The idea remotely resembles Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in a rather simpler manner. But this movie is a masterpiece of unique kind.When you find enough ingredients in the plot, setup and pace of the movie, the unexpected thrilling element that changes the entire course of the movie, at regular interval, will take you by surprise. The pace keeps you hooked and does not give you time to anticipate a twist. That's what have made this movie enjoyable to watch.No one can fit into the role of Vikram Vedha better than Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. Especially the comical arrogance of Vijay Sethupathi have created wonders on screen. Even a small character in the movie have owned the role to perfection providing a flawless performances from all sides.Yaanji song and BGM does the work it was expected to do. The movie is a rich mixture of class and entertaining elements with astonishing story and narration.

10,A movie which shows the class of South Indian Cinema,"First , I got to know about the movie from IMDB , which showed some posters for highest rated current Indian movies. Since, I got too late to the party I did not get to see the movie in theaters and after looking long and hard found the movie with eng subtitle which was great. (because I can only understand hindi and eng). About the movie, amazing acting by Madhvan as always but the 'Betaal' (Vedha) of the move is awesome. His acting is so natural, he is the highlight of the movie. Though movie never tries to give any actor/character more time or importance but the guy just shins like a diamond. I must admit, I did not know anything about the actor before this movie and after writing this I will have to look him up..Also, his character's aging process in flashbacks are awesome as well (i don't know who to praise for that).I got hooked from the first shot of the movie about Vikram & Betaal story , which i loved as a child by the way, and after 15 min in the movie you get the reason for the name.I have seen few South Indian movies before which shows the real standing of this industry compare to Hindi cinema. If Hindi cinema is to copy trends from there, I believe it should be movies like this not the ninja fighting sequence where people hit villains like hulk and they fly for 10 meters.Finally, this movie is a must watch for people who appreciate good cinema but beware ""Hero do not fly in this movie and are not as powerful as Bahubali"".",movie which shows class south indian cinema,first i got know about movie imdb which showed some posters highest rated current indian movies since i got too late party i did not get see movie theaters after looking long hard found movie with eng subtitle which was great because i can only understand hindi eng about movie amazing acting by madhvan as always but betaal vedha move is awesome his acting is so natural he is highlight movie though movie never tries give any actor character more time or importance but guy just shins like diamond i must admit i did not know anything about actor before this movie after writing this i will have look him up also his characters aging process flashbacks are awesome as well i dont know who praise that i got hooked first shot movie about vikram betaal story which i loved as child by way after 15 min movie you get reason name i have seen few south indian movies before which shows real standing this industry compare hindi cinema if hindi cinema is copy trends there i believe it should be movies like this not ninja fighting sequence where people hit villains like hulk they fly 10 meters finally this movie is must watch people who appreciate good cinema but beware hero do not fly this movie are not as powerful as bahubali,0.5899305555555557,0.2503472222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10,"Lessons to be learnt from the movie ""Vikram Vedha""","11 lessons to be learnt from the crime thriller movie ""Vikram Vedha"".1) What you do is always not right. Killed Puli without knowing whether he is a criminal or not, but rewarded him as criminal, who is actually an innocent soul.2) Don't guess things without knowing what exactly happened. Vikram guessed Simon was killed by Vedha because under Simon's order the encounter took place where Puli was shot by him.3) Don't trust anyone who is with you. Vedha and Vedha's brother was targeted to be killed by Ravi. Simon was killed by his own cop brothers. Vikram too was about to be killed by his great cop mates.4) Police are always not right. Criminals are not always wrong.5) You can't guess anyone by seeing their eyes. Vikram didn't believe when Vedha said Simon worked for Ravi. Vikram can't find out his own team mates killed Simon.6) Don't see a thing from one point of view all the time. Vikram had an imagination that Simon was killed by Chandra. But he never had a thought that even his cop friends could have done that for the sake of money.7) Not everyone who helps you is true to you. Vikram's encounter team was helping him to accomplish the task of encountering Vedha. But Vikram never knew they wanted to do this task just for money.8) A person can even act as if he is innocent just to make his job done. The new member of the team acted as if he is innocent to Vikram. In the climax when Vikram asked him to give cover, he pulled off the innocent mask and aimed the gun at Vikram itself.9) Business/work and friendship can't co-exist peacefully. Chetta ordered to kill Chandra because she tried to escape with his money. Ravi wanted to kill Vedha even while working for him.10) Don't relate your personal life with your work. Priya never helped Vikram, when he asked, he wanted to know the place of Vedha. Profession can't be compromised for personal things.11) Criminal/Police have a human heart. Vikram was keen to find Vedha and kill him in an encounter. If not in an encounter, he will escape. But, in the climax the great gangster Vedha helped the true police by saving his life. Vikram shot all his team mates in hands and legs so that they will be alive, but killed the unit head who turned all his friends to work for him.",lessons be learnt movie vikram vedha,11 lessons be learnt crime thriller movie vikram vedha 1 what you do is always not right killed puli without knowing whether he is criminal or not but rewarded him as criminal who is actually innocent soul 2 dont guess things without knowing what exactly happened vikram guessed simon was killed by vedha because under simons order encounter took place where puli was shot by him 3 dont trust anyone who is with you vedha vedhas brother was targeted be killed by ravi simon was killed by his own cop brothers vikram too was about be killed by his great cop mates 4 police are always not right criminals are not always wrong 5 you cant guess anyone by seeing their eyes vikram didnt believe when vedha said simon worked ravi vikram cant find out his own team mates killed simon 6 dont see thing one point view all time vikram had imagination that simon was killed by chandra but he never had thought that even his cop friends could have done that sake money 7 not everyone who helps you is true you vikrams encounter team was helping him accomplish task encountering vedha but vikram never knew they wanted do this task just money 8 person can even act as if he is innocent just make his job done new member team acted as if he is innocent vikram climax when vikram asked him give cover he pulled off innocent mask aimed gun at vikram itself 9 business work friendship cant co exist peacefully chetta ordered kill chandra because she tried escape with his money ravi wanted kill vedha even while working him 10 dont relate your personal life with your work priya never helped vikram when he asked he wanted know place vedha profession cant be compromised personal things 11 criminal police have human heart vikram was keen find vedha kill him encounter if not encounter he will escape but climax great gangster vedha helped true police by saving his life vikram shot all his team mates hands legs so that they will be alive but killed unit head who turned all his friends work him,0.4363217427733557,0.08550481776288228,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8,Mindblowing,"Born and brought up in Bangalore and exposed to all the four south Indian language movies from a young age, I had a special love for Tamil Cinema. While Malayalam was more art house type, Tamil was a blend of art and commercial and hence entertaining. Vikram Vedha is loosely based on popular mythology stories Vikram Betaal and I loved the way director duo Gayathri and Pushkar along with the writers adapt it for the modern day audience as a cop-gangster film where Madhavan plays Vikram the cop and Vijay Sethupathi plays Vedha the gangster.And like the Vikram Betaal stories, whenever Vikram catches Vedha, Vedha tells Vikram a story asking him what is right or wrong and then escapes after hearing Vikram's judgement.Its a beautifully layer film where none of the protagonists are black or white. They both are grey bordering between right and wrong and each has their justification for being what they are. Both hands are soaked in blood. There are enough twists and turns in the film including a brilliant one in the climax. This is writing at its best. Also, there aren't many songs which keeps the audience focused. The film technically is brilliant with excellent cinematography and back ground score.The performances are top notch. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi are brilliant in their respective roles and have a great on screen chemistry. They both compliment each other. Kathir as Vedha's brother is good and the women Shraddha and Varalaxmi are fiery in their small but important roles.A brilliant film and I hope to see a sequel to this.",mindblowing,born brought up bangalore exposed all four south indian language movies young age i had special love tamil cinema while malayalam was more art house type tamil was blend art commercial hence entertaining vikram vedha is loosely based popular mythology stories vikram betaal i loved way director duo gayathri pushkar along with writers adapt it modern day audience as cop gangster film where madhavan plays vikram cop vijay sethupathi plays vedha gangster like vikram betaal stories whenever vikram catches vedha vedha tells vikram story asking him what is right or wrong then escapes after hearing vikrams judgement its beautifully layer film where none protagonists are black or white they both are grey bordering between right wrong each has their justification being what they are both hands are soaked blood there are enough twists turns film including brilliant one climax this is writing at its best also there arent many songs which keeps audience focused film technically is brilliant with excellent cinematography back ground score performances are top notch madhavan vijay sethupathi are brilliant their respective roles have great screen chemistry they both compliment each other kathir as vedhas brother is good women shraddha varalaxmi are fiery their small but important roles brilliant film i hope see sequel this,0.5726594483947426,0.34441122602887314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10,Tired of western cinema? Check out Indian movies,"As a westerner I have grown extremely unsatisfied with the plot and charachter development in western cinema. I have been watching Indian movies and Vikram Vedha strikes a cord that misses in western cinema. It asks questions vital to our urge to rationalize the world arounf us.

It's a story that will keep you guessing as to it's outcome, and even then when it's over, one remains on the fence as to motivations and methods employed.

6,Interesting Movie but not Exceptional.,Vikram Vedha is a story happens between a criminal and a cop who is trying with his all might to catch him.The story line or script from just outset looks ordinary. But it certainly have some twists and turns with some degree of unpredictability. So the story is not really boring. People might be able to guess what is happening in the middle of the film but the granular revealings will keep the audience with suspense.Film has a 8+ ratings but it is not worth that . When we compare with different genre of 8+ films in Hollywood and Bollywood this film is overrated in that front. Because this does not bring that additional uniqueness in the story as well as acting. Majority of the Kollywood might like this spicy formula of hero and villain hence this will surely have a higher rating by the same audience.Madhavan is a good actor but Vijay Sethupathi who plays the criminal clearly out score Madhavan. Villain is doing the hard yards in this story and he has to keep a right balance between not becoming the Madhavan type hero but becoming a hero in his own right. He has done a fantastic job with his character.This film is suitable when you are ready for a action but not too 'action' bored movie.,interesting movie but not exceptional,vikram vedha is story happens between criminal cop who is trying with his all might catch him story line or script just outset looks ordinary but it certainly have some twists turns with some degree unpredictability so story is not really boring people might be able guess what is happening middle film but granular revealings will keep audience with suspense film has 8 ratings but it is not worth that when we compare with different genre 8 films hollywood bollywood this film is overrated that front because this does not bring that additional uniqueness story as well as acting majority kollywood might like this spicy formula hero villain hence this will surely have higher rating by same audience madhavan is good actor but vijay sethupathi who plays criminal clearly out score madhavan villain is doing hard yards this story he has keep right balance between not becoming madhavan type hero but becoming hero his own right he has done fantastic job with his character this film is suitable when you are ready action but not too action bored movie,0.5571291735084839,0.12709359605911327,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8,Third time's the true charm! [76%],"Pushkar-Gayathri stormed into the Tamil cinema scene with 2007's 'Oram Po' and managed to grab a fair bit of attention for their second outing 'Va Quarter Cutting'. But their third film is by far their best..in terms of writing, the magnificent amalgamation of 'class' and 'mass' elements, and in managing to tantalize the viewer as to who they should be rooting for when the thin line between protagonist and antagonist starts to blur.R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi, through their scintillating performances (especially the latter), reinstate the fact that the director-duo's casting choices for the leads haven't backfired. The ancient folklore of Vikramaditya - Vedhal serves as the backbone for the script that pitches an encounter specialist (Vikram) against a hard-bitten gangster (Vedha) and narrates the several occasions where they confront each other, producing unexpectedly explosive results.On each separate occasion of their face-off, Vedha unfolds a series of incidents (that shape his scarred past) and questions Vikram as to how he'd have acted given the same situation and leaving the audience to judge whether said bad guy here was inherently savage or was it mere circumstance that pushed him to embracing those extremes? The twist- packaging is extremely delectable; each time the viewer begins to form an opinion, the tables are turned and the layers get deeper.Kathir's entry in the second half (as Vedha's brother 'Puli') not only adds to the film's positives, but he ensures that Vedha's story gets a wholly grounded rendering, one that doesn't require to resort to cheap tricks to evoke reactions. The ladyfolk in the film - Shraddha Srinath who plays Vikram's lawyer wife Priya and Varalaxmi who plays Kathir's love interest Chandra, are solidly written characters. Vedha is a client of the former's and this often leads to professional friction between lawyer and cop, although they always comply with each other when it comes to respecting their marital bond.'Yaanji' is the hummable track in the album while the background compositions by CS Sam (in close association with Chennai Orchestra) are brilliant. The 'Tasak Tasak' song though, could have been chopped off in the edits room. Coming back to Vijay Sethupathi - he is in fact, the principal reason why the character 'Vedha' instantly clicks with the audience and stays with them long after they have left the cinema hall. His wise- cracking demeanor combined with slick looks lend a likable vibe to Vedha. No points in guessing whether its Vikram or Vedha who gets a sexier intro scene and elicits larger number of hoots and screams from the viewer. Vedha smartly plays off Vikram on most instances; kudos to Madhavan for allowing Sethupathi to flee with the ""massy"" honors.""Cop-hero and gangster-villain"" films are not novel to Indian cinema but if 'Vikram Vedha' still manages to secure from my end, the accolades of 'best Tamil flick of the year so far' and 'best-written character in a (negative) role', that indeed says a lot. 'Vikram Vedha' is a thrilling ride from the word go.Verdict: Must-watch!",third times true charm,pushkar gayathri stormed into tamil cinema scene with 2007s oram po managed grab fair bit attention their second outing va quarter cutting but their third film is by far their best terms writing magnificent amalgamation class mass elements managing tantalize viewer as who they should be rooting when thin line between protagonist antagonist starts blur r madhavan vijay sethupathi through their scintillating performances especially latter reinstate fact that director duos casting choices leads havent backfired ancient folklore vikramaditya vedhal serves as backbone script that pitches encounter specialist vikram against hard bitten gangster vedha narrates several occasions where they confront each other producing unexpectedly explosive results each separate occasion their face off vedha unfolds series incidents that shape his scarred past questions vikram as how hed have acted given same situation leaving audience judge whether said bad guy here was inherently savage or was it mere circumstance that pushed him embracing those extremes twist packaging is extremely delectable each time viewer begins form opinion tables are turned layers get deeper kathirs entry second half as vedhas brother puli not only adds films positives but he ensures that vedhas story gets wholly grounded rendering one that doesnt require resort cheap tricks evoke reactions ladyfolk film shraddha srinath who plays vikrams lawyer wife priya varalaxmi who plays kathirs love interest chandra are solidly written characters vedha is client formers this often leads professional friction between lawyer cop although they always comply with each other when it comes respecting their marital bond yaanji is hummable track album while background compositions by cs sam close association with chennai orchestra are brilliant tasak tasak song though could have been chopped off edits room coming back vijay sethupathi he is fact principal reason why character vedha instantly clicks with audience stays with them long after they have left cinema hall his wise cracking demeanor combined with slick looks lend likable vibe vedha no points guessing whether its vikram or vedha who gets sexier intro scene elicits larger number hoots screams viewer vedha smartly plays off vikram most instances kudos madhavan allowing sethupathi flee with massy honors cop hero gangster villain films are not novel indian cinema but if vikram vedha still manages secure my end accolades best tamil flick year so far best written character negative role that indeed says lot vikram vedha is thrilling ride word go verdict must watch,0.4929894179894179,0.1317989417989418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9,Beautiful script and direction. Hats off ..!,"One of the best thing happened to Kollywood after Thani Oruvan. Same punch but a great plot. Vikram and Vedha were absolutely phenomenal and casting was super cool. The main talking point of this movie is the direction. You can see some minute directorial brilliance through out the movie. Some of them were really cool. 1) When Vedha approached the police station to surrender . While walking he threw some snacks to the police dog out there. That scene was so cool which proclaims the Vedha's intention ""Yeah. I am gonna give you some thing to boost up your little mind Police dog"". That's exactly what he did to Madhavan on the following scenes.2) We can notice Madhavan's Mentaility through his T shirts. Which was white on the beginning and became grey later.There are many simple scenes throughout this movie.That's what so cool about this movie.

It's harsh. I like most of it. What I don't like is to construction in the first half. I don't like the two characters sitting across each other and the stories being recounted as recollections. It takes away some of the intensity. The interrogation room and the time jumping disrupt the momentum of the movie. I do like the mano-a-mano part and the twist of the movie.

8,Good vs Bad! Jesus vs Satan!,"There is a theological belief that says Jesus was not of flesh. Gnosticism tries to substantiate that belief and says; since Jesus was not of flesh, he didn't die in the cross. It was indeed Simon of the cyrene who got crucified for Jesus. I am not an advocate of any of these beliefs but what is enthralling is all these stories gives you questions which shakes you. If you are questioned ""If Gandhi's father was Gandhi? Or Is Godse's son a Godse?"", then you are in the never ending tale of Good vs Bad or God vs Devil. This goes on from Generation to generation. From childhood, we might have heard a lot of stories on moral values and principles. One of the intriguing things in listening all those stories is; how to attain the wisdom to decide between good vs bad. Some of the stories end with a verdict so you need not really bother about the process of deciding the evil. The ambulimama stories of Vikramadhithan-Vedaal never end with a verdict. They always question you. So, the process of judging\comprehending\concluding is left to you. Vikram-vedha gives you the same experience in big screen; of questioning yourself with few tales and lot of questions. Most importantly, you enjoy it a lot like all the granny stories. The canvas is big and you could see lot of colors. The story tellers or the grannies are enamoring and very wise to make you think. Vikram-vedha has the x-factor in it because the art of story-telling is at its finesse. Surprisingly, it is both deductive and detective. If it is an investigative story where you are searching something , it is not the object that gets found or the result you achieve it is all about the ride. It is the hermeneutics that gives you the satisfaction. There are stories that cancel themselves. A good example would be Yuvan's ""Naankavuthu Kanavu"" (Fourth dream) in Tamil. One common thing about such stories is that they switch back and forth between time. They create a world in your mind and bring you back to your senses. They question you how that world was. Then they will tell you another tale and then ask questions. Sometimes it will be tales within tales. The idea is just to engross you and present you the alternate realism. Then they will connect the dots within all these tales slowly revealing the canvass. The devil will be in the details. Exactly, what Vikram-Vedha does to you.Madhavan plays the role of Vikram. The straight as an arrow, who considers himself having the wisdom of seeing right and wrong. Its zero or one for him and so he is in peace. Enters, Vijay Sethupathi, Vedha@Vedaal, who questions Vikram's wisdom. Vikram slowly realizes that its not always black or white and truth gets hidden somewhere in between. Vijay Sethupathi scores easily. Madhavan is good but somehow reminds me of a grown-up Anbarasu of Anbe Sivam times. He is spontaneous, charming, good and straight. In many aspects, we as audience are in the world of Vikram. We associate ourselves to his character. Vedha gets him into a ride. Vedha knows the truth. He asks you tough questions. Slowly, you acknowledge that Vedha has a superior intellect. You stick out to him. You listen to him. He mocks you, burdens you sitting at your back. He bedevils you with ease and poise. Vijay Sethupathy scores easily because of his usual cool, calm way of living the character. Vijay Sethupathy easily strikes a chord because he had arrived and mastered the art of matching the traits of a character with dialogue delivery, looks and walk. Simple copybook approach. In the world of tamil cinema, where the likes of Kamalahasan doing a lot at the age of 60+ to live a character, Vijay Sethpuathy does it with real ease. May be the ease is what stands apart!Metaphors and images from folklore and mythologies are spread over the film including the title. There is this character called Simon, who just lives as gnostics' belief. He has a son named Alex. He was made to carry the cross. He is confused, he can't bear it and he can't refuse it. He just falls back to the lord. A bullet abandoned by Vikram's father, gets the much need chain sprocket from Vedha just like the clues. Vedha has a brother whom Vedha protects a lot and thus loses him. He is the crux of the story and nicknamed as pulli. A money minded kid Chandra grows up exactly as she was earlier. Vikram's wife is another tool in the tale. She plays an advocate. Advocate and cop inside same house creates lot of dilemmas in the personal and professional front.Dialogues are crisp and sharp. There are notoriously comical dialogues in Orampo. Pushkar and Gayathri the director couple are really good at dialogues. My urge to watch the film is mainly due to the dialogues of Orampo. A cop with pride says that his to be brother-in-law is an engineer. Vikram responds ""What is the pride being an engineer?"". His wife confronts him that ""in lawyer's world cops are wrong!"". Vedha says we have to cease the opportunity. For him, a cop gets a name by being a cop, but he has to do something to be a hero. He says its nauseating to have blood stains and so buys pistols. His policy is not to worry about losing an egg but to make an omelet out of it. The punch soundtrack is too good. Music at times is very loud. Screenplay stands apart and the neatly woven details gives you the embroidered image in the climax. Vikram-vedha a must watch!",good vs bad jesus vs satan,there is theological belief that says jesus was not flesh gnosticism tries substantiate that belief says since jesus was not flesh he didnt die cross it was indeed simon cyrene who got crucified jesus i am not advocate any these beliefs but what is enthralling is all these stories gives you questions which shakes you if you are questioned if gandhis father was gandhi or is godses son godse then you are never ending tale good vs bad or god vs devil this goes generation generation childhood we might have heard lot stories moral values principles one intriguing things listening all those stories is how attain wisdom decide between good vs bad some stories end with verdict so you need not really bother about process deciding evil ambulimama stories vikramadhithan vedaal never end with verdict they always question you so process judging comprehending concluding is left you vikram vedha gives you same experience big screen questioning yourself with few tales lot questions most importantly you enjoy it lot like all granny stories canvas is big you could see lot colors story tellers or grannies are enamoring very wise make you think vikram vedha has x factor it because art story telling is at its finesse surprisingly it is both deductive detective if it is investigative story where you are searching something it is not object that gets found or result you achieve it is all about ride it is hermeneutics that gives you satisfaction there are stories that cancel themselves good example would be yuvans naankavuthu kanavu fourth dream tamil one common thing about such stories is that they switch back forth between time they create world your mind bring you back your senses they question you how that world was then they will tell you another tale then ask questions sometimes it will be tales within tales idea is just engross you present you alternate realism then they will connect dots within all these tales slowly revealing canvass devil will be details exactly what vikram vedha does you madhavan plays role vikram straight as arrow who considers himself having wisdom seeing right wrong its zero or one him so he is peace enters vijay sethupathi vedha who questions vikrams wisdom vikram slowly realizes that its not always black or white truth gets hidden somewhere between vijay sethupathi scores easily madhavan is good but somehow reminds me grown up anbarasu anbe sivam times he is spontaneous charming good straight many aspects we as audience are world vikram we associate ourselves his character vedha gets him into ride vedha knows truth he asks you tough questions slowly you acknowledge that vedha has superior intellect you stick out him you listen him he mocks you burdens you sitting at your back he bedevils you with ease poise vijay sethupathy scores easily because his usual cool calm way living character vijay sethupathy easily strikes chord because he had arrived mastered art matching traits character with dialogue delivery looks walk simple copybook approach world tamil cinema where likes kamalahasan doing lot at age 60 live character vijay sethpuathy does it with real ease may be ease is what stands apart metaphors images folklore mythologies are spread over film including title there is this character called simon who just lives as gnostics belief he has son named alex he was made carry cross he is confused he cant bear it he cant refuse it he just falls back lord bullet abandoned by vikrams father gets much need chain sprocket vedha just like clues vedha has brother whom vedha protects lot thus loses him he is crux story nicknamed as pulli money minded kid chandra grows up exactly as she was earlier vikrams wife is another tool tale she plays advocate advocate cop inside same house creates lot dilemmas personal professional front dialogues are crisp sharp there are notoriously comical dialogues orampo pushkar gayathri director couple are really good at dialogues my urge watch film is mainly due dialogues orampo cop with pride says that his be brother law is engineer vikram responds what is pride being engineer his wife confronts him that lawyers world cops are wrong vedha says we have cease opportunity him cop gets name by being cop but he has do something be hero he says its nauseating have blood stains so buys pistols his policy is not worry about losing egg but make omelet out it punch soundtrack is too good music at times is very loud screenplay stands apart neatly woven details gives you embroidered image climax vikram vedha must watch,0.4550595238095238,0.10973494341915395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

6,Molecule Review: Vikram Vedha,"There's a hint of purposeful suspense in the proceedings that lead to some of the most amusing scenes in Vikram Vedha. Yet the overlong, plotholes-ridden screenplay wreaks havoc to what would have been an otherwise tight watch. This neo-noir thriller about righteousness has two people at the center of its conflict - a hard cop and a similarly hard gangster - both of whom believe that what they have done (killed people) and are doing (killing more people) is justified. It is when their philosophies chafe against each other that they realize that they may not be actually right. Watching Vikram Vedha unfold as the gangster (Vijay Sethupathi) takes his adversary (Madhavan) back to his life through three stories is highly engaging, but somewhere in the middle in an attempt to look intelligent it slips and falls on the ground flat. The convoluted story then gasps for breath so as to further surprise its expecting audience - one twist after another. The huge number of characters - who dance in the screen thanks to the non-linear narrative - help Vikram Vedha don the hat of a master thriller, but when you disassemble it down to the nail, it ends up looking like those cop-gangster stories that you have seen countless times in Tamil and Malayalam cinema. What it does differently is talk about ethics and legitimacy in the fields of law breaking and enforcement. Vikram Vedha scores more points because of the fantastic performances by Sethupathi and Medhavan, but as a film, it's just about one notch higher than average.

8,Great characters and great performances,"Without a doubt Vikram Vedha is currently one of the best Tamil movies of this year. Pros: The two main characters Vikram and Vedha were developed very good. While Vikram is an honest policeman, who is not easily readable and finds himself during the story, Vedha is a gangster, who is surprisingly relaxed and funny. I enjoyed the super performances by nearly everyone. Not only Madhavan and VSP portrayed their roles extra-ordinary. But I was surprised by many actors. In my opinion this has been the best performance by Varalaxmi Sarathkumar in her career.The theme ""crime justice"" might be attractive on it's own, but still I loved the way how Gayatri and Pushkar handled this topic on top of that. Okay: The Background Score had up and downs. In some scenes the score fits very well and sounded good. In other scenes the score only sounded good. After all, the music is memorable and catchy. Cinematography was all in all okay'sh. The contrast between happy and sad scenes was portrayed very good visually. But the lighting methods didn't fit that good to a crime thriller. In other words: in some scenes you could see way too much. Contras: The storytelling was unique, but it felt kinda forced. They made it too easy. Sometimes I felt like the story structure was completely ignored. You should watch Vikram Vedha because of an unique script, great characters and especially breathtaking performances. Don't expect too much of the psychological aspect.
