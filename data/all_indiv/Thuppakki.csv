9,Mindblowing action movie with vijay's power packed performance,"First of all hats off to A.R. Murugadoss for his wonderful direction and shaping Vijay into a new dimension and a super meaningful movie. Vijay->Vijay has given life to the character as Captain Jagdish. He looks too stylish and he has carried the movie right from the beginning till the end. He is so comfortable and he admires a lot with his stylish dialogue deliveries and peppy dance moves. Vijay has found a new avatar with this movie. Kajal->Kajal looks so cute and embarrassing. She portrayed her character very well and proved to worth her character as the female lead. She has also danced well with Vijay. Vidyut->A villain who should be in a Hollywood. Mind-blowing performance by him and the scenes between him and Vijay are the highlights. Technicians->Santosh sivan has proved his legendary work again. He has showed a pleasant mumbai to the audience. Background score is well used in the movie by Harris. Every frame is credited for its technical value. Drawbacks-> Songs should have visualized much better. Alaikaa laikaa, google google looks good.. Others doesn't found new to the viewers... The screenplay of the movie which is very racy slows down a bit after the Antarctica song. Highlight-> Vijay targeting the 12 sleeper cell with 12 men is speechless. The interval block portraying the dialogue- I'm waiting and the climax scene dialogues looks for a high standard.

Overall i'll give them a 9/10Music: The main drawback of the movie is the songs.. Songs were a big letdown expect Google Google.. many people went out during songs which were so boring.. The theme of thuppakki was very good and BGM in the climax was nice.. I ll give Harris 6/10 .Overall the movie was a treat for Vijay fans who were treated with a refreshing story.. definitely ARM has given a new life for Vijay.. only if the songs were nice the film would have been much more nice.

10,"Thuppakki: Honestly and Proudly, A Distinctive Vijay Movie Ever","Among all the 54 movies including Thuppakki, this one stands separate as the best performer. Poove Unakaga, Kadhaluku Mariyadhai, Ghilli were huge turning points in Vijay's career and set new benchmarks. And now Vijay has put himself into more trouble by raising the bar higher in Thuppakki.For second movie in a row Vijay's name came after the movie name, which in my view is good and the title cards was good, showing different places in Mumbai.A decent introduction song, Kutti Puli Kootam but the next song, Antartica came rather quickly and chilled me a lot. I never finished listening Alaika Laika song but in my view that was the best choreographed song in the movie. Google Google meets expectation, Vennilave okayyy, poi varava was heart touching.The movie flows well in first 20 mins with the regular hero heroine introduction comedies. As soon as antartica song is over, movie enters main story and rest is just THE GAME. A game with thrill, ideas, lot of smartness, team work and the Gun.Interval block amazing, Vijay's Hindi superb, stunning camera-work, enthralling background score, pacy editing, perfect climax with a touching end :)Kajal satisfies with her role, Vidyut is smart, Jayaram was too good in his comedies and Ilayathalapathy Vijay was just the best in his career, with his attitude driven performance.Undoubtedly to be the biggest hit in Vijay's Career...

7,"Vijay's best movie... which isn't saying much. But really, it's good.","This is possibly Vijay's best movie ever. If you don't know Vijay, you need to know that it's not a huge testimony up there - Vijay's movies usually set a pretty low bar, so a halfway decent movie could have gotten that tag. But Thuppakki is a very entertaining masala movie.Vijay is an army captain on holiday in Mumbai with his parents and sisters. They drag him to a prospective bride right from the train station, in his army uniform. This starts off the romantic background for the movie.But the story's crux is that Vijay is actually on a mission to track down and destroy terrorists operating in Mumbai. The fact that he directs this mission by driving around with his policeman friend and eventually stumbling onto a terrorist who bombs a bus, or that his senior officer does not seem to have a clue about this mission, does not detract from the thrill.The movie is implausible, the improvised plans are all too convenient, and we still have a grandiose element that is standard fare for masala movies. But it is entertaining from start to finish. Solid entertainer. My thumbs up to Vijay. See, Vijay? You don't HAVE to make sucky movies. Nobody expects you to make great movies, but you can use Thuppakki as a career guidance chart for yourself.",vijays best movie which isnt saying much but really its good,this is possibly vijays best movie ever if you dont know vijay you need know that its not huge testimony up there vijays movies usually set pretty low bar so halfway decent movie could have gotten that tag but thuppakki is very entertaining masala movie vijay is army captain holiday mumbai with his parents sisters they drag him prospective bride right train station his army uniform this starts off romantic background movie but storys crux is that vijay is actually mission track down destroy terrorists operating mumbai fact that he directs this mission by driving around with his policeman friend eventually stumbling onto terrorist who bombs bus or that his senior officer does not seem have clue about this mission does not detract thrill movie is implausible improvised plans are all too convenient we still have grandiose element that is standard fare masala movies but it is entertaining start finish solid entertainer my thumbs up vijay see vijay you dont have make sucky movies nobody expects you make great movies but you can use thuppakki as career guidance chart yourself,0.43964105339105336,0.22031024531024526,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10,Thupakki a racy entertainer that keeps you hooked till the end.,"Thupakki, the much awaited Vijay-murugadoss combo hit the screens yesterday and luckily I got a ticket for a early morning special screening at a local multiplex. Right from the first frame, Vijay mesmerizes the audience with his sleek looks and awesome style. A big thumbs up to his costume designer who has done the job with utmost care.The strength of the movie lies in the flawless screenplay and dialogues by murugadoss. The Cat and mouse game between the protagonist and villain has been scripted immaculately. Especially the scene before intermission and climax got electrifying response in the theater. Vijay seems more mature on the screen and his scenes involving kajal and satyan cracks up the audience. Actions sequence seems more vivid and dynamic in Santhosh sivan's camera who has once again showed the world that he has not won the national awards for nothing. Harris Jayaraj has done a commendable job with his BGM score and it makes some scenes even more striking. Songs are good and murugadoss has taken a special care in choosing the locations for it. Especially Vennilave song's backdrop is mindblowing. Though Kajal agarwall didn't have a big role to play,she along with sathyan and Jayaram provide comic relief at regular intervals. One more person who if not mention here would be unfair is editor Sreekar Prasad. He has chiseled the movie perfectly and the audience doesn't feel like a watching a movie that is almost 3hrs. Villain Vidyut Jamwal robust and does a laudable job. He has portrayed a character who is brainy and evil.On the downside the romance track between Vijay and Kajal is Clichéd. Even though songs are good, the situations they appear are not relevant. On the whole Thupakki is a racy entertainer that keeps you hooked till the end. It is one of the Vijay's best movie in the recent times. With Nanban already a hit and now along with thupakki 2012 is surely belongs to Ilayathalapathy.",thupakki racy entertainer that keeps you hooked till end,thupakki much awaited vijay murugadoss combo hit screens yesterday luckily i got ticket early morning special screening at local multiplex right first frame vijay mesmerizes audience with his sleek looks awesome style big thumbs up his costume designer who has done job with utmost care strength movie lies flawless screenplay dialogues by murugadoss cat mouse game between protagonist villain has been scripted immaculately especially scene before intermission climax got electrifying response theater vijay seems more mature screen his scenes involving kajal satyan cracks up audience actions sequence seems more vivid dynamic santhosh sivans camera who has once again showed world that he has not won national awards nothing harris jayaraj has done commendable job with his bgm score it makes some scenes even more striking songs are good murugadoss has taken special care choosing locations it especially vennilave songs backdrop is mindblowing though kajal agarwall didnt have big role play she along with sathyan jayaram provide comic relief at regular intervals one more person who if not mention here would be unfair is editor sreekar prasad he has chiseled movie perfectly audience doesnt feel like watching movie that is almost 3hrs villain vidyut jamwal robust does laudable job he has portrayed character who is brainy evil downside romance track between vijay kajal is clich d even though songs are good situations they appear are not relevant whole thupakki is racy entertainer that keeps you hooked till end it is one vijays best movie recent times with nanban already hit now along with thupakki 2012 is surely belongs ilayathalapathy,0.5565061922204778,0.2530952380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,Thuppakki: Hits the correct target!,"Movie: ThuppakkiRating: 4.5/5In Tamil cinema, two names are very popular. One is Vijay, and other is A.R. Murugadoss. As we all know, Vijay is a great actor and Murugadoss is a very a very talented and creative director. So just imagine what would happen if they come together? Can't imagine? Then just do one thing- Watch Thuppakki, you will get the answers to all your questions.Written and directed by Murugadoss, Thuppakki is one of the finest Tamil films ever. It's evident from every bit of the film's screenplay. Murugadoss has used the army concept very well and Vijay fits in it. I think that except Vijay anyone would have done this role but not with that perfection with which Vijay has done it. It's true, not just for Vijay, but for the entire film. The film scores well in every department and the occasional thrills in the film make you sit by the edge of the seat. It is the style of Murugadoss to make every scene look amazing. This thing is visible even in the intermission scene.The fights, performances, VFX and screenplay are all amazing. You don't get a chance to blink at all. After all, the focus remains only on the storyline, and nothing except it. It's a very good point. Besides, there are no scenes that would actually hinder the film's screenplay. However, it's nothing except the music, that hinders a bit. If a few songs would have been removed, the pace would have been well. But still, you forget these small blemishes and go on to watch the film.Overall, Thuppakki is a mind blowing entertainer, as well as a very different film by Vijay. If you like action thrillers and want great thrill in your movies along with some brainstorming puzzles, then watch Thuppakki. As I said before, you will get all your answers. Today it's a blockbuster, but for tomorrow, it's going to be a classic film.",thuppakki hits correct target,movie thuppakkirating 4 5 5in tamil cinema two names are very popular one is vijay other is r murugadoss as we all know vijay is great actor murugadoss is very very talented creative director so just imagine what would happen if they come together cant imagine then just do one thing watch thuppakki you will get answers all your questions written directed by murugadoss thuppakki is one finest tamil films ever its evident every bit films screenplay murugadoss has used army concept very well vijay fits it i think that except vijay anyone would have done this role but not with that perfection with which vijay has done it its true not just vijay but entire film film scores well every department occasional thrills film make you sit by edge seat it is style murugadoss make every scene look amazing this thing is visible even intermission scene fights performances vfx screenplay are all amazing you dont get chance blink at all after all focus remains only storyline nothing except it its very good point besides there are no scenes that would actually hinder films screenplay however its nothing except music that hinders bit if few songs would have been removed pace would have been well but still you forget these small blemishes go watch film overall thuppakki is mind blowing entertainer as well as very different film by vijay if you like action thrillers want great thrill your movies along with some brainstorming puzzles then watch thuppakki as i said before you will get all your answers today its blockbuster but tomorrow its going be classic film,0.5478030303030302,0.290530303030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7,Thuppakki seems to be a better Vijay film and it's worth-watching,"A.R.Murugadoss's Thuppakki is a fresh action thriller that stands tall with its strong content and racy screenplay. First of all, Vijay looks really fresh on-screen with his stylish appearance which is definitely something new to witness. A.R.Murugadoss had brought a slightly different Vijay in this action flick which depends on his screen presence and larger than life persona. Vijay looks fit and he is ready to fight the bad guys in his new form. He plays Jagadish, a military officer who is on holiday with his family. Vijay's role in Thuppakki is really different from what he used to do. We have seen Vijay being the mass hero who throws countless punch dialogue to the villain but here, Vijay doesn't do anything. While the villain threatens him, he ends the conversation with a simple ""I'm waiting"". Can you believe that? It's unusual to see Vijay underplay in such a massy role. Well, he is the same superhero that he use to be but with some different shades and mannerisms. Except for Vijay, we don't have any stronger characters who can lift the film. The villain Vidyut Jamwal is menacing at times and he is intellectually a perfect antagonist for Vijay. He is muscular and he doesn't need to speak much to create that evilness of his character. The other supporting actors are just there for some of the scenes. The background score is another electrifying element in Thuppakki. Harris Jayaraj has the right tunes to elevate Vijay's superhero character. Unfortunately, except for the popular Google google song sung by Vijay and Andrea, the other songs are just average. Coming to director A.R.Murugadoss's work, we have to say that he had presented a refreshing Vijay film after a while. The film is really interesting to watch but there are few elements that he could have easily removed from the film like the unnecessary comedy scenes because it slows down the pace of the film which is supposed to be racy. After all, Thuppakki seems to be a better Vijay film and it's worth-watching.",thuppakki seems be better vijay film its worth watching,r murugadosss thuppakki is fresh action thriller that stands tall with its strong content racy screenplay first all vijay looks really fresh screen with his stylish appearance which is definitely something new witness r murugadoss had brought slightly different vijay this action flick which depends his screen presence larger than life persona vijay looks fit he is ready fight bad guys his new form he plays jagadish military officer who is holiday with his family vijays role thuppakki is really different what he used do we have seen vijay being mass hero who throws countless punch dialogue villain but here vijay doesnt do anything while villain threatens him he ends conversation with simple im waiting can you believe that its unusual see vijay underplay such massy role well he is same superhero that he use be but with some different shades mannerisms except vijay we dont have any stronger characters who can lift film villain vidyut jamwal is menacing at times he is intellectually perfect antagonist vijay he is muscular he doesnt need speak much create that evilness his character other supporting actors are just there some scenes background score is another electrifying element thuppakki harris jayaraj has right tunes elevate vijays superhero character unfortunately except popular google google song sung by vijay andrea other songs are just average coming director r murugadosss work we have say that he had presented refreshing vijay film after while film is really interesting watch but there are few elements that he could have easily removed film like unnecessary comedy scenes because it slows down pace film which is supposed be racy after all thuppakki seems be better vijay film its worth watching,0.5112210141279907,0.11557099231517837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,An Action packed Deepavali Cracker which bursts Louder,"If you come to watch this film for Vijay or ARM or Harris or Santosh or Vidyut. The result is you will return home with an idea of Watching it again. I watched FDFS at 5:00 am in Velan theater in Nanganallur. I saw not only ardent fans but also families who came to watch this film with so much interest. Well you can see this only Vijay movies after Rajini.Now what about this ""Thuppakki""??? Is it fighting for terrorism? or Vijayism? or Patriotism?. One word for ever thing is ""Sacrifice"". Yes this film tells how an army officer would be in border or with his family, he should not back step for sacrifice. He must be alert and cautious and he must work not only with his muscle but also mind.The plot: Jagdish(Vijay) who is an Army officer returns home for a vacation to his family. But his family decides to make him get married. But he rejects Nisha(Kajal). Soon he discovers a bombing plot which makes assails whole Mumbai. Then rest of the story how he gets the leader and master mind behind this plot.Vijay with his unique style of acting excels well in this role. He has stunning physique and active gestures makes fit to the role of Secret Agent. Whether its humor,action,sentiment he delivers with ease and no doubt its one of the best performance of Vijay as all rounder in recent times. Kajal looks mesmerizing with her eyes and dance moves. She is lovable. Satyan supports well the story and his final lines on end of the movie gives kudos to whole Indian Army. Vidyut the brain of sleeper cells made huge impact with his cunning plots and problem solving skills in making quick decisions. His martial background adds extra ARM's intelligent screen play and the execution was so brilliant. We can see as he so cautious in screen play after his box office debacle Ezham arivu. Harrish music is so peppy and everything shot well with Santhosh sivan's cinematography especially ""GOOGLE GOOGLE"" and ""Kutti puli kootam"". BG score is major plus point in this film and thanks to Harrish Jayaraj.So over all this film is best of recent times and its sure winner of Deepavali.

10,Pure Bred Blockbuster,"Thuppakki the best big hero film in last say five years, best Vijay movie since Pokkiri, and better movie than ghilli and pokkiri put together. Here is why the movie works perfectly, a script not custom made for Thalapathy, thanks to ARM for first writing the script and then choosing the actor, so he has created a role which Vijay can only do because the hero is required to do just about everything crack a comedy, be cool, be stylish, fight, romance and dance all one after the other. No actor in the same stature of thalapathy can actually do dat, one has to be a pure bred commercial hero for this film, and he is the one.

8,High-octane action thriller,"Written and directed by A.R.Murugadoss, ""Thupakki"" tells us the story of an army man who takes up the mission of eradicating the sleeper cells in Mumbai. He does it almost single-handedly with style and panache, brawn and brain, Tamil movie style. A.R.Murugadoss is back to his old form dishing out an engaging story with almost racy screenplay aided by a best technical team and above all Vijay, that one man entertainment troop. Movie is not without its share of flaws and logical loopholes, as does many great makers' movies are. But what make them click is that they are masters in camouflaging these flaws by a racy narration which leaves the viewers not that much time to think while you are watching the movie. Here A.R.Murugadoss succeeds in doing the same. He flounders in the romantic portion which is marginally better than his previous very dreary ""7 am Arivu"". But there few enjoyable portions in between also.There are at least two or three ""wow!"" moments in the movie which sure would bring goose bumps in most of the viewers. Pre-interval portion is one of the best adrenaline rush scenes in recent times. Another one which warrants mentions is when Vijay emerges out of smoke after shooting one of the terrorists to save the kidnapped girls. These scenes along with the racy screenplay would ensure success. Also the heroism in this movie is not engineered but appears along the flow of the script. Dialogues are another strong point in the movie. There are many hard- hitting dialogs that extol the Indian army and the sacrifices of the army men. Also there are couple of enjoyable humorous dialogs coupled with Vijay's excellent comic timing that rocks the theater.Technically it is one of the best Vijay movies. Santhosh Sivan needs no praise for this movie is like child's play for the great man. His candid shots especially are noteworthy. Srikar Prasad's editing is another astounding aspect of the movie. It is not all racy, where there is need for the pace to slow down he does it with proficiency.Vijay is excellent in a very casual portrayal of an army man accidentally caught in a mission. His body language, Hindi and English diction, comic timing, agility in action sequences and subtle acting makes it one of the best work from him in the recent times next to ""Nanban"". Kajal Agarwal is gorgeous and dances well, though in terms of acting she has nothing much to do. Vidyut Jamwal is excellent, he is more of a Hero material than Villain though he has done a very good job here. Jayaram and Sathyan lend good support.Harris Jayaraj's background score is one of his best in recent times. It makes sure that right amount of adrenaline rush happens in the most crucial of moments in the movie. ""Google google"" and ""Kutti puli kootam"" are awesome dance numbers while ""Vennilave"" is a delectable melody. ""Antartica"" is picturized interestingly while ""Alaika laika"" has good dance movements. ""Poivarva"" is a heart-rending number rightly placed.Agreed there are few moments in the movie that slackens the flow but the larger picture satisfies the audience to a great deal. May be the songs may irritate a few, but when you have a proficient dancer like Vijay, gorgeous damsel like Kajal and above all awesome songs from Harris Jayaraj why wouldn't anyone have songs in their movies.On the whole, 2012 would be remembered as the year in which all the big stars of Tamil cinema fell by the wayside except for this one man, Vijay who has hit bull's-eye not once but twice.",high octane action thriller,written directed by r murugadoss thupakki tells us story army man who takes up mission eradicating sleeper cells mumbai he does it almost single handedly with style panache brawn brain tamil movie style r murugadoss is back his old form dishing out engaging story with almost racy screenplay aided by best technical team above all vijay that one man entertainment troop movie is not without its share flaws logical loopholes as does many great makers movies are but what make them click is that they are masters camouflaging these flaws by racy narration which leaves viewers not that much time think while you are watching movie here r murugadoss succeeds doing same he flounders romantic portion which is marginally better than his previous very dreary 7 am arivu but there few enjoyable portions between also there are at least two or three wow moments movie which sure would bring goose bumps most viewers pre interval portion is one best adrenaline rush scenes recent times another one which warrants mentions is when vijay emerges out smoke after shooting one terrorists save kidnapped girls these scenes along with racy screenplay would ensure success also heroism this movie is not engineered but appears along flow script dialogues are another strong point movie there are many hard hitting dialogs that extol indian army sacrifices army men also there are couple enjoyable humorous dialogs coupled with vijays excellent comic timing that rocks theater technically it is one best vijay movies santhosh sivan needs no praise this movie is like childs play great man his candid shots especially are noteworthy srikar prasads editing is another astounding aspect movie it is not all racy where there is need pace slow down he does it with proficiency vijay is excellent very casual portrayal army man accidentally caught mission his body language hindi english diction comic timing agility action sequences subtle acting makes it one best work him recent times next nanban kajal agarwal is gorgeous dances well though terms acting she has nothing much do vidyut jamwal is excellent he is more hero material than villain though he has done very good job here jayaram sathyan lend good support harris jayarajs background score is one his best recent times it makes sure that right amount adrenaline rush happens most crucial moments movie google google kutti puli kootam are awesome dance numbers while vennilave is delectable melody antartica is picturized interestingly while alaika laika has good dance movements poivarva is heart rending number rightly placed agreed there are few moments movie that slackens flow but larger picture satisfies audience great deal may be songs may irritate few but when you have proficient dancer like vijay gorgeous damsel like kajal above all awesome songs harris jayaraj why wouldnt anyone have songs their movies whole 2012 would be remembered as year which all big stars tamil cinema fell by wayside except this one man vijay who has hit bulls eye not once but twice,0.4669499698613622,0.315900140646976,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8,Blockbuster : an excellent stress buster!,"The movie is a completely commercial and entertaining one. Personally , I was most impressed by the looks of the heroine - Kajal Agarwal. This is the first movie I have seen of her.She has the Hollywood kind of beauty and looks very attractive all through the movie. The director has used her to mellow down the violent disturbing scenes.Vijay has done good work too and has played his part. In the tamil movie Industry, Vijay is an icon and his role is just to be Vijay and he has done that well. The music in the move is catchy and young and quite impressive. It will live on to keep the interest in the movie while the movie is in the market.The director Murugadoss had directed Ghajini which was again a huge commercial success. There are fresh plot ideas in the central thread of the movie. The first half itself offers enough content that had I had to leave the movie at half time, I would still have left happy.Violence - There is violence in the movie. Murugadoss has a penchant for violence and likes to challenge how much cold-bloodedness a hero in the movie can show. Vijay does cold brutal acts in the movie. While the viewer sits disturbed, the next scene would be a softie with the heroine that would put ice cream on top of all the burn and that has worked.The movie is written and directed by Murugadoss and is dedicated to the Indian army. The movie highlights the sacrifices that the army needs to make and does try to tell the common man that we should also be open to making some life sacrifices. While potentially far-fetched, I agree. Murugadoss , within his soft shy outlook, has a genuine heart and wants to fight injustices around and tends to get violent about it.Unfortunately, there are certain stupidities too, even for a commercial movie, there is a long fight sequence towards the end of which the villain is shown making a phone call.It is a complete entertainer and is excellent as a stress buster.",blockbuster excellent stress buster,movie is completely commercial entertaining one personally i was most impressed by looks heroine kajal agarwal this is first movie i have seen her she has hollywood kind beauty looks very attractive all through movie director has used her mellow down violent disturbing scenes vijay has done good work too has played his part tamil movie industry vijay is icon his role is just be vijay he has done that well music move is catchy young quite impressive it will live keep interest movie while movie is market director murugadoss had directed ghajini which was again huge commercial success there are fresh plot ideas central thread movie first half itself offers enough content that had i had leave movie at half time i would still have left happy violence there is violence movie murugadoss has penchant violence likes challenge how much cold bloodedness hero movie can show vijay does cold brutal acts movie while viewer sits disturbed next scene would be softie with heroine that would put ice cream top all burn that has worked movie is written directed by murugadoss is dedicated indian army movie highlights sacrifices that army needs make does try tell common man that we should also be open making some life sacrifices while potentially far fetched i agree murugadoss within his soft shy outlook has genuine heart wants fight injustices around tends get violent about it unfortunately there are certain stupidities too even commercial movie there is long fight sequence towards end which villain is shown making phone call it is complete entertainer is excellent as stress buster,0.541708882134414,0.11780341408000981,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
