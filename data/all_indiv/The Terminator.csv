10.0,This is the movie that made a big break through for sci-fi movies!!!!,"The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10",this is movie that made big break through sci fi movies,terminator is one those films that no matter if youve seen it or not youve heard it heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it this is movie that blasted then new comers arnold schwartzeneggerrs career made james cameron name hollywood gave new meaning possible dark future that gave us nightmares i remember first time i saw this movie i was just 8 years old my dad course walks saying cover my eyes at every bad scene with violence or nudity needless say about 70 movie he covered my eyes finally i got see it with my mom i was love this wasnt just action movie though it is one best it had story think this was all based upon just quick nightmare that james cameron had he didnt have much money but he had good script great crew his side make one cinemas greatest movies all time two men appear los angeles separate locations manifesting sudden blinding flash storms electricity one is heavily muscular other man slim wiry mysterious muscular man obtains weapons begins hunting down all women named sarah connor using phone book track his targets he successfully kills first two three listed women when he attempts kill last sarah connor he is stopped by other man kyle reese who has been sent back time protect her while hiding parking garage reese explains that man hunting sarah is actually cyborg assassin called terminator built by skynet artificial intelligence network created by cyberdyne systems near future reese explains skynet gained self awareness initiated global takeover military hardware launched nuclear war against humanity skynet ordered that scant number humans were be kept alive order be used as slave labor john connor sarahs son rallied few remaining humans led resistance movement against machines after grinding campaign human resistance was verge victory last ditch effort skynet sent terminator back time kill sarah before john was born preventing resistance ever being founded allowing machines win by default reese volunteered follow terminator back time protect sarah after his use time transportation equipment it was be destroyed by resistance order prevent further terminators going back time terminator feels no pain has no emotions will stop at nothing accomplish its mission terminator is personally one my favorite movies all time i think because this movie really is something special yeah effects are very 80s but time even this day i think special effects are much better than cgi crud we get todays cinema this has everything action romance horror sci fi even some dark humor reason why arnolds ill be back is so famous is not just because his accent but because you knew that something bad was coming kyle reeses come with me if you want live is classic as well if you havent seen terminator i highly recommend this movie its incredible one that is sure deliver entertainment fullest this is one greatest movies all time im sure that you will not be disappointed if you are get cat scan 10 10,0.4628151450539511,0.11160926966897117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,The best of the best in its genre...,"Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" In ""The Terminator,"" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. ""It can't be bargained with, it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!"" Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, ""I'll be back,"" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don't worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in ""The Terminator."" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition ""T2"" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the ""Terminator 2"" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. ""No, no, that won't work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around..."" etc. The point is, he's a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.Some people say ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" is better than the original. It's hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view ""The Terminator"" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view ""Judgment Day"" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it's still the same, too.) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On ""T2"" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, ""The Terminator"" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see ""T2."" They're both excellent films.""The Terminator"" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, ""The Terminator"" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.",best best its genre,rarely has film so frightened audience as terminator after its release 1984 extremely low budget sci fi actioner broke box office records gave audiences something more fear through years there have been stories natures beasts creatures another world so so forth jaws was terrifying because it seemed so possible if jaws is terrifying terminator is horrific realization this hit man machine dawned everyone watching film time exceeding technology how long will it be before man is overtaken by very things he created that is what is particularly scary about film like terminator terminator arnold plays cyborg cyberdyne system model 101 t800 whatever that means he has been sent back time assassinate soon be mother future world leader john connor who battles machines future leads uprising if connor is killed then there will be no one oppose machines future they will triumph this would be pretty bad so future john connor has sent protector back time help save his mother kyle reese michael biehn tells sarah connor linda hamilton about machine that is trying kill her it cant be bargained with it cant feel pain or mercy it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead talk about bad day terminator hunts them down time after time including famous police station scene where arnie says ill be back returns moments later crashing through wall car he then takes whole squad cops but dont worry sarah reese escape slightly unscathed there are countless classic scenes terminator you will see them spoofed your entire life image terminator lines they speak scenes they act out everything is spoofed film is worthy its fame special edition t2 dvd second one there is set documentary making terminator 2 3 d ride at universal studios as camera moves around it shows cameron detailing what he wants this scene some guy suggests something else cameron gets tone no no that wont work you do it like this we come off here he walks around etc point is hes perfectionist demanding director some directors are bit too easy dont really care where their films are going but james cameron seems have clear vision what he wants he goes around making sure it gets done exactly way he wants it be done it shows his work its hard find any mistakes james cameron film its even harder find plot holes some people say terminator 2 judgment day is better than original its hard choose because two films are very different i view terminator as more deep intellectually consuming dark thriller i view judgment day as action film with more or less recycled plot plot is still good but its still same too its hard choose favorite because they are so different t2 budget is ten times larger probably even more than that but if you want horror thriller terminator is better you if you want special effects really fun time see t2 theyre both excellent films terminator is great movie it is one my favorites it is terrifying horrifying 100 entertaining unlike lot other cheap actioners out there terminator has some thought put into its plot that is what separates it rest its kind,0.4778561382358852,0.07637633112316655,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Nice night for a walk.,"Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold? For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man. His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine. It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge. People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film. And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it. First I have to mention Michael Biehn. He has the real starring role. He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience. He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why. It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right. But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him. Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again. "" That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing. Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films. And they are so passionate with what they have to say. I like it when a film has something to say. I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film. One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken. Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular. Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it. And he adds spark to any film that he's in. Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.",nice night walk,is there better person play cyborg than arnold this movie he was massively built oak tree man his strange accent makes perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine its almost like his voice is computer read out which i guess it is one sense terminator is one those films that started something huge people didnt realize it at time but careers arnold cameron perhaps even guys like micahel biehn lance henriksen even bill paxton were substantially started because this film cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all them substantial roles his next film aliens as we all know what story is ill just tell you bit about what is so fascinating about it first i have mention michael biehn he has real starring role he is character that has explain everything audience he has explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening why it is not easy job do something like that still come off looking all right but biehn is simply awesome this film microcosm his performance can be seen when sara bites him biehn kyle reese replies terminators dont feel pain i do dont do that again that is such great line delivered with perfect expression perfect tone perfect timing biehn is perfect role this is also first film that i saw as youngster that ever warned me dangers nuclear war rapid advancements machinery perhaps i was too young naive fully understand all that james cameron was trying say but now that i am older i can honestly say that two terminators are perfect anti nuke films they are so passionate with what they have say i like it when film has something say i enjoy being entertained process but if you can manage both then you have masterpiece this is masterpiece finally there are two other reasons enjoy this film one this is first film where ill be back was spoken now it is part arnolds vernacular secondly bill paxton is it he adds spark any film that hes especially here as idiot punk leader that really gets hell beat out him he has some great lines great film,0.6563041125541125,0.2809253246753246,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,A fantastic SC-FI action thriller!,"""The Terminator"" is an incredible and fun Action/Sci-Fi movie of 1984. ""The Terminator's"" plot is that a cyborg a.k.a. ""The Terminator"" portrayed by ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" time travels from 2029 back to 1984 to murder ""Sarah Connor"" portrayed by ""Linda Hamilton"". A savior named ""Kyle Reece"" portrayed by ""Michael Biehn"" also time travels back to 1984 to save ""Sarah Connor"". The plot is simple yet incredible. There is neither plot holes nor unanswered questions after watching ""The Terminator"". The acting in this movie is perfect ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" was born to play the role of ""The Terminator"". And the one-liner that was repeated over and over again ""I'll be back"". ""Michael Biehn"" was amazing playing the role of ""Kyle Reece"". The music in this movie is thrilling to listen to; the climax of the film is incredible thanks to the stunning music composed by ""Brad Fiedel"". ""James Cameron"" did an amazing job at directing this movie, and he was great at filming the movie, there are one or two scenes that could've been shot better but only one or two. The special effects in this movie are superb for 1984 for example the scene where the terminator drives the car into the police station. There is one scene that is very bad, this is the scene where the terminator's eye is damaged and he cuts he eye out this scene is bad. If you are a person who enjoys 1980's Sci-Fi/Action films then you should definitely watch ""The Terminator"" as it is an exciting and incredible movie. The only issues are the eyeball cutting out scene, one or two scenes shot better and the dialogue been a little less of it repeating itself. I give ""The Terminator"" a 10/10.",fantastic sc fi action thriller,terminator is incredible fun action sci fi movie 1984 terminators plot is that cyborg k terminator portrayed by arnold schwarzenegger time travels 2029 back 1984 murder sarah connor portrayed by linda hamilton savior named kyle reece portrayed by michael biehn also time travels back 1984 save sarah connor plot is simple yet incredible there is neither plot holes nor unanswered questions after watching terminator acting this movie is perfect arnold schwarzenegger was born play role terminator one liner that was repeated over over again ill be back michael biehn was amazing playing role kyle reece music this movie is thrilling listen climax film is incredible thanks stunning music composed by brad fiedel james cameron did amazing job at directing this movie he was great at filming movie there are one or two scenes that couldve been shot better but only one or two special effects this movie are superb 1984 example scene where terminator drives car into police station there is one scene that is very bad this is scene where terminators eye is damaged he cuts he eye out this scene is bad if you are person who enjoys 1980s sci fi action films then you should definitely watch terminator as it is exciting incredible movie only issues are eyeball cutting out scene one or two scenes shot better dialogue been little less it repeating itself i give terminator 10 10,0.5882936507936507,0.2234160052910053,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time,"The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! ""This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay  and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film.

10.0,"The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.","Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",terminator has heart cameron might be well advised less is more,many people look back at films james cameron suggest that smaller budget tighter limitations better end product films like avatar titanic true lies had huge budgets drew even bigger box office but many still yearn cameron that gave us terminator aliens which were huge movies but packed far bigger punch artistically my feelings all these years are that cameron has earned right make those huge movies but i have admit preferring his earlier body work terminator is nightmarish time travelling science fiction film told at breakneck pace delivered with confidence style film has very gritty underground look it does great job telling its story amid frenetic action there is also huge slice horror suspense thrown impression that has diminished years since its release due inferior sequels viewed as standalone piece however terminator is fine piece work director with very clear vision everyone knows that terminator is film that gave us arnold schwarzenegger but when i look back at film it has heart its michael biehn character kyle reese that provides it artistically speaking cameron might be well advised that less is more,0.5237454212454212,0.22400183150183148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,"Arnie is cool as the bad guy, in this classic 80's action film!","It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease. The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film. There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it, I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent, but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come, a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of 'I'll be back'!Rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10",arnie is cool as bad guy this classic 80s action film,it was funny read that this film nearly avoided coming our screens with many number studios rejecting script story terminator was nearly terminated before getting ground however one company orion pictures last resort this movie loved premise robot running around as man trying kill mother savior planet earth thank goodness they saw that it was good script because it become one great films 1980s 2029 giant super computers dominate planet hell bent exterminating human race destroy mans future by changing past they send indestructible cyborg terminator back time kill sarah connor woman whos unborn son will become mankinds only hope can sarah protect herself this unstoppable menace save life her unborn child or will human race be extinguished by one mean hunk mutant metal well this film is real blast cast is extraordinary this is probably arnold schwarzeneggers most popular role i cannot see why it isnt he was great as cyborg that was walking around as killing machine his facial expressions are sketched my memory life i love scene where see close his face police car it was brilliant schwarzenegger originally body builder he has had wonderful career movie industry his other great films include predator end days total recall eraser was impressive his role as mr freeze batman robin his career was hold sometime while back due injury but he is back i hope we get see more his acting talents then you have others cast other stand out this film me is linda hamilton she was suited perfectly role feeble sarah connor who is going be mother child who is going save world hamilton has had mixed career with her filmography including enjoyable dantes peak good guy terminator was michael biehn who played out role sarah connors protector reese kyle he was very good his role his other movies include aliens rock crash uncredited role great musical grease director terminator namely james cameron did great job with this film considering he thought up idea sick bed had it rejected that many times it is great credit him most directors would have given up it but he stuck with it till he got our screens thank goodness he did story terminator is interesting one it has very biblical feel it one man sent help save world with initials j c fascinated me immensely cameron co writer gale anne hurd did fantastic script this film there are some unbelievable scenes this movie none more so then vision we see metal cyborg walking truck fire vision we see this scene is one main reasons why we have terminator james cameron explained that he wanted scene movie that has machine walking fire menacing fashion he got this spot if you ask me then there are some other great scenes such as tense stand offs that evil cyborg has with all humans he comes into contact with including first confrontation with sarah addition meeting he has with reese i also enjoyed scene where he goes through police station course this scene has one hollywoods most famous lines it that arnies ill be back classic final confrontation between sarah cyborg is another tension filled scene this great movie so what more can i say about this movie it is simply brilliant i have asked many people their opinion this film one such response about it was that is too eightish that comment is fair enough if you have chance grab copy terminator dvd as it is great 2 disc set i must admit first time i saw it i did not appreciate terminator like i do now perhaps i found it tad violent but that is be expected film that is called terminator this movie was great success deserved be with all great work that was put into it however more was come film that was become one greatest sequels movie history arnie was deliver his promise ill be back rating 4 5 stars or 9 10,0.5735205853174604,0.2402765376984127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,One of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...,"In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gortthe prototype, Michael Rennie suggests, for a global police force... Similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out of space-ships ever since...In ""Devil Girl from Mars,"" the giant refrigerator robot Chai hunts for virile Scotsmen and find John Laurie, while in 'Target Earth,' the Venusian robots imitate Gort in projecting rays from their heads but take the idea a step further and make the rays lethal... In Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie... But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.' His 'Terminator' is a systematic metal, 'surrounded by living tissue,' an invulnerable cyborg, part man, part machine, with whom 'it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.' The film opens with two naked men appearing in two different parts of Los Angeles' darkened streets... One is tall and powerfully built, the other is compact and muscular... Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor...Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the 'killer cyborg' who 'looks like Death rendered in steel.' He has searched the phone book and brutally shot to death other unfortunate women who bear the same name... He is sent back from the future to present-day (1984) to kill the mother of an unborn enemy... Schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like a panther, scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings, and in a perfect simulation of voice, he is on the track of his victim... He examines his weapons with precise movements, drives expressionlessly, and kills without pity, or remorse, or fear... It is a role that suits his talent perfectly... Michael Biehn seems scared by traumas of others wars... His face outlines a long burn scar... He tries to stop Schwarzenegger's attempts to be carried out... He is sinister in his long coat... His whole life has been combat... He identifies himself as Reese, a soldier from the future, assigned to protect Sarah at all costs... For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend... We feel his pain and anguish when he said: 'That terminator is out there. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!' Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed... She feels a blind panic boiling up within her, a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine... She is in a daze, paralyzed, shivering silently, uncontrollably... Her fragile personality disguises a hidden force she did't know she had...Cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...",one most breathtaking modern action science fiction films,one most intelligent unhesitating science fiction films 1950s robert wise equipped day earth stood still with technical marvels chief among them huge robot gort prototype michael rennie suggests global police force similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out space ships ever since devil girl mars giant refrigerator robot chai hunts virile scotsmen find john laurie while target earth venusian robots imitate gort projecting rays their heads but take idea step further make rays lethal stanley kubricks mythological documentary hal 9000 computer is most human character movie but james camerons breakthrough feature there is indeed storm coming his terminator is systematic metal surrounded by living tissue invulnerable cyborg part man part machine with whom it cant be bargained with it cant be reasoned with film opens with two naked men appearing two different parts los angeles darkened streets one is tall powerfully built other is compact muscular both men seek same person small delicate blond woman by name sarah connor arnold schwarzenegger is terrifying as killer cyborg who looks like death rendered steel he has searched phone book brutally shot death other unfortunate women who bear same name he is sent back future present day 1984 kill mother unborn enemy schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like panther scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings perfect simulation voice he is track his victim he examines his weapons with precise movements drives expressionlessly kills without pity or remorse or fear it is role that suits his talent perfectly michael biehn seems scared by traumas others wars his face outlines long burn scar he tries stop schwarzeneggers attempts be carried out he is sinister his long coat his whole life has been combat he identifies himself as reese soldier future assigned protect sarah at all costs him it is honor chance meet legend we feel his pain anguish when he said that terminator is out there it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead linda hamilton is quiet convincing as strong innocent prey targeted termination momentarily disoriented vaguely disturbed she feels blind panic boiling up within her lightning blot terror greater than she could ever imagine she is daze paralyzed shivering silently uncontrollably her fragile personality disguises hidden force she didt know she had cameron makes successful move behind lens one most breathtaking modern action science fiction films,0.5131720430107526,0.10591397849462365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,Compelling science fiction,"For the gift of `Aliens' and `The Terminator' I am willing to forgive Cameron's `Titanic'. The key plot concept is beautifully simple - machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother, thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat. One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.`The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle, with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer, and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines, including the infamous `I'll be back' are all well judged and timed, and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features, he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's `Aliens' - the human tough guy: he's got the fight, but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional - they tend to come out in the same tone of voice - he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the woman-thrown-into-chaos, somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in `Alien', although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are, for an action science fiction, above average and so never distract.It's the script, with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes, there's a certain amount of corniness - the `we loved a life time' element for example - but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and, through its passion, will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie - rarely do we see daylight, and, when we do, it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes, helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score (including a fantastic brooding credit sequence). Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of `Attack of the Clones' and `The Fellowship of the Ring', but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability, intertwined with hope, permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.`The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts, and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise, a script that mostly delivers, characters you can enjoy, and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 8/10.",compelling science fiction,gift aliens terminator i am willing forgive camerons titanic key plot concept is beautifully simple machines take over earth future machines are eventually over thrown by one man machines travel back time kill mans mother thus preventing him being born stopping their own defeat one human also travels back stop machines killing his leaders mother terminator is classic good versus evil struggle with little way greys clouding issue terminator is unstoppable brutal remorseless killer it perfectly suits arnold schwarzeneggers limited acting abilities his few lines including infamous ill be back are all well judged timed give great feeling precision inhumanity his character coupled with his chiselled features hes best choice role michael biehn is playing character type that hed reprise two years later camerons aliens human tough guy hes got fight but still ability love care people his features are well chosen this although his delivery lines is hardly exceptional they tend come out same tone voice hes able carry his part linda hamilton is woman thrown into chaos somewhat reminiscent sigourney weavers ripley character alien although hamilton doesnt have weavers strength presence all actors are action science fiction above average so never distract its script with camerons force behind it that lifts movie mediocrity yes theres certain amount corniness we loved life time element example but movie has real sense conviction present movie believes itself through its passion will make you believe too theres general sense darkness movie rarely do we see daylight when we do its often soft light dawn theres nice sense tension action scenes helped not only by camerons camera work but also by excellent electronic score including fantastic brooding credit sequence sure some sfx look clunky these days attack clones fellowship ring but they still work theres certain sense inevitability intertwined with hope permeating picture that creates mood i particularly enjoyed thats harder find current crop science fiction movies terminator is not perfect picture movie lags some parts romance element is fairly contrived despite all that movie brims with energy promise script that mostly delivers characters you can enjoy ultimate arnie role well worth catching 8 10,0.5315604198668714,0.1264368919610855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,"An excellent film, highly original","Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).The Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line ""I'll be back"" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).This is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, it is very well paced and never gets boring, and if you have the time, watch T2 right after this.",excellent film highly original,terminator is extremely low budget movie fact just about everything used it didnt cost much at all but it is very effective movie back 70s 80s movies could be very low budget but still be great think john carpenters halloween terminator is story about how nuclear war causes end mankind end result could be start even greater tragedy than war its self entire message terminator is anti nuclear war message many people think that few parts beginning movie are just some random things thrown i can understand why but these seemingly random scenes actually do have lot do with story arnold does great job as cyborg who is programmed kill without mercy or remorse those who dont know this is movie where line ill be back was spoken other actors do good job this linda hamilton made great choice doing this movie she really improved her career through it movie she made before this was horrible children corn this is better than terminator 2 which is still great by way because this movie has more story is more involved i would recommend watching this movie at any time it is very well paced never gets boring if you have time watch t2 right after this,0.5325238095238095,0.18719047619047618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever!,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time.This is the one that started it all! Arnold is excellent in it! Linda Hamilton was great! Michael Biehn was very good as the good guy! Paul Winfield was good! Lance Hendrickson played a different character! In their short roles Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were cool! Look for Dick Miller! The acting by the cast is very good! The action scenes are very exciting with lots of gun fire and the special effects are awesome! The music is great! Out of the three Terminator films it is hard to decide which is the best but this one is damn good! In fact its one of the best movies ever! I strongly recommend anyone who loves Arnold and the other cast members I mentioned and especially if you love action, sci-fi, or even horror movies to not rent but buy this classic! I recommend The Terminator!Movie Nuttball's NOTES:There is one scene that I really like in the Terminator! It is when Sarah Connor is at the dance club. What I love about it is the song and the excellent slow motion camera. Its when Sarah drops something, she goes to pick it up and while she is bending over The Terminator comes walking through the dance floor! Its a classic moment!Bill Paxton has been a part of three huge franchises! Being The Terminator as The Punk Leader, Aliens as Pvt. W. Hudson, and Predator 2 as Jerry Lambert! Lance Hendrickson has had a similar way of being in epics like Paxton being in The Terminator as Detective Vukovich, in Aliens as Bishop, Alien 3 as Bishop II, and as Charles Weyland in the upcoming 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator! Hendrickson, believe it or not was the original choice to play The Terminator! It is so amazing about this!By Paxton and Hendrickson being in these films and that Alien Vs. Predator is finally going to invade the theaters in 2004 could it be that this has happened for a reason? The reason possibly being this: In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers and/or directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!",terminator is one greatest films ever,this is one great movies 80s my collection that i think about all time this is one that started it all arnold is excellent it linda hamilton was great michael biehn was very good as good guy paul winfield was good lance hendrickson played different character their short roles bill paxton brian thompson were cool look dick miller acting by cast is very good action scenes are very exciting with lots gun fire special effects are awesome music is great out three terminator films it is hard decide which is best but this one is damn good fact its one best movies ever i strongly recommend anyone who loves arnold other cast members i mentioned especially if you love action sci fi or even horror movies not rent but buy this classic i recommend terminator movie nuttballs notes there is one scene that i really like terminator it is when sarah connor is at dance club what i love about it is song excellent slow motion camera its when sarah drops something she goes pick it up while she is bending over terminator comes walking through dance floor its classic moment bill paxton has been part three huge franchises being terminator as punk leader aliens as pvt w hudson predator 2 as jerry lambert lance hendrickson has had similar way being epics like paxton being terminator as detective vukovich aliens as bishop alien 3 as bishop ii as charles weyland upcoming 2004 movie alien vs predator hendrickson believe it or not was original choice play terminator it is so amazing about this by paxton hendrickson being these films that alien vs predator is finally going invade theaters 2004 could it be that this has happened reason reason possibly being this great dark horse comic books there are many editions alien vs predator edition alien vs predator vs terminator what i am saying is could this mean that alien vs predator vs terminator will be made into huge motion picture or alien vs terminator or even predator vs terminator movie future its just thought but what if i am sure some writers or directors have talked about these subjects i am also sure big fans these films terminator would love watch these icons battle it out,0.6224114229024941,0.31213647959183666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Review of the Special Edition DVD,"I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",review special edition dvd,ive reviewed this classic movie before but now im gonna review dvd start i must say that although they had their rationale deleting terminated scenes as they were called i think they definitely should have left that one scene where sarah connor calls her mom tells her hide cabin where she finds listing cyberdyne corp phone book this scene established sarah as one who is willing try take matters into her hands stop nuclear war horrible future she talks reese about getting rid cyberdyne they get into arguement about whether or not that is mission objective reese ends up chasing sarah into wooded area i think beauty woods flowers waterfalls was important too because reese starts crying saying how all this is destroyed future is nothing but blackened charred ruins littered with skulls attempted human genocide what terrific powerful scene i adore michael biehn i didnt realize what great actor crier he is maybe other terminated scenes were okay delete although they were all delightful one where sarah practices her wholesome waitress routine was cute one where she talks about disneyland hot dogs might have seemed silly but it really brought home how foreign our world is reese as did crying scene tickling scene might have seemed silly editor but i thought it really made point after all violence bleakness reese lived through be with woman hes always loved idolized lay cozy warm bed with her experiencing simple joys life first time i still wonder if sarah devirginized him since he said hed never had any special someone his life seemed bring everything into perspective scene where you discover that factory was cyberdyne systems was important too but ill let these scenes slide i really think they should consider releasing terminator with scene wooded area included nevertheless i still consider this film as one my favorite sci fi films my favorite james cameron film i still admire who he infuses humanity with action adrenaline missing scenes were wonderful,0.5695121951219513,0.14221835075493613,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga,"The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.Now to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic. The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement. The last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) ""I'll be back."" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.In the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing.

10.0,A beloved favourite of mine,"Widely regarded as something of a classic in the realms of science fiction and action films, I think that this film is an underrated horror film and may be in fact one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, due to the fact that I had a fascination for it as a child. Director James Cameron, better known to modern audiences for his bloated epic TITANIC, truly succeeded in creating a classic film, one which I would watch many times over his later, waterlogged dreck. THE TERMINATOR was a hugely popular hit and created a new movie monster, the big, silent, hulking figure of Arnold Schwarzenegger in what I believe to be his best role as an unstoppable killer. The fact that the monster is human - and thus able to hide amid fellow humans - is relatively original (depends on who you speak to, but acknowledgement definitely goes to Harlan Ellison) and his sheer indestructibility is really awe-inspiring.All of the different factors work in this film. The score is unforgettable, a thumping, deadly beat which turns up whenever the Terminator is on screen, and it sends chills down your spine (much like the music for THE OMEN). The film portrays Los Angeles as a dark, dirty, bleak city to live in and the film reflects this. It has a gritty feeling much like the earlier classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the little touches, such as the Terminator's infra red vision, are chilling.The actors in this film all give brilliant portrayals and are totally realistic, many of them have since gone on to greater things. Schwarzenegger emerged as an action movie star after this film put him on the map and has since become phenomenally successful, with a string of hits in his belt. Biehn has also kept in the movie business but hasn't found many hits like this one, apart from Cameron's 1986 smash, ALIENS. Hamilton has also gone on to bigger-budgeted things like DANTE'S PEAK and her portrayal of Connor as an unsuspecting woman caught up in the violence is a performance which brings real depth to the character. She turned this around in the sequel where Connor became a lean, lithe killer out for survival. Paul Winfield is great as the hard but kind cop, and Lance Henricksen, who was originally considered for the role of the Terminator, makes the best of his small role. Earl Boen is also memorable as the laconic psychiatrist. Roger Corman regular Dick Miller puts in a welcome cameo appearance as the ill-fated gun store owner, while Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson appear in early roles in their careers.This film is also surprisingly gory for a mainstream movie. One scene, in which the Terminator rips out his own eye, parallels the ultra-violence popular in Fulci movies. People are repeatedly and violently shot and mutilated. To keep things moving along there is a ton of action in the film, with hundreds of bullets flying everywhere and numerous car chases. The only spot where things let up is near the end where Reese and Sarah hide out in first a tunnel and then a motel. This section of the film tends to veer into mild tedium and is the only part where Cameron could have done better.The film has many classic, totally brilliant moments. One of these is the Tech Noir scene, which builds up suspense carefully before exploding into violent carnage. It's a nightmarish and completely effective moment, with the music slowing down, people dancing in slow motion. Another scene is the one where the police station is single-handedly destroyed by the Terminator, this shows how unstoppable he is and is again very violent and effective. The final future 'dream' sequence in which the dying, diseased survivors are killed by another machine is also brutally effective and very moving. Other memorable moments are the scene where the metal Terminator rises from the flames, which is almost Biblical, and the entire fight in the factory, which is basic human vs. machine action, where the Terminator keeps coming back time after time before being finally crushed to death.Cameron returned with a successful sequel in 1991, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. The film contained then state of the art CGI effects in the ""morphing"" T-100 terminator, and signalled the return of Schwarzenegger and Hamilton (and also Reese in the Director's Cut). Although the film contained a lot of action and violence, it was not as effective and horrifying as it was basically a string of action scenes one after the other, and more designed to show off special effects work instead of telling a story. However the sequel is still hugely enjoyable and well worth seeing if you liked this one.Overall, THE TERMINATOR is a true classic in the realms of killer robot movies, the best one ever made in my opinion. It also clearly shows how science fiction and horror can be mingled together to form a pleasing whole. An excellent film for those of us who like action as well as horror, it's got everything you could ever want: time travel, gun battles, car chases, fights, gore, explosions, fire, melodrama, romance, an excellent score, and true gut wrenching horror.

10.0,"Bold, Gritty, and Realistic","The 1984 classic, an astounding production. One of Cameron's early works, and yet one of his best. The ultimate thing that puts this film on a whole another level above so many other flops is the awesome blend of realism and atmosphere. When I first saw it as a kid, it just felt so real to me. And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also did extraordinarily so, just putting the right amount of emotional touches to their performances. Its an involving film throughout that never fails to hit hard, even in light of some terrible and CGI loaded sequels. And who could forget the score, which only added to the already excellent tension. My favorite scene? No doubt, in a disturbing way, the scene where the T-101 is repairing itself, and the lighting is just so perfect gives off a feeling of absolute fear. Or perhaps the scene in the club where Reese first engages the Terminator, either way ingenious and unforgettable moments in film history.A classic in every way.",bold gritty realistic,1984 classic astounding production one camerons early works yet one his best ultimate thing that puts this film whole another level above so many other flops is awesome blend realism atmosphere when i first saw it as kid it just felt so real me now ten years later t that feeling hasnt left me using his camera way only he can do cameron instills sense dread every scene something good old arnold did quite well michael biehn linda hamilton also did extraordinarily so just putting right amount emotional touches their performances its involving film throughout that never fails hit hard even light some terrible cgi loaded sequels who could forget score which only added already excellent tension my favorite scene no doubt disturbing way scene where t 101 is repairing itself lighting is just so perfect gives off feeling absolute fear or perhaps scene club where reese first engages terminator either way ingenious unforgettable moments film history classic every way,0.5855889724310777,0.23909774436090225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

They are on the verge of destroying SkyNet when it sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill John Conner's mother. Connor sends soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the killer machine.This is director James Cameron's first at bat, and he hits it out of the park. It is near perfection that started a franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting during his deliveries really helped. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He is the perfect terminator. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It is a sci-fi horror that doesn't let go.

10.0,"The best of the best movies ever on the planet, galaxy & the entire universe","The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the story-line is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally & psychologically thrilling and made so dark & sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of $6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are:1. When the terminator killed Ginger & her boyfriend.2. Shootout at the nightclub (A classic scene in film history).3. Self surgery on his wrist & eye.4. Shootout at the police station.5. When the terminator was driving the lorry.6. When he unexpectedly rose from the fire as an endoskeleton after that it was a nail biting experience to the end.The line ""I'll be back"" is simply the best quote for any film because the audience never expected his position of coming back. Although it is on the IMDb top 250 but it should have been No 1 top place because I have never seen a better movie than this. I've seen it about 100 times and I'm still not fed up. The Terminator gave me the passion about films and my verdict is 1000, 000/10. It's nearly about 25 years old and people still watch it. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street & Predator, the list is endless. Anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be a better film than The Terminator.",best best movies ever planet galaxy entire universe,terminator simply has be my number 1 favourite movie all time when first time i saw film i fell love with it about 15 years ago truly original idea story line is amazing about cyborg is sent future deadly mission he has kill sarah connor young woman whose life will have great significance years come sarah has only one protector kyle reese also sent future terminator uses his exceptional intelligence strength find sarah movie was emotionally psychologically thrilling made so dark sinister that give tensive mood film well made 80s film i was surprised when i heard that it made with budget 6 4 million because it looks more expensive e g nuclear war los angeles 2029 i loved every second it best scenes are 1 when terminator killed ginger her boyfriend 2 shootout at nightclub classic scene film history 3 self surgery his wrist eye 4 shootout at police station 5 when terminator was driving lorry 6 when he unexpectedly rose fire as endoskeleton after that it was nail biting experience end line ill be back is simply best quote any film because audience never expected his position coming back although it is imdb top 250 but it should have been no 1 top place because i have never seen better movie than this ive seen it about 100 times im still not fed up terminator gave me passion about films my verdict is 1000 000 10 its nearly about 25 years old people still watch it 80s was best decade movies e g american werewolf london gremlins nightmare elm street predator list is endless anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be better film than terminator,0.48858885017421605,0.24227642276422762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"

As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, ""they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie."" His friend said, ""take it."" Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions. None could have pulled it off as well as he did. Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite. A man sent from the future to stop this machine. He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his. A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance. Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.

10.0,"One of the greats of the action genre, and just a great film overall","Have not always been a big fan of action films, after seeing my fair share poorly made, dull and predictable, sloppily written and badly acted ones that delivers just as little on the action (the worst of Steven Seagal being prime examples. The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.The Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.Action fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",one greats action genre just great film overall,have not always been big fan action films after seeing my fair share poorly made dull predictable sloppily written badly acted ones that delivers just as little action worst steven seagal being prime examples terminator however is like die hard thrilling well made film that succeeds as action film film general treats its audience genre with respect it is also one director james camerons best films along with terminator 2 aliens terminator looks great still sure special effects have not held up as well as rest film but they are not that bad film is beautifully slickly photographed sets lighting are so imaginative wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked immersed into its world filled with sharp details camerons direction is superb some best his whole career music score is hauntingly eerie its synthesised sound doesnt date film at all instead adding hugely atmosphere script including famous ill be back is snappy smart with plenty wittily written lines story is incredibly engrossing exciting maximum with plenty suspense fun action fans are guaranteed too be thrilled by action here being both dynamic thrilling climax really does jangle nerves michael biehn especially linda hamilton shine their roles arnold schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character date all all brilliant film one greats action genre 10 10 bethany cox,0.5635059871901976,0.21682330827067667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,The ultimate blend of Orwell and action,"Even in this post-Matrix era, this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action. If the definition of a classic is a movie that's often imitated but never equaled, then The Terminator is definitely a classic, because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.I wasn't fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release, the year predicted by Orwell's classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people, but I did see it in about 1992, when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior, but after all these years I now prefer the first film's raw intensity and kinetic energy.The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron, and even after Aliens and Titanic it's still arguably his best-directed film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement, because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can't think of one moment in the whole 100-minute running time that I would want to change.Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who's very difficult to work with, but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He's a master of the small touch, as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in mid-sentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.Cameron also co-wrote the story, so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye, and indeed the whole film has the urgent, oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid, which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron, this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie, but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie, while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotions--sweetness and vulnerability, toughness and despair, etc.Michael has always been a B actor, but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties, to which his big, haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie, as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission, and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film, the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive, but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable set-pieces, the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops, and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as ""cool,"" and yet there is some-thing undeniably cool about Arnold, with his sunglasses and leather jacket, going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the cold-blooded determination of the Terminator, but also the character's single-mindedness invites admiration: even as we're appalled by all the killing, we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire, explosions and stunt-work (including some especially good stunt driving) to work purely as an action picture, but it's the film's anti-technology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice, for example, the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story: the cops can't get into touch with her because of it, while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot, the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future, crushing an endless row of skulls, which you can interpret any number of ways (is it a crack against urban renewal?). Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper, and that even in the post-apocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching, but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many science-fiction/action movies fail under the weight of their own camp, but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity, but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is, after all, The Terminator, and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years, then I'll give it a 10.",ultimate blend orwell action,even this post matrix era this movie is still ultimate blend orwell action if definition classic is movie thats often imitated but never equaled then terminator is definitely classic because increasing redundancy its sequels imitations merely demonstrates how good original is i wasnt fortunate enough see this movie year its release year predicted by orwells classic novel as time when technology would be used enslave people but i did see it about 1992 when blockbuster success first sequel made me curious watch first film at that time i preferred second terminator movie being technically superior but after all these years i now prefer first films raw intensity kinetic energy terminator was course breakthrough movie james cameron even after aliens titanic its still arguably his best directed film i challenge anybody watch this movie point out one single shot that needs improvement because direction this movie is so fluid precise that i cant think one moment whole 100 minute running time that i would want change cameron was course still is notorious perfectionist whos very difficult work with but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again again without losing its entertainment value hes master small touch as when cop at desk is filling out his paperwork with small pencil pauses mid sentence look up see headlights coming towards him through doors cameron also co wrote story so this movie meant even more him personally than merely directing triumph supposedly he drew his inspiration nightmare which he was being chased by humanoid with one glowing red eye indeed whole film has urgent oppressive atmosphere calm logic characteristic nightmare but course he was probably also remembering subconsciously couple episodes outer limits that he saw as kid which explains why he had acknowledge writer ellison credits besides cameron this movie really belongs three lead actors arnold course gives performance his career this movie but then so do linda michael arnolds physical presence harsh accent have never been put better use movie while linda never had another role that required her run through such full range emotions sweetness vulnerability toughness despair etc michael has always been b actor but since terminator is essentially b movie he fits perfectly his performance proves that action hero is much more compelling when hes vulnerable not only physical pain but emotional difficulties which his big haunted eyes are put good use watch him this movie as man thrown out his time but with mission youll see perfect match actor character typical action film amount violence bloodshed terminator would be excessive but movie about unstoppable killing machine envelope can be pushed one more memorable set pieces terminator takes entire police station full thirty cops although i didnt exactly count them viewer gets sense watching every single cop being gunned down ordinarily i wouldnt describe such scene slaughter as cool yet there is some thing undeniably cool about arnold with his sunglasses leather jacket going through station with shotgun assault rifle taking everybody arnolds charisma helps audience stomach cold blooded determination terminator but also characters single mindedness invites admiration even as were appalled by all killing we have admit he does it rather well this movie has more than enough gunfire explosions stunt work including some especially good stunt driving work purely as action picture but its films anti technology paranoia that makes it more than just exciting ride notice example subtle role that sarahs answering machine plays story cops cant get into touch with her because it while message she leaves it brings terminator right her one memorable shot tracks construction crane become those killing machine future crushing endless row skulls which you can interpret any number ways is it crack against urban renewal also note that criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper that even post apocalyptic future which machines have destroyed world children still huddle around television set desperate effort be entertained some viewers may be turned off by this movies preaching but one quality that distinguishes terminator its countless imitations is strength its convictions too many science fiction action movies fail under weight their own camp but terminator is exception because it actually has nerve take itself seriously bickering between seasoned cops paul lance provides some levity but at no point does film make fun itself only reason im not giving this movie perfect 10 is because it is after all terminator not casablanca if people still remember it forty years then ill give it 10,0.49532398429457253,0.11701082142258613,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,Lethally Efficient Entertainment Machine,"The police psychologist interviewing Kyle Reese says it just right at one point: ""I could make a career out of this guy!"" Make that two careers, that of action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and blockbuster filmmaker James Cameron.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a struggling waitress who has just been stood up for a date. Another date is en route; unfortunately for her it's the proverbial date from hell. He may look like a studly Austrian-American bodybuilder, but he's really a hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped in human tissue sent from the future to kill her before she can give birth to the hope of mankind's survival. Can Kyle (Michael Biehn) save her before Arnold does his job?The title character is really a thing of beauty. As Kyle explains: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead.""So what you have is ""Jaws"" for a new decade. And there can be no doubt what that decade is. From the Walkman worn by Sarah's roommate to the trendy neon sportswear on display at the ""Technoir"" nightclub, this is a 1980s movie through and through. And other than some clunky miniatures work set in the world Kyle came from, there's nothing wrong with that.The film has a lot more going for it. From start to stop this is, like ""Jaws,"" a pop-action spectacular that never stops. Even the lengthy time-travel exposition scenes are suspenseful, because you are always alert for what might come through the door in the next second. Schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression in an atypical bad- guy role, while Hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty and sudden bursts of heroism. Biehn may do the best job, his face suggesting the anguish of his character's plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope for the future personified in Sarah.Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd fashioned a clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re-viewings. There's a scene between Kyle and Sarah that brings ""Terminator's"" greatness into focus for me. He's telling her of this photograph he has been holding of her, and spent many terrible nights staring at, wondering what she was thinking. Later, Cameron has a scene where we get to see what Sarah was thinking, and it's a doozy!Then there's the police vehicle the Terminator rides around in trying to get his mark. The slogan on the side of the car reads: ""Dedicated To Serve."" Perfect!Is the Terminator supposed to be from THE future, or just ""one possible future""? Like Sarah says, a guy could go crazy thinking about this. Or at least have to wait until the next sequel. Hollywood can beat good ideas to death, but this film proves it will take a lot indeed to kill the Terminator.",lethally efficient entertainment machine,police psychologist interviewing kyle reese says it just right at one point i could make career out this guy make that two careers that action hero arnold schwarzenegger blockbuster filmmaker james cameron sarah connor linda hamilton is struggling waitress who has just been stood up date another date is en route unfortunately her its proverbial date hell he may look like studly austrian american bodybuilder but hes really hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped human tissue sent future kill her before she can give birth hope mankinds survival can kyle michael biehn save her before arnold does his job title character is really thing beauty as kyle explains it cant be bargained with it cant be reasoned with it doesnt feel pity or remorse or fear it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead so what you have is jaws new decade there can be no doubt what that decade is walkman worn by sarahs roommate trendy neon sportswear display at technoir nightclub this is 1980s movie through through other than some clunky miniatures work set world kyle came theres nothing wrong with that film has lot more going it start stop this is like jaws pop action spectacular that never stops even lengthy time travel exposition scenes are suspenseful because you are always alert what might come through door next second schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression atypical bad guy role while hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty sudden bursts heroism biehn may do best job his face suggesting anguish his characters plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope future personified sarah cameron producer gale anne hurd fashioned clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re viewings theres scene between kyle sarah that brings terminators greatness into focus me hes telling her this photograph he has been holding her spent many terrible nights staring at wondering what she was thinking later cameron has scene where we get see what sarah was thinking its doozy then theres police vehicle terminator rides around trying get his mark slogan side car reads dedicated serve perfect is terminator supposed be future or just one possible future like sarah says guy could go crazy thinking about this or at least have wait until next sequel hollywood can beat good ideas death but this film proves it will take lot indeed kill terminator,0.4481168831168831,0.08363876863876862,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,It's about transformation,"I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator. Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman. That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier."" She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous. And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me. It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart. It's quickly developing love story touches me. Its humor makes the dark places in me smile. But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?9.5 out of 10.",its about transformation,i just saw horrifying touching very good movie again its terminator now talk it as great film compare it with american beauty might seem idiotic its almost unrelentingly dark violent frightening action movie after all but strip away relentless action strip away technophobia strip away blatant dislike cops modern youth strip away poignant love story at its core its about immature essentially mindless girl becoming strong determined woman thats theme more movies should have if we want girls have strong role models course few hours during which sarah connor realises that she is running her life soul less machine human flesh that is implacably violently determined kill her she transforms girl who cant balance her cheque book woman who can order wounded beaten man get your feet soldier she is clear headed not panicky focused crisis incredibly courageous its not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that shes grown up its relentless heartless violence appals fascinates me its gritty depiction our society as prelude even more horrific one 2023 darkens my heart its quickly developing love story touches me its humor makes dark places me smile but most all i am touched fascinated by sarahs precipitous transformation as good life exercise ask yourself this would you have courage do what she does 9 5 out 10,0.5522222222222223,0.07574074074074073,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
