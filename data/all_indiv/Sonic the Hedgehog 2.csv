8,Much more of a Sonic movie this time,"The first Sonic movie was surprisingly competent. This one is even better, incorporating additional elements from the games and sticking to more of an action-adventure plot. It's a kid's movie through and through (way more toilet humor this go-around), but a fun one that never takes itself too seriously. Everyone in my theater was having a great time with it.As with the original, Jim Carrey steals the show as Eggman. This man is 60 years old and yet he has more verve than I do! He's so energetic he sometimes resembles a cartoon more than Sonic, Knuckles, or Tails! While I respect his desire to retire, I do hope he holds on and does the third movie-- there would be such a void without him there.",much more sonic movie this time,first sonic movie was surprisingly competent this one is even better incorporating additional elements games sticking more action adventure plot its kids movie through through way more toilet humor this go around but fun one that never takes itself too seriously everyone my theater was having great time with it as with original jim carrey steals show as eggman this man is 60 years old yet he has more verve than i do hes so energetic he sometimes resembles cartoon more than sonic knuckles or tails while i respect his desire retire i do hope he holds does third movie there would be such void without him there,0.42592592592592593,0.30879629629629624,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,Fun. What more do you want?,"Following Dr Robotnik's exile, Sonic has settled down in rural Montana with adoptive parents Sheriff Tom and wife Maddie. What follows includes Robotnik's escape, the arrival of additional alien oddities Miles ""Tails"" Prower, the twin-tailed fox and Knuckles, the aggressive echidna, a marriage in Hawaii, a dance-off in Siberia, mushroom machinery, a Master Emerald, some annoying military intervention, and a giant robot.That sounds like a lot, but it's pretty straightforward stuff in a plot which aims directly at a 3-part audience - kids, tolerant parents, and mature gamers with fond memories of the original games.

8,A Good Example On How A Movie Sequel Should Be Done,"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the sequel to 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog, a film that had a rocky development, but would listen to fans and fix its incarnation to Sonic, resulting in it being well received, and breaking the Detective Pikachu movie's record as the highest-grossing video game-based movie, and the highest-grossing superhero movie of 2020.Here, while Tom and Maddie are going to Hawaii to attend Rachel's wedding to a man named Randall, leaving Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) in charge of the house. However, Dr. Robotnik (played once again by Jim Carey) has managed to escape the Mushroom Planet with the aid of Knuckles (voiced by Idris Elba), whom he repays by taking him to Sonic so he can destroy him. However, just as Sonic is about to be creamed, a police car rams Knuckles, revealing Tails (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessy, the only VA to reprise his or her role from the video games). After finding out Longclaw left a message telling Earth is the hiding place of the Master Emerald, the one thing Knuckles seeks to restore honor to his extinct tribe (as he is the last one left).Now this is another good example of how sequels should be done. Sonic 2 is an epic film, as Sonic teams up with Tails and faces Dr. Robotnik and Knuckles. The cast from the first film returns with some new faces appearing, and the new story is awesome. Jim Carey still hams it up as the evil doctor and even Rachel gets a scene where she can be a heroine. But the best thing about this film is that it brings Knuckles back to being a serious rival to Sonic, compared to the Sega games demoting him to the role of being an idiot since the Sonic Boom cartoon. It makes me wish Sega would make notes if they saw the films, because IMHO, Paramount is basically doing Sonic better than Sega did post-Sonic Adventure 2 (it even goes as far as to give Knuckles a father, something the games would never do).However, if there are some complaints I have, it's that this movie has some scenes that are basically imitating scenes from the first film (the Siberian lounge scene reminds me of the Piston Pit scene from the first movie, only instead of a bar fight, we get a dance off), but this is a good sequel regardless. Don't pay heed to the critics bashing it and watch it if you can and see if it clicks with you.",good example how movie sequel should be done,sonic hedgehog 2 is sequel 2020s sonic hedgehog film that had rocky development but would listen fans fix its incarnation sonic resulting it being well received breaking detective pikachu movies record as highest grossing video game based movie highest grossing superhero movie 2020 here while tom maddie are going hawaii attend rachels wedding man named randall leaving sonic voiced by ben schwartz charge house however dr robotnik played once again by jim carey has managed escape mushroom planet with aid knuckles voiced by idris elba whom he repays by taking him sonic so he can destroy him however just as sonic is about be creamed police car rams knuckles revealing tails voiced by colleen oshaughnessy only va reprise his or her role video games after finding out longclaw left message telling earth is hiding place master emerald one thing knuckles seeks restore honor his extinct tribe as he is last one left now this is another good example how sequels should be done sonic 2 is epic film as sonic teams up with tails faces dr robotnik knuckles cast first film returns with some new faces appearing new story is awesome jim carey still hams it up as evil doctor even rachel gets scene where she can be heroine but best thing about this film is that it brings knuckles back being serious rival sonic compared sega games demoting him role being idiot since sonic boom cartoon it makes me wish sega would make notes if they saw films because imho paramount is basically doing sonic better than sega did post sonic adventure 2 it even goes as far as give knuckles father something games would never do however if there are some complaints i have its that this movie has some scenes that are basically imitating scenes first film siberian lounge scene reminds me piston pit scene first movie only instead bar fight we get dance off but this is good sequel regardless dont pay heed critics bashing it watch it if you can see if it clicks with you,0.49769696969696975,0.10757575757575757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8,Best Video Game Movie easily!,"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is basically everything the first Sonic movie should have been. While the first film wasn't bad per se and perfectly watchable, it was very basic and clearly limited in scope and budget. Still alright overall.Thankfully, with a sequel greenlit it feels like this time the writers and director could do much more. The CGI game characters get more of the spotlight than the Human characters, the jokes land better and there's just much more going on here that fans will recognise from the games. With Tails and Knuckles added into the roster, it adds more character dynamic and banter that fleshes them out more in the story.Robotnik also gets to shine more too thanks to Jim Carrey's performance and having more gadgets and locations to juggle with. The weakest parts of the movie are when Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik aren't on screen, but the scenes are still perfectly watchable and better than almost everything in the first film. There's more locations too and gimmicks to play around with in the movie as well.Without spoilers, fans will be most happy with Sonic 2 and even people who aren't a fan of Sonic will still get a kick out of it. Although this ain't saying much, I can confidently say this is the best Video Game Movie I've seen easily. It really felt like they put their soul and effort into it and kids will have a blast with this. Don't forget to stay to the end for a surprise. There will definitely be a third film coming.7.5/10.",best video game movie easily,sonic hedgehog 2 is basically everything first sonic movie should have been while first film wasnt bad per se perfectly watchable it was very basic clearly limited scope budget still alright overall thankfully with sequel greenlit it feels like this time writers director could do much more cgi game characters get more spotlight than human characters jokes land better theres just much more going here that fans will recognise games with tails knuckles added into roster it adds more character dynamic banter that fleshes them out more story robotnik also gets shine more too thanks jim carreys performance having more gadgets locations juggle with weakest parts movie are when sonic tails knuckles robotnik arent screen but scenes are still perfectly watchable better than almost everything first film theres more locations too gimmicks play around with movie as well without spoilers fans will be most happy with sonic 2 even people who arent fan sonic will still get kick out it although this aint saying much i can confidently say this is best video game movie ive seen easily it really felt like they put their soul effort into it kids will have blast with this dont forget stay end surprise there will definitely be third film coming 7 5 10,0.43545168067226886,0.31211484593837535,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9,So much fun!,"Incredibly entertaining and surprisingly sweet- Sonic the Hedgehog 2 improves upon its predecessor by expanding on its worlds and dynamic- executing itself better and better each step of the way. First off, I absolutely love the look of this film. Famously the Sonic CGI was replaced in the last film after an incredibly negative and honestly valid response for the characters original design- and consequently its secondary design could feel a bit rushed at times considering they changed the films main character for a film within 3 months. Not to say it was bad, but it was definitely noticeable how fast they had accomplished this fact before. With this film however, the CGI is absolutely fantastic. Of course I love a more well done and thought out Sonic design, but man do I absolutely love the look of Knuckles in this film and even the look of Sonic's signature sidekick Tails. The expansion of the world in the Sonic universe is also breathtaking, truly making my younger self's dreams come true by finally seeing this universe on the big screen. The film is also incredibly funny and even absurd at times, never taking itself too seriously, and remembering this is a film about a Blue intergalactic hedgehog- focused on fun and heart. Speaking of heart, the film was oddly moving and quite cute in its family sort of setting background with Marsden's returning character and I really enjoyed the dynamic they expanded upon with the human characters as well. Heck, even Jim Carrey's iconic villain seemed a lot better this time around, allowing Eggman to lose his mind, and therefore allowing Carrey to do what he does best. It has a few subpar moments, and a few ones that stick out, but in the end- I enjoyed the heck out of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and I honestly can't wait to watch it again.My Rating: 9.1/10.",so much fun,incredibly entertaining surprisingly sweet sonic hedgehog 2 improves upon its predecessor by expanding its worlds dynamic executing itself better better each step way first off i absolutely love look this film famously sonic cgi was replaced last film after incredibly negative honestly valid response characters original design consequently its secondary design could feel bit rushed at times considering they changed films main character film within 3 months not say it was bad but it was definitely noticeable how fast they had accomplished this fact before with this film however cgi is absolutely fantastic course i love more well done thought out sonic design but man do i absolutely love look knuckles this film even look sonics signature sidekick tails expansion world sonic universe is also breathtaking truly making my younger selfs dreams come true by finally seeing this universe big screen film is also incredibly funny even absurd at times never taking itself too seriously remembering this is film about blue intergalactic hedgehog focused fun heart speaking heart film was oddly moving quite cute its family sort setting background with marsdens returning character i really enjoyed dynamic they expanded upon with human characters as well heck even jim carreys iconic villain seemed lot better this time around allowing eggman lose his mind therefore allowing carrey do what he does best it has few subpar moments few ones that stick out but end i enjoyed heck out sonic hedgehog 2 i honestly cant wait watch it again my rating 9 1 10,0.5177777777777779,0.2253703703703704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7,A decent continuation that's sure to entertain both fans of the games and the previous film,"""Sonic The Hedgehog 2"" is the sequel to the 2020 video game film adaptation of SEGA's ""Sonic The Hedgehog"". Starring James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Jim Carrey, as well as the voice talents of Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba, it is a decent continuation that's sure to entertain both fans of the games and the previous film.Sometime after the events of first film, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) has taken it upon himself to become a hero that others can rely on in Green Hills, Montana. After causing a great deal of collateral damage foiling a bank robbery, Sonic is forced to housesit for Tom (James Marsden) and Maddie (Tika Sumpter) while the two are attending a wedding in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik (Jim Carrey) has returned from the Mushroom Planet thanks to the help of Knuckles the Echidna (voiced by Idris Elba) to seek out the powerful Master Emerald, which will help them conquer the world. After learning of this, Sonic teams up with his new fox friend Miles ""Tails"" Prower (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey) to stop both Dr. Eggman and Knuckles before they can wreak havoc with the Emerald.What I believe made the first ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" movie such a success was how it managed to appeal to hardcore Sonic fans while also functioning as an amusing family film in its own right. Something like this is easier said than done because various other movies based on video games have tried too hard to be as close to the original games as possible, alienating uninitiated viewers in the process. Because of how it was able to rise above this common mistake, I rank the first Sonic movie among the best video game related films of all time (although considering the lack of competition, the bar isn't exactly very high). Most of what made its predecessor work so well has been replicated here in the sequel, as it provides about the same amount of entertainment value one might expect from a follow-up.Deviating from the original, this film has a slightly darker tone since the Emerald is shown to be something that could easily destroy all of life as we know it. Because of this, we see Sonic actually treating this as a serious threat, limiting the amount of jokes and wisecracks he makes when attempting to hunt it down. This could be compared to the power of Infinity Stones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where their use has the potential to cause catastrophic damage if it were to fall into the wrong hands. I'm not entirely sure if this is accurate to the games since I'm only a casual fan of the series but it all seems like a typical plot device one would see when playing something related to Sonic the Hedgehog.However, things aren't all doom and gloom since that signature fun factor is still there to prevent things from becoming too bleak. Sonic, who is now joined by his good friend Tails, can be seen dancing off against foes to some catchy songs on his iPhone and snowboarding down mountainous slopes in Siberia. Scenes like these are as fast-paced and likeable as the blue hedgehog himself, elevating the film above the usual onslaught of family movie fodder designed solely towards very small children. To my surprise, Sonic now only seems to use his superspeed sparingly rather than just for the sake of it. Perhaps this was done in an effort to develop Sonic more as a character using his head instead of mindlessly speeding around, or maybe they simply didn't want to show Sonic being way too overpowered. Either way, it is an interesting creative decision.Visually, the film looks considerably better than its predecessor. Years ago, many people on the internet infamously cyber-bullied the makers of the first film into changing Sonic's look, winning out in the end with his current design. Normally I'm against this type of vitriolic attack on filmmakers but after seeing the fixed product, I'd say it was all for the best. I'm not sure how they were able to pull it off, but Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all look well integrated into our world. Scenes where human characters were interacting with Sonic, both physically and verbally, all looked quite convincing, as though there really were an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog sitting next to them or dancing alongside them in a bar.I also like how each of the three characters' distinct colours did a clever job of representing their personality traits. Sonic's blue stands out as he confidently speeds past everybody, Tails's orange highlights his supportive nature, and Knuckles' red perfectly mirrors his angry determination. Whether or not this was done intentionally I'm not entirely sure but if it was, then it was a nice addition the film. With that in mind, it also makes it easier to distinguish each of them from a distance, especially during certain action scenes where many things were happening at once.Like last time, Ben Schwartz does a great job playing up Sonic's cocky attitude to full effect. Although he still has that streak of impulsivity, Sonic this time feels as though he is trying to make an effort to use his intellect rather than just his speed to hunt down the Master Emerald. It was also nice to hear Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprise her role as Tails from the video games, as I can't really think of any other mainstream actors capable of voicing the loveable two-tailed fox. If you enjoyed O'Shaughnessey's voice of Tails in the games, then you are sure to like how she is able to hold her own alongside the rest of the cast. Idris Elba is appropriately irritable and brutally strong as the voice of Knuckles. Elba seems to be voicing Knuckles in the vein of the MCU's Thor in his first appearance, in that he is very powerful and one track minded but ignorant to basic things like food and recreational activities.Jim Carrey's performance as Dr. Eggman was easily my favourite thing about the original film. I remember laughing out loud quite a lot at the over-the-top material the writers gave him to work with. It was almost as though the character has been personally tailored to make use of all his comedic talents. This time, he bears a stronger resemblance to his video game counterpart, complete with a bald head and comically huge moustache, and like before he steals the show in virtually every scene he is in. For a man in his 60s, Carrey still demonstrates a considerable amount of versatility and physical dexterity when playing this iconic villain. I look forward to seeing more of Carrey's version of Dr. Eggman in future Sonic films.As far as video game movies and sequels are concerned, ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" is a fun follow-up that is able to recapture what made the original a success in the first place. It isn't afraid to be goofy fun if it wants to be but it also doesn't shy away from serious moments whenever it feels necessary. If you liked the first film, then it stands to reason that you should like this one as well. Judging by the mid-credits scene, it seems there are some more surprises on the horizon so Sonic fans definitely ought to stay tuned.I rate it 7/10.",decent continuation thats sure entertain both fans

7,A fun time dragged down by the boring humans,"This film is a very fun time. Sonic and Tails are a delight, Knuckles is epic and the action is great. Jim Carey's energy is amazing as Robotnik and the humour is pretty solid (although its missing the more witty humour the first had at times).However, the film is slightly ruined by the humans. Tom and Maddie are fine and are hardly in the film.But the entire film is utterly dragged down by a 15 minute sequence in the middle involving the bride raging at her wedding being crashed. When Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Eggman don't appear for 15 minutes straight, something has gone wrong. The acting was horrendous in this scene and it was as if an awful cheesy romance film was shoved into a Sonic film.The third act regained some momentum but it started to drag on by the end.

7,A Sonic adventure,"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022) is a great sequel and might be better than the first movie.Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba were all great as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. Sonic and Tails were great together and had a cute friendship.Knuckles was funny in how he didn't understand most things but he is tough and wants to complete his quest for the Master Emerald.Jim Carrey was still great as Dr. Robotnik/Eggman, he is still funny and gives a over the top performance that shows he is having fun with it.The action scenes are fun and awesome seeing with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles interacting off each other. Especially the Sonic vs Knuckles fight, it is worth seeing on the big screen.The 3rd act is amazing and fun while also having Easter eggs from the games that Sonic fans will recognize and find funny. Also the different locations they go to are nicely shot.The after credits scene is amazing and will get you excited for the future of the Sonic movie series.

10,"Sonic Is Back! With New Characters, Major Plot Twists, Mind-Blowing Adventures, And Tons Of Laughs","The wild, fun and adventurous blue hedgehog we all love, Sonic a.k.a. Blue Justice, is back in his new movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 2! This film has new character appearances, major plot twists, mind-blowing adventures, and tons of laughs throughout it. It's great that this sequel is one of those movies you can enjoy without seeing the original; however, since it refers to different scenes from the first one, you may want to watch the original first.In Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, or Dr. Eggman as Sonic calls him (Jim Carrey), returns to Earth with a new ally, Knuckles (Idris Elba), in hopes of finding a magical gem that holds the ultimate power of the universe. All that stands in their way is Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his new partner in crime, Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey). It's a battle of good and bad to see who will reach the emerald first and win in the end.The main characters are Sonic, Dr. Robotnik, Tails and Knuckles. I love how this film introduces characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise and they just fit in seamlessly. One of the voice actors who surprised me is Idris Elba. His voice is the perfect match to portray Knuckle's strong and confident personality. My favorite part is when Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) and Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter) are at Rachel's wedding and need to open a portal for Sonic; Tom realizes he may have mistaken the wedding ring for one of Sonic's golden rings. It adds some hilarious adventure to the wedding. Kudos to Junkie XL for keeping an ""old school"" feel throughout the film with songs such as It's Tricky by Run D. M. C. And Here Comes the Hotstepper by Ini Kamoze.This film sheds light on the importance of having family and friends in your life. They will always have your back and keep you on the right path in life. Sonic and the other characters experience different obstacles that teach them the true definition of a family, even if they come as friends.Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is out of this world. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The ""battle of the gem"" takes place in theaters on April 8, 2022. Be sure to stay for the after-credits movie scene.

7,"A Fun Time at the Movies, Plain and Simple","Having enjoyed the Sonic the Hedgehog video games throughout the years and also having enjoyed the first film in 2020, I was curious where they would go with a sequel. Now playing in theatres, I would say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is about just as enjoyable as its predecessor. Everything I liked about the first film is doubled up on here which was a nice treat, but new issues are also present. I don't go into films like this hoping for some masterful piece of filmmaking, but I do question when a creative decision just feels off. Here are my mostly positive thoughts on Sonic the Hedgehog 2.After being banished to the Mushroom Planet, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) forms a new ally in Knuckles (Idris Elba). Returning to Earth with his new companion, he once again seeks out Sonic. The only addition however is that he wishes to find the chaos emerald, which holds ""ultimate power."" Sonic (Ben Schwartz) teams up with a new ally of his own in Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey) to search for it as well. This film becomes both a treasure hunt and villain showdown, which was fun to see. It doesn't get much simpler in terms of storytelling for a film such as this, but I thought it was well done.On top of having fun with the story itself, I also found myself impressed with how witty the film was with its dialogue. I laughed at multiple puns and Jim Carrey's portrayal is once again great, if not even better. What did bog the film down though was a portion of the film that took place in Hawai'i. I understand continuing the parent storyline with both James Marsden and Tika Sumpter, but why they go to Hawai'i and why so much time is focused on secondary characters when it ultimately amounts to nothing to move the story forward was beyond me. Sure, these scenes had their moments and I didn't hate them, but they felt out of place for this film. Taking this out would leave no impact and make the film feel much better-paced.Overall, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 delivers on all of its promises. It's a film for both kids and adults that doesn't take itself overly seriously (only when it needs to), and is also just a pure blast of energy from start to finish. I never once found myself bored, other than that major story detour, and that's all I really wanted from this sequel. It's bright, vibrant, energetic, and delivers just the right amount of emotion without feeling overdone. The setup for a third film does excite me and I will gladly watch the next instalment. There's nothing all that special about these movies, but I have fun watching them. Especially if you enjoyed the first movie, I recommend checking this one out. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now playing in theatres.",fun time at movies plain simple,having enjoyed sonic hedgehog video games throughout years also having enjoyed first film 2020 i was curious where they would go with sequel now playing theatres i would say that sonic hedgehog 2 is about just as enjoyable as its predecessor everything i liked about first film is doubled up here which was nice treat but new issues are also present i dont go into films like this hoping some masterful piece filmmaking but i do question when creative decision just feels off here are my mostly positive thoughts sonic hedgehog 2 after being banished mushroom planet dr robotnik jim carrey forms new ally knuckles idris elba returning earth with his new companion he once again seeks out sonic only addition however is that he wishes find chaos emerald which holds ultimate power sonic ben schwartz teams up with new ally his own tails colleen oshaughnessey search it as well this film becomes both treasure hunt villain showdown which was fun see it doesnt get much simpler terms storytelling film such as this but i thought it was well done top having fun with story itself i also found myself impressed with how witty film was with its dialogue i laughed at multiple puns jim carreys portrayal is once again great if not even better what did bog film down though was portion film that took place hawaii i understand continuing parent storyline with both james marsden tika sumpter but why they go hawaii why so much time is focused secondary characters when it ultimately amounts nothing move story forward was beyond me sure these scenes had their moments i didnt hate them but they felt out place this film taking this out would leave no impact make film feel much better paced overall sonic hedgehog 2 delivers all its promises its film both kids adults that doesnt take itself overly seriously only when it needs is also just pure blast energy start finish i never once found myself bored other than that major story detour thats all i really wanted this sequel its bright vibrant energetic delivers just right amount emotion without feeling overdone setup third film does excite me i will gladly watch next instalment theres nothing all that special about these movies but i have fun watching them especially if you enjoyed first movie i recommend checking this one out sonic hedgehog 2 is now playing theatres,0.5495114584097635,0.24091856824907668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7,An entertaining Sonic adventure that is better than the first and feels more true to the games,"This movie definitely felt like a step up from the previous which was good but kind of just felt like a road trip movie that just happened to have Sonic and Robotinik dropped in the middle of it, this one felt more aligned with the items and locations of the games and had a lot more fanservice in it, with more action and comedyI have had a soft spot for the Sonic games, the original 2D games revolutionised 2D platformers at the time, however the 3D games always felt behind innovation though some are better than others. Sonic 06 and Rise of Lyric are definitely the worst ones, though can still be entertaining if you love hilarious glitches and super cheesy writing and scenesThis movie however is still quite good despite having a few flays, Jim Carrey's acting as Robotnik has been taken a step up on the cheese factor and now feels like a full fledged cartoon character with the dial all the way up to 10, than just Jim Carrey pretending to be Robotnik. He even feels more cartoonified than what Eggman was in most of the recent games, but Jim knows how to get into that zone and stay there because he lives and breathes that styleI really liked the addition of Tails in the movie and felt very faithful to the character, Knuckles was good too but kind of felt like he was dumbed down a little compared to the wisecracking character of the games to an extent. I also wasn't a real big fan of his African accent, but it makes sense why they made him that way. I didn't like how Tails was unconscious for almost 20 minutes with no dialogue and it felt lazy to me, like they were compensating for not having enough lines for him in a very cheap way.I did like how the Chaos Emeralds were more focussed upon in this movie aswell as the Master Emerald, and it was fun to see Sonic turn into Super Sonic at the end, though I thought they could have played a bit more with it in that scene and felt it was a bit too short and glossed over too quicklyOverall, I had a fun time with this movie and I think fans will like it a lot too, it felt more like a Sonic adventure in this one and I liked that, maybe we'll see Shadow and Amy make an appearance in the 3rd one.",entertaining sonic adventure that is better than first feels more true games,this movie definitely felt like step up previous which was good but kind just felt like road trip movie that just happened have sonic robotinik dropped middle it this one felt more aligned with items locations games had lot more fanservice it with more action comedyi have had soft spot sonic games original 2d games revolutionised 2d platformers at time however 3d games always felt behind innovation though some are better than others sonic 06 rise lyric are definitely worst ones though can still be entertaining if you love hilarious glitches super cheesy writing scenesthis movie however is still quite good despite having few flays jim carreys acting as robotnik has been taken step up cheese factor now feels like full fledged cartoon character with dial all way up 10 than just jim carrey pretending be robotnik he even feels more cartoonified than what eggman was most recent games but jim knows how get into that zone stay there because he lives breathes that stylei really liked addition tails movie felt very faithful character knuckles was good too but kind felt like he was dumbed down little compared wisecracking character games extent i also wasnt real big fan his african accent but it makes sense why they made him that way i didnt like how tails was unconscious almost 20 minutes with no dialogue it felt lazy me like they were compensating not having enough lines him very cheap way i did like how chaos emeralds were more focussed upon this movie aswell as master emerald it was fun see sonic turn into super sonic at end though i thought they could have played bit more with it that scene felt it was bit too short glossed over too quicklyoverall i had fun time with this movie i think fans will like it lot too it felt more like sonic adventure this one i liked that maybe well see shadow amy make appearance 3rd one,0.5092735042735043,0.2481143162393162,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9,And Once Again... The Critics Are Wrong,"I'm genuinely confused on why critics are going out of their way to try and review these films as if they were trying to be Gone with the Wind. For me personally I felt like this was one of the better video game movies I have ever seen. The addition of the other video game characters and only make this 1000 times more entertaining than the first one. I also felt like the rivalry between sonic and knuckles really worked and you can tell that there was a lot of animosity between the characters which was the point of their rivalry. It's not perfect, or some things with the human characters that are pretty boring and obnoxious. I just don't get why they won't make a movie about the characters from the game themselves and not try and add a bunch of side human characters to further along a less interesting plot. Other than that I really like that I really don't understand why critics are so hard on this franchise. Every complaint that I've seen about this movie they are saying that this is a cash grab for sonic. This is a sonic movie! Why would they not be using elements from the games that are related to sonic if it's a sonic movie? That's ridiculous. Same thing with Uncharted I just think critics are way too hard on these video game movies because of the stigma around them. For me... This is just as good if not better than the first one. Also stay for the credits if you're a fan of a franchise... OH MY GOD!!!",once again critics are wrong,im genuinely confused why critics are going out their way try review these films as if they were trying be gone with wind me personally i felt like this was one better video game movies i have ever seen addition other video game characters only make this 1000 times more entertaining than first one i also felt like rivalry between sonic knuckles really worked you can tell that there was lot animosity between characters which was point their rivalry its not perfect or some things with human characters that are pretty boring obnoxious i just dont get why they wont make movie about characters game themselves not try add bunch side human characters further along less interesting plot other than that i really like that i really dont understand why critics are so hard this franchise every complaint that ive seen about this movie they are saying that this is cash grab sonic this is sonic movie why would they not be using elements games that are related sonic if its sonic movie thats ridiculous same thing with uncharted i just think critics are way too hard these video game movies because stigma around them me this is just as good if not better than first one also stay credits if youre fan franchise oh my god,0.48210784313725474,-0.053921568627451,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"
8,Yup. I really enjoyed this one.,"As a fan of the games, I had an idea of where the story was going within the first 15 minutes of the film. With that being said, the execution of the plot and writing with both new and returning characters, made the build up to the finale very entertaining and worth my time. It's a little slow at the beginning but once Tails and Knuckles join the cast, it's a thrilling race to the finish; and what a finish it is! There are some twists I didn't see coming and I won't spoil the 3rd act which is the peak of the film. Think Spider-Man No Way Home: Sega version! Yes, the 3rd act is that good and it gave me goosebumps.

8,Put a ring on it,"Not just what Beyonce said or Sonic for that matter. But another character who gets a side story that may feel weird to some, who came to watch a Sonic movie. But weird side stories make this perfectly weird and I reckon fun.

Even after the movie is over (as in during the credits - there is one scene that you will cherish also). That being said, apart from the returning Sonic, his father and mother and the ever so great Jim Carrey, we get some new additions. Who really are able to give a fresh take and put us in a spin.Adding Idris Elbas voice is a stroke of genius (though since it is CG no brush was used). Puns aside, the movie has a few things that are too convenient and if you think too much about the story and all the things that are happening ... well you will find flaws and your fun might be dampened a lot.

5,If only they hired a better Screenwriter,"I'm sorry but was it an unannounced extended cut? Was I simply not aware of it? If not, then why the heck was this film so stretched? I can understand when a certain script demands an extra bit of time to build up the tale or to settle some essential things, for Sonic 2 though, I still don't get the urgency, what was the necessity? Really, what was it?I mean sure you have two new characters in this sequel who need adequate introductions but what about the rest of the cast? The humour is obnoxiously loud, the performances (except for Jim Carrey) were awful and on top of all that you have this dubious CGI; which was supposed to be the film's main attraction, what a shame!Now following the success of the first film, it is quite obvious that the creators had the green light from the studio to spend additional cash this time and guess what they did; however, to our utter dismay, it appears as if they have only utilised that extra bit of budget to demonstrate some cool action set pieces and nothing else!Had they invested a small percentage of their budget into hiring a better Screenwriter; things could have been much different! Why? Cause the Screenplay was poorly paced. Not only it was tiresome but it also dragged the whole movie down with it.The only good things that are worth remembering are Sonic and his newfound counterparts (Tails and Knuckles). Perhaps it's my nostalgia talking here but yeah I was having fun whenever these characters were in focus.",if only they hired better screenwriter,im sorry but was it unannounced extended cut was i simply not aware it if not then why heck was this film so stretched i can understand when certain script demands extra bit time build up tale or settle some essential things sonic 2 though i still dont get urgency what was necessity really what was it i mean sure you have two new characters this sequel who need adequate introductions but what about rest cast humour is obnoxiously loud performances except jim carrey were awful top all that you have this dubious cgi which was supposed be films main attraction what shame now following success first film it is quite obvious that creators had green light studio spend additional cash this time guess what they did however our utter dismay it appears as if they have only utilised that extra bit budget demonstrate some cool action set pieces nothing else had they invested small percentage their budget into hiring better screenwriter things could have been much different why cause screenplay was poorly paced not only it was tiresome but it also dragged whole movie down with it only good things that are worth remembering are sonic his newfound counterparts tails knuckles perhaps its my nostalgia talking here but yeah i was having fun whenever these characters were focus,0.509781295093795,0.06393984487734487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"

Can't wait to own this movie.",what blast,such fun great movie tons easter eggs those who grew up sonic too everything was perfect this is how video game movies should be i cant wait more idris was amazing as knuckles he was so point man was born play that role it was such great vibe them get colleen do voice tails she is tails i loved all easter eggs jokes most all jim man is legend if this happens be his last movie ever what way go out he killed it cant wait own this movie,0.5619047619047619,0.37142857142857144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.22}"
