10,"""Now it looks like Disney Land""","This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew ""Ace"". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this ""Goodfells Part 2"". Is it ""Goodfellas Part 2"", in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. ""Casino"" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says ""It's more like Disney Land now"". Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. ""You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!"" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my ""Rober DeNiro: A history of his films"" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace ""I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. ""Casino"" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to ""Goodfellas"", let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I'd like to see it in the top 100, but we'll see. 10/10",now it looks like disney land,this is one best films 90s hands down without doubt this has become one my favorite movies im not sure why really i just love it i think because i read book lot what happened real life happened my little town chicago no names my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew ace again no names that was always pretty cool me since my town really didnt have much excitement i guess also because im huge fan martin robert joes when they work together they create masterpieces ive read lot comments imdb more than 50 comments are calling this goodfells part 2 is it goodfellas part 2 my opinion no yes its very similar situations but its not same plot its little more gory more bright casino is mainly about rise fall las vegas when robert deniros character says its more like disney land now actually thats true its not like it used be im only 20 but my mom dad told me how different times were 60s 70s everyone was more close wanted know who you were how everything was going everything is more corporate greed now days but back onto movie it does have gangstas it with that comes some pretty gruesome violence robert deniro no words can describe how wonderful actor he is if you read most my comments you can tell im fan this movie is actually what made me into huge fan his hes dialog image is very powerful you understand his position you want love him even though technically hes bad guy too you still think he is so cool lot people i talked too guys wanted be him girls wanted be with him what performance it deserved more praise joe does it again being hole who thinks with his gun not with his head joe as actor is very remarkable hes only 5 6 but he is so intimidating his speech desert with ace big confrontation you want me get out my own town dont bleep with me ace does he swear this movie oh yeah lot were talking 400 f words guys but you get past vulgar language just enjoy what joe says does head vice scene metal bat scene with joe is two most disturbing scenes cinematic history sharon stone what can i say what remarkable performance she was very much robbed her deserved oscar i was reading my rober deniro history his films that sharon over shined both joes roberts performance some ways that is very true she plays gold digging druggie drunk hustling whore she is very glamorous film though she is covered beautiful gowns jewelery that no guy could ever resist her first scene where robert first sees her she is stealing chips guy who has hired her night was extremely effective you can see why ace fell so hard her what terrific performance end when she screams at ace i will go fbi i will go police im not protecting you anymore you get scarred cant help but watch more even though you are sitting your butt more than 2 1 2 hours you hate her character so much you want her get whats coming her thats what makes terrific performance when you actually want make sure that this character gets justice he or she deserves sharon i apologize you deserved more praise as well martin scorcesse one greatest living directors our time this film was very wonderfully made with great visuals soundtrack really adds lot im telling you theatrical trailer with song gimme shelter by rolling stones what great feel martin has been nominated several times oscar but they snub him i think because his films are so violent typical but they remain classics im disappointed with oscars this man deserves more whew casino is excellent movie that i highly recommend mob movie lovers dont compare this goodfellas let it stand its own but please this is not movie children any manor parents this is movie that should be wait until later teens its very violent were talking head vice beating with metal bat just name few violent scenes theres more drugs sex very vulgar language this is adults only its great movie that deserves very much be top 250 id like see it top 100 but well see 10 10,0.5835714285714286,0.1837528344671202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10,The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s.,"A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.",most uncompromising studio picture 1990s,complex multilayered beautifully directed film martin scorseses casino is masterpiece destruction betrayal few films take so many chances succeed so wonderfully it takes some basic formulas that were found goodfellas applies them another type story while goodfellas view was ground level telling story blue collar gangsters nyc this film tells story guys who controlled those guys its fascinating watch these people run las vegas control flow money then fall heights power due lust hubris greed amazing film that will hopefully get recognition it deserves years come,0.5318181818181819,0.32045454545454544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.,"I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4",i know i am minority when i say this was much better than goodfellas,i saw goodfellas first more times than casino yet i totally love casino as it is one best movies i have literally ever seen i find goodfellas be overrated casino be movie that learned formers flaws something i really do think more than my own opinion is that if this was released before goodfellas this would be more liked no new ground was broken everything was just elevated robert de niro gives his most underrated performance as well as second best year behind nicolas cage leaving las vegas as sam ace rothstein ace is unbeatable gambler who secures mobs casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend nicky santoro pesci keeps everybody line only real difference between nicky tommy goodfellas is tommy has curlier hair theres divided opinion who is crazier more violent i lean towards nicky ace helps casino grow eventually seizes full power by becoming owner nickys wild crazy antics get him banned every las vegas casino so he decides create his own meanwhile ace blindly falls beautiful prostitute named ginger stone they get married her habits dont change ace does all he can help her out love story this is amazing ginger is unlikeable but we cant turn away her her nicky both contribute aces fall as well as rise other casinos vegas one easy thing i loved was performance by robert de niro he is very likable my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by ginger nicky he was easily better lead than ray liotta his character was more likable deeper than jimmy fact all three our leads this are much deeper developed than leads goodfellas ray liotta is dummy who is not cut out be mobster while we see conviction ace as he tries make everything work out casino is also much more flashy nicer too look at than goodfellas which takes place new york music this is not distracting or overpowering filming is step up flow is much better story is superior this has more linear stable story than goodfellas which is just mans escapades mafia everybody that watches casino is impacted more than goodfellas watch casino you have be mood well prepared movie has really done its job if it does that viewer actually has purpose its content 4 4,0.5415181224004753,0.2956179441473558,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9,"I enjoyed this more than ""Goodfellas"".","I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching ""Casino"" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you'd expect with a Joe Pesci character, he's a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn't mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you'll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than ""Goodfellas""...also with the same stars and same director. This is because ""Goodfellas"" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas ""Casino"" seemed to have more story and wasn't always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a 'nice' picture. It's filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn't really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice.",i enjoyed this more than goodfellas,i generally avoid violent films which is why i resisted watching casino long time however despite being very violent spots film turned out be very compelling it was far more than just violence had interesting look at mob influence las vegas back day film is unusual that it has two leading men with parallel stories sometimes ace nicky robert de niro joe pesci were scenes together often they were apart each doing his own thing as ace he was smart man who was charge one vegas top casinos he was tough but basically honest mobster as nicky as youd expect with joe pesci character hes bit nut job often out control letting anger govern most his decisions unlike ace who had veneer honesty about him nicky was hood didnt mind this eventually pair end up having downfall how what happens each youll have see yourself parts this film i enjoyed most were when you learned about how vegas operated seeing ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting this sense i enjoyed film much more than goodfellas also with same stars same director this is because goodfellas was mostly just about violence crime whereas casino seemed have more story wasnt always about excessive violence nastiness not that film is any way nice picture its filled with obscenities nasty folks few scenes horrific violence think about this before you decide whether or not see movie by way this is only personal choice doesnt really affect movie much but one thing i did not love about film is omnipresent pop music which at times made film seem like music video i think less this would have been nice,0.5947176079734219,0.12438907345884087,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8,Typically fantastic Scorcese film,"I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever. Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable. Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master. Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant. Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them. While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly",typically fantastic scorcese film,i have admit my bias because i believe that scorcese cannot do wrong ever even his lesser known or critically panned films are above great film line casino is certainly no exception casino spans three decades chronicles true story faction mob who ran las vegas casinos robert deniro plays ace rothstein fantastic bookie who is chosen run tangiers hotel casino along way he marries drug addicted con artist trophy wife sharon stone struggles with his friendship with loose cannon nicky santoro joe pesci rothstein is complicated figure that he is not heavy yet he wields lot power due respect he has gained his mob bosses back home robert deniro joe pesci are both fantastic their roles sharon stone actually turned out non irritating performance as viewer you cant stand her but that is point scorceses normal supporting cast are also involved this film including his great mother even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles they are always memorable scorcese seems have several different directing styles casino follows tradition goodfellas as pseudo documentary lot exposition is revealed by characters themselves form voice overs several scenes are filmed documentarian fashion entire production however is sleek very quick use music bears mentioning as well most martin scorcese films have amazing soundtrack that adds enhances scene being child mtv age im sucker good uses music films scorcese is master scorcese doesnt just utilize soundtrack he makes it part storytelling by music we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing since one cannot rely other factors such as fashion alone one my favorite scenes film which effectively involves music is actually casino very intense scene when relationship between deniro stone pesci come head climax film pounding music cut throughout this scene is cover satisfaction by devo result is absolutely brilliant being complete film geek i generally dont go films that feature certain stars i go films by certain directors scorcese is one them while this was probably tenth time id seen this film there were more things i noticed im sure ill notice more upon my eleventh viewing man is complete genius gift film my suggestion is watch some his films then check out his unbelievable series personal journey with martin scorcese through american movies which was done same year as casino series is essentially primer history film sectioned off by film genres you not only will experience his amazing intellect massive knowledge film history but his incredible humility as well shelly,0.5737067562067563,0.1447973137973138,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"

After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their ""Goodfellas"" roles.

7,"Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion","Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an ""I'm a schmo"" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way"" and The Animals' ""The House of the Rising Sun"" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film.

10,An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic,"If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it. Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture. I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both. The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done. The acting is superb. I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino. Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem.",underrated undervalued scorsese classic,if you havent seen casino yet stop whatever it is youre doing rush nearest video store rent it watch it along with mean streets casino is probably scorseses most underrated unheralded picture i would also venture say that this is probably his most ambitious film film deals with particular time period particular atmosphere accomplishes overwhelming achievement by creating accurately portraying both art direction is splendid most likely best any film scorsese has ever done acting is superb i never thought pesci would be able top his dynamic performance raging bull until i saw casino every time i watch this picture i fall love with it all over again this is most honest depiction las vegas especially time period it was portrayed scorseses direction is flawless perhaps it is because i watch alot scorsese kubrick films but i am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films more enamored by films that possess freedom that typical stories just dont seem hold sharon stone gives best performance her career as far as editing is concerned well if you believe like kubrick pudovkin that film is not shot but built who better have your team than long time cohort collaborator editor thelma schoonmaker ultimately genius scorsese is not just mastery medium but understanding appreciation necessity great collaborators all levels that scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career casino exemplifies not only best scorsese film but transcends it this film is truly gem,0.6057432432432432,0.37804054054054054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10,A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told,"As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a ""moneymaker"" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the ""wiseguy"" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",cant miss story no matter how told,as lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with few fringe types portrayed film im well aware story culture ambiance tangiers fictional casino placed control sam ace rothstein robert deniro rothstein is not mob member but moneymaker them because hes nations best sports handicapper it was refreshing movie finally show that not all gamblers are stupid but instead one those who takes advantage many who are rothsteins partner crime is nicky santoro joe pesci who is far less convincing as mobster than he would seem like believe sharon stone plays psychotic ginger once lifetime role that it was only time my life i could bear watch her film supporting cast is strong led by james woods don rickles excellent his dramatic capacity movie is generally well acted if you are gambler or know wiseguy culture movie doesnt have be explained while if you arent youll feel like youve stumbled upon secret meeting place mafia made privy what is said without anyone knowing you were there this film is based true story what happened when mob tried put its men suits have them heading casino why it has never been tried since homage paid incestuous nature nevada politics was excellent touch most us wouldnt like guy like sam rothstein nor would we like be him but if we go vegas weekend stay at casino hotel well have better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is pleasant one films nod how vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate reflects sadness at lost era where baby old school types who made vegas great was thrown out with bathwater organized crime influences,0.6446428571428571,0.2273809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10,Hugely underrated and very compelling film,"I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",hugely underrated very compelling film,i dont consider casino scorseses very best film goodfellas is my personal favourite but it is fantastic film definitely one see it is shocking disturbing unflinching places particularly part where head gets squeezed vice but that added atmosphere rather than distracted it casino is brilliantly made too i loved setting cinematography editing are outstanding never take away atmosphere martin scorseses direction is superb realism film has is always absorbing subplots that form story are intriguing characters are adeptly drawn story me has seldom dull moment not with subplots as intriguing as they are how well made it is how good characters acting are characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with goodfellas making it perhaps more even portrayal unorganised crime but decision do that paid off acting is equally impressive robert deniro great actor he is is incredibly charismatic joe pesci gives his best performance one his more meatier roles sharon stone who has never been this good or even sexy before is revelation very demanding role overall hugely compelling underrated 10 10 bethany cox,0.6013235294117648,0.3558333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8,Very good but not without flaws,"Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.But I don't think that Casino is at all a ""perfect"" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.Casino is based on the story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein ""secretly"" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded ""mix tape"" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.",very good but not without flaws,casino is very good film if youre at all interested gangster mafia films or if youre at all fan director co writer martin scorsese novelist

10,How Others See Us,"Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen.",how others see us,casino is my favorite movie last decade last century just like goodfellas martin scorsese rivets audience their seats without real hero root its power characters he creates robert deniro as gambler boss tangiers casino las vegas 70s 80s joe pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals mean streets brooklyn both move out las vegas seeking their respective places their related fields at orders higher ups criminal world but circumstance drives them apart one those circumstances is sharon stone people descending into degradation is always role that will get you noticed by academy sharon stones part as ginger is no exception here shes high price call girl when we first meet her her descent into drug addiction isnt pretty but scorsese keeps it very real but main story line involves deniro pesci see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many this world these two arent exception each can see how other is screwing up absolutely cannot see what hes doing key scene whole film is when deniro pesci meet desert where lot problems have been known disappear if you can get passed all cursing which is how you would expect gangsters talk each is making very realistic assessments about other one neither is listening word other is saying this is why i love casino so much ive never seen that particular theme ever handled so well screen,0.4676602564102564,0.11086538461538463,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"

Seductive, to say the least.It's in the second half that the narration vanishes and the movie starts to overstay its welcome. This criminal enterprising dream can't last forever, and when things start to come crashing down, they do so viciously (don't ever tell Scorsese he's timid on his violence).

9,Is it just me...,"...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple.

People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a ""scumbag"" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!",ossessione,reprise goodfellas mostly as has been pointed out although long not as tired or boring as some have felt how could movie with steve allen jerry vale be all bad people have wondered why scorcese coppola keep coming back mobsters specifically mafia all that corruption mixed with loyalty course no one knows perhaps not even directors but i suspect there are at least three reasons first it works economically it draws audience there is power violence sex appeal mens fantasies there is loyalty intrigue sheltered family lives excitement wealthy rogue male women second italian americans may return repeatedly stories mafia same reason that southern writers deal over over with themes minority relations spelling out stories they are explaining odd customs their subcultures rest us yes we are hung up these obsessions just as you believe here is how things work bit more subtle than youd thought arent they finally exploring these themes interests outsiders better understanding them they can explore their own conflicts model form as stated anthropologist john m roberts conflict enculturation hypothesis when we view something with ambivalence we tend poke around it touch it fascinated by it if we cant actually do thing itself become mobster endorse slavery we can play games with idea constructing little mock worlds which we can jiggle concepts around conflict about having children well you dont really need you can nurture something that is model or surrogate child cats dogs will do fine but if your conflict is more intense you are driven less recognizable models house plants say if conflict is very intense you can start coin or stamp collection what after all do you do with stamp collection you conceive idea you start it when its small you feed it you watch it grow get bigger when it gets too big or when you lost interest you sell it ebay it moves out house directing movie means constructing model world too like model social world chess game movie you lay out plot cause characters do certain forbidden things imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself im not surprised that scorcese made this movie or that hes filled it with italian american actors im not surprised that faulkner wrote intruder dust or that judith rossner wrote looking mr goodbar or that philip roth wrote portnoys complaint these model worlds theyve created deal with issues like crime race female sexuality ethnic loyalties that have kept italian americans southerners feminists jews marginal rest our culture artists are trying explain us themselves how things look inside if these issues ever disappear which is most improbable conflicts will ease marginal populations will no longer be prompted produce such intense work rest us will be poorer it maybe this case scorsese did too good job it i found myself listening deniros voice over telling us that james woods character was scumbag because he was small time chiseler chasing dentists golf course taking money whore sharon stone but who is deniros character make such judgments woods is detestable because hes vellicating minor hood with no money whereas deniro is morally superior because hes major player with lots illegal gains we admire deniro because he is more successful crook moral calculus is little confusing top all that highbrow stuff man does scorsese know how stage fierce family fight i should know that opening scene car explosion backed by majestic sweep bachs missa solemnis,0.45977751756440266,0.0638544106167057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6,throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car,"***SPOILERS*** Almost three hours long with some 150 character references or credits in it the film ""Casino"" has to do with the rise and fall of big time Las Veges operator and Tangiers Casino manager Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, Robert De Niro, who's fate remains uncertain until the movie is just about over.We see Sam in 1983 getting in his car and then blown to pieces as a bomb exploded as soon as he turned on the key to start the engine going. As Sam is put, by the explosion, in some kind of state of suspended animation, floating aimlessly in outer space, he tells us in flashback what lead to him getting into the situation that we find him now in. It all had to do with Sam's boyhood friend Mafia made-man Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, who was brought to Vegas by the mob to be put in charge of the casino's security. It was Nicky who's strong armed actions like beating and clubbing the customers fond cheating, as well as showing disrespect, on the floor of the casino that brought the heat, cops, as well as local politicians down on Ace Rothstein. This made things hot for Ace who with his criminal record now being scrutinized,instead of being looked the other way, to see if he can qualify to have a license to run the casino.Things get even worse for Ace when Nicky after being banned by the State Casino Commission from ever stepping into a Las Vegas casino or gambling establishment still pesters him about getting his job back! That would cost Ace his job as casino manager for just associating with the blood thirsty little psycho. Things really come to a head when Nicky starts to warm up to Ace's old lady ex Las Vegas showgirl and part time hooker Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone. Ginger is also still involved with her pimp ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond, James Woods, who's been leaching off her 2 million dollars in cash & jewelry that Ace gave her as a wedding present. This lead Lester to get worked over in a restaurant parking lot by Ace's goons with a terrified Ginger forced to watch.As Ginger got more and more into snorting coke she became easy pickings for Nicky who got her to become his squeeze or woman in him supplying her, through his mob connections, with the white stuff. Soon Ginger got so hooked on both drugs and Nicky that she started to abuse her and Ace's 9 year old daughter Amy, Erika Von Tagen, by tying her up in bed as the two were out at night painting the town red behind Ace's back. It's when the word came back to Nicky's boss back east that he's fooling around with Ace's wife it was decided that he, despite being a made man in the Mafia, was more trouble them he was worth. A hit was set up for both Nicky and his equally psychotic kid brother deli owner Dominick, Philip Surian,who likes to spit in his costumers food especially cops whom he was forced to pay off. In a secret meeting site held in a deserted Indiana corn field both Nicky & Dominick were met by mobster and good friend Frank Marino,Frank Vincent, and his boys to talk over business. What was later to happen to the two sadistic creeps is far too brutal and shocking to be put down on paper!***SPOILERS*** When the film ""Casino"" is just about over we finally get to see what exactly happened to the what looked like at first the late and dismembered Samuel ""Ace"" Rothstein who's doing all the narrations in the movie. But by then with all the action and sub-plots in the film Ace's fate wasn't anything to write home, or in a movie review, about anyway!

6,GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York,"Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way.",goodfellas vegas it was better new york,scorsese de niro pesci team up again goodfellas rehash casino is not bad film but it pales comparison what has come before it it would be much easier applaud casino if we could take it its own merits but parallels goodfellas are so numerous so obvious casino always leaves us wanting more weve seen this all before weve seen it done better casino starts quite literally with bang with rather shocking car bombing before opening titles have even rolled its fascinating highly intriguing opening but casino never is able sustain that energy film slogs along three hours with pace so slow that at times movie seems come dead stop scorsese has even his most brilliant successes been criticized pacing or lack thereof his films casino is prime example scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if action could have been pushed along just little bit faster theres terrific story here top notch acting performances typically brilliant scorsese visual touches whats missing is energy film like goodfellas had all that casino has going it end its simply not entertaining enough after shock opening sequence casino goes back time ten years tell story ace rothstein as played by robert de niro we see he is running behalf midwestern mob bosses tangiers casino las vegas through use voice over narration la goodfellas rothstein later joe pescis nicky santoro explain how money moves through casino into hands mafia kingpins as story begins everybodys getting paid everythings running smoothly everybodys happy when mafia tough guy santoro played wonderfully by pesci who could do this type thing his sleep takes up residence vegas things start unravel santoros hothead out make quick buck himself where rothstein had been free operate his casino peace when santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention authorities rothsteins wife ginger is not helping matters by being constantly drunk stoned or drunk stoned sharon stone plays ginger character is such train wreck its hard really evaluate stones performance shes certainly convincing as glamorous call girl early perhaps less convincing when shes forced be hysterically screaming all time anyhow ace ends up having problems with wife problems with authorities problems with his onetime good friend nicky its fascinating see all conflict swirl around him de niro is reliably brilliant his performance as he deals with all madness around him pesci is terrific stone is ok actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work james woods does well bit part as man who is part gingers past frank vincent goodfellas parallel number 8 362 or thereabouts settles into his mobsters role quite easily don rickles dick smothers all people have serious parts play each does fine job so acting certainly isnt problem main characters some secondary ones are wonderfully developed casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect scorsese story is good one intriguing beginning end its that long journey beginning end where casino stumbles somewhat it just takes too long get where were going film cant sustain energy it opened with fascinating story but end one that with better pace could have been told much more entertaining way,0.5389402834608314,0.18195333965881902,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.51}"
5,"Even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself.","The opening 30 minutes or so of ""Casino"" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist—nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero—providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film ""The Departed"" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece ""GoodFellas,"" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of—I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress—but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in ""Casino."" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie—the middle in particularly—really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that ""Casino"" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from ""GoodFellas,"" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of ""Casino"" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing.",even though technique is pure storytelling seems half baked uninterested itself,opening 30 minutes or so casino embodies everything that i adore about pre 21st century martin scorsese cinema most particularly excellent craftsmanship he seems have lost his grip recent years as picture begins we get this fabulous quasi documentary narrative with robert de niro as films protagonist nobody with any sense morality can call mob figure hero providing us all details what hes been given say is fascinating way scorsese coordinates his camera is superb technique is pure edits are crisp clean there are none those horrendous your face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film departed clean through heart amount detailed information presented entertaining way scorsese his co screenwriter nicolas pileggi both whom collaborated 1990 gangster masterpiece goodfellas are certainly be commended as researchers this fabulous first half hour they know just when where tell us data about how mob ran las vegas casino when show us they tell us who watches who during big gambling night show us splendid detail how get rid cardsharp by giving him bogus heart attack unfortunately me once sharon stone as prostitute who sets protagonists heart aflame enters picture everything begins drag this is not negative reflection sharon stones performance not only is this her best piece work that im aware i personally do not think shes untalented as actress but she gives best performance entire movie there isnt bad performance really but she does dominate everybody else casino so its not her acting that wears out movie me its pretentious uninteresting melodrama that follows her tracks pseudo romantic dynamic between de niro stone is at heart just old fashioned gangster his moll story with feisty woman first being pushed around then pushing back standing up boyfriend with gun why does this dynamic go wrong because screenplay tries make something monumentally important out it all it tries go deep explore psyches both characters takes them out casino into deserts apartments las vegas attempts bring psychologically fascinating angle their relationship here it completely falls apart remaining two half hours movie middle particularly really begins drag other problem with this relationship is that de niros character is not interesting when movie tries explore his depth as person hes much more interesting old fashioned personality rough touch silent but deadly casino manager who save his cameras supervises everything that goes his establishment once he gets all mucky muggy with stone fascination is wiped clean slate as was my ability stay interested i wish that casino had stayed inside casinos not gone into deserts apartments swamps outer las vegas me heart movie was contained that big luxurious building with omnipresent colors i do not see why movie could not have just stayed there told its story that setting venturing outside only when necessary obviously its based true events but since true events as told screen become this dull whats point even joe pesci essentially repeating his performance goodfellas seems have little purpose outside casino theres some promising sequences with him forcing de niro come down middle night get him fifty million dollar chips gambling rage but once again once story leaves casino starts getting involved with all other stuff it goes downhill but filmmakers credit having pesci narrate part story does make his denouement all more surprising i will not give away exactly what happens but way things unfold toward end with pescis narration almost completely eradicating de niros really does leave audience unexpected what eventually turns out its brilliant touch i admired physical production values casino as much as any great looking movie ive ever seen scorseses flair as director is very impressive but even though technique is pure storytelling seems half baked uninterested itself thats coldest feeling movie can possibly give you whether its representational or not when you get notion that filmmaker lost interest story he was telling its all nothing,0.46616852414724747,0.14935199257007772,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.34}"
