6.0,"Great scenes, great setting, decent story, mediocre direction...","Rum Diary (2011)If you're looking for the craziness of later Hunter S. Thompson, you'll find shreds of it here. In a way this is a more cogent movie than say ""Fear and Loathing"" but it's also a bit prosaic beneath the wilder stuff that peppers the surface. Johnny Depp stars and runs the show in his usual strong if uninspired way as a new, hard-drinking reporter with a failing English language newspaper in Puerto Rico.There is a true surface here that's pretty amazing--the cars, the low down rot of the apartments, the racism between the rich white Americans and the indigenous Puerto Ricans. The depth you might expect and want here is slim, however, even though all the pieces are in play for a great drama--a charming troubled writer in a land filled with prejudice and violence and great natural beauty. It pushes the clichés too hard, and it's generally agreed (even by Thompson) that the material is weak and ""rambling."" The movie doesn't rearrange it enough to make it work.You can in a way watch this for those surfaces, if you don't need too much more. There are several secondary characters who do their best to be a bit insane, including Giovanni Ribisi as a drugged out waif of a reporter, something like what Thompson himself might have become later in life. (See of course the Depp in the imperfect 1998 ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" for a sense of the famous freewheeling selfish addled sometimes brilliant Thompson.)The director here also adapted Thompson's book and if he gets the credit for the nice ambiance of the film he also gets the burden of how clunky, choppy, and sometimes slow it is, even with such exciting material. It's not a horror, it's watchable, but you'll flag here and there. Even the end, without giving a thing away, is a bit deflating.",great scenes great setting decent story mediocre direction,rum diary 2011 if youre looking craziness later hunter s thompson youll find shreds it here way this is more cogent movie than say fear loathing but its also bit prosaic beneath wilder stuff that peppers surface johnny depp stars runs show his usual strong if uninspired way as new hard drinking reporter with failing english language newspaper puerto rico there is true surface here thats pretty amazing cars low down rot apartments racism between rich white americans indigenous puerto ricans depth you might expect want here is slim however even though all pieces are play great drama charming troubled writer land filled with prejudice violence great natural beauty it pushes clich s too hard its generally agreed even by thompson that material is weak rambling movie doesnt rearrange it enough make it work you can way watch this those surfaces if you dont need too much more there are several secondary characters who do their best be bit insane including giovanni ribisi as drugged out waif reporter something like what thompson himself might have become later life see course depp imperfect 1998 fear loathing las vegas sense famous freewheeling selfish addled sometimes brilliant thompson director here also adapted thompsons book if he gets credit nice ambiance film he also gets burden how clunky choppy sometimes slow it is even with such exciting material its not horror its watchable but youll flag here there even end without giving thing away is bit deflating,0.5985250229568412,0.12342745638200182,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,A labor of love for Johnny Depp who came to know Hunter S Thompson very well.,"For me the backstory was even more interesting than the movie. In his younger days Thompson wrote the manuscript for ""Rum Diary"" but it had been left unfinished and unpublished. In more recent years Depp discovered it in Thompson's basement among other things and through a collaborative effort with others trimmed, polished and published the book. Now it is this movie, a very interesting one.It is set in 1960 and Johnny Depp as Kemp is a struggling author who goes to Puerto Rico for a newspaper job. He gets hired then finds out he was the only applicant. The newspaper wasn't doing that well and the office morale wasn't particularly high. As Kemp gets around he gets into the social circle of Aaron Eckhart as Sanderson, a wealthy man with a pretty young girlfriend. Kemp is smitten with the girl, and tolerates Sanderson. But Sanderson and his associates are putting together a land deal, to build hotels and a resort, not totally above-board. They hire Kemp as a writer who can help them make their case look favorable. We never really get into the real estate deal, it just provides the reason for the scenes that come after.Kemp's sidekick is Michael Rispoli as news photographer Sala. He must be a New Yorker, I kept imagining I was hearing Danny Devito in ""Romancing the Stone."" He was a good addition to the story.Very pretty Amber Heard, who looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson but prettier and more refined is Sanderson's girlfriend, Chenault. Her face was very familiar as I saw her this season on the now cancelled TV series ""Playboy Club"" as one of the bunnies. She is a good enough actress and with her looks I think we will be seeing her in more roles.Befitting the title there is a lot of rum-drinking in the movie, plus some cock-fighting, nude swimming, and sailing. While it is not autobiographical the fictional Kemp is certainly quite close to the author's own character. Depp is of course quite good. The critic Ebert has a very fair and accurate review.",labor love johnny depp who came know hunter s thompson very well,me backstory was even more interesting than movie his younger days thompson wrote manuscript rum diary but it had been left unfinished unpublished more recent years depp discovered it thompsons basement among other things through collaborative effort with others trimmed polished published book now it is this movie very interesting one it is set 1960 johnny depp as kemp is struggling author who goes puerto rico newspaper job he gets hired then finds out he was only applicant newspaper wasnt doing that well office morale wasnt particularly high as kemp gets around he gets into social circle aaron eckhart as sanderson wealthy man with pretty young girlfriend kemp is smitten with girl tolerates sanderson but sanderson his associates are putting together land deal build hotels resort not totally above board they hire kemp as writer who can help them make their case look favorable we never really get into real estate deal it just provides reason scenes that come after kemps sidekick is michael rispoli as news photographer sala he must be new yorker i kept imagining i was hearing danny devito romancing stone he was good addition story very pretty amber heard who looks lot like scarlett johansson but prettier more refined is sandersons girlfriend chenault her face was very familiar as i saw her this season now cancelled tv series playboy club as one bunnies she is good enough actress with her looks i think we will be seeing her more roles befitting title there is lot rum drinking movie plus some cock fighting nude swimming sailing while it is not autobiographical fictional kemp is certainly quite close authors own character depp is course quite good critic ebert has very fair accurate review,0.5041462948815889,0.2953377259994907,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,Waste of time,"This movie can be summed up in one word: boring. There's no story line, no jokes, no drama, no excitement, the dialogues are shale, bordering, to the ridicule. The characters are shallow and predictable, clichés all along. Depp is at his lowest, he seems like bored by himself. I've never seen him acting so lousy, he seems to have totally lost it. As for Amer Heard, the less screen time she gets the better. It's beyond me why she has been cast in the first place. It's obvious her talent lies with another movie genre with a more visual focus and very little dialogues. A most disappointing experience. So spare yourself this disappointment and employ your time with a more useful endeavor. For example reading the book.",waste time,this movie can be summed up one word boring theres no story line no jokes no drama no excitement dialogues are shale bordering ridicule characters are shallow predictable clich s all along depp is at his lowest he seems like bored by himself ive never seen him acting so lousy he seems have totally lost it as amer heard less screen time she gets better its beyond me why she has been cast first place its obvious her talent lies with another movie genre with more visual focus very little dialogues most disappointing experience so spare yourself this disappointment employ your time with more useful endeavor example reading book,0.445,-0.0896875,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.47, 'Fear': 0.24}"
,A review for people who don't know about Hunter S Thompson,"I'm one of the uncultured folks who never read a word of Hunter S. Thompson in my life. If that describes you, too, then read on.The appeal of this film is geared toward the cult following of HST, capitalizing on the quirky ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" vibe that Johnny Depp created for the character. Apparently Depp was HST's friend in life, so we can expect a respectful, if not accurate, portrayal. Who knows if that's truly the case, but the Depp character is very likable and unique.The character comes across as intelligent, always seeming to understand things 1 level deeper than everyone else; however he never comes across as condescending, judgmental or cynical. That's the real beauty to me. For example he can sit and listen to his friend, a drunken Hitler fan, say some pretty racy and racist things, and he doesn't say a word. But in that deer-eyed look that only Depp can do, we feel the comedy of the awkward situation without feeling the bitterness of, say, someone rolling their eyes or sighing in exasperation.It's that innocent-yet-worldly approach that makes his performance such a treat to watch. The opening scene sets the character's tone for the entire film: he awakens in a hotel room looking like he had just spent the night drinking a small bathtub of booze. The locked mini bar has been ravaged as if by a pack of crazed ferrets. The room service guy stares in disbelief as Depp says, ""I avoid alcohol"" and then with that boyish smile ""when I can."" What can I say, that had me rolling right off the bat. The whole movie is somewhat low-key like that. There are no big punchlines, pratfalls or sight gags, but there are some absolutely classic moments like that which make you feel like you're part of an inside joke.The story itself? Well here's where I do know something about the book: many things were changed, and the ending itself was watered down. But it's still entertaining with a message: it's the story of a lone crusader who uses the power of journalism to battle the corrupt commercial powers invading Puerto Rico. I have to admit that the ending left me a little unsatisfied but not because it was weak. I didn't like it because it sorta injected a clichéd, Hallmark-channel-type scene when this film is certainly not Hallmark-channel material. But really that was just a 30 second scene, and aside from that I thought the film was well presented.Of course there will be comparisons to Terry Gilliam's ""Fear & Loathing"" which established the HST-Depp character and his surreal adventures. Hardcore Gilliam fans might be offended by the mimicry, but I thought it was well played in the same way I enjoyed Peter Hyams' film ""2010"" which was a fan-doomed followup to Kubrick's untouchable ""2001"".""The Rum Diary"" doesn't have quite as much surrealism & quirk, but it certainly has its fair share. There's a psychedelic drug-induced line about a man's tongue that had me in stitches. I won't spoil it, you gotta hear it for yourself.If you're a casual fan of ""Fear & Loathing"" (or maybe even a hardcore fan, who knows), if you like early Depp characterizations like ""Ed Wood"", if you like existentialist comedies about people who seem to be adrift in their own isolated world with their equally outcast friends, you might want to check this out.WARNING: One thing I didn't care for was the way it glorified cockfighting (all the characters seem to enjoy & profit from it). But at least there's no blood or mutilation shown, and the American Humane Association did monitor film production. Still it might be a little unsettling for people who don't like depictions of animal abuse.",review people who dont know about hunter s thompson,im one uncultured folks who never read word hunter s thompson my life if that describes you too then read appeal this film is geared toward cult following hst capitalizing quirky fear loathing las vegas vibe that johnny depp created character apparently depp was hsts friend life so we can expect respectful if not accurate portrayal who knows if thats truly case but depp character is very likable unique character comes across as intelligent always seeming understand things 1 level deeper than everyone else however he never comes across as condescending judgmental or cynical thats real beauty me example he can sit listen his friend drunken hitler fan say some pretty racy racist things he doesnt say word but that deer eyed look that only depp can do we feel comedy awkward situation without feeling bitterness say someone rolling their eyes or sighing exasperation its that innocent yet worldly approach that makes his performance such treat watch opening scene sets characters tone entire film he awakens hotel room looking like he had just spent night drinking small bathtub booze locked mini bar has been ravaged as if by pack crazed ferrets room service guy stares disbelief as depp says i avoid alcohol then with that boyish smile when i can what can i say that had me rolling right off bat whole movie is somewhat low key like that there are no big punchlines pratfalls or sight gags but there are some absolutely classic moments like that which make you feel like youre part inside joke story itself well heres where i do know something about book many things were changed ending itself was watered down but its still entertaining with message its story lone crusader who uses power journalism battle corrupt commercial powers invading puerto rico i have admit that ending left me little unsatisfied but not because it was weak i didnt like it because it sorta injected clich d hallmark channel type scene when this film is certainly not hallmark channel material but really that was just 30 second scene aside that i thought film was well presented course there will be comparisons terry gilliams fear loathing which established hst depp character his surreal adventures hardcore gilliam fans might be offended by mimicry but i thought it was well played same way i enjoyed peter hyams film 2010 which was fan doomed followup kubricks untouchable 2001 rum diary doesnt have quite as much surrealism quirk but it certainly has its fair share theres psychedelic drug induced line about mans tongue that had me stitches i wont spoil it you gotta hear it yourself if youre casual fan fear loathing or maybe even hardcore fan who knows if you like early depp characterizations like ed wood if you like existentialist comedies about people who seem be adrift their own isolated world with their equally outcast friends you might want check this out warning one thing i didnt care was way it glorified cockfighting all characters seem enjoy profit it but at least theres no blood or mutilation shown american humane association did monitor film production still it might be little unsettling people who dont like depictions animal abuse,0.5286103330220977,0.07605820105820107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
5.0,Lacks Coherency or Flair,"The film begins with main character Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) waking up in a luxurious hotel room in Puerto Rico after a heavy night of drinking. After chomping down a few aspirin, Kemp stumbles into the editors office of the San Juan Star and is given a dead end writing job. After a few chance encounters, Kemp becomes the center of intrigue and corruption while consuming copious amounts of alcohol.""The Rum Diary"" was originally a novella from the twisted mind of Hunter S. Thompson an eccentric journalist and novelist who in addition to smoking, snorting, injecting, drinking every drug, alcohol and carcinogen known to man, managed to change the face of journalism by calling it as he sees it. His writing can repel and enchant with equal measure and has a breakneck spontaneity which is rivaled by its frazzled incoherency.Incoherency would be the best word to describe this film. The story lacks any kind of focus jumping from a love story, a corrupt land deal, drunken antics, workplace politics and racial tensions. Watching ""The Rum Diary"" was like talking to a drunk grad student; little flashes of genius may linger but after what seems like four hours you realize you're talking to a drunken idiot and looking for the door.Thompson's other work adapted to screen shares a similar inconsistency but say what you will about ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" at least it was interesting. Director Bruce Robinson seems unsure behind the camera trying desperately to balance themes and while Terry Gilliam threw spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks, Robinson compensates by drawing out its screen time and keeping the camera-work and editing as dull and uninspiring as possible.The films only saving grace is the inclusion of Giovanni Ribisi as a cirrhosis addled, syphilitic cohort who takes LSD while listening to records of Nazi propaganda. His arguments with the Star's head editor (Richard Jenkins) provide some of the few precious moments of humor.The epilogue appears while Johnny Depp sails into the horizon explaining that while its the end of the story ""...its the beginning of another."" I would have liked to have seen the other story. At least by then the sardonic wit of Thompson was finally present.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",lacks coherency or flair,film begins with main character paul kemp johnny depp waking up luxurious hotel room puerto rico after heavy night drinking after chomping down few aspirin kemp stumbles into editors office san juan star is given dead end writing job after few chance encounters kemp becomes center intrigue corruption while consuming copious amounts alcohol rum diary was originally novella twisted mind hunter s thompson eccentric journalist novelist who addition smoking snorting injecting drinking every drug alcohol carcinogen known man managed change face journalism by calling it as he sees it his writing can repel enchant with equal measure has breakneck spontaneity which is rivaled by its frazzled incoherency incoherency would be best word describe this film story lacks any kind focus jumping love story corrupt land deal drunken antics workplace politics racial tensions watching rum diary was like talking drunk grad student little flashes genius may linger but after what seems like four hours you realize youre talking drunken idiot looking door thompsons other work adapted screen shares similar inconsistency but say what you will about fear loathing las vegas at least it was interesting director bruce robinson seems unsure behind camera trying desperately balance themes while terry gilliam threw spaghetti at wall see what sticks robinson compensates by drawing out its screen time keeping camera work editing as dull uninspiring as possible films only saving grace is inclusion giovanni ribisi as cirrhosis addled syphilitic cohort who takes lsd while listening records nazi propaganda his arguments with stars head editor richard jenkins provide some few precious moments humor epilogue appears while johnny depp sails into horizon explaining that while its end story its beginning another i would have liked have seen other story at least by then sardonic wit thompson was finally present,0.5401587301587303,-0.06313492063492063,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,"LIKE ENGLAND, EXCEPT WITH TROPICAL FRUIT","Ohnny Depp plays Paul Kemp, a New Yorker hired to work at a newspaper in San Juan (1960). The paper is going down hill. The editor, Richard Jenkins, wants new blood, even though Paul appears to be everything he doesn't want in an employee. There is unrest outside, but no one at the newspaper knows what is going on. The humor is fast and witty. The man Paul is replacing was ""artistic"" and ""raped to death"" by sailors.Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone. He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing. He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up. He describes the obese Yankee tourists as ""great whites"" the most deadly creature known to man. They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping. The more you spend, the more you save. His writings tend to be cynical.Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief. Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional. There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, ""Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal."" While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because ""I do horoscopes."" The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson. A local proclaims, ""This country was founded on genocide and slavery...then they brought in Jesus like a bar of soap.""The movie is also critical of the dummy-down media who kills stories so as to not offend their advertisers. In the film, capitalism is destroying Puerto Rico, creating a war of haves vs. have-nots while Cuba turns to communism. A rich man claims, ""Liberals are college educated communists with Negro thoughts."" To them the problem with the world is the communists. The movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.The movie is not all political. Just as you think Paul has reached bottom, he discovers ""a drug so powerful that the FBI gives it to communists."" NOTE: LSD in liquid form, administered to the eye should be done in split drops with three full drops being way too much, possibly causing hallucinations...or so I've been told.Good acting, good script, funny and very entertaining. Staunch conservatives might be critical of the leftist views contained in this Hollywood film. A must view for Hunter S. Thompson fans.F-bomb, excessive drinking, drug use.

1.0,Drear and Loafing,"By the film's intentional anti-climax we learn that Hunter S. Thompson, who wrote THE RUM DIARY about his stint as a journalist in Puerto Rico in 1960, would go onto better things, taking on all the ""bastards"" he let slip by in his youth.The problem is, there's none in this movie worth troubling over, or for the audience to root against. Which means Johnny Depp's Paul Kemp (Thompson with a fake name) has nothing for an audience to root for: other than he's a popular actor that played a pirate who loved rum, and so does this character. (Every time Depp mentions drinking, he's practically winking at the audience.) Doing the same Walter Cronkite mumble from FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, Johnny's performance is so low-key it hardly registers at all. His porky photographer sidekick Sala (Michael Rispoli) has more interesting and memorable qualities since he's sloppy and somewhat humorous. But in this film, there's a lack of anything meaningful beneath the surface... which is an existential odyssey misadventure, sort of... yet it sporadically plants a political flag; but other than clips of Nixon, or shots of poor people being exploited, there's nothing substantial to hold onto.The ""plot"" has Kemp hired as a journalist at a fledgling Puerto Rico newspaper, with the task of making the country seem like an accessible tourist trap, and then conned by a millionaire to be his propagandist – a man who seems nice at first, but has his eyes on turning the gorgeous exterior into a real estate landmine. He has a sexy girlfriend who Kemp lusts after, leading to a brief romance more lacking in chemistry than the film does purpose.As a Thompson fan, and having read his posthumous novel, it's a understandably difficult work to base a movie on. Making it that much more annoying when cinematic clichés – like the scruffy underdogs battling the greedy rich guys, or a drug trip that too easily propels a creative edge – are shoved at the screen: turning a subtle book never intended for publication into a ponderous film trying way too hard to make a point: whatever that might be.For More Movie Reviews: http://cultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com/",drear loafing,by films intentional anti climax we learn that hunter s thompson who wrote rum diary about his stint as journalist puerto rico 1960 would go onto better things taking all bastards he let slip by his youth problem is theres none this movie worth troubling over or audience root against which means johnny depps paul kemp thompson with fake name has nothing audience root other than hes popular actor that played pirate who loved rum so does this character every time depp mentions drinking hes practically winking at audience doing same walter cronkite mumble fear loathing las vegas johnnys performance is so low key it hardly registers at all his porky photographer sidekick sala michael rispoli has more interesting memorable qualities since hes sloppy somewhat humorous but this film theres lack anything meaningful beneath surface which is existential odyssey misadventure sort yet it sporadically plants political flag but other than clips nixon or shots poor people being exploited theres nothing substantial hold onto plot has kemp hired as journalist at fledgling puerto rico newspaper with task making country seem like accessible tourist trap then conned by millionaire be his propagandist man who seems nice at first but has his eyes turning gorgeous exterior into real estate landmine he has sexy girlfriend who kemp lusts after leading brief romance more lacking chemistry than film does purpose as thompson fan having read his posthumous novel its understandably difficult work base movie making it that much more annoying when cinematic clich s like scruffy underdogs battling greedy rich guys or drug trip that too easily propels creative edge are shoved at screen turning subtle book never intended publication into ponderous film trying way too hard make point whatever that might be more movie reviews,0.6166666666666667,0.14342105263157898,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.27}"

That would be Johnny Depp in his portrayal of journalist Kemp, landing a gig at the San Juan Star in Puerto Rico. He doesn't know it yet, but he's being recruited to write flattering stories for conniving developers who want to change the pristine landscape of an unnamed nearby island into a tourist trap with a magnificent hotel. Teaming with an equally sobriety-free photographer (Michael Rispoli), the pair form an unusual alliance with yet another outcast from society named Moburg. I don't think I've seen Giovanni Ribisi in a role I haven't liked, and he plays up the degenerate aspect of his character to the hilt. What it all leads to is a take down of Hal Sanderson's (Aaron Eckhart) latest scheme for scoring millions, while losing his fiancee Chenault (Amber Heard) to the often bewildered Kemp. I got a kick out of the scene with the hallucinatory eye drops, though I thought more could have been done with it. The island cock-fights looked real enough, but the FAQ page for the film here on IMDb explains how it was done to avoid the PETA folks' wrath.

,bad representation of an amazing book,"If you have had the pleasure of reading the great book from Hunter S. Thompson, ""The Rum Diary"" this film is not for you. And even if you did not read the book, this film lacks drama, cinematic style, character arcs, a hooking intro, and satisfying end. I am not sure if the writer/director Bruce Robinson spent the time to really READ the book. It's a DARK comedy, not a lighthearted love story. Hunter S. Thompson (played by Johnny Depp) was very depressed at the time, getting wasting, working minimal amounts, and having sex with any Puerto Rican girl that was interested. None of this was portrayed accurately in the film. One key factor that Bruce Robinson screwed up was eliminating the character of Yemon, which was crucial in the book. Instead this Robinson combined three characters into two, which isn't true to the book and does not work on screen. Another factor missed was the bar Al's which played a big role in the book. This was the local bar in which all the works at the newspaper went to everyday and got wasted at. Besides the two lead characters in the film, all the workers were alcoholics and Robinson failed at exposing the working environment of the newspaper.The ending of the book was tremendous; the boss Lotterman has a heart attack and dies when he thinks one of the employees was going to beat him up. Instead of using this great ending handed to him, Bruce Robinson steered away from that and it fell flat at the end. All in all, when adapting a book like ""The Rum Diary,"" you have to stay true to the heart (balls) of the story. Bruce Robinson missed the dark tone of the book, did not develop the characters and the environment to its fullest extent. On top of that did a terrible job of exposing the beautiful landscape of Puerto Rico, shooting everything much too tight not allowing the viewer to get a true feel of the surroundings and native people.

7.0,Johnny Depp's Homage to His Friend Hunter S. Thompson,"A Labor of Love, Johnny Depp's Homage to Offbeat Journalist and sometime Novelist Hunter S. Thompson is Affectionate, Warm, and at the Same Time Desperate. The Novel was Written Early in Thompson's Career when He first Discovered Alcohol and the need for Journalistic Integrity (that defined the writer's output).Those Expecting the Hallucinatory Visuals and Bombastic, Outrage of Terry Gilliam's and Johnny Depp's take on the Author's most Popular Work, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""(1998) will most Likely be Disappointed. Critics and Moviegoers Reflected this resulting in Poor Box Office and Scathing Reviews.The Strength of the Movie are the Words, the Dialog that is filled with Insights and Rhetorical Rage. Almost Every Scene is Riddled with Entertaining Oratorical Observations. The Look of the Movie can't be Faulted as the Beauty of the Island is Contrasted with the Dehumanizing Poverty. The Cast is Outstanding with Bravura Performances from Michael Siboli, Giovanni Ribisi, and Richard Jenkins. Amber Heard is the Eye Candy. Aaron Eckhart is the Capitalist Villain, a Role that is Not Very Demanding.Overall, it is an Offbeat Movie that does not have Wide Appeal. Thompson Himself Struggled for Wide Appeal, while Maintaining His Integrity and Never quite got there, at least Not Until very Late in Life, as He Gained Respect and Admiration as a Cult Figure.

Thompson in my life, neither having read or viewed much of his written work. While others have his books and posters adorning their walls, for me he is merely a name and something about drugs. I'm not sureFrom watching interviews with Johnny Depp – on Newsnight of all places – you would think this was a political film about 'truth' in journalism. The film only really hints at this, however, focusing more on the fun and wild aspects of the time in Puerto Rico.The whole film, therefore, feels a bit like a precursor to something that never comes, with little real depth or intrigue.

,The Rum Diary,"I have been waiting for the film adaptation of The Rum Diary to be released for quite some time now. I am a big fan of writer Hunter S. Thompson and his books, articles and films made from his writings such as Terry Gilliam's 1998 masterpiece Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Over the past several years I kept hearing that different people were attached to do The Rum Diary movie, but people would back out and just when it seemed like the film was ready it would be delayed. Finally it has been released and I can easily say that the film exceeded way past my expectations of it. I own The Rum Diary, but it has been several years since I have read it and till I watched the film, I could not really remember all that much about it. Basically just minor details. This is not because it is necessarily a bad book, but when I read it, I think I found that I liked a lot of Hunter S. Thompson's other writings considerably better. Fortunately for me the film translates really well to the screen and has given me a whole new admiration for the book and the film has easily become one of my favourite films of this year. The story just briefly takes place in the 1960's where an American writer and journalist named Paul Kemp, goes to Puerto Rico and gets a job at a rundown and failing newspaper as a writer. There he befriends some of the others who work at the paper and gets involved with a shady character named Sanderson, and also falls for his girlfriend Chenault. Throughout the rest of the film there is a lot of humour, despair, eccentricities and a lot that I absolutely loved. When the film version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas came out, it was really divided by critics. Some absolutely loved it and others hated it with a passion. I can safely say that if Fear was not your film, you may still like The Rum Diary. Fear was all about having a good time and partying and seeing all the freaky things that came out of it. The Rum Diary is a much more subdued and low key film in that regard. There is drinking and some partying, but not a lot and it is not the focus of the film. The focus and main message that The Rum Diary was trying to get across is the decline and failure of the American dream, politics, greed and human nature. It is told in somewhat a bitter way, but it is making a point here and is making it loud and clear just as revved up and ready to go as any of Hunter S. Thompson's writings. The thing is the characters in the film know of this decline and it comes to the point where they try and do something about it, but there is no values, ethics or things left to save. The film at times is a beautiful looking film and at other times very bleak, drab and ugly. I say this in a good way because it really strikes home the conditions the writers are talking about and further adds to the message it is trying to convey and also show the lifestyle of where they are living. The Rum Diary is not all hopelessness and despair either. There is a good amount of fun to be had here as well. Some of the supporting characters are so out there and wonderfully unique that they made me laugh out loud several times. I really enjoyed the chemistry and forbidden love of Paul Kemp's character and Chenault, and found it really added tension and other interesting elements to the film. That acting here by everyone is superb and there is not one weak performance in the bunch. The film has the look, feel and style of Thompson's gonzo style journalism and his blunt way of saying things. It strikes home a message that some may already get and others perhaps not. It is important, but remember that there is also a lot of fun to be had here as well. This film is destined to become a cult classic because unfortunately it is doing poorly at the theatres. If you are at all a fan of Thompson, cult films, or just anything different I highly recommend you give this film a try.

I was pleasantly surprised, the director Bruce Robinson has done a great job with this film, which was always going to be a very tough job being adapted from a novel by Hunter S Thompson and technically having next to no strong plot.The film itself is stunning, the locations are amazing and well shot, and the editing style and shots work brilliantly with the type of film and more importantly with Johnny Depp, who has a massive screen presence in everything he does, including 'The Rum Diary'.This film has everything I want to see in a good movie, strong characters, great sets and brilliant comedy, along with meaning. It really makes you think about society and life nowadays and how primarily, nothing has changed in the way the world goes round and the sort of corruption and manipulation that still goes on today all around us, as it did back in the fifties, only less obviously.On a lighter note, this film is hilarious and great to watch more than once, there is something rather satisfying about watch a man drink huge amounts of high octane rum and have to deal with the consequences the next morning, something that makes you happy its not only you.Summary In all I thought this was a very enjoyable film for anyone to watch and have a good laugh at while loving everything about the characters.

9.0,The Rum Diary film review,"The Rum Diary is a drama conjoined with elements of playful humour, based on the self entitled novel by Hunter S. Thompson. The film boasts one of the most critically acclaimed actors Johnny Depp, who is joined by other noticeable stars such as Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight), Giovanni Ribisi (Gone In 60 Seconds) and upcoming beauty Amber Heard. Depp himself is familiar with Thompson when incorporating his novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas onto the big screen in 1998. With this in mind we were certain to expect elements of surrealism with maybe the odd drug usage now and then. The story is set in the 1950's and follows Depp through the character of Paul Kemp who moves to Puerto Rico as a journalist who is in search of work, a good story and possibly something more. With his new job comes new friendships, utter absurdity, vast amounts of alcohol all topped off with a blonde bombshell.The Rum Diary displays beautiful visual strategies in stages throughout the narrative. Being based on the island of Puerto Rico the camera work certainly fetishises the beauty of the island in the same way in which beauty Chenault (Amber herd) is captured. Her blonde hair and blue eyes offer the same satisfaction as long stretching beaches and deep blue oceans. The visual strategies are very creative and often juggle between states of mind that Kemp and others alike are under. This being most apparent in a scene between Kemp and co-worker Sala, when experiencing an unknown drug, which is taken as eye drops. Similar visuals between this scene and ones in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas can be matched, and anyone who is familiar to this film knows that experiences of intoxication are to be had. The hazy and slow motion camera work have been closely thought out to create these effects over us, the audience, as we are able to be a part of these actions.One thing that I have been highly impressed with is the script itself; people have mentioned that The Rum Diary has not lived up to expectations and could have been better. However, this is not my personal opinion and I will offer a different outlook on the matter. My expectations of the film were not high due to these reviews but I am an individual who likes to make my own assumptions. The storyline offered, in my opinion, intriguing characters that all offer special characteristics in the narrative. They have been well thought of and are strong and understood rather than being weak or pointless. Moberg, played by Giovanni Ribisi, is a violent, black mailing, alcoholic who works in the newspaper with Kemp and Sala but rarely shows up to work and on the odd occasion he does he is drunk. The character is built to represent the pointlessness of the newspaper and seems to have worked out what Kemp has yet to learn already. His far fetched logic and actions all add up to a comic effect in the story which present light relief to a dramatic storyline. Scenes involving Voodoo witches and Nazi uniforms add to the surreal yet humorous conventions The Rum Diary offers.As I mentioned, my expectations of The Rum Diary weren't at all particularly high but because of this aspect I think I enjoyed the spectacle more and was pleasantly surprised. The storyline keeps on going and I was never left with the feeling of it dragging on but left wanting more, which the film could have easily done without becoming numb. The characters are entertaining as well as fresh and the surreal aspects certainly are not typical in everyday Hollywood blockbusters. The film is defiantly worth watching in terms of its originality as well as the comical moments and strong storyline.Defiantly a film worth seeing and remembering.

In the book Paul Kemp and Sanderson represent the dueling persona's of Hunter, one being a cutthroat athletic type, the other being the booze-hound anti-authoritarian. In this film, Johnny Depp plays more to the character being a young HST and combines the characteristics of both into Kemp. Some may have a problem with this, but the movie is stronger for it as you are only rooting for the protagonist while giving the story a strong antagonist, a necessity in filmmaking.In my eyes, this is Bruce Robinson's best work on screen to date, Johnny Depp is absolutely awe-inspiringly believable as a very young and constrained Hunter, and the cast could not have been more dead on. I'll be seeing this several more times in the theaters in the coming months.",one king hell movie hst fans,im huge hunter s thompson fan but i was feeling very weary this film since it has been shelved almost year now i attended world premiere last night i can report with absolute sincerity that if you loved hsts work this will not disappoint one problem many die hard fans book may have is with character sanderson book paul kemp sanderson represent dueling personas hunter one being cutthroat athletic type other being booze hound anti authoritarian this film johnny depp plays more character being young hst combines characteristics both into kemp some may have problem with this but movie is stronger it as you are only rooting protagonist while giving story strong antagonist necessity filmmaking my eyes this is bruce robinsons best work screen date johnny depp is absolutely awe inspiringly believable as very young constrained hunter cast could not have been more dead ill be seeing this several more times theaters coming months,0.5541269841269841,0.226031746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.61}"
4.0,Not Entertaining,"Reporter Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) takes a job in Puerto Rico, and falls for Chenault (Amber Heard) the girl friend of Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), who has plans to build hotels on the part of Puerto Rico the US Navy is currently using as a bombing range as that lease is soon to expire. Sanderson hires Kemp to write the brochures to lure other investors. I tried very hard to find some entertainment value in here. The movie was actually shot in Puerto Rico and all I saw were tree lined beaches, poverty laced living conditions, a cock fight, one road that ran along the beach lines, a red corvette, and one modern gated house belonging to Sanderson. No other buildings were shown -- government or otherwise -- no hotels, no casinos within the hotels. I realize the year was 1960, but stillOh, I did also see many, many 1955 to 1957 Chevrolets, which answered a question I always had: where did they go?I tried very hard to find some reason I continued to watch as I was not being entertained. Nothing was happening. There was a lot of drinking, smoking, some drug use and language at times. Main character Kemp seemed to be stuck in neutral. He wanted to write, but was only given horoscopes to deal with probably because his editor knew Kemp was an alcoholic and couldn't be trusted with anything else. Kemp finds himself a part of a secret group of Sanderson investors who want to build hotels on land that may soon be available to them. Kemp is sworn to secrecy regarding this venture but later has a falling out with Sanderson.I tried very hard to determine what exactly Kemp would do in order to make some sense of all this. He had a plan to expose Sanderson for taking advantage of the citizens of Puerto Rico. However, nothing comes of this as the newspaper Kemp was working for goes under and there was no way to get the story out. What to do? What to do? So what was the point? If this was entertaining, I wouldn't have been too concerned, but it wasn't.I tried very hard to find some humor in here and, If there was any, it flew over my head. I tried very hard to like this movie because I like Johnny Depp. He and the supporting cast were fine but the script was underdeveloped and didn't go anywhere. Or maybe, in this sort of autobiographical story, by author Hunter S. Thompson, nothing actually happened to write in any diary and make a movie out of.The only thing I did like was that, when he drank, Johnny Depp's character didn't act like Captain Jack Sparrow channeling Keith Richards.

,Booze Induced Reality,"I have read the book and this movie holds true to the voice that Thompson writes with - this is what makes the movie works. Depp's role, unsurprisingly, mimics his portrayal of Hunter in Fear and Loathing (only with less drugs, not counting alcohol).The movie can, realistically, be summed up in one ""revelation"" Depp's character has with a rather unusual counterpart. Throughout the film we see examples of the opulent lifestyle of few and downtrodden livings of the many. What Depp confides with his ""friend"", allows us to use what we have learned up to that point in the movie and chew on for the remainder of the movie, is this - the banks hold the wealth while leaving us (and the starving children) to stare at empty brass plates hanging on their front doors. Whether you agree with it or not, this is not a stretch to compare with the ""occupy"" movement settling into America and around Europe today.This movie is good. Much like the original book, this movie doesn't try to entertain the viewer; it allows the viewer to sit back and follow along as one man experiences a lifetime of ups and downs in a matter of weeks. And be prepared to go out for a drink afterward, you'll need it.",booze induced reality,i have read book this movie holds true voice that thompson writes with this is what makes movie works depps role unsurprisingly mimics his portrayal hunter fear loathing only with less drugs not counting alcohol movie can realistically be summed up one revelation depps character has with rather unusual counterpart throughout film we see examples opulent lifestyle few downtrodden livings many what depp confides with his friend allows us use what we have learned up that point movie chew remainder movie is this banks hold wealth while leaving us starving children stare at empty brass plates hanging their front doors whether you agree with it or not this is not stretch compare with occupy movement settling into america around europe today this movie is good much like original book this movie doesnt try entertain viewer it allows viewer sit back follow along as one man experiences lifetime ups downs matter weeks be prepared go out drink afterward youll need it,0.4878787878787879,0.16893939393939392,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,A shambolic story about a shambolic man,"Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) joins a newspaper in 1960s Puerto Rico and, from there, he befriends a seedy photojournalist. becomes involved in the affairs of shady businessmen, is attracted to a self-indulgent young woman, drinks far too much far too often, and gets embroiled in sundry other misadventures of one sort or another.I understand that this is based on a recently discovered largely autobiographical book by the late Hunter S. Thompson, and has been produced as a labour of love by Johnny Depp (with whom Thompson was friendly before his death). I know very little about Thompson other than that he was prone to overindulgence in artificial stimulants of one sort or another, and arrived at a premature death by his own hand.It is directed and written for the screen by Bruce Robinson, who was also responsible for Withnail and I, a film which I have so far managed not to see but which, I am aware, concerns a pair of dissolute individuals who wander around getting involved in various misadventures as a result of overindulgence in artificial stimulants of one sort or another. I think I see certain broad themes emerging. In praise of this film, I can say that it seems to summon up its time and place very well, the performances are good, and Amber Heard is gorgeous There is some amusement here and there, but this is not a comedy, and most of the humour was used in the trailer.On the negative side, however, it appears to me that it is perhaps a bit too faithfully adapted from the source. If the source book depicts a life where someone lurches drunkenly from one shambolic crisis to another, where the events are not necessarily connected to each other and don't necessarily matter very much in any event, then it has been adapted very well. The narrative flow here is sequential, but pretty random. In short, the film is a mess and this is probably because Thompson's book is a mess, and that's probably because Thompson himself was a mess. One admires Depp's commitment to his friend, but it hasn't resulted in a very good film.This was disappointing.",shambolic story about shambolic man,paul kemp johnny depp joins newspaper 1960s puerto rico there he befriends seedy photojournalist becomes involved affairs shady businessmen is attracted self indulgent young woman drinks far too much far too often gets embroiled sundry other misadventures one sort or another i understand that this is based recently discovered largely autobiographical book by late hunter s thompson has been produced as labour love by johnny depp with whom thompson was friendly before his death i know very little about thompson other than that he was prone overindulgence artificial stimulants one sort or another arrived at premature death by his own hand it is directed written screen by bruce robinson who was also responsible withnail i film which i have so far managed not see but which i am aware concerns pair dissolute individuals who wander around getting involved various misadventures as result overindulgence artificial stimulants one sort or another i think i see certain broad themes emerging praise this film i can say that it seems summon up its time place very well performances are good amber heard is gorgeous there is some amusement here there but this is not comedy most humour was used trailer negative side however it appears me that it is perhaps bit too faithfully adapted source if source book depicts life where someone lurches drunkenly one shambolic crisis another where events are not necessarily connected each other dont necessarily matter very much any event then it has been adapted very well narrative flow here is sequential but pretty random short film is mess this is probably because thompsons book is mess thats probably because thompson himself was mess one admires depps commitment his friend but it hasnt resulted very good film this was disappointing,0.5640750915750917,0.05200091575091576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.4}"
7.0,For Johnny Depp fans.,"You have Johnny Depp in high quirkiness. A gorgeous woman in Amber Heard. A film devoted to the late journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who died in 2005. The story is set in the 1950s; Paul Kemp(Depp)is a New York journalist and yet successful novelist that is tired of the humdrum life he is living. Kemp decides to go to Puerto Rico, where he takes a job with a political, but unmotivated rag of a newspaper. The editor(Richard Jenkins), a booze-hound much like Kemp, assigns him the horoscope column and random tourist reports. Paul ends up rooming with an aging reporter, Sala(Michael Rispoli),who is definitely edging the end of his career. Paul sees both those that live in luxury and those that endure poverty and actually ends up making a business deal with a shifty businessman named Sanderson(Aaron Eckhart)and falls in love with his beautiful fiancé Chenault(Heard). It doesn't take long for the shaky business deal to spoil and the newspaper to hit the skids. Kemp leaves Puerto Rico a more experienced man. There is some awesome scenery, but a story line that won't appeal to all. Right before you start giving up on this movie...enters Miss Heard; a damn good reason to stick around. Also in the cast: Giovanni Ribisi, Julian Hollaway, Marshall Bell and Bill Smitrovich.",johnny depp fans,you have johnny depp high quirkiness gorgeous woman amber heard film devoted late journalist hunter s thompson who died 2005 story is set 1950s paul kemp depp is new york journalist yet successful novelist that is tired humdrum life he is living kemp decides go puerto rico where he takes job with political but unmotivated rag newspaper editor richard jenkins booze hound much like kemp assigns him horoscope column random tourist reports paul ends up rooming with aging reporter sala michael rispoli who is definitely edging end his career paul sees both those that live luxury those that endure poverty actually ends up making business deal with shifty businessman named sanderson aaron eckhart falls love with his beautiful fianc chenault heard it doesnt take long shaky business deal spoil newspaper hit skids kemp leaves puerto rico more experienced man there is some awesome scenery but story line that wont appeal all right before you start giving up this movie enters miss heard damn good reason stick around also cast giovanni ribisi julian hollaway marshall bell bill smitrovich,0.5752504638218924,0.24452896310039168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.53}"
