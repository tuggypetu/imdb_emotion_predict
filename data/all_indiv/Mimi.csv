9,Beautiful.!!,"'Mimi' is a well written, well made film which carries a heart.Story revolves around the surrogate mother whose biological parents abandon the surrogacy and the struggle she goes through.Kriti Sanon may have a ton of films under her wings that shows off her glamour but this definitely proves she's more than just the pretty face. Perhaps the first time she's going to be loved as an actress, instead of a model.Pankaj Tripathi , as usual is at his best as a character that drives the story initially and later adds humour and fun when the plot gets tense.Evelyn and Aiden, instead of being a usual 'english couple in Indian film' did invest emotionally as the chatacters who wants a kid. Evelyn did an amazing job especially in the latter half of the film.Manoj ,Supriya and Sai were impressive even as side characters.A. R. Rahman's music score was good but the background score was flawless, both of which flows beautifully throughout the film, adding an extra cherry on top.Overall it is a beautiful film that deserves a watch.",beautiful,mimi is well written well made film which carries heart story revolves around surrogate mother whose biological parents abandon surrogacy struggle she goes through kriti sanon may have ton films under her wings that shows off her glamour but this definitely proves shes more than just pretty face perhaps first time shes going be loved as actress instead model pankaj tripathi as usual is at his best as character that drives story initially later adds humour fun when plot gets tense evelyn aiden instead being usual english couple indian film did invest emotionally as chatacters who wants kid evelyn did amazing job especially latter half film manoj supriya sai were impressive even as side characters r rahmans music score was good but background score was flawless both which flows beautifully throughout film adding extra cherry top overall it is beautiful film that deserves watch,0.4673076923076923,0.3403846153846154,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10,It's a Kriti Sanon show!!,"A good and entertaining hindi movie, in a while.Story is about a girl(Kriti Sanon), an aspiring actress from small indian town, who agrees to be a surrogate mother for an American couple. And what happens when that couple decide to abandon her due to some unforeeen circumstances. How she deals with it, forms the rest of the story.The execution of the plot is very engaging. The movie keeps you glued to the screen for its entire runtime. Screenplay and dialogues are crisp and applaud worthy.Performances by each and every cast member is terrific. Sai Tamhanakar leaves a mark. Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak are adorable as Mim's parents. Pankaj Tripathi is excellent and almost steals the thunder in every scene he is.But it's Kriti Sanon who just wins you over with her range of emotions. She shines and shines bright in every scene she is in. She brings Mimi to life. Watch her acting during the child birth scene and you would be in awe. The fact that she stands out in midst of some of India's finest actors, says a lot about her.The American actors are good too.Blemishes? Very minor. The characterization of John and Summer could have been better developed. Some of their motivations don't make sense. Length could have been shortened by 10-15 mins. The culmination is very predictable and convenient. Makers could have been a little more creative. But that aside this is great cinema.Recommended!",its kriti sanon show,good entertaining hindi movie while story is about girl kriti sanon aspiring actress small indian town who agrees be surrogate mother american couple what happens when that couple decide abandon her due some unforeeen circumstances how she deals with it forms rest story execution plot is very engaging movie keeps you glued screen its entire runtime screenplay dialogues are crisp applaud worthy performances by each every cast member is terrific sai tamhanakar leaves mark manoj pahwa supriya pathak are adorable as mims parents pankaj tripathi is excellent almost steals thunder every scene he is but its kriti sanon who just wins you over with her range emotions she shines shines bright every scene she is she brings mimi life watch her acting during child birth scene you would be awe fact that she stands out midst some indias finest actors says lot about her american actors are good too blemishes very minor characterization john summer could have been better developed some their motivations dont make sense length could have been shortened by 10 15 mins culmination is very predictable convenient makers could have been little more creative but that aside this is great cinema recommended,0.5634666666666667,0.2806333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10,Mimi!!,"Mimi is inspired from the 2010 marathi film 'mala aai vhhaychy' which in itself is a national award winner. Here are the positives and negatives.Acting:kriti sanon has given her best performance till date. I was at loss of words talking about her performance. Her dialogue delivery,expressions everything is top notch. She is a potential star. The supporting cast has done a tremendous job. Sai tamhankar, manoj pahwa, supriya pathak hv ably supported the film.The 'pankaj tripathi' factor:i think appreciating him is an under appreciation itself. This man is a legend in true sense. His dialogue delivery, comic timing, expressions, body language, everything is so inch perfect. He is a masterclass of acting.Climax: the climax is so so good. It left me with a smile and happy tears. After a long time the climax of a movie has impressed me. The film will make u weep at several places. U just cannot take ur eyes off the screen.Music: the music by AR Rahman is brilliant. Every song is so soulful and melodious. Be it param sundari or hututu or any song. But the song 'rihaai 'and its placement will make u weep. Its so beautiful.Bgm:okay so this my only little criticism. The bgm in the emotional scenes is brilliant. But in the comedy scenes it was used excessively at several places. The director should hv trusted the situation and writing(which is brilliant) a bit more.The message:so who is a mother?the one who gives birth or the one who looks after the child or both? A question which would require centuries to answer. And an urge for adoption as well.I cannot talk less about this film and the impact it has had on me. So go and watch the film. Its so heartwarming and emotional.

So I was in a dilemma that whether to watch it or not but since it had Pankaj Triphati in it , I decided to give it a shot and let me tell you I was surprised !! Mimi is beautiful and rarely feels boring . It is perfect in every sense. The comical scenes are just hilarious !! And by comedy I don't mean those double meaning jokes . It's actually good ( the comedy) as it feels natural. The dialogues are just superb !! Especially that one from Pankaj Tripathi, ""I'm a driver Mimi ji . We have some principles ......"" and there is one more dialogue said by an supporting actress ( I don't know her name actually) which is ,"" Life is not what we think , Life is that what we live ."" The soundtrack by A. R Rahman ...... SOOTHING !!!!!!Especially 'Rihayi de' and 'param sundari' . Also the acting of all the cast members especially PANKAJ TRIPHATI !!!!! Man what an actor ! Just brilliant. He's excellent in comic scenes but brilliant In emotional scenes . Kriti Sanon is definitely the highlight. She's proved that why she deserves to be here .. she's just awsome as the Small town girl who aspires to be an actor . Also special mention for Evelyn Edwards , Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak .On the whole , Mimi is an excellent film and a great tribute to all the mothers out there .

7,Kriti Sanon Gives Career's Best Performance In This Beautiful Tale Of Motherhood,"Surrogacy is a process where infertile couple and woman (the surrogate) will carry a baby through pregnancy on behalf of a couple and then return the baby to the intended parent(s) once it is born. While only few Bollywood films like Filhaal (2002) and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke (2001) have explored the complex theme, Mimi takes a step ahead with right message and in right direction.Set in the town of Rajasthan, Mimi tells the story of a dancer (Kriti Sanon) who wants to rule the Bollywood one day. Her aspiration takes a different direction when a local cabbie, Bhanu Pratap Panday (Pankaj Tripathi) contacts her to become the surrogate mother to an American couple (Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock) who are desperate to have a baby. Lured by huge sum of money, Mimi readily accepts the offer only to find that her to-be-born child is suffering from down syndrome.Directed by Laxman Utekar (Luka Chuppi), Mimi is based on acclaimed Marathi film 'Mala Aai Vhhaychy!' by Samruoddhi Porey. Mimi opens on a pleasant note with Pankaj Tripathi's typical comic act where he gives his best to convince Mimi to be the surrogate mother for the American couple. Introduction song of Kriti Sanon followed by her interaction with Pankaj Tripathi is sparkling. The movie becomes more interesting when Mimi agrees to carry the baby for the couple followed by a surprise event which shatters her life. The second half is filled with emotional drama followed by a happy ending. The best part of watching Mimi is that it keeps the serious topics of surrogacy entertaining with subtle humor without loosing its sheen. The movie is 133 minutes long but does not give away any chance of losing the focus as the writing helps to keep the right balance between the drama and comedy.While editing takes a back seat, songs composed by maestro A R Rahman are just passable except for Rihaayi De which is beautifully composed. Cinematography is pretty good with natural ambience of Rajasthan which renders vibrant flavor that goes well with Rajasthani tradition. Mimi belongs to Kriti Sanon who has probably given her career's best performance. The gorgeous actress fits it right to the central character and plays it like a boss, expressing with right emotions. Pankaj Triptahi is electrifying as usual. The brilliant actor just gets better with his one-liners and comic acts which brings down the house. I also liked Evelyn Edwards as Summer who plays the role of a desperate mother while Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pathak and Sai Tamhankar are fine in their respective role.Overall, Mimi has wonderful and offbeat storyline layered with superb performances. Mimi is currently streaming on Netflix and is produced by Maddock Films and Jio Studios.",kriti sanon gives careers best performance this beautiful tale motherhood,surrogacy is process where infertile couple woman surrogate will carry baby through pregnancy behalf couple then return baby intended parent s once it is born while only few bollywood films like filhaal 2002 chori chori chupke chupke 2001 have explored complex theme mimi takes step ahead with right message right direction set town rajasthan mimi tells story dancer kriti sanon who wants rule bollywood one day her aspiration takes different direction when local cabbie bhanu pratap panday pankaj tripathi contacts her become surrogate mother american couple evelyn edwards aidan whytock who are desperate have baby lured by huge sum money mimi readily accepts offer only find that her be born child is suffering down syndrome directed by laxman utekar luka chuppi mimi is based acclaimed marathi film mala aai vhhaychy by samruoddhi porey mimi opens pleasant note with pankaj tripathis typical comic act where he gives his best convince mimi be surrogate mother american couple introduction song kriti sanon followed by her interaction with pankaj tripathi is sparkling movie becomes more interesting when mimi agrees carry baby couple followed by surprise event which shatters her life second half is filled with emotional drama followed by happy ending best part watching mimi is that it keeps serious topics surrogacy entertaining with subtle humor without loosing its sheen movie is 133 minutes long but does not give away any chance losing focus as writing helps keep right balance between drama comedy while editing takes back seat songs composed by maestro r rahman are just passable except rihaayi de which is beautifully composed cinematography is pretty good with natural ambience rajasthan which renders vibrant flavor that goes well with rajasthani tradition mimi belongs kriti sanon who has probably given her careers best performance gorgeous actress fits it right central character plays it like boss expressing with right emotions pankaj triptahi is electrifying as usual brilliant actor just gets better with his one liners comic acts which brings down house i also liked evelyn edwards as summer who plays role desperate mother while manoj pahwa supriya pathak sai tamhankar are fine their respective role overall mimi has wonderful offbeat storyline layered with superb performances mimi is currently streaming netflix is produced by maddock films jio studios,0.5260963142319074,0.24379876244283025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.4}"
