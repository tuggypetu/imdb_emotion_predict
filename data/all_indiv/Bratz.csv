1,By far one of the worst films - ever,"Had I not been forced to see this film because of my occupation (and the fact I have two young daughters), I would have avoided this particular production like Richard Simmons avoids women.However, no such luck came my way on this night, and I was subjected to one of the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly-acted movies of the year.Or in ANY year, for that matter.""Bratz, The Movie"" is supposedly based on those slutty-looking dolls with huge eyes, full lips and no noses; figures which many parents feel imbues their daughters with an overinflated infatuation with clothes, shoes and make-up. Unfortunately, this movie is live action (but still concentrates on the whole ""appearance is the most important"" thing).And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good-looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions.As if any of this makes any difference, here's the basic plot outline: Four adolescent girls (all beautiful with perfect bodies), Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) enter high school. It's also needless to mention that none of these young women has even the most remote acting talents, whatsoever.In fact, I've seen better acting in a morgue. Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of ""Bratz"" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt.But I digress ...Anyway, these four vapid souls enter Carrie A. Nation High School (which is more than appropriate since I wanted to take a hatchet to the projection room during this preview) and immediately clash with uptight beauty queen, Meredith (Chelsea Staub) and her group of ""Heathers"" wannabes.Meredith - even though a freshman - has divided the entire academy into clicks (emo's, skaters, geeks, potheads, jocks, tree-huggers and other assorted losers). Why anyone accepts this pigeon-holing is beyond me, but wondering about this isn't worth the time it takes for a synapse to fire, so ...And while it's easy to see the above-mentioned no-names populating this production, it's quite disheartening to watch a veteran actor such as Jon Voight, who plays Meredith's father and school principal. He not only embarrasses himself in the movie, but has put a stamp of incompetence on what was once a stellar career.Oh, there's also a deaf kid, Dylan (Ian Nelson) who somehow has the power to hear Yasmin singing (oh, and he can spin turntables, as well).The picture's witless conclusion consists of a huge birthday bash for Meredith (see enters on an elephant) and a loud and irritating musical number (it's amazing what passes for entertainment in today's world).My little girls liked this film, but then again they are 3 and 7-years old. Unless you fit into this particular gender or age group - or are in a coma - you will see this entire enterprise as shallow as a saucer and empty-headed as Paris Hilton.Truly one of the worst movie-going experiences since ""Are We Done Yet?""",by far one worst films ever,had i not been forced see this film because my occupation fact i have two young daughters i would have avoided this particular production like richard simmons avoids women however no such luck came my way this night i was subjected one single most shallow insignificant poorly directed badly acted movies year or any year that matter bratz movie is supposedly based those slutty looking dolls with huge eyes full lips no noses figures which many parents feel imbues their daughters with overinflated infatuation with clothes shoes make up unfortunately this movie is live action but still concentrates whole appearance is most important thing while film tries touch friendships being key main message here is that only thin good looking people are worth anything only way make difference world is wear latest most expensive fashions as if any this makes any difference heres basic plot outline four adolescent girls all beautiful with perfect bodies yasmin natalie ramos jade janel parish sasha logan browning chloe skyler shaye enter high school its also needless mention that none these young women has even most remote acting talents whatsoever fact ive seen better acting morgue friends combined talent entire cast crew bratz could be put thimble there would still be room rosie odonnells butt but i digress anyway these four vapid souls enter carrie nation high school which is more than appropriate since i wanted take hatchet projection room during this preview immediately clash with uptight beauty queen meredith chelsea staub her group heathers wannabes meredith even though freshman has divided entire academy into clicks emos skaters geeks potheads jocks tree huggers other assorted losers why anyone accepts this pigeon holing is beyond me but wondering about this isnt worth time it takes synapse fire so while its easy see above mentioned no names populating this production its quite disheartening watch veteran actor such as jon voight who plays merediths father school principal he not only embarrasses himself movie but has put stamp incompetence what was once stellar career oh theres also deaf kid dylan ian nelson who somehow has power hear yasmin singing oh he can spin turntables as well pictures witless conclusion consists huge birthday bash meredith see enters elephant loud irritating musical number its amazing what passes entertainment todays world my little girls liked this film but then again they are 3 7 years old unless you fit into this particular gender or age group or are coma you will see this entire enterprise as shallow as saucer empty headed as paris hilton truly one worst movie going experiences since are we done yet,0.537767857142857,0.07762641293891297,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
7,I actually quite enjoyed this movie,"Pretty much all the reviews were negative so I'm here to shed some light. This movie was made with a 9-12 year old girl audience in mind. Bratz dolls were my favourite when I was little so of course, I bought this movie when it came out. I re-watched it last summer. I still love it. It has the same kind of ridiculousness you'd find in Mean Girls. It's cheesy but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the tunes really catchy (It's All About Me being my favourite). Many people are complaining but so what if they're all conventionally pretty, and like make-up and clothes? This is just a cute movie about friendship and standing out and being yourself. How could there be anything wrong with that? I agree many parts were unrealistic (adult freshmen and the whole seating chart thing), but with a young audience in mind (and a nostalgic teen audience), this movie is pretty good. There's really nothing much that's problematic in it. It's already a lot more racially diverse than other teen movie casts.",i actually quite enjoyed this movie,pretty much all reviews were negative so im here shed some light this movie was made with 9 12 year old girl audience mind bratz dolls were my favourite when i was little so course i bought this movie when it came out i re watched it last summer i still love it it has same kind ridiculousness youd find mean girls its cheesy but thats not necessarily bad thing i found tunes really catchy its all about me being my favourite many people are complaining but so what if theyre all conventionally pretty like make up clothes this is just cute movie about friendship standing out being yourself how could there be anything wrong with that i agree many parts were unrealistic adult freshmen whole seating chart thing but with young audience mind nostalgic teen audience this movie is pretty good theres really nothing much thats problematic it its already lot more racially diverse than other teen movie casts,0.5270833333333333,0.12279411764705885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.09}"

2,thoughts from a grown man about a movie based upon dolls who've spent 100 hours a week at the mall,"Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes. My intentions were a little more pure, on a movie-geek level. Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience). It's a staggering, warped view of high school life, the connections made in 'cliques' and social order, and about the bonding between girls who can't get enough of talking to each other through their web-cams. It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?But for all of this, if one is in the right frame of mind, it's hilarious, even achingly and hysterically, funny material, whether it was intentional or not. Frankly, I'm sure that the filmmakers didn't quite know what they were doing outside of making a big long commercial with the intellectual value of Tropicana fruit punch. But on those levels it almost works at times at looking like an unintentional satire; what is one to make of the symbolism of the heightened security at the high school envisioned by the school emblem and trophies: a hand holding an ax, with little figures holding the axes all over the school in one form or another? It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.Maybe if you're already quite a young girl, seeing this movie might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things as far as real psychological impact. But at the same time if one were to look objectively, Bratz's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect. Does one stick with friends or act individualist or, um, like, go into another clique or another table? How about staying fashionable, in the glammed up style that the girls go to lengths to do- leading up to, of course, the Bratz mobile that they walk out of to the climactic talent show- even in the face of peril? It really doesn't serve any artistic integral purpose whatsoever either. So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb. But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now.

10,Guys - sit down.,"So, my friends and I were searching on demand forever and couldn't find anything to watch. I see this film on the list, no idea what this movie is, but knowing well of the dolls. Thought it might be an animated movie or something else to keep us entertained. So I say ""F*** it we're watching Bratz."" and we did. It's a Saturday night and we are juniors in high school - our expectations aren't high.To start off, let me say that I know for a fact that this film was obviously in no way meant to be taken so seriously. I literally made this IMDb account just now simply to write this review for this movie. I see reviews of other members saying things like (a-hem), ""No-one would in their right mind would write, direct and produce this film, under the impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except for toddlers...and, unfortunately, that peculiar clique...young girls who actually assume that they and there friends are actually Bratz."", or ""If you really have to put ""OMG"" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career"", or even, ""It makes high school seem like a horrible place full of cliques and a mean, prissy, ""boss"" figure that runs the whole school""My God. You people need to relax.We were all laughing hysterically the entire duration of this movie. This is literally one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. But from the intentional overuse of predictable stereotypes of teen behavior/society in general, mixed with a good helping of cliché 'heartfelt' moments, we couldn't help from being amused.The budget was incredibly high. It is undeniably a very quality-made/high-end film (cinematography-wise). So in that sense its also pleasing to the eye. Very colorful. Lot's to look at.In comparison to a movie like Clueless, of course this film doesn't compare. But it is completely different. This is a movie about BRATZ DOLLS we are talking about. Bratz. As in, the child's toy. Expecting a Bratz movie to accurately depict high school life or common social interaction or whatever else you think it should have, is mad.However I do know that this is a film I will never forget.I will always have these fond memories of watching this astonishing film with my friends on a Saturday night. Being blown away by how outlandish it was, but enjoying it thoroughly as a fun movie night with friends.So let's chill out.",guys sit down,so my friends i were searching demand forever couldnt find anything watch i see this film list no idea what this movie is but knowing well dolls thought it might be animated movie or something else keep us entertained so i say f it were watching bratz we did its saturday night we are juniors high school our expectations arent high start off let me say that i know fact that this film was obviously no way meant be taken so seriously i literally made this imdb account just now simply write this review this movie i see reviews other members saying things like hem no one would their right mind would write direct produce this film under impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except toddlers unfortunately that peculiar clique young girls who actually assume that they there friends are actually bratz or if you really have put omg as actual spoken line then i think its time rethink your career or even it makes high school seem like horrible place full cliques mean prissy boss figure that runs whole school my god you people need relax we were all laughing hysterically entire duration this movie this is literally one most bizarre things i have ever seen but intentional overuse predictable stereotypes teen behavior society general mixed with good helping clich heartfelt moments we couldnt help being amused budget was incredibly high it is undeniably very quality made high end film cinematography wise so that sense its also pleasing eye very colorful lots look at comparison movie like clueless course this film doesnt compare but it is completely different this is movie about bratz dolls we are talking about bratz as childs toy expecting bratz movie accurately depict high school life or common social interaction or whatever else you think it should have is mad however i do know that this is film i will never forget i will always have these fond memories watching this astonishing film with my friends saturday night being blown away by how outlandish it was but enjoying it thoroughly as fun movie night with friends so lets chill out,0.5043536155202821,0.07594797178130512,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
3,This didn't get sent DTV why?,"If you missed the ridiculously shallow ego-trip of Hilary Duff ""Material Girls"" last year, don't worry, here's another shallow teen movie for you that steals so much from Mean Girls that it hurts. The movie is based on the ugly dolls with the same name with perfect bodies and lots of money - only in the movie, the blond girl doesn't have any money at all. But don't worry, when she really needs it (for a dress), her friends have gift certificates.Sure enough, no one would like to see a movie with a bunch of fat teens running around acting silly but did the movie have to star four slender girls with attitude problems? Because let's face it, these girls think that appearance is the most important thing in the world. They're seriously not much better than their enemy - Meredith. And by the way - how did the word 'brat' become a positive word? For me it's still a very negative word meaning that your parents have spoiled you.Bratz doesn't want to give its core audience (small girls) a good message. It wants them to realize how important fashion and appearance is - and if you have an ugly outfit on - always make sure to keep a fashion emergency kit with you.

(Note to script writers: If you really have to put ""OMG"" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career) After this monstrosity finally ended, I looked to my friend and we looked to her sister, who then informed us that the movie was horrible.

1,A movie based on doll ho's....what could possibly be bad?,"Actually, almost everything. I normally don't comment on films I haven't seen all the way through, but since I currently work in a cinema and have had to endure snippets of this rubbish for the last couple of days I feel I have seen more than enough to comment on it.First off...walking through the auditorium doors at any point during this ""movie"" is like being battered repeatedly about the head by a deranged thug wielding a piece of two-by-four. You can literally feel your conscious mind sagging in defeat as the dreadful mindlessness of it washes over you. It really is a palpable thing.At no point that I saw did any of the lead girls display anything remotely like acting ability. They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term ""wooden actor"" at least implies some ability, however dismal.All that this movie offers is the most pitifully superficial gratification for the absolute youngest girls. And all the movie seems to teach is that being superficial and shallow is the best way to ""get on"" in life.And what the heck is John Voight doing in here? At what point was he convinced that doing a teen movie based on a set of ugly, under-dressed and over made-up dolls was a good career move?

1,Aaaaugh! My Eyes! My Ears! My Brain! All Ruined!,"Aaaaaaauuuugh!!!! This movie was so awful it makes me wish I had been struck blind and deaf as a child! I watched it with 2 friends, to try for an MST3K style viewing but.... it doesn't work!!! One of my friends became very still, and started attracting flies halfway through the film, and another one became temporarily quadriplegic from watching this! I'm 20... I haven't cried for any reason since I was 12, and this movie brought me to tears. Not from laughter, not sadness... it was SO bad, I had no emotions that could be connected to this film, and I just started crying because nothing else quite fit. If these people tried to perform like this two thousand years ago, they would have been stoned to death. The acting was so terrible, I think I lost my faith in mankind. The materialism in this movie was so... I can't even think of an adequate adjective to describe it... No wonder there are countries that want to see our way of life crumble... after seeing this movie, I almost agree with them. The MST3K guys would be speechless, watching this. It's so awful, no one could possibly lampoon this movie. It's too terrible to properly mock and satirize. I feel really terrible for the companies that sponsored this. They really lost out on this investment. The attempts at throwing in messages about individualism and inner strength would have worked, if there hadn't been the ""be yourself, but dress fashionably to be accepted"" message splayed across this film like roadkill. It's a good thing I didn't have any forks, or acetylene torches nearby... or I would have tried to stab/burn my brain out. I seriously considered gnawing my own leg off several times, to escape watching this film. I actually lost the ability to breathe after about 40 minutes of this film...

10,Bratz hits the Silver Screen!,"What got me into ""Bratz"" is I would watch a couple episodes of the CGI animated TV show; I prefer them in CGI because in 2D their lips look huge. As for the doll line, I am more of Barbie girl myself...Yes! I am 22 years and I still collected Barbie dolls. I only love the TV show and the new live-action film that came out last summer. As I said a million times, I was shocked, surprised and flabbergasted by the negative reviews I would see on the web. I thought the film was an excellent comedy.I love the idea of friendship, though many people find it corny but I love the idea as the girls Yasmin, Sasha, Chloe and Jade face during their first year of high school. I had like films and shows that set in high school ever since I was in the 8th Grade. I love it when Meredith shouts ""You Brats!!"" It's like the film's title would spring out of her mouth.

6,Entertaining enough...but...,"Hmmmm, well, what can you say about this movie other than clothes, hair, clothes, hair, clothes, makeup, clothes and shoes....sorry, did I mention the clothes? Oh, and I think there's some sort of moral thing in there somewhere about being true to yourself, and sticking with your friends. Whatever. On the surface this is entertaining enough - it's as loud and big-mouthed as the lairiest teen at the mall, as brightly coloured and saccharine as a tube of Smarties, and about as deep as a high-heel mark on a piece of tarmac...you see where I'm going with this? OK, but considering it's market aim, this is no bad thing really. On the surface it's entertaining. Sure. It makes sense. It's a 'surface' movie. It's not there to promote debate (all though the way people on the message boards were ranting you'd think it was in the same avant-garde league as Eraserhead!) it's simply there for muddle-headed tween girlies to vicariously live out their make-up smothered, high-heel wearing, uber-fashion ensemble touting fantasies without fear of reprisal. And the moral (however confused it might be) is at least in evidence, even if you do have to dig for it. The main problem I had with the movie was Yasmin's singing, which seemed to have been put through a coda so many times it came out sounding like a 40 year old doing Ashley Simpson at karaoke. Not great. Jade was a pretty poor actress, probably the worst of the bunch, the most sickening moment being her warbling 'Boo yah!' while carelessly slopping caustic chemicals into a beaker that sets off a mini firework display. Oh, yep, she's meant to be the smart one. Chloe was OK, as was Sasha, but the high-kickin' soccer moves and high-spinnin' cheerleader sequences were a bit cringey, especially when it became apparent that Sasha's stunt double was white (so white she glowed, actually). These rooky mistakes really spoilt the film, in my opinion, and without them I think this could've deserved a solid seven, based on its entertainment value. Anyways, like OMG, I'm totally outta here (to quote the Bratz). BFF! Woo!",entertaining enough but,hmmmm well what can you say about this movie other than clothes hair clothes hair clothes makeup clothes shoes sorry did i mention clothes oh i think theres some sort moral thing there somewhere about being true yourself sticking with your friends whatever surface this is entertaining enough its as loud big mouthed as lairiest teen at mall as brightly coloured saccharine as tube smarties about as deep as high heel mark piece tarmac you see where im going with this ok but considering its market aim this is no bad thing really surface its entertaining sure it makes sense its surface movie its not there promote debate all though way people message boards were ranting youd think it was same avant garde league as eraserhead its simply there muddle headed tween girlies vicariously live out their make up smothered high heel wearing uber fashion ensemble touting fantasies without fear reprisal moral however confused it might be is at least evidence even if you do have dig it main problem i had with movie was yasmins singing which seemed have been put through coda so many times it came out sounding like 40 year old doing ashley simpson at karaoke not great jade was pretty poor actress probably worst bunch most sickening moment being her warbling boo yah while carelessly slopping caustic chemicals into beaker that sets off mini firework display oh yep shes meant be smart one chloe was ok as was sasha but high kickin soccer moves high spinnin cheerleader sequences were bit cringey especially when it became apparent that sashas stunt double was white so white she glowed actually these rooky mistakes really spoilt film my opinion without them i think this couldve deserved solid seven based its entertainment value anyways like omg im totally outta here quote bratz bff woo,0.5049777777777777,0.05064632034632035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"

1,One need only read the 'good reviews'....,"...to understand the kind of person that would enjoy this crap.I happen to love teen movies, and Clueless remains to this day one of my all-time favorite movies. Bratz does not approach teen movie fame; I'd rather watch Date Movie again.If you read the reviews of those who gave Bratz a high rating you'll understand the kind of vapid, shallow people this film was aimed at. In fact, I wonder how many of those reviews came from people that were a part of this movie; they almost would have to be to justify this trash.First off, how can I not be offended by the mariachi band in the Latina's kitchen? I've been Puerto Rican all my life and never once have I been that offensively cliché, but maybe it's just me? The acting was not award winning but the girls otherwise did alright...except for when they had to show any ~real~ emotion other than thoughtless glee; then, they failed. Miserably. The montages got old quickly and the singing, oy...It will be a long time before I wash the taste of this out of my mouth. One thing people should understand is High School is ~not~ like this. It's hard, shallow, and harsh indeed, but people simply don't go around like bubble-headed retards abbreviating half of their sentences. Real High School issues revolve around violence, sexual identity issues, peer pressure, not having a CLUE what you're going to do when you get out, etc., etc. If only H.S. were as easy to cope with as this movie made it same; if only all anyone had to worry about were shallow obnoxious girls.

5,"Smarter than your average doll, which is saying a great deal for this film","Bratz, based off the wildly popular line of dolls, is actually a much more tolerable film than the one I was expecting to be greeted with. Rather than a shallow, frothy, candy-colored stroll through ditzy women, inappropriate fashion, and immature circumstances, I received a mildly-entertaining, high-energy romp filled with attractive leads, all of whom at least carry their part with some semblance of conviction, acceptable, if scatter-plotted themes and ideas, and a pleasantly fun diversion through the world that sort of mimics our reality but still finds itself wholly trapped in cinema's, family-friendly kind of reality.Make no mistake, Bratz isn't really a good film and it wouldn't be the first thing I recommend your daughters see. However, for a film that concerns three teen girls who are obsessed with fashion and self-expression, we could've been handed a much more harmful piece of cinema. Even as a male child, I always wondered why so much outrage and hate was directed at Barbie, who predicated herself off of being a good-natured sweetheart, was always the subject of vehement feminist controversy while the Bratz doll-line went under the radar, with their skimpy attire, makeup-heavy faces, and distracting artificiality. You want to talk about giving young girls the false sense of beauty and exercising the gender roles? The Bratz essentially were telling them not to leave the house without a tube-top, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.Bratz follows four lifelong best-friends - Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) - as they enter high school with an attitude to keep each other as close as possible. However, they are heavily burdened by the idea that the self-indulgent, wildly narcissistic class president Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Kane) wants to identify every student by what clique they should belong to, forcing nothing but social segregation in the already ominous halls of high school. Of course, Meredith finds the free-spirited girls disgusting and offsetting to her plan, but finds little to worry after two years of high school.Yes, by junior year, the lifelong friends have become nothing but faces in crowded hallways to each other, drifting towards their own sort of cliques, falling victim to Meredith's plan to keep all students part of their own little class of people. Cloe becomes invested in soccer, Sasha becomes a gifted and determined cheerleader, Jade embraces her inner-scientist with the chemistry club, and Yasmin sort of watches it all happen, while quietly participating in journalism. Yet the girls are brought together by four colossal, incredulous misunderstands at lunchtime, which reminds them that they have fallen prey to Meredith's system. Upon reuniting the group to prove that they can still be inseparable and devoted to each other, Meredith sets out to destroy the girls by recreating the party she threw for her sweet sixteen, making it even bigger and better, which she hopes will propel herself to the known voice of the school while the four girls wallow in their shame.I laud Bratz for at least doing what I never thought would be done in one of the most ostensibly shallow teen films of the last decade, which is etch some solid, vital commentary about high school into its material. While many films have addressed the abundance of cliques and groups in high school, Bratz recognizes the problem with it, which is that kids get the idea that they shouldn't be seen with kids of different cliques, which stunts their emotional and mental growth all the more. Yes, Bratz would be better if it didn't make the cliques so overblown and farcical that they tread the line of being part of a high school satire, but its acknowledgment of a real problem in a pleasantly real way is actually heartwarming to say the least.Then there's the abundance of singing, dancing, and just hanging out these girls do, which is surprisingly fun and enjoyable, given how shallow it sounds. These are teen girls being teen girls, minus the sarcastic and childish lingo utilized on contemporary kids shows like iCarly and Victorious, but also without the biting wit and commentary of something like Mean Girls, one of this particular's decades smartest teen films.Bratz essentially wants to be a flashier, more stylistically-potent Mean Girls, but its reliance on scenes that are too goofy and ridiculous to be taken seriously and its repetitive nature are what hinder it from living up to what it could be. The visuals are eye-popping, the music is catchy, if existing from the often forgettable subgenre of bubblegum pop that expires quickly, and the four leads are all charming with their smiley charisma and micro-mini fashionista sense, but the film simply has too much going on to really settle on a focus and it bogged down by scenes that are either not funny or heavy-handed in their moralizing. But the fact that there's moralizing in a film called Bratz, taken from the line of dolls that look the way they do, is surprising enough, giving the film much more leverage and likability than I could've ever imagined.Starring: Skyler Shaye, Nathalia Ramos, Logan Browning, Janel Parrish, and Chelsea Kane.

10,A true masterpiece.,"This is the best movie I've ever seen. The people who wrote the script are literary geniuses; the director had the best creative vision of the century. Honestly, I think if Charles Dickens were alive to read the original script, he would be blown away. So would Fyodor Dostoevsky and Shakespeare. The movie is too fantastic for words.The cast is phenomenal. I would absolutely love to get a window into the personal lives of all of the female actresses; I wonder what techniques they used before each scene? I'm guessing Stanislavski's. How else could they be such excellent role models for young girls around the world? They are all at exciting points in their career right now. They are on the cusp of an astounding revolution. Their talent surpasses that of iconic actresses such as Bette Davis and Audrey Hepburn. Maybe even more talented than Hannah Montana! Their talent as young artists are immeasurable. It can't be measured even with an advanced measuring tool such as a protractor, or a ruler.Everyone who contributed to this masterpiece are all truly artists of our generation.

Not to mention Sasha's too. Jade was the only who could actually sing. And the choreography is so bad that the girls look unattractive. I think the girls were awful influences on young girls. They wear way too much makeup for young high schoolers. Plus, Yasmin is absolutely terrible to Dylan. In the words of Yasmin, ""You don't sound deaf."" There was so much wrong with that whole situation. Another bad thing was how cliché the whole plot and characters were. The mean/rich girl, the jock, the cute boy, the annoying friends, the sports girl, the cheerleader, the shy girl who has an 'amazing voice', and the smart girl who has a, ""passion for fashion.""

1,I let my case speak for itself.,"This film was doomed to fail from the start. I mean, c'mon, a film based on little sexualized urban ""Barbies""?!?! Its just amazing what Hollywood would do to make a quick buck out of this derivative piece of uninspired pretentious ""image conscious"" POS. The main ""characters"" are just clones of those from yesteryear of film. Put simply, this film just plain sucks. IT SUCKS!!! John Voight, has, up to this point, belittled himself to the detriment of himself...literally. What actor would star in this? Is it for the money or to push up against these ""beampoles""? The main idea of this film is image, just what perception of image as laid out in this film is anyone's judgement.Little kids or fans of these ""Urban Barbies"" may like this film for its ""merit"" but only from a kid's point of view. Adults, please take heed and do your best to try and wipe this film's existence from your mind. Like Morpheus said to Neo in the Matrix: Free your mind.",i let my case speak itself,this film was doomed fail start i mean cmon film based little sexualized urban barbies its just amazing what hollywood would do make quick buck out this derivative piece uninspired pretentious image conscious pos main characters are just clones those yesteryear film put simply this film just plain sucks it sucks john voight has up this point belittled himself detriment himself literally what actor would star this is it money or push up against these beampoles main idea this film is image just what perception image as laid out this film is anyones judgement little kids or fans these urban barbies may like this film its merit but only kids point view adults please take heed do your best try wipe this films existence your mind like morpheus said neo matrix free your mind,0.4834226190476191,-0.0017559523809523802,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
