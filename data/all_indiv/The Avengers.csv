3.0,Waste of Cast and Budget,"In London, the agent of the Ministry John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) are summoned by the Mother (Jim Broadbent), who shows a footage where the Prospero Project that controls the weather is damaged by Dr. Peel. They head to meet Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery), who is a weather specialist, but soon they discover that he wants to rule the world, using his machine that controls the weather. I saw ""The Avengers"" in the 90's and did not like this movie. Today I have just seen it again on DVD and I found again a silly and boring movie that wastes cast and budget. It is hard to believe that Sean Connery accepted to work in this turkey.

3.0,A wasted opportunity,"Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says ""how now brown cow?"" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.",wasted opportunity,is avengers good film no is it worst film ever made no i first saw movie at cinema upon its release at that time i did think that it was one worst films id seen up that point ive watched it 2 or 3 times since then my opinion it has improved well very slightly at any rate apart pervading incoherence i think films major problem is its slightness its only hour half long plot is very simplistic say least its not hard imagine audiences feeling bit short changed when it first came out especially as film was big budget would be summer blockbuster another big problem is casting uma thurman as emma peel thurman has shown herself be fine actress movies such as pulp fiction but she just looks out her depth here i never believed her as top level scientist second her english accent doesnt sound natural nicole kidman whom role was first offered would surely have been better particular shes displayed flawless english accents films such as others hours english actress i also think would have made great peel is joely richardson but studio would probably have vetoed such choice grounds her not being big enough name ralph fiennes was real enigma this film there was nothing wrong principle casting him as steed but he looks ill at ease throughout movie as if hed rather be elsewhere i can only assume hed already twigged that film was going be turkey whats worse fiennes thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them which wastes snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout film supporting cast fare bit better with seasoned pros such as sean connery jim broadbent fiona shaw making most their underdeveloped parts retro chic world original tv series is nicely recreated theres no shortage nice cars costumes locations but whats good about film is easily drowned out by whats bad avengers is ultimately shallow rushed messy affair severely hampered by performances its two leads handled properly film could have been wonderful success all concerned first chapter entertaining lucrative franchise stretching well beyond 1990s instead its one most embarrassing flops that decade original cut film was apparently two half hours long but following negative reactions audiences at test screenings studio hacked film down its present one half hour length this doesnt actually come as much surprise as there is lack proper narrative flow film suggestive chunks explanatory scenes having been cut out just one example towards end film just before they enter sir augusts underwater lair steed peel enter phone box peel says how now brown cow down phone phrase seems be password enter premises but how does peel know it theres been talk here there possibility warners releasing directors cut or special edition dvd restoring original two half hour version i think this would be good idea id definitely be interested watching full version film its highly unlikely be any kind masterpiece but its difficult imagine that it wouldnt improve upon movie as it stands at very least youd have assume that it would be more coherent sadly i dont think chances warners going down this line are high i have feeling that this is movie studio would rather forget about than draw attention,0.46921488308585085,0.070184331797235,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,"Consistently misjudged and lacking laughs, excitement or fun","John Steed is an agent for the Ministry; he is trained to perfection and one of the best despite his belief that the enemies of the past are no longer relevant. When a research laboratory into a weather-based defence system is blown up the main suspect is one Dr Emma Peel, although Dr Peel is adamant that she is innocent. With her being their only lead into the bomb, the Ministry assign Steed to work alongside her and use her to get to the bottom of the mystery  well, after tea anyway.At the time of release I decided to give this film a miss as I felt I had heard too much of the critics having a field day to really be able to view it with a clear eye. Years later though I decided to give it a go on the basis that each year will see a blockbuster getting a kicking from all critics  sometimes deserved but at other time it is just a poor film that critics jump on it. However by the time I had reached the point where Sean Connery reveals his plan to a bunch of partners dressed as day-glow teddy bears I realised that things were not going to go well. Up till this point I had felt that the film was developing a nice little sense of humour that spoofs the idea of the typically English gentleman spy; however tongue-in-cheek humour is hard to do right and it is very easy to turn the film into a very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing.And so it was with The Avengers, a film that has some reasonable moments but is generally an unengaging and rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such. The problem is, this is a very expensive film for one that is just meant to be silly and it really needed to be fun, exciting and enjoyable as well, not just feature some silly points. For me the bear costumes were silly but enjoyable (it is such a weird sight that it stayed with me) but the majority of the rest of the film were just plain silly. The weather plot was poorly done and it never engaged me once.The cast look good on paper but they are lost in the material and can do little with it. Of course in the case of Connery, it may have helped a little bit if he'd even tried, but he is poor throughout and just looks like a man getting paid. Fiennes is well cast and he is very English, it would have been a good performance had the rest of the film got the tone even half right. Thurman is not an actress I really rate and she has turned in too many average performances recently and here is no exception. Fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but for me that doesn't come close to covering a very poor performance where she gets it all wrong. Support from Broadbent, Izzard and Macnee sounds like a good prospect but really they have nothing to do and are pretty pointless in reality.Overall this is not a laughingly terrible film, it is just lacking in any real, consistent value. Some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with the humour being too silly to work and damaging any dramatic value the film may have had. The actors are mostly poor, thanks to the material and an apparent uncertainty about what they are meant to be doing. It isn't the child of Satan or anything but I would be hard pressed to give you one reason why you should watch this.",consistently misjudged lacking laughs excitement or fun,john steed is agent ministry he is trained perfection one best despite his belief that enemies past are no longer relevant when research laboratory into weather based defence system is blown up main suspect is one dr emma peel although dr peel is adamant that she is innocent with her being their only lead into bomb ministry assign steed work alongside her use her get bottom mystery well after tea anyway at time release i decided give this film miss as i felt i had heard too much critics having field day really be able view it with clear eye years later though i decided give it go basis that each year will see blockbuster getting kicking all critics sometimes deserved but at other time it is just poor film that critics jump it however by time i had reached point where sean connery reveals his plan bunch partners dressed as day glow teddy bears i realised that things were not going go well up till this point i had felt that film was developing nice little sense humour that spoofs idea typically english gentleman spy however tongue cheek humour is hard do right it is very easy turn film into very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing so it was with avengers film that has some reasonable moments but is generally unengaging rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such problem is this is very expensive film one that is just meant be silly it really needed be fun exciting enjoyable as well not just feature some silly points me bear costumes were silly but enjoyable it is such weird sight that it stayed with me but majority rest film were just plain silly weather plot was poorly done it never engaged me once cast look good paper but they are lost material can do little with it course case connery it may have helped little bit if hed even tried but he is poor throughout just looks like man getting paid fiennes is well cast he is very english it would have been good performance had rest film got tone even half right thurman is not actress i really rate she has turned too many average performances recently here is no exception fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but me that doesnt come close covering very poor performance where she gets it all wrong support broadbent izzard macnee sounds like good prospect but really they have nothing do are pretty pointless reality overall this is not laughingly terrible film it is just lacking any real consistent value some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with humour being too silly work damaging any dramatic value film may have had actors are mostly poor thanks material apparent uncertainty about what they are meant be doing it isnt child satan or anything but i would be hard pressed give you one reason why you should watch this,0.5523101673101675,0.01713159588159589,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1.0,Not worth weathering,"This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment, but here are a few nonetheless.This is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of ""My Mother the Car"").At any rate, the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.Considering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.The best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.Ironically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of ""Mother,"" IS included in the film. Go figure.Connery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.Quirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.On a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.At any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for ""Return to Gilligan's Island."" Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of ""The Avengers"" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint.",not worth weathering,this movie based popular british tv series is such flop it doesnt really deserve comment but here are few nonetheless this is kind movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit theater again when you consider waste millions dollars sets special effects high powered actors that could have been used such better causes such as oh say big screen version my mother car at any rate film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics bombing at box office it was then rushed out theaters with bad film strategy that relative obscurity would result more bread at video stores considering that ralph fiennes schindlers list englsh patient uma thurman pulp fiction etc were at top their box office draw potential with addition always popular sean connery unique role as villain one would think that this movie would have been sure hit however potential went lightning fast down tubes greased by stinky script second guessed editing incompetent direction best elements original series namely its charm style are absent lot charm came relationship between steed peel but fiennes steed is aloof thurmans mrs peel is cold as ice two appear be sleepwalking through their respective roles with visions fat paychecks dancing their heads ironically imprudent element tv series that was indicative its downhill slide after departure diana rigg original mrs peel namely introduction silly character mother is included film go figure connery s performance as mastermind who can manipulate worlds weather falls flat like fiennes thurman he appears be going through motions script he has no faith quirky aspects original series that were cute amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange head scratchingly bizarre example requisite cameo actor original series features only voice patrick macnee role invisible man behind desk what this character has do with anything other than adding already disjointed script is anybodys guess website competently dedicated series it has been speculated that director never saw single episode tv avengers if you were any kind fan you will immediately observe that there is good reason believe this jeremiah chechiks direction seems lack any instinct flavor original series at any rate with this brand tv series inspired movie making you may find yourself yearning return gilligans island originally hyped as summer blockbuster cinematic version avengers is only spectacular its capacity disappoint,0.555063492063492,0.1620937950937951,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,"Not great, but not the horror everyone else describes","Frankly, when THE AVENGERS was released, I wanted it to bomb--I wanted Hollywood to finally get the idea that ripping off old TV shows is IMBECILIC and almost never successful. Thus, I was happy that the movie did poorly and closed quickly. (I also took a trip to London just as the movie was released, and if you think it was ill-received here, the British took it times TEN.)Ironically, though, it isn't that bad a movie. Not great, but certainly not the despicable mess that most others seem to think.It's been called ridiculous, slow, talky, surreal. Well, what a shock, so was the original series. I've recently viewed the entire 1967 season (bought all four boxed sets), and the show is all those things at times. It is slow, generally, at a very langorous pace throughout most stories. It is talky, since most of the charm of the original was in the dialogue between characters. It was surreal, even ridiculous (The Winged Avenger, anyone? Eeee-urp.)Uma Thurman does a passable job as Emma--she's no Diana Rigg, but who is? She plays the character smart enough, although she doesn't quite capture Rigg's regal command of situation. Ralph Fiennes, however, misses the character of Steed quite a bit, playing him as reserved, without any of Steed's charisma. Steed always had a quality about him that made you feel as if he woke up every morning feeling absolutely smashing--Fiennes seems to miss that.The problem the film faces is twofold: Those of us who have seen the original will always compare the two, and a copy can't hope to compare. Those who haven't seen the series have no grounds to assess it on--(see some of the above user comments which begin 'I never saw the original series...')and since I think this series is not exactly vividly-remembered by the majority of the population (particularly the 18 and under movie-goers, who don't have much grasp of the nuances The Avengers operated on). Frankly, The Avengers was probably just a bad choice to try to remake(--LIKE ALL OLD TV SHOWS. Tell me one old-TV remake that has ever spawned a sequel (which Hollywood is always sure to do when something is a success)-- only THE BRADY BUNCH...point proven?)",not great but not horror everyone else describes,frankly when avengers was released i wanted it bomb i wanted hollywood finally get idea that ripping off old tv shows is imbecilic almost never successful thus i was happy that movie did poorly closed quickly i also took trip london just as movie was released if you think it was ill received here british took it times ten ironically though it isnt that bad movie not great but certainly not despicable mess that most others seem think its been called ridiculous slow talky surreal well what shock so was original series ive recently viewed entire 1967 season bought all four boxed sets show is all those things at times it is slow generally at very langorous pace throughout most stories it is talky since most charm original was dialogue between characters it was surreal even ridiculous winged avenger anyone eeee urp uma thurman does passable job as emma shes no diana rigg but who is she plays character smart enough although she doesnt quite capture riggs regal command situation ralph fiennes however misses character steed quite bit playing him as reserved without any steeds charisma steed always had quality about him that made you feel as if he woke up every morning feeling absolutely smashing fiennes seems miss that problem film faces is twofold those us who have seen original will always compare two copy cant hope compare those who havent seen series have no grounds assess it see some above user comments which begin i never saw original series since i think this series is not exactly vividly remembered by majority population particularly 18 under movie goers who dont have much grasp nuances avengers operated frankly avengers was probably just bad choice try remake like all old tv shows tell me one old tv remake that has ever spawned sequel which hollywood is always sure do when something is success only brady bunch point proven,0.5702288667404947,0.04483665559246955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"""How Now Brown Cow!""","The 1990's saw a vogue for making motion pictures based on vintage television shows, 'such as 'The Fugitive', 'Mission: Impossible', 'Sergeant Bilko', 'Lost In Space', 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'The Saint'. Most ( though not all ) were not terribly good, for the simple reason that their makers were unable to recapture the ingredients which had made the originals so successful. A movie based on the British spy show 'The Avengers' was announced as far back as 1987, with Mel Gibson ( also said to have purchased the rights from E.M.I. ) as 'Steed'. These rumours persisted well into the 1990's, when after the success of 'Basic Instinct', the role of 'Mrs.Emma Peel' was tipped to go to Sharon Stone. What sort of movie would have resulted with these leads we can only guess at, but I am glad that it was never made.Jerry Weintraub, a self-proclaimed fan of the show, hired Don Macpherson to write a script that was true to the style of the original. It centred on a madman who has created a weather control machine, and plans to use it to blackmail the world's governments into paying him for their weather, or else he will condemn them to perpetual winter. It was a witty, imaginative, and outrageous piece of work. As 'Steed', Ralph Fiennes of 'The English Patient' was cast, with Uma Thurman of 'Pulp Fiction' taking up the role of 'Emma'. Weintraub then pulled off another major casting coup - Sir Sean Connery. The former 'James Bond' was hired to play the villain, necessitating a major rewrite. The character of 'Merryweather' became 'Sir August De Wynter', who lives in a mansion called 'Hallucinogen Hall', and is so fixated by Emma he clones her. In a thrilling opening, the clone gains illegal access to 'The Prospero Project', which she destroys. The real Emma is naturally blamed, and Mother calls on Steed to investigate.The film had a decent budget, but was not on a level-playing field with say 'Star Wars' or 'Harry Potter'; nevertheless, it boasts stupendous art direction, cinematography by by Roger Pratt, and music by Joel McNeely. Director Jeremiah Chechik skilfully recreated the look and setting of the series - Agatha Christie England - but mixed with a dose of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. There is humour, but not of the 'funny ha-ha' variety; for instance, the scene in the conference room in which Sir August's henchmen are kitted out in teddy bear costumes. This was intended to spoof similar scenes in Bond films such as 'Thunderball'.Of the supporting cast, Eileen Atkins shone as the gun-toting spinster 'Alice'. Comedian Eddie Izzard played 'Bailey', Sir August's ( mostly mute ) henchman, with Jim Broadbent delightful as Steed's macaroon-munching boss 'Mother'.'The Avengers' was all set for a major launch as Warner Brothers top summer release, but then disaster struck. It registered poorly with a preview audience in Arizona ( why Arizona, for heaven's sake? ), causing it to be recalled for major edits. We shall probably never know the name of the man who butchered the film, but I suspect his first name may have been 'Sweeney'. He took out major scenes, such as the 'Prospero Project' opening, and Sir August's 'Frankenstein'-like creation of 'Bad Emma'.Cut down from a two-hour running time to a paltry eighty-five minutes, 'The Avengers' opened ( rather aptly ) in August to a universal drubbing from critics and public alike. The overkill of bad reviews was enough to destroy any chance the film had of becoming a hit.While the film had its flaws, it certainly did not deserve the opprobrium heaped upon it on its release. Yes, Fiennes and Thurman were not Macnee and Rigg, nor were they intended to be. This was a NEW 'Avengers', intended to be a film for the twenty-first century.Years after its release, the movie has a fan base, whose main aim is to see the original restored. Its worth remembering that Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' was regarded as a boring flop in 1982, now is thought of as a sci-fi classic. I hope that someday 'The Avengers' can pull off the similar feat of being regarded in a whole new light.",how now brown cow,1990s saw vogue making motion pictures based vintage television shows such as fugitive mission impossible sergeant bilko lost space beverly hillbillies saint most though not all were not terribly good simple reason that their makers were unable recapture ingredients which had made originals so successful movie based british spy show avengers was announced as far back as 1987 with mel gibson also said have purchased rights e m i as steed these rumours persisted well into 1990s when after success basic instinct role mrs emma peel was tipped go sharon stone what sort movie would have resulted with these leads we can only guess at but i am glad that it was never made jerry weintraub self proclaimed fan show hired don macpherson write script that was true style original it centred madman who has created weather control machine plans use it blackmail worlds governments into paying him their weather or else he will condemn them perpetual winter it was witty imaginative outrageous piece work as steed ralph fiennes english patient was cast with uma thurman pulp fiction taking up role emma weintraub then pulled off another major casting coup sir sean connery former james bond was hired play villain necessitating major rewrite character merryweather became sir august de wynter who lives mansion called hallucinogen hall is so fixated by emma he clones her thrilling opening clone gains illegal access prospero project which she destroys real emma is naturally blamed mother calls steed investigate film had decent budget but was not level playing field with say star wars or harry potter nevertheless it boasts stupendous art direction cinematography by by roger pratt music by joel mcneely director jeremiah chechik skilfully recreated look setting series agatha christie england but mixed with dose terry gilliams brazil there is humour but not funny ha ha variety instance scene conference room which sir augusts henchmen are kitted out teddy bear costumes this was intended spoof similar scenes bond films such as thunderball supporting cast eileen atkins shone as gun toting spinster alice comedian eddie izzard played bailey sir augusts mostly mute henchman with jim broadbent delightful as steeds macaroon munching boss mother avengers was all set major launch as warner brothers top summer release but then disaster struck it registered poorly with preview audience arizona why arizona heavens sake causing it be recalled major edits we shall probably never know name man who butchered film but i suspect his first name may have been sweeney he took out major scenes such as prospero project opening sir augusts frankenstein like creation bad emma cut down two hour running time paltry eighty five minutes avengers opened rather aptly august universal drubbing critics public alike overkill bad reviews was enough destroy any chance film had becoming hit while film had its flaws it certainly did not deserve opprobrium heaped upon it its release yes fiennes thurman were not macnee rigg nor were they intended be this was new avengers intended be film twenty first century years after its release movie has fan base whose main aim is see original restored its worth remembering that ridley scotts blade runner was regarded as boring flop 1982 now is thought as sci fi classic i hope that someday avengers can pull off similar feat being regarded whole new light,0.5136598670689579,0.054075112597839876,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"

1.0,Please!,"I love the Avengers. Emma Peel was a hero of my childhood. I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies. I was thrilled with the selection of Fiennes -- but Thurman? I was hesitant. Then Diana Rigg passed on being in the film. Another bad sign. Then, the television trailers, yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad. IT was worse than my wildest nightmares -- and I have an excellent imagination. Thurman was as bad as I thought, Fiennes had nothing to play to. Macnee, oh, how it could have improved if we'd seen him. I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke.

4.0,Well it's not as bad as I assumed (and there are MUCH worse movies than this),"This is among the most panned movies of all time since it was based on a TV show. And while I can understand the fans of the original TV show I still don't think that this movie is THAT bad. I would NEVER put it in the Bottom 100 as I can name many other movies that are much worse than this one (FREDDY GOT FINGERED, THE CAT IN THE HAT and DISASTER MOVIE for example).In this full length version of the 1960s TV show John Steele and Emma Peel battle with a duplicate Emma Peel and Sir August de Wynter (played by Sean Connery), a mastermind that wants to rule the world with his weather-controlling machine. And while this plot could look stupid to some, it certainly is! But you can't do anything but admire the extraordinary special effects as well the sets. In particular I loved the special effects (the CGI insects were cool to look at). I personally can't give a 1 to a movie with great special effects and sets, it deserves at least other 4 points for the effects.As for the acting, even though the movie it's bland Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are good in their roles. And it was a surprise for me seeing Sean Connery in such a nasty role and Patrick Mcnee as the Invisible Jones (a small role).However, while the movie is a bit bad, it's watchable and far from a huge disappointment.

7.0,"Falling for the old ""edit out what the test audience didn't like"" trick","Oh, wait, that's from Get Smart, not The Avengers.No matter. As a longtime fan of The Avengers (since childhood), I will say, right off the bat, that this movie did not fail on all levels. If nothing else, the makers of this film understood, at least, what The Avengers was about. This puts them head and shoulders above, say, the makers of The Wild Wild West movie, who had only the most rudimentary (and faulty) knowledge of what made that series an icon of popular American culture.They might not have been successful in the execution, but they did understand what made The Avengers tick, and if the studio heads hadn't ordered extreme and desperate editing, we might have been able to see more of what the filmmakers imagined.Two scenes stand out as perfect examples of this understanding: When Mrs. Peel tries to escape by running endlessly down an Escher-like staircase, and when Steed and Mrs. Peel walk on water in giant bubbles. Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious, conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.Whatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old ""edit out what the test audience didn't like"" trick, and put a botched film on the screen.

10.0,From left-field,"Well I don't know how this one slipped through the studio system but I'm very glad it did. When I heard about an Avengers movie I assumed we'd be getting a bastardised Hollywood formula movie, and it would resemble some of the recent Bond films more than the original series. But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. :)I think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy. This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad, but that's their problem. The comedy style is not a popular one, it's a particular style of generally British humour, best described as complete and utter nonsense. If you have no appreciation for absurdity, then you will NOT like this film.Nothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value, it's all a load of s***. Steed and Peel are full of s***, that's the point. No one acts the way they do, they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other. The world of The Avengers is a place where ""small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all"".The Avengers purposely doesn't explain things, it's not supposed to make sense, that would ruin it. It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine. Small asides from left-field that seem to go over most peoples heads.Fiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg, but I'm not sure they're much worse. Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare, but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel. Connery going nuts was fun to see too. BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there, get it. Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.It's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy, why a film like The Avengers is so funny. Most people I guess will just never get it. I got it, and I'm glad that there ARE plenty of other people who did too.

4.0,Average rendition of the British classic series from the 60s,"It's the cinematic adaptation from the most popular show(produced by Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell)series in England during the 60s what spread its success to United States and all the world.The film concerns about John Steed(Ralph Fiennes),a brilliant agent secret,he isn't the James Bond type, a sexist macho man but a kind spy with wide culture working for the British Intelligence and of course a charm,attractive Emma Peel(Umma Thurman),she's an elegant leather-garbed British spy with great toughness and strength.Both join forces facing dangerous and mysterious situations to save the world ,just on the edge of the sci-fi .They team up to confront against a nasty Scottish ,Sir August of Winter(Sean Connery with skirt included),a megalomaniac who wishes to rule the world by means a weather changing machine.The picture follows the series plot by the writing credits Sidney Newman but with quite flaws .The wonderful relationship TV series among John Steed(Patick McNee) and his female partners(the gorgeous Diana Rigg,Honor Blackman,Linda Thorson,Joanna Lumney) who was subliminally funny and romantic here malfunctions and there aren't the enjoyable chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman .Appear usual character series as Mother(incarnated by Jim Broadbent and in the episodes by Patrick Newell) and strange ,odds baddies,besides a character named Father(Fiona Lewis).The classic Steed ,Patrick Mcnee, plays an invisible agent in a bemusing voice-cameo.

A pathetic effort from a formerly stellar actor.Eileen Atkins was rather fun as Alice, Steed's minder, and the guest appearance by Patrick Macnee was somewhat amusing.As for the writing, well....

7.0,Blame Warners,"I rewatched The Avengers today and it really is a missed opportunity. The reason it failed was not IMO the surreal wackiness, it was that Warners panicked and cut huge chunks out of the film rendering it not only surreal and weird, but missing links in the story that would have tied all the bizarre stuff together better.If you look on Wikipaedia it details what was in the original script, such as the attack on the secret base by the evil Emma Peel that was seen in trailers. I also recommend reading the novelisation, which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had, judging by the book and screenplay, a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like, we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'. They should have had the courage of their convictions, and if they had The Avengers might have been a huge success. One can only hope they pull their fingers out and release the director's cut.On reflection there's a lot to like in The Avengers: Uma Thurman in leather: always a plus, Sean Connery hamming it up more than Porky Pig at a bacon factory, and henchmen dressed as multi-coloured teddy bears.

5.0,Weird flop of a film is worth a look for bad movie lovers,"This big-budget flop is not without its good points, seeing as it contains enough offhand weirdness and odd situations to appeal to most bad movie fans. Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get, there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while, I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.You know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening, which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example, at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film, which is not for all tastes it has to be said.Packed with cheesily overemphasised dialogue, lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie, THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees, characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic ""storm within a building"" scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere, we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman, one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen, and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.Ralph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed, and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel: one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain, and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it, but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere, we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother, leader of the agents, and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).The major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings, which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness.

7.0,The 90's mightiest heroes,"I guess there are two ways of looking at 1998's 'The Avengers' film (and, yes, it has NOTHING to do with the Marval brand that would dominate the Box Office a decade later). You can either believe everything you've heard about it, or just keep an open mind and go with the flow.It's a remake of a British 1960s spy show about a male and female secret agent, generally saving the world with gadgets and an assortment of witty quips. The studio had high hopes for the big budget adaptation and cast two major stars (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) in the lead. However, close to release it became clear (from 'critics,' anyway) that the movie wasn't that good and its release date got put forward while they did reshoots, or re-edits etc, trimming the run-time dramatically. When it did hit theatres, basically everyone hated it, claiming it was a 'mess' and it now lives on only in top ten lists of movies that bombed hard.Yet, saying all that, I quite enjoyed it. I enjoyed it then and I enjoy watching it on DVD every so often. No, I'm not saying it's perfect (or even that good!), but I'm saying there's enough there to keep me entertained for an hour and a half.For a start there's Sean Connery as the bad guy, who's threatening to control the world's weather and force countries to 'purchase' their weather directly from him. Therefore, Fiennes and Thurman must stop him. Yes, it's kind of like a Bond film plot and you can expect the regular punch-ups and car chases that come with the genre.What you also get are some truly surreal scenes which don't make a lot of sense. Now, these could be written just to add to the film's 'kooky' feel, or it could be because the other scenes that explain them were left on the cutting room floor, therefore leaving these scenes' meaning up to our imagination.People also remarked on 'how little chemistry' there was between Fiennes and Thurman. I can see their point. However, it's worth noting that they were supposed to be playing cold and unflappable characters lifted from yesteryear when this kind of acting/social interaction was more common. It's a case where the film tried to copy the source material and succeeded - only a little too well for its own good.Like I say, 'The Avengers' is just about as far from perfect as you'll ever get, but it's not the car crash you've probably heard it is. And, if you're in the mood for a spy movie that's a little bit different and has a mute Eddie Izzard, a gun-totting Granny and a swarm of robot bees, then give this one a go.

The movie is rather odd, so if machine-gun toting grannies, mad scientists disguised as Teddy bears, and a hero that wields an umbrella as his weapon-of-choice aren't your cup of tea (Pun intended. The hot drink features in every scene.), then this film is not for you. Extra points for starring Sean Connery, the original James Bond himself, as the demented villain, a scientist bent on controlling the weather.",i dont care what anyone says i loved this movie,films characters are so british they make james bond look american hated by critics audiences even fans tv show it was based avengers is great as long as youre looking spy movie thats more than little weird ralph fiennes gives brilliant performance as debonair derby wearing agent johnathan steed uma thurman also is at her best as his lovely but lethal civilian counter part mrs emma peel movie is rather odd so if machine gun toting grannies mad scientists disguised as teddy bears hero that wields umbrella as his weapon choice arent your cup tea pun intended hot drink features every scene then this film is not you extra points starring sean connery original james bond himself as demented villain scientist bent controlling weather,0.5676470588235294,0.15269607843137253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,"I'm terribly sorry, but I liked this movie","ok, so it might just be a leaf in the wind but it's not that bad. It was quite odd and in many ways ve-he-ry funny. Now I am of course not talking about poor Ralph nor Thurman, I'm of course relating to HILARIOUS SEAN CONNERY! I laughed my head off at his quotes: ""Peel... Emma Peel"", and ""you all know who I am"". Since this is an agent film, and he is the king of agent... well you know. I'd give THE AVENGERS 6/10 and I really don't understand what's so bad about it. It sure is ten times better than many, many other movies.

9.0,Much better than expected,"In spite of all the negative reviews and the low rating, I have immensely enjoyed this new version of 'The Avengers'. No, it does not replace Patrick MacNee nor Diana Rigg. But it's not supposed to, so that does not count. Yet what positively surprised me is that the film does have the flavour of the original Avengers, that it is full of understatements, and that the acting is in the - difficult - vein of what I'd call 'grotesque underacting'. Uma Thurman delivers a worthy Emma Peel with more than enough man appeal to keep me starry-eyed to the screen for 90 minutes. Mr. Fiennes combines distinction, humour and resolution in a way that is worthy of Mr. John Steed. The plot is original, yet partly predictable - but aren't all of the original 'Avengers' episodes predictable by modern audiences? Isn't a Mozart symphony predictable? Add to this the cinematography that is just delicious, and you have a real audience treat, even for those who consider themselves long-time Avengers fans like me.",much better than expected,spite all negative reviews low rating i have immensely enjoyed this new version avengers no it does not replace patrick macnee nor diana rigg but its not supposed so that does not count yet what positively surprised me is that film does have flavour original avengers that it is full understatements that acting is difficult vein what id call grotesque underacting uma thurman delivers worthy emma peel with more than enough man appeal keep me starry eyed screen 90 minutes mr fiennes combines distinction humour resolution way that is worthy mr john steed plot is original yet partly predictable but arent all original avengers episodes predictable by modern audiences isnt mozart symphony predictable add this cinematography that is just delicious you have real audience treat even those who consider themselves long time avengers fans like me,0.5981818181818181,0.1271212121212121,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.33}"
3.0,Just how bad could it really be...,"It comes to something when the most interesting thing about a film is spotting all the famlliar locations in the south of England, but that's what I ended up doing here! Being a massive fan of The Avengers TV series, I managed to resist watching this film for 20 years. In the end, morbid curiosity took over - just how bad could it be? The main problem here seems to be that the whole film is completely ill-judged. It's like a hotchpotch of lukewarm & half-baked ideas from the 60s TV series - thrown into a melting pot with no real love or appreciation of what made the TV series so special.Ralph Fiennes is miscast as a foppish & smarmy Steed, and never feels like a respected and likeable gentleman from 'the ministry'. Uma Thurman fares slightly better, but there's never any real chemistry between them, and it just makes you long to see the original instead.Why do they drink tea all the time? I don't remember that happening in the real Avengers! Predictable views of tourist London only serve to add to the feeling that someone thinks this will all make it more 'English' & please a section of the American audience who think England is still like how it was 50 years ago.Sean Connery does a good job as the villain bent on controlling the weather with his elaborate machine (nods to the episode 'A Surfeit of H2O' here), but the whole Bond-like epic climax falls flat, & goes down the drain faster than rain in a rainstorm.This whole ludicrous film feels contrived, unreal, charmless and cartoonish. Its only purpose seems to annoy & confound long-standing Avengers fans, and to bore contemporary cinema watchers who now probably wonder what all the fuss was about.",just how bad could it really be,it comes something when most interesting thing about film is spotting all famlliar locations south england but thats what i ended up doing here being massive fan avengers tv series i managed resist watching this film 20 years end morbid curiosity took over just how bad could it be main problem here seems be that whole film is completely ill judged its like hotchpotch lukewarm half baked ideas 60s tv series thrown into melting pot with no real love or appreciation what made tv series so special ralph fiennes is miscast as foppish smarmy steed never feels like respected likeable gentleman ministry uma thurman fares slightly better but theres never any real chemistry between them it just makes you long see original instead why do they drink tea all time i dont remember that happening real avengers predictable views tourist london only serve add feeling that someone thinks this will all make it more english please section american audience who think england is still like how it was 50 years ago sean connery does good job as villain bent controlling weather with his elaborate machine nods episode surfeit h2o here but whole bond like epic climax falls flat goes down drain faster than rain rainstorm this whole ludicrous film feels contrived unreal charmless cartoonish its only purpose seems annoy confound long standing avengers fans bore contemporary cinema watchers who now probably wonder what all fuss was about,0.49046416546416555,0.0712602212602213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,A whimsical delight - more please!,"I am amazed at how well an American film has captured the matter-of-fact surrealism which the mathematician Dodgson(Lewis Carroll)gave to his dream-child, Alice, as also it recalls the more knowing, and oh-so-polite deconstruction wrought by the media-saavy British children of the 60's upon the distressed remnants of England's Imperial aplomb! Of course, as Oscar Wilde may not have said, Satire revisited is only a lukewarm cup of tea. But then nostalgia - especially when the satire was so gentle anyway - has its own charms. And there was, anyway, a hefty dose of nostalgia amidst the cool insouciance of the original. Its very modernity was made to seem almost an expression of polite insistence on whatever surreal manifestation of tradition was encountered. It was the utterly unruffled mien of the original which prevailed over all lapses from reason and good taste. So, at its best, in the new cinema version.This is indeed a brave try by Hollywood to draw us back into that black-and-white psychedelia of swinging sixties British commercial television. The sheer madness of the enterprise almost works - if the money-men hadn't had cold feet at the last minute, we might have been enjoying a really remarkable fantasy film. As it is, we must content ourselves with a merely very amusing piece of whimsy. Even through the plot-holes left by a nervous editor we can see some wonderfully mad logic at work: The Escher-inspired architecture of the baddy's stately home, in which Mrs Peel at one point loses her way, encapsulates this whole dream-trip of a movie.And for those who don't 'get it', I can only say, Humour is like that: Very dependent on individual taste. But even allowing for taste, it is a sad reflection on public taste that 'The Avengers' overwhelmingly offends filmgoers who are probably quite prepared to accept the ever more overblown superheroes of a more violent tradition, such as 'Batman' or 'The Hulk'. Of course, these two are clearly representative of that particularly adolescent taste for the extreme and crude for which the contemporary Hollywood production-line largely exists. (There is every sign that Eddie Izzard's character was originally intended to satirize mega-buck entertainment and mega-buck villains as being really just spoiled brats with their expensive toys.) The genteel quirks of the English-inspired concept of 'The Avengers' are - in their essence, and however silly - just too irritatingly grown-up for such hyperactive youth ever to endure sitting still for!A pity the film was not left alone upon release to find its own friends - like a stray cat, that will carefully choose whom it will exercise it's feline charm upon. And what more feline than Uma Thurman in Mrs. Peel's cat-suit?!This is certainly not the sort of film to toss into an auditorium full of baying first-run morons.But I suspect that it is a film with more than one life ...",whimsical delight more please,i am amazed at how well american film has captured matter fact surrealism which mathematician dodgson lewis carroll gave his dream child alice as also it recalls more knowing oh so polite deconstruction wrought by media saavy british children 60s upon distressed remnants englands imperial aplomb course as oscar wilde may not have said satire revisited is only lukewarm cup tea but then nostalgia especially when satire was so gentle anyway has its own charms there was anyway hefty dose nostalgia amidst cool insouciance original its very modernity was made seem almost expression polite insistence whatever surreal manifestation tradition was encountered it was utterly unruffled mien original which prevailed over all lapses reason good taste so at its best new cinema version this is indeed brave try by hollywood draw us back into that black white psychedelia swinging sixties british commercial television sheer madness enterprise almost works if money men hadnt had cold feet at last minute we might have been enjoying really remarkable fantasy film as it is we must content ourselves with merely very amusing piece whimsy even through plot holes left by nervous editor we can see some wonderfully mad logic at work escher inspired architecture baddys stately home which mrs peel at one point loses her way encapsulates this whole dream trip movie those who dont get it i can only say humour is like that very dependent individual taste but even allowing taste it is sad reflection public taste that avengers overwhelmingly offends filmgoers who are probably quite prepared accept ever more overblown superheroes more violent tradition such as batman or hulk course these two are clearly representative that particularly adolescent taste extreme crude which contemporary hollywood production line largely exists there is every sign that eddie izzards character was originally intended satirize mega buck entertainment mega buck villains as being really just spoiled brats with their expensive toys genteel quirks english inspired concept avengers are their essence however silly just too irritatingly grown up such hyperactive youth ever endure sitting still pity film was not left alone upon release find its own friends like stray cat that will carefully choose whom it will exercise its feline charm upon what more feline than uma thurman mrs peels cat suit this is certainly not sort film toss into auditorium full baying first run morons but i suspect that it is film with more than one life,0.55616236996834,0.0972413904503457,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
