7.0,M for masterful,"A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, ""Dial M For Murder"" is Hitchcock's second ""drawing-room perfect murder"" movie, after ""Rope"", the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious ""Rear Window"" which immediately followed it in his career.However. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.Yes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn't grown out of by ""Marnie"" some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it's well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who'd want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it's pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade (since ""Saboteur"" in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes, it's old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it's old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.",m masterful,treat eyes exercise brain dial m murder is hitchcocks second drawing room perfect murder movie after rope latter darker more sinister affair altogether hitchcock himself interviews played down quality this movie amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as warm up more ambitious rear window which immediately followed it his career however it actually has lot going it being beautifully shot luminous colour extremely well acted almost every role peppered throughout with those eye catching brain satisfying flourishes which so distinguished director rest yes it is very set bound betraying its stage origins likewise very talky especially exposition but it keeps viewer alert throughout delivers neatly satisfying conclusion i do wish hitchcock could have done better with his back projection unit old fashioned jarring trait he still hadnt grown out by marnie some 10 years later i occasionally found constant too frivolous background music intrusion but its well paced throughout helped considerably by form cast ray milland is excellent kind darker cary grant type persona grace kelly whod want murder her goes convincingly loveliness wretchedness while its pleasing see robert cumming fore recalled by hitch first time over decade since saboteur 1942 actors playing would be murderer nosey police inspector are just fine too about those flourishes perhaps most famous being changing spotlight grace kellys doomed face as her trial is condensed into just few terse minutes course murder scene itself even if one cant imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough cut through swanns jacket far less kill him stone dead but i also enjoyed raised tracking shot looking down milland as he explains his plot swann particularly parting shadows lovers cumming kelly at millands unexpected approach yes its old fashioned hollywood movie making but its old fashioned hollywood movie making at its best my opinion unjustly overlooked effort master,0.5398526077097504,0.2308956916099773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,"The stage-originated dialogue sings with intelligence, wit, and an easy transition to the screen","There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder,"" and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for ""Dial M for Murder"" on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's ""Rope,"" though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen ""Dial M for Murder"" two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though ""Dial M for Murder"" pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: ""Goodbye, my dear."" The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though ""Dial M for Murder"" was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. ""Dial M for Murder"" is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production.",stage originated dialogue sings with intelligence wit easy transition screen,there is lot admire about alfred hitchcocks dial m murder i do hold film with great deal admiration respect however what i adore about movie most more than cinematography suspense acting even direction is work by screenwriter frederick knott mr knott based screenplay dial m murder his successful stage production which i have never seen but am told contains almost all words we hear film words are music ears they sing with intelligence wit that mr hitchcock certainly found attractive best all easy transition screen many times when stage production goes film as far as i am concerned results even if good are uneven frequently dialogue restricted set space allowed tend give off impression filmed play not cinematic experience another hitchcock film 1948s rope though valiant interesting successful attempted this suffered this difficult struggle but dialogue put film here is exceptional i write this review having seen dial m murder two or three times wanting see it once again many reviewers myself included have tried watching films with sound off i want try opposite i want close my eyes just listen dialogue because its so strong macguffin conversation at beginning with perfectly cast ray milland blackmailing perfectly cast anthony dawson into murdering perfectly cast grace kelly is brilliantly written by mr knott it was clearly stage production as it explains plot background great detail goes better part twenty minutes both men are fleshed out giving us their personalities individual tendencies even though dial m murder pretty much stays just one small set apartment london which we see mostly foyer little bedroom just glimpse kitchen what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want venture out into city that is just setup dialogue remains insistently interesting clever throughout picture it also has that subtle dark sense humor that alfred hitchcock was keen it also has ironic touches such as when mr milland as jealous husband kisses his unfaithful wife night she is be murdered tells her goodbye my dear audience having been given every single little detail about scheme how it is unfold cringes with dark realization that mr hitchcock might just go through with mr millands plot mr hitchcock as director is also due tremendous credit his trademark creating tension screenwriter knott brilliantly lays out audience not victim how murder will go through but mr hitchcocks camera dutifully follows everything as scheme goes along before we realize it if something starts go wrong we become scared tense you can imagine my guilt when i realized i was feeling scared that plan murder someone just might not go through its mr hitchcocks gift at work dimitri tiomkin very good film composer hits all write notes that includes knowing when he needs tell his violins trumpets shut up robert burks cinematography is also strong with effective usage shadows streaks light colors are omnipresent even though dial m murder was shot with intent be seen 3d it is hardly evident when i first saw film much superior 2d i did not mind lamps such foreground such as when one bisects screen between ray milland anthony dawson during opening sequence i just thought it was clever piece filmmaking misc en scene not cheap gimmick like most 3d movies today dial m murder is near perfect movie its kind pumped full smart dialogue dazzling energy this is one few play movie transition that i have seen where i have suddenly become eager see original stage production,0.6138189223057643,0.2984163533834588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.25}"
9.0,The perfect film for the perfect murder...,"After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure, ""Mogambo"", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western ""High Noon"", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. ""Dial M for Murder"" was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.The movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony's plan's infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.Like most Hitchcock's films, ""Dial M for Murder"" was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott's script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it's easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.It seems that Hitchcock's knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock's classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock's use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott's dialog to shine.Without disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly's talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming ""villian"". Milland's performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.In many ways, ""Dial M for Murder"" shares many things with ""Rope"", as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both ""experiments"": while ""Rope"" was conceived as a ""movie in one take"", ""Dial M for Murder"" was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock's use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices' apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with ""stuff coming out of the screen"" (as seen in for example, ""House of Wax""). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it.""Dial M for Murder"" is probably less celebrated than the Master's most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as ""Rear Window"" (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him.

9.0,Tense and exciting.,"Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player, unhappily married to Margot (Grace Kelly), correctly guesses that she has been cheating, with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.Dial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it's weird in that even though she's cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he's trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.Alfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie.",tense exciting,tony wendice ray milland ex tennis player unhappily married margot grace kelly correctly guesses that she has been cheating with mark halliday robert cummings mark writes crime stories unbeknown margot mark tony knows about affair wants teach margot little lesson by taking away thing that is her life but being too guileful do it himself wendice blackmails one his old school friends into murdering her essential thing doing it is his latchkey dial m murder succeeds many levels it is largely thanks some superb dialogue written tricksy yet capable script that never gets too deep cast are treat ray milland is absolute gem extremely sly dispassionate yet character so full self assurance that one almost sides with him grace kelly completes her great year she gave oscar winning performance country girl also starred rear window by emanating poised beautiful being that is vulnerable yet oddly unassailable its weird that even though shes cheating her husband you care her lot more than him although that could do with fact that hes trying kill her john williams as police detective is quite wonderful alfred hitchcock manipulates enthrals his audience here like master that he is each scene has sense direction great pacing is staged realistically stunning full colour photography haunting atmospheric score dimitri tiomkin complete this great package ending when it comes feels little too nice be truly realistic but that is my only major quibble with otherwise highly entertaining thrilling movie,0.5927927927927928,0.26430180180180174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,Excellent,"What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.Cold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasn't paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didn't get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? It's incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear - it's fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a now-dead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, it's a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock.",excellent,what gets me about this film every time i see it is just how simple it is witty urbanity dialogue goes without saying hem acting is stagily impeccable direction by hitchcock is limited by small sets but masterful all that cold ray milland plans sets up murder his demure but faithless wife grace kelly by virtual stranger who is urged by stick exposure his misdeeds carrot gbp1 000 used notes course all his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong depending your point view leading even more convoluted revised plan when first seen when young i wasted my time because i wasnt paying attention at critical moment so missed point didnt get it key is how did baddie get into apartment its incredibly verbose being stage play after all at times it seems nothing more than radio show with pictures long scene setting verbal sparring by milland anthony dawson is superb hear its fascinating its relentless poetry displaying now dead world i could never understand attraction 3d movies least all with this particular attempt or why kelly was continually uglified by hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than here when she was playing stressed out throughout i wonder if hitch remembered jokey murder scene he did 1930 elstree calling when jameson thomas realised he was murdering wrong apartment turn that key you have go its remarkably literate film as intricate inside as any lock,0.643452380952381,0.15875850340136055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.54}"
9.0,"Not Hitchcock's best, but definitely a film not to miss!","Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, directing classics such as Psycho, North by Northwest and Rebecca. While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",not hitchcocks best but definitely film not miss,alfred hitchcock is wonderful director directing classics such as psycho north by northwest rebecca while not his best dial m murder has so much recommend it first all is breathtaking cinematography which is nearly always best thing hitchcock film script is gem showing that you are capable anything most time it is very tense rarely slips that said my only complaint is that one or two scenes such as ending do fall flat compared rest film however film also has wonderful music score fantastic performances entire cast ray milland actor i really want get more familiar with is excellent as tony wendice husband planning murder his wife make it perfect murder as margot beautiful grace kelly is picture beauty vulnerability wonderful understated performance perhaps outshining her co star everyone else acquitted themselves well too even robert cummings as mark halliday john williams as inspector hubbard overall excellent film not hitchcocks best but well looking out 9 10 bethany cox,0.5849462365591399,0.45537634408602146,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,Fantastic Hitchcock murder mystery,"Another excellent Hitchcock film, just one of the many that the director made which exceeded all my expectations. This murder mystery has a twist - we know the identity of the culprit from the start, it's just a question of waiting to see whether the cast work it out or not. The film takes place in a single location, a low key apartment, much like the Audrey Hepburn thriller WAIT UNTIL DARK. It's a slow paced and talky affair with an absolutely intricate plot that's likely to tie you up in circles if you don't watch it closely enough, but of course that's part of the fun.Personally, I thought the script was superb - one of the best, ever. Every little detail has been worked out and even if there are a couple of weak explanations along the way, you can easily forgive them thanks to how enjoyable watching the twists and turns play out is. The clever title refers to the pivotal scene, a sterling set-piece of suspense and murder, in which the lovely Grace Kelly is menaced by a sinister thug. Ray Milland is the deliciously slimy anti-hero and I love his stiff upper lip and confident air of self-assurance that propels him along throughout the movie. John Williams, a carry-over from the stage play on which this is based, supplies the much-needed comic relief and Anthony Dawson is as delightfully sinister as he's ever been.The fun from this film comes from watching Hitchcock ratchet up the suspense in numerous unexpected ways - such as the simple turning of a key in a lock. There isn't a cliché in sight, just strong plotting and decent scriptwriting. I even enjoyed this over the Hitchcock film I watched previously, NORTH BY NORTHWEST; it's one of those films where I wouldn't change a thing. I know I'm gushing, but this is a real treat. NB. I've recently re-watched this film in 3D, but that aspect is almost needless, merely adding depth to a few sequences; there's only one stand-out bit (during the attempted murder) so I wouldn't go to the trouble, personally.",fantastic hitchcock murder mystery,another excellent hitchcock film just one many that director made which exceeded all my expectations this murder mystery has twist we know identity culprit start its just question waiting see whether cast work it out or not film takes place single location low key apartment much like audrey hepburn thriller wait until dark its slow paced talky affair with absolutely intricate plot thats likely tie you up circles if you dont watch it closely enough but course thats part fun personally i thought script was superb one best ever every little detail has been worked out even if there are couple weak explanations along way you can easily forgive them thanks how enjoyable watching twists turns play out is clever title refers pivotal scene sterling set piece suspense murder which lovely grace kelly is menaced by sinister thug ray milland is deliciously slimy anti hero i love his stiff upper lip confident air self assurance that propels him along throughout movie john williams carry over stage play which this is based supplies much needed comic relief anthony dawson is as delightfully sinister as hes ever been fun this film comes watching hitchcock ratchet up suspense numerous unexpected ways such as simple turning key lock there isnt clich sight just strong plotting decent scriptwriting i even enjoyed this over hitchcock film i watched previously north by northwest its one those films where i wouldnt change thing i know im gushing but this is real treat nb ive recently re watched this film 3d but that aspect is almost needless merely adding depth few sequences theres only one stand out bit during attempted murder so i wouldnt go trouble personally,0.575746965452848,0.1408846872082166,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9.0,One of Hitchcock's best thrillers.,"1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly. She played in Hitchcock's classic ""Rear window"" and she won an Oscar for best actress in ""The country girl"" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, ""Dial M for murder"". Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time. In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being ""Psycho"" (although I haven't seen ""Rear window"" yet). Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player. However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it. So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife. But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go. So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time. The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark. He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife. What follows this is pure entertainment at its best. As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery. He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be. Another of his great performances is in ""Witness for the prosecution"" where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case. As for ""Dial M for murder"", well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost.",one hitchcocks best thrillers,1954 was big year grace kelly she played hitchcocks classic rear window she won oscar best actress country girl most people tend forget that she starred yet another classic dial m murder starring grace kelly ray milland robert cummings it is simply one hitchcocks finest movies all time fact i would consider it be my second favorite hitchcock movie ever my first being psycho although i havent seen rear window yet margot grace kelly is married tony wendice ray milland ex tennis player however she has been seeing another man named mark halliday robert cummings mark writes crime stories two them think that tony doesnt know about their relationship but theyre wrong tony has known about this relationship one year seems have had enough it so when mark who lives new york comes london see margot tony wants go out with mark his wife but night event tony is unable go so he tells margot take mark out have good time only problem is that tony doesnt really have something thats keeping him going out with margot mark he has another plan plan being blackmail one his old college friends that has become small time crook into murdering his wife what follows this is pure entertainment at its best as usual hitchcock masterfully directs this movie has right actors do job ray milland grace kelly deliver very good performances surprisingly enough robert cummings does rather good job his role mark halliday american crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles answer but it is john williams who steals show with his great performance as inspector hubbard detective who holds key whole mistery he is simply excellent pretty funny when he is supposed be another his great performances is witness prosecution where he played brogan moore charles laughtons very good friend seconding lawyer case as dial m murder well its one those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost,0.5168517316017316,0.31099242424242424,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"
7.0,One Room Thriller,"I had forgotten that most if not all of it happens in one single room. The planning of it is a display of extraordinary craftsmanship. Not a lagging moment. I was riveted to the, let's face it, preposterous plot from beginning to end. Ray Milland is a credible monster in elegant and civilized clothing. Grace Kelly, a peach as the unfaithful wife who stays home to cut newspaper clippings of her husband's past glories. Yeah, right. Robert Cummings has always been a mystery to me. A popular leading man with a long career. He only exudes a campy, if lightweight vibe that almost works in comedies and when he's in a supporting role - My Geisha and What A Way To Go with Shirley MacLaine are good examples. Here as Grace Kelly's secret lover, I don't know what to say.

8.0,"""Do you really believe in the perfect murder? ""","The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott ""Dial M for Murder"" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film ""A Perfect Murder"" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. ""Dial M for Murder"" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call ""Dial M for Murder"" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes.",do you really believe perfect murder,hit broadway play by frederick knott dial m murder has been adapted screen several times including films made west germany sweden as well as tv movie 1981 tv by boris seagal film perfect murder 1998 directed by andrew davis with michael douglas gwyneth paltrow viggo mortensen alfred hitchcocks 1954 adaptation was first certainly best one even if master himself considered it one his lesser efforts dial m murder will be remembered as hitchcocks first color film first three thrillers he had made with grace kelly future princess monaco prime her beauty her talent using color proved be very effective film first two scenes featuring kelly wearing white morning dress idyllic scene with her husband tony right after that kissing passionately her american lover writer robert cummings red dress immediately without many words tell viewer that story passion deception betrayal ultimately murder will follow ray milland tony wendice is surprisingly sympathetic villain which is perhaps not surprising actor with talent charm charisma that equal remind lot both cary grant jimmy stewart who knows about his wife cheating decides teach her lesson by plotting very clever murder which will make him sole heir her money she is wealthy one family his plan is perfect almost works but margot managed not only escape murderer but turn table him while stunned wendice is phone listens how his well thought plan collapses wendice is very resourceful he proved be master improvisation because it took him few minutes cab switch plan b that turned terrified victim margot into cold blooded murderess now it is up seasoned shrewd inspector hubbard john williams find crucial piece evidence solve case as always with hitchcock his directing is impeccable camera rarely leaves wendices apartment but film is never claustrophobic which is case many plays adaptation it breathes moves freely we almost forget that we are same room close two hours i would not call dial m murder my favorite hitchcocks film but it is enjoyable clever witty thriller with interesting twists outstanding performances more than one truly memorable scenes,0.5931357649442756,0.2921073961499494,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Hitchcock's perfect film of a non-perfect crime ...,"With ""Dial M For Murder"", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed ""Rear Window"", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but ""Dial M for Murder"" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.I. Dial M for  MurderThe Murder takes place right in the middle of the story and like in ""Psycho"", it's defined by what precedes and what follows, it's the emotional reward of a patient but powerful build-up while the resolution is an intelligent case of manipulation. The build-up is the construction of a perfect crime, Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, presents to the killer, a remarkable Anthony Edwards, the killing's plan as if it was a simple technical operation, following an incredibly methodical scheme, admirably meticulous if it wasn't for the purpose of killing. Hitchcock's masterful direction creates a plot within the plot, at a point you wonder if you're watching the adapted play within a film, or a film that transcended the confined setting of the play. And the second and crucial element of the build-up subtly hints the fact that there's always a human factor that undermines any attempt of perfectionism. So, when comes the time of the murder, we have these two parameters, we know how it should happen, but we keep in mind that whatever must go wrong will go wrong. How? When? Where? This is what the whole first part of the suspense is about.II. Dial M for  MistakeWhat could have been a lazy exercise of adaptation becomes in the hands of the Master, an extraordinary thriller confined in an elegant room sometimes welcoming, sometimes claustrophobic. The handling of the space and the various objects that occupy it, a telephone, sockets, scissors, keys, the way the camera shows them or hides them till the right moment is crucial in the way they organize what would lead to the fatal mistake. We only see what the characters can see and Hitchcock's manipulative effects consists on the way he lets the human factor affect the story only during the villainous parts. As much as we don't really care for the love story, because Christopher Hummings who plays the lover, Halliday, is probably the least charismatic of all, we sort of root for the villains, because of that 'humanity' displayed by the mistake. The point is that the murder is so well crafted, that there's a little evil voice inside us that wishes it could work, but again, this is Grace Kelly, and the sight of that creature in danger immediately reverses the rooting process, and then while her hands desperately seek a providential help, one pair of scissors theatrically conclude the heart of the film and the ruthless killer, becomes a worthless killer, before falling as a victim, or a collateral damage at best. The mistake is not just a plot device, it's Hitchcock's cynical insertion of humanity in a rather cold and emotionless mindset.III. Dial M for  ManipulationThere's an interesting trivia about the title's translation in French: ""The Crime Was Almost Perfect"", which conveys the inevitability of human factor like fate in Greek tragedies. It is, no pun intended, the key element of the evolution and resolution of the plot, when Wendice will exploit the mistake to his advantage. Tony Wendice is impressive, because he's simply predicted everything, and he puts the level so high, that even Halliday couldn't accuse him, although, in the way he deconstructed the murder when trying to convince Wendice to find an alibi to save his wife Margot from execution, he concluded on what could have been the true motive of the murder but he was not in the same caliber than his opponent, hence the entrance of Detective Hubbard, played by an elegant, suave and scene-stealing John Williams. And it's only justice, that he could outfight Wendice by using his very weapon, manipulation. It's all about manipulating objects, space and people and on that level, Wendice found his archenemy.IV. Dial M for  MillandRay Milland is perfect as the quintessential upper class villain, elegant, sophisticated and absolutely and totally unflappable, and I use the word 'perfect' as the reference to the French title. A perfect murder needs a perfect villain whose perfect scheme wouldn't be undermined by any external factor, except something under his own control. The casting of Milland also works because he's the one who outshines the other characters, his wife is the victim, the man he hires also appear as the victim, when he tries to kill Grace, you can look on his eyes, that he was a 'casting' error, Milland also underestimated his wife's strength as she managed to overcome her fear and become the killer. But Milland is the only one who doesn't change, totally unflappable, he's the pillar of the film, and the film is so confident that even when he's caught, he doesn't flinch an eye.V. Dial M for  MelodramaThe film also allows to insert some melodramatic elements to engage our sympathy toward the couple, but it's clear that this just works as the foil to justify the murder, and inspire some sympathy toward Milland, when you see him with Margot, all in white, in the opening scene, then she's wearing a bright and dazzling red dress with Halliday. In one minute, Hitchcock masterfully highlighted the treachery that would inspire Tony's crime. The love will be Halliday's motive to fight for innocence but again, it's only with the same weapons that Wendice could've been defeated. so whether it's for murder, manipulation, Milland or melodrama, you know you'll dial a definite M for  Masterpiece.",hitchcocks perfect film non perfect crime,with dial m murder master signs another classic mystery starring first time actress whod

9.0,There Is no Perfect Crime,"In London, the wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) one year ago while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is traveling in a tennis tour. Tony quits playing to dedicate to his wife and finds a regular job and she decides to give a second chance for their marriage. When Mark arrives from America to visit the couple, Margot tells him that she had destroyed all his letter but one that was stolen in a depot; then she was blackmailed through letters but she had never retrieved the stolen letter. Tony arrives home and claims that he needs to work, and asks Margot to go with Mark to the theater. Meanwhile Tony calls the scum Captain Lesgate - aka Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) that studied with him in the college and blackmails him to murder his wife, so that he would inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime, and things do not work as planned by Tony.""Dial M for Murder"" is one of the best thrillers of cinema history, with a theatrical story supported by an excellent screenplay and top-notch performances. Ray Milland is superb in the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice; Grace Kelly is extremely gorgeous and sweet in the role of a wife in the 50's; and John Williams is great in the role of the efficient and fussy Chief Inspector Hubbard. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the picture of Tony's reunion. In 1998, Andrew Davis remade this movie with ""A Perfect Crime"", with Michael Douglas, Gwineth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen.

,"Space, Distance, Entry","I recently saw this again, but I will make this comment on a viewing I had many years ago.I was sponsoring some research on human interfaces, and the center of expertise at the time was coordinated by an Air Force Lab out of Dayton Ohio. Some of the more clever guys at the lab had connections with hobbyists in the area, and also with local film enthusiasts connected with the city artfilm theater. They'd arranged for a reconstruction of the three-D version of this. I made a special trip for what was billed as the only week ever this would be shown.It was originally filmed in 3D, using an unusual process. Two cameras made two color prints. These were delivered together to the theater and shown with two synchronized projectors on the same screen through polarizing lenses. Polarized glasses allowed the viewer to see color 3D.Almost immediately after release, the process was abandoned because the projectors required amazing skill and were extraordinarily complicated, expensive and unreliable. To reconstruct the original effect, several years went into the location of most of the original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized to create the complete kit of Siamese twin projectors. Some missing precision parts may have been fabricated in a spooky government research lab; I cannot say. That was only the first impossibility.What had happened shortly after the film was released over 50 years ago, within a few months, was that the left and right prints were separated and distributed as ""ordinary"" versions. To reconstruct a pair, you need to have every single frame match. But no prints had all frames complete. Some had been edited by exhibitors for various reasons like time. Others had been broken and respliced and some of those repairs even reversed. Some had frames snipped to create publicity stills. Still others had both some left and some right elements.It apparently was a tremendous effort to scan all prints a frame at a time and reconstruct a matched pair. A previous 3D version had been released, but it was no help, in fact unwatchable. It reduced the process to the older black and white and didn't do the matching this team did. Its horrible, and not even 3D in some places.So I made a special trip to see this in Dayton as it was intended. Hitchcock made this in his spare time while preparing for his masterful ""Rear Window."" It was already a hit play, and his contribution was to design the blocking for 3D. Its important because Hitchcock was a master in advancing the notion of a spatial camera, a space-savvy eye. Some of what he did here is not only extraordinary on its own, but it can be seen as a sort of sketchpad for some of the indirectly referenced effects on ""Rear Window."" So if you are interested in the world, then you are interested in film in space, and then ""Rear Window,"" and as a result this in 3D.I not only saw this, but arranged to have the optimum seat in the house. And the place was packed with some of the most enlightened viewers I knew and the swelling of sighs at points was palpable. It was an extraordinary experience. The vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because of Republican actions in Congress. I believe the reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever, so the window may have closed to see this properly.You'll have to extrapolate the 3D effects from a two-d print. Its not impossible I suppose. I'll give you some clues. He places the camera in one of three modes, alternating among them depending on whether we are colluding, witnessing or dissecting. (The trial scene is excluded from this.) Obviously, these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with: the husband (a performer), the boyfriend ""mystery writer,"" or the detective. Its easy to work out and quite thrilling to see how he has ""dialed"" the vision.This is a replacement comment, the original having been deleted (along with scores of others) by a reader unhappy with comments elsewhere I made about an unrelated actor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",space distance entry,i recently saw this again but i will make this comment viewing i had many years ago i was sponsoring some research human interfaces center expertise at time was coordinated by air force lab out dayton ohio some more clever guys at lab had connections with hobbyists area also with local film enthusiasts connected with city artfilm theater theyd arranged reconstruction three d version this i made special trip what was billed as only week ever this would be shown it was originally filmed 3d using unusual process two cameras made two color prints these were delivered together theater shown with two synchronized projectors same screen through polarizing lenses polarized glasses allowed viewer see color 3d almost immediately after release process was abandoned because projectors required amazing skill were extraordinarily complicated expensive unreliable reconstruct original effect several years went into location most original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized create complete kit siamese twin projectors some missing precision parts may have been fabricated spooky government research lab i cannot say that was only first impossibility what had happened shortly after film was released over 50 years ago within few months was that left right prints were separated distributed as ordinary versions reconstruct pair you need have every single frame match but no prints had all frames complete some had been edited by exhibitors various reasons like time others had been broken respliced some those repairs even reversed some had frames snipped create publicity stills still others had both some left some right elements it apparently was tremendous effort scan all prints frame at time reconstruct matched pair previous 3d version had been released but it was no help fact unwatchable it reduced process older black white didnt do matching this team did its horrible not even 3d some places so i made special trip see this dayton as it was intended hitchcock made this his spare time while preparing his masterful rear window it was already hit play his contribution was design blocking 3d its important because hitchcock was master advancing notion spatial camera space savvy eye some what he did here is not only extraordinary its own but it can be seen as sort sketchpad some indirectly referenced effects rear window so if you are interested world then you are interested film space then rear window as result this 3d i not only saw this but arranged have optimum seat house place was packed with some most enlightened viewers i knew swelling sighs at points was palpable it was extraordinary experience vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because republican actions congress i believe reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever so window may have closed see this properly youll have extrapolate 3d effects two d print its not impossible i suppose ill give you some clues he places camera one three modes alternating among them depending whether we are colluding witnessing or dissecting trial scene is excluded this obviously these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with husband performer boyfriend mystery writer or detective its easy work out quite thrilling see how he has dialed vision this is replacement comment original having been deleted along with scores others by reader unhappy with comments elsewhere i made about unrelated actor teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.5586309523809526,0.12177871148459382,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Superior Hitchcock with an exquisite Grace Kelly,"This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and bloodless ability to glue us to the screen. This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice. Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days. The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed. I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood what happened. Follow the latchkey! Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone, even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well. At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.

7.0,A mean husband concocts an intricate plan to murder his unfaithful wife for her money,"Thrilling and suspense movie based on Frederick Knott's play , author of other successful and equally adapted books as ¨Wait until dark¨ and ¨The honey pot¨ . A London ex-tennis pro (Ray Milland) carries out a plot to murder his wife and then he hires a killer (Anthony Dawson who recreates his stage role) . When things go wrong , he improvises a brilliant plan B . In the city , wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice was on a tennis tour . But his plan for pulling off the perfect crime is temporarily foiled and quickly switches to another plan . Meanwhile a Police Inspector (John Williams who won the 1953 Tony Award to recreate his stage role of Chief Inspector Hubbard) investigates the deeds .Top-notch suspense film of a man plotting spouse's killing , full of sustained intrigue , thrills , a few interesting twists and entertainment . The picture , stagy at times , is formed by two parts , a Plan A and a Plan B with even more fun . Casting is frankly magnificent , the stars are excellently cast . Splendid performances from Ray Milland as a rather likable nasty who desires to inherit his wife's fortune and John Williams as an obstinate Inspector who carries out the subsequent investigation . Furthermore , a gorgeous and wonderful Grace Kelly ; Hitch arranged to have Grace dressed in bright colors at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. Colorful and shimmer cinematography by Robert Burks who uses intelligent camera vantages , being photographed in Technicolor and 3D , which explains the prevalence of low-angle shots with lamps and other objects between us and the cast members.

6.0,"All it is, is plot","Undoubtedly, ""Dial M for Murder"" has a clever plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans ""the perfect murder"" to do away with his wife Margot (Grace Kelly), who cheated on him with novelist Mark (Robert Cummings). He blackmails an old schoolmate into committing the crime and plants clues to mislead the police. But when things don't go according to plan, Tony has to plant new clues and think of another explanation to give the detectives, so that suspicion doesn't fall on him.The trouble is, the plot is the only interesting thing about this movie, and the characters are defined solely by how they can affect the plot. For instance, Mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability to ""read"" the crime scene. Most of the movie's dialogue is expository: long scenes where the characters debate the minutiae of evidence found at the scene, without an interesting subtext. The movie is known for taking place almost entirely in the Wendices' living room, and Hitchcock does a good job of varying the camera angles to make you forget there's just one set. But he did this even better in ""Rear Window,"" his other 1954 film.Admittedly, Milland gives an enjoyable performance as the villaintruly a guy you love to hate, a clever and smiling sociopath. But Kelly and Cummings are surprisingly boring for a pair of adulterous lovers. Kelly also proves herself the ancestor of all those female horror- movie characters who go investigating strange noises in their best lingerie.""Dial M for Murder"" is lightweight without actually being funnya fatal combination. Though serious concerns (adultery, murder, the death penalty) underlie the story, we're never made to feel that they are really consequential. It's a cold and mechanical movie, which subordinates everything else to the demands of an intricate plot. Contrast this with something like ""Rear Window,"" whose plot is simple and lacking in twists, but whose characters are vividly drawn and act as though their stories really meant something. Having a clever solution to a mystery does not a great movie make.",all it is is plot,undoubtedly dial m murder has clever plot tony wendice ray milland plans perfect murder do away with his wife margot grace kelly who cheated him with novelist mark robert cummings he blackmails old schoolmate into committing crime plants clues mislead police but when things dont go according plan tony has plant new clues think another explanation give detectives so that suspicion doesnt fall him trouble is plot is only interesting thing about this movie characters are defined solely by how they can affect plot instance mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability read crime scene most movies dialogue is expository long scenes where characters debate minutiae evidence found at scene without interesting subtext movie is known taking place almost entirely wendices living room hitchcock does good job varying camera angles make you forget theres just one set but he did this even better rear window his other 1954 film admittedly milland gives enjoyable performance as villain truly guy you love hate clever smiling sociopath but kelly cummings are surprisingly boring pair adulterous lovers kelly also proves herself ancestor all those female horror movie characters who go investigating strange noises their best lingerie dial m murder is lightweight without actually being funny fatal combination though serious concerns adultery murder death penalty underlie story were never made feel that they are really consequential its cold mechanical movie which subordinates everything else demands intricate plot contrast this with something like rear window whose plot is simple lacking twists but whose characters are vividly drawn act as though their stories really meant something having clever solution mystery does not great movie make,0.5616182836771071,0.11626559714795014,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,A classic stage murder thriller...,"Ray Milland schemes to knock off his lovely wife (Grace Kelly) in order to support his flagging bank balance...His cause is ""justified"" by the fact that his wife is guilty of cheating on him...Milland develops a carefully constructed murder plan, contacting Captain Lesgate (John Williams), an old college classmate operating illegal ventures, to whom he outlines his murder scheme and then blackmails into carrying it out... The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly & Robert Cummings both pale in comparison, although Grace is slightly better, for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...The murder is set up and is deliciously evil: The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife, thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch, the placement of the golden key, and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused, her outfits become darker... Kelly is ingénue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone, oblivious to the assassin behind her... Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table... John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy-talking husband is trying to cover his tracks... As soon as he arrives on scene to investigate the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity... Here's a guy who can read human nature from a mile away... He takes compassion on Kelly, but unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...The film, however, belongs to the sinister Ray Milland, the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...Milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover, then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan, the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks: Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening; a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment; a stopped watch; an occupied telephone box; Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck; Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie & precarious...""Dial M for Murder"" is a film that makes you pay attention.

9.0,Retooling the perfect murder when it turns out to be imperfect,"Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an aging tennis pro who learns that his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly as Margot) has a lover (Bob Cummings as Mark). Tony figures out what might have led his wife astray and fixes it - he gets a real job with a real boss. But what if his wife divorces him? He'd get nothing! Realizing that getting a job may have enlarged his wife's respect for him but not diminished her affection for the lover, he spends a large amount of time figuring out a perfect way to kill his wife so that he can inherit her money. Tony has nothing personal against Margot and her infidelity, he just can't take the chance of winding up penniless. He can't do the job himself - the husband is always the prime suspect in such matters. So, he must find someone who will be willing to do the job for him. He's not the type who hangs with organized crime types, so he has to find someone already guilty of murder but yet untouched by the law and get that person to agree to do the job for him.It sounds perfect. Tony even has the lover with him as an alibi the night the murder is to occur. But everything does go wrong, and now Tony has to retool his perfect murder. Who will kill Margot for Tony? The law of course! Watch this great little thriller and see what I'm talking about.Most directors lose a step after they are in their 50's. There is just something about their creativity that just fizzles, and I say that as someone who is 55 myself. But here Hitchcock is at age 55 doing some of his best and most clever work. This one is so ironic it could be considered a film noir if not for the elegance of the players, the setting, and that great score.Just one thing that nobody ever seems to talk about much - did anybody else want Tony to get away with it just a little? He does play it icy cold and smiling throughout, but when he makes the phone call that sets everything in motion, you can see the regret in his face - the fact that he hates that this is the way that it must be. Meanwhile my sympathy was not with the cheating wife and especially the false friend Mark Halliday. The guy was sleeping with a man's wife while pretending to be his friend, even carrying on a kissing session with her while the husband went down the street for an errand. If you're going to steal someone's wife, let it be a stranger's. Don't shake the guy's hand, eat the guy's food, and accept his hospitality and take his wife behind his back too. Maybe Hitch wanted the audience to be conflicted though, maybe he was trying to add to the complexity of the situation with this added dimension. At any rate, watch this if you get a chance. In fact, watch it more than once. You'll always see something you didn't see before.",retooling perfect murder when it turns out be imperfect,tony wendice ray milland is aging tennis pro who learns that his wealthy wife grace kelly as margot has lover bob cummings as mark tony figures out what might have led his wife astray fixes it he gets real job with real boss but what if his wife divorces him hed get nothing realizing that getting job may have enlarged his wifes respect him but not diminished her affection lover he spends large amount time figuring out perfect way kill his wife so that he can inherit her money tony has nothing personal against margot her infidelity he just cant take chance winding up penniless he cant do job himself husband is always prime suspect such matters so he must find someone who will be willing do job him hes not type who hangs with organized crime types so he has find someone already guilty murder but yet untouched by law get that person agree do job him it sounds perfect tony even has lover with him as alibi night murder is occur but everything does go wrong now tony has retool his perfect murder who will kill margot tony law course watch this great little thriller see what im talking about most directors lose step after they are their 50s there is just something about their creativity that just fizzles i say that as someone who is 55 myself but here hitchcock is at age 55 doing some his best most clever work this one is so ironic it could be considered film noir if not elegance players setting that great score just one thing that nobody ever seems talk about much did anybody else want tony get away with it just little he does play it icy cold smiling throughout but when he makes phone call that sets everything motion you can see regret his face fact that he hates that this is way that it must be meanwhile my sympathy was not with cheating wife especially false friend mark halliday guy was sleeping with mans wife while pretending be his friend even carrying kissing session with her while husband went down street errand if youre going steal someones wife let it be strangers dont shake guys hand eat guys food accept his hospitality take his wife behind his back too maybe hitch wanted audience be conflicted though maybe he was trying add complexity situation with this added dimension at any rate watch this if you get chance fact watch it more than once youll always see something you didnt see before,0.6266931216931216,0.2200132275132275,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,It's the Key to the whole thing.,"Dial M for Murder is a well chosen vehicle for Alfred Hitchcock, very similar to Rope. A suspense thriller set in the London flat of married couple Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, it had a very successful run on Broadway, 552 performances from 1952 to 1954. Unlike Rope, Hitchcock did briefly give the audiences in a couple of instances a break from the one room set of the play.Although shot in Hollywood, Hitchcock used a few members of the British colony to give the film proper authenticity. The character of Grace Kelly's paramour is American and Grace seems to have improved her British accent from Mogambo. The remake of Dial M for Murder was disappointing because of all the additions to a very simple suspense drama. The key here is that both Ray Milland and Grace Kelly so polite and civil to each other, like any other upper class couple. Then in conversations with other characters, Kelly with paramour Bob Cummings and Milland with Anthony Dawson the audience finds out their true feelings. It's all so genteel and very British, the completely American setting of the Michael Douglas film, A Perfect Murder was the last thing from perfect.Kelly's fallen for Bob Cummings, she realizes Milland is a wastrel, a word I wish would come back into use. Milland realizes he's drained the wife dry or coming pretty close so he hires an old college acquaintance Anthony Dawson to murder Kelly. Or rather blackmails him into it. That scene where he blackmails Dawson is one of both Hitchcock's and Milland's screen highlights.On Broadway, the parts that Milland, Kelly, and Cummings have were played by Maurice Evans, Gosti Huber, and Richard Derr respectively. Hitchcock retained from the Broadway cast Anthony Dawson and John Williams as the police inspector. In the case of Williams I should say THE police inspector. John Williams won a Tony Award on Broadway for his part. He set the standard as far as I'm concerned, maybe even more than Alastair Sim, for a British detective. Calm and detached, Williams goes far beyond duty requirements in relentless pursuit of the truth.Milland's scheme is a tricky bit of business involving his and Kelly's latch keys to their apartment. Quite ingenious in how Williams puts it together.",its key whole thing,dial m murder is well chosen vehicle alfred hitchcock very similar rope suspense thriller set london flat married couple ray milland grace kelly it had very successful run broadway 552 performances 1952 1954 unlike rope hitchcock did briefly give audiences couple instances break one room set play although shot hollywood hitchcock used few members british colony give film proper authenticity character grace kellys paramour is american grace seems have improved her british accent mogambo remake dial m murder was disappointing because all additions very simple suspense drama key here is that both ray milland grace kelly so polite civil each other like any other upper class couple then conversations with other characters kelly with paramour bob cummings milland with anthony dawson audience finds out their true feelings its all so genteel very british completely american setting michael douglas film perfect murder was last thing perfect kellys fallen bob cummings she realizes milland is wastrel word i wish would come back into use milland realizes hes drained wife dry or coming pretty close so he hires old college acquaintance anthony dawson murder kelly or rather blackmails him into it that scene where he blackmails dawson is one both hitchcocks millands screen highlights broadway parts that milland kelly cummings have were played by maurice evans gosti huber richard derr respectively hitchcock retained broadway cast anthony dawson john williams as police inspector case williams i should say police inspector john williams won tony award broadway his part he set standard as far as im concerned maybe even more than alastair sim british detective calm detached williams goes far beyond duty requirements relentless pursuit truth millands scheme is tricky bit business involving his kellys latch keys their apartment quite ingenious how williams puts it together,0.432007722007722,0.11779279279279282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.47}"
8.0,Can Ray Milland get away with the perfect murder?,"Alfred Hitchcock loved shooting in studios, and here he had a film based upon a stage play, much of which could take place within a single set. Here he had every opportunity to show his perfect blonde doll in distress, as the impeccably sculpted Grace Kelly survives an attempt by her cold-hearted and jealous husband, Ray Milland, to have her murdered. But she doesn't know that he was behind the incident. Instead, she herself is convicted of the murder of her would-be murderer, by an evil irony, so that Hitchcock gets another crack at one of his favourite themes, the horrifying dilemma of the unjustly accused. It literally is a case of 'Will she hang tomorrow?' The play and the screenplay were both written by Frederick Knott (1916-2002), who did an excellent job of opening it out beyond a stage proscenium, aided of course by Hitchcock's relentless story-boarding and planning of a variety of shots in a single space which makes everything look like it is taking place in a wider context. This play was filmed no less than 14 times, starting with a TV play for the BBC in 1952. Hitchcock's film was merely the fourth filmed version. Somehow, the idea of someone dialling a phone number to trigger a murder attempt seems to have grabbed the public's imagination, and one can only describe 14 films in 46 years of the same play as 'a frenzy of film-making'. It was so popular in Germany that it was filmed twice there within only three years. Of course, the excitement only really works when all the phones are landlines. In the story, Grace Kelly had to stand in a specific position beside a curtain (which concealed the would-be murderer) in order to answer the phone, and dialling M for murder was the signal. It really was an 'M', by the way, because she was in London and her telephone number, for anyone who wants to try the same trick, was MAYFAIR 4399, which in those days before modern dialling codes, one reached by literally putting one's finger in a rotary dial, starting with the letter 'M', to dial MAY-4399. (I just tried dialling it and also the other number mentioned in the film, HAMPSTEAD 7899, adding the modern prefix '7', but neither number is connected. I suppose the shock of Hitchcock's film was too much for them.) To show just how the emphasis was on the attempt to commit the perfect murder, the last filming of the story in 1998 was actually entitled THE PERFECT MURDER, and starred Michael Douglas, who has just the right look in his eyes. In this version, Ray Milland's ice-cold and ultra-polite manner provided the necessary chill factor. Kelly's lover, Robert Cummings, features in the film but has little to do but look earnest and friendly. As for Grace Kelly, being an ice queen was somewhat contra-indicated, because she is simply not enough of a whimpering victim. Instead of being hopelessly distraught, she substitutes puzzlement and disbelief for true emotion. We therefore don't care that much about whether she is murdered or not, except for all that beauty going to waste, like destroying a Botticelli painting unnecessarily. We want to keep her on screen so we can look at her, that's all. What she feels about it all is irrelevant, because it is clear that she does not really feel anything. Ray Milland, as I have had occasion to say more than once, was notorious in the acting community for being obsessively mean with money. I never met him, but I knew some who worked with him, and his favourite trick in Manhattan when working on Broadway was to share a taxi with another actor and then at the end say he had forgotten his wallet. His higher up colleagues knew about this, but many a poor starving supporting actor was left with a huge taxi bill which he or she could not afford, and with a promise of repayment never kept. It was therefore never difficult for Ray Milland when acting to narrow his eyes and look self-obsessed, and let his inner lizard out. And the way he is continually taking his wallet out of his pocket and putting it back in again in this film, carefully minding the incriminating fingerprints of another man on a crucial letter and wearing gloves himself, is simply too reminiscent of his 'wallet problem' in real life. The story of this thriller is so ingenious, detailed, and complex that it is really a marvel of plot construction. And in this film, Hitchcock's personal appearance on screen takes the form of a wonderful joke, for he appears not in person this time but in a group photograph which features prominently in the story. Haha, good one, Hitch. And the best Hitchcockian touch of all is the final shot of the film.",can ray milland get away with perfect murder,alfred hitchcock loved shooting studios here he had film based upon stage play much which could take place within single set here he had every opportunity show his perfect blonde doll distress as impeccably sculpted grace kelly survives attempt by her cold hearted jealous husband ray milland have her murdered but she doesnt know that he was behind incident instead she herself is convicted murder her would be murderer by evil irony so that hitchcock gets another crack at one his favourite themes horrifying dilemma unjustly accused it literally is case will she hang tomorrow play screenplay were both written by frederick knott 1916 2002 who did excellent job opening it out beyond stage proscenium aided course by hitchcocks relentless story boarding planning variety shots single space which makes everything look like it is taking place wider context this play was filmed no less than 14 times starting with tv play bbc 1952 hitchcocks film was merely fourth filmed version somehow idea someone dialling phone number trigger murder attempt seems have grabbed publics imagination one can only describe 14 films 46 years same play as frenzy film making it was so popular germany that it was filmed twice there within only three years course excitement only really works when all phones are landlines story grace kelly had stand specific position beside curtain which concealed would be murderer order answer phone dialling m murder was signal it really was m by way because she was london her telephone number anyone who wants try same trick was mayfair 4399 which those days before modern dialling codes one reached by literally putting ones finger rotary dial starting with letter m dial may 4399 i just tried dialling it also other number mentioned film hampstead 7899 adding modern prefix 7 but neither number is connected i suppose shock hitchcocks film was too much them show just how emphasis was attempt commit perfect murder last filming story 1998 was actually entitled perfect murder starred michael douglas who has just right look his eyes this version ray millands ice cold ultra polite manner provided necessary chill factor kellys lover robert cummings features film but has little do but look earnest friendly as grace kelly being ice queen was somewhat contra indicated because she is simply not enough whimpering victim instead being hopelessly distraught she substitutes puzzlement disbelief true emotion we therefore dont care that much about whether she is murdered or not except all that beauty going waste like destroying botticelli painting unnecessarily we want keep her screen so we can look at her thats all what she feels about it all is irrelevant because it is clear that she does not really feel anything ray milland as i have had occasion say more than once was notorious acting community being obsessively mean with money i never met him but i knew some who worked with him his favourite trick manhattan when working broadway was share taxi with another actor then at end say he had forgotten his wallet his higher up colleagues knew about this but many poor starving supporting actor was left with huge taxi bill which he or she could not afford with promise repayment never kept it was therefore never difficult ray milland when acting narrow his eyes look self obsessed let his inner lizard out way he is continually taking his wallet out his pocket putting it back again this film carefully minding incriminating fingerprints another man crucial letter wearing gloves himself is simply too reminiscent his wallet problem real life story this thriller is so ingenious detailed complex that it is really marvel plot construction this film hitchcocks personal appearance screen takes form wonderful joke he appears not person this time but group photograph which features prominently story haha good one hitch best hitchcockian touch all is final shot film,0.5145397793263644,0.10794134727061559,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Tense Hitchcock classic,"Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) is being blackmailed for an affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). She had one of her love letter from Mark stolen. Her husband Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) was a professional tennis player who quit for his wife. Unbeknownst to her, Tony stole her letter and has been blackmailing her. Also he blackmails an old acquaintance from Cambridge and petty criminal C. A. Swann (Anthony Dawson) into murdering his wife to get her fortune. Tony plans out the perfect murder but it doesn't works out. Swann tries to strangle Margot but she turns the table on him. Chief inspector Hubbard (John Williams) closes in with every clue.It's a pretty dense start and lots to take in. Once the expositions are done, it is quite tense and compelling. Ray Milland is fascinating as the scheming suave villain. It's a Hitchcock classic and well made game of clue. The tension of the investigation builds and builds. It's fascinating because it lays out everything for the audience. The tension comes from the fact that the characters don't know everything and as they scramble to make up a story.",tense hitchcock classic,margot mary wendice grace kelly is being blackmailed affair with mark halliday robert cummings she had one her love letter mark stolen her husband tony wendice ray milland was professional tennis player who quit his wife unbeknownst her tony stole her letter has been blackmailing her also he blackmails old acquaintance cambridge petty criminal c swann anthony dawson into murdering his wife get her fortune tony plans out perfect murder but it doesnt works out swann tries strangle margot but she turns table him chief inspector hubbard john williams closes with every clue its pretty dense start lots take once expositions are done it is quite tense compelling ray milland is fascinating as scheming suave villain its hitchcock classic well made game clue tension investigation builds builds its fascinating because it lays out everything audience tension comes fact that characters dont know everything as they scramble make up story,0.5255555555555557,0.16111111111111112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.17}"
6.0,Dial A For Adultery,"This is considered a ""sophisticated"" crime film and it does have some interesting dialog and a story that keeps your interest. You have to pay attention, particularly at the end when the British police inspector explains how he figured things out.Ray Milland is the big star of this show, being in almost all the scenes. This kind of suspense movie is unheard of today - a thinking man's gentleman as the main bad guy - with little action in the film. That wouldn't be a success today. It was re-made in 1998 but had more twists and action scenes added.In this film, as in that re-make (A Perfect Murder), I found myself rooting for the husband. In this case, it was Millland, although he was a bit cocky.Note: It's a sad comment that Hitchcock, who didn't seem to have a lot of principles, made Robert Cummings - who was an adulterer in this film having an affair with Milland's wife Grace Kelly - into a ""good guy."" Nobody in the film challenged him on what he was doing. Apparently, adultery was okay with the filmmakers here. At least in the re-make, they made the adulterer into a scumbag (although they made the cheating wife into a sympathetic character! No matter who makes this film, they are still clueless when it comes to what's right and what's wrong!.)",dial adultery,this is considered sophisticated crime film it does have some interesting dialog story that keeps your interest you have pay attention particularly at end when british police inspector explains how he figured things out ray milland is big star this show being almost all scenes this kind suspense movie is unheard today thinking mans gentleman as main bad guy with little action film that wouldnt be success today it was re made 1998 but had more twists action scenes added this film as that re make perfect murder i found myself rooting husband this case it was millland although he was bit cocky note its sad comment that hitchcock who didnt seem have lot principles made robert cummings who was adulterer this film having affair with millands wife grace kelly into good guy nobody film challenged him what he was doing apparently adultery was okay with filmmakers here at least re make they made adulterer into scumbag although they made cheating wife into sympathetic character no matter who makes this film they are still clueless when it comes whats right whats wrong,0.5312629399585922,0.15571946169772258,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.46, 'Fear': 0.24}"
3.0,Ridiculous - why is this considered great?,"SPOILER: There are many who believe that Alfred Hitchcock was a visionary genius; but personally, I fail to see the appeal in his films. I like some 1950s movies - those of Billy Wilder are great, but I find Hitchcock gets stiff performances from his casts, uses preposterous plots and in 'Dial M for Murder', there's a surprising absence of action - just a lot of talk. To summarise the story, a man plans an improbably complex murder; when the plan goes wrong, he frames his wife; but when his wife's friend and a sympathetic policeman get suspicious, they manage to trap him (albeit via the peculiar device of taking her from prison on the eve of her planned execution to help find the evidence to damn him and free her). He takes his capture with sang froid, and the film ends. I suppose Hitchcock was an original, in attempting to tell tales more complex than those previously attempted in cinema; but in an age of over-plotted and under-motivated thrillers, I wonder if his influence can be wholly considered good.",ridiculous why is this considered great,spoiler there are many who believe that alfred hitchcock was visionary genius but personally i fail see appeal his films i like some 1950s movies those billy wilder are great but i find hitchcock gets stiff performances his casts uses preposterous plots dial m murder theres surprising absence action just lot talk summarise story man plans improbably complex murder when plan goes wrong he frames his wife but when his wifes friend sympathetic policeman get suspicious they manage trap him albeit via peculiar device taking her prison eve her planned execution help find evidence damn him free her he takes his capture with sang froid film ends i suppose hitchcock was original attempting tell tales more complex than those previously attempted cinema but age over plotted under motivated thrillers i wonder if his influence can be wholly considered good,0.5509259259259259,0.16934523809523816,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"
