,The greatest good surprise for me since a while...,"I'll be honest, I have never been courageous enough to Watch a movie from India, Bollywood. The only thinking to Watch one movie from here scared me to death. I won't explain why, you could misunderstand me. So, I first read the comments in magazines about this one, and made an attempt. At my own risks...And was amazingly surprised. A truly good surprise, a genuine film noir, real dark, whilst with comedy scenes, such as this one: with some of the guys Under custody explaining to the police officer how to use a cell phone as a camera...It could have been used in the new wave crime flicks from UK and USA, as we see since Quentin Tarantino arrival, two decades ago...An offbeat way of filming and especially story telling. No hero here, no good vs bad guys scheme. A depressing tale, if you analyse the tale in detail. With a downbeat and totally surprising end. This director deserves to be watched, although this kind of stuff is not for all audiences. Not for sissies or romantic addicts.",greatest good surprise me since while,ill be honest i have never been courageous enough watch movie india bollywood only thinking watch one movie here scared me death i wont explain why you could misunderstand me so i first read comments magazines about this one made attempt at my own risks was amazingly surprised truly good surprise genuine film noir real dark whilst with comedy scenes such as this one with some guys under custody explaining police officer how use cell phone as camera it could have been used new wave crime flicks uk usa as we see since quentin tarantino arrival two decades ago offbeat way filming especially story telling no hero here no good vs bad guys scheme depressing tale if you analyse tale detail with downbeat totally surprising end this director deserves be watched although this kind stuff is not all audiences not sissies or romantic addicts,0.7024793388429752,0.13233471074380165,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.16}"
9.0,"Another engaging, dark thriller from AK.","I saw it at a local film festival last night and thought it was quite good. It is probably one of the darkest Bolly movie I've seen. This is the opposite of a family movie -- the plot is very dark, characters very gray, and language very adult. It has a very realistic feel to it. Other than Ronit Roy it was all new faces on the screen. There is no likable character in the movie, but there are a few scenes where you can't help but empathize with their situation and find justification for their actions. There is a little bit of dark humor sprinkled throughout. This is not a movie for general audience, but if you enjoy dark movies that are good character studies then I'd highly recommend checking this one out.",another engaging dark thriller ak,i saw it at local film festival last night thought it was quite good it is probably one darkest bolly movie ive seen this is opposite family movie plot is very dark characters very gray language very adult it has very realistic feel it other than ronit roy it was all new faces screen there is no likable character movie but there are few scenes where you cant help but empathize with their situation find justification their actions there is little bit dark humor sprinkled throughout this is not movie general audience but if you enjoy dark movies that are good character studies then id highly recommend checking this one out,0.39426406926406926,0.08026334776334776,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Ugly - An ugly state of affairs in the lives of ordinary people,"Anurag Kashyap yet again proves that he is in a league by himself among accomplished Bollywood directors. Lately in Bollywood there has been a surge in talented writers/directors creating movies that steer away from typical Bollywood glitz, glamor and grandeur. These glamorous movies appeal to the delusions of most of the Indian audience. But audience who take movies as a form of art and source for inspiration can see through the bling and realize that the substance is utterly lacking. Writers/Directors like Kashyap do not have audience in their mind when they create movies, they cater their work for themselves, which in my opinion brings the best out of any creator of art.Ugly is a tale of ordinary lives involved in extraordinary circumstances. It starts out with a missing child followed by sequences that will make you utterly hate some characters initially. But as the movie unfolds and characters develop on screen, opinions on most of the characters will gradually change. This is a rarity in Bollywood movies, because many of them have characters that are purely good or evil. There is no middle ground, everything is looked as black or white and 30 minutes into the movie you can predict the plot by connecting dots between good and bad characters. But what if you start watching a movie where characters are constantly evolving on screen and every character has some evil and some nobility to him? That is when things become unpredictable and keep you on the edge of your seat if it is a thriller like this story is.Greed and desperation, combined with poverty has a way of bringing out monsters in people you would usually deem as normal. Let me go ahead and say that you will find no character likable in the movie. Correction, I liked all the characters, but I could not root for any of them. But if I had to make an exception I would say one character would come out in a positive light by the end of the movie, even if there is some evil to him/her.This movie is very condensed and concentrated with many raw, heavy hitting scenes that prompt vivid reactions from expressive audience. The plot is captivating and progresses linearly, with some retrospection in-between. Kashyap manages to have his audience on the edge of their seats 15 minutes into the movie. If you are a sucker for suspense thrillers like I am, you wont be leaning back for the rest of the movie. Kashyap also compels you to empathize and cringe at the plight and despair of characters, a lot of which is brought onto them by themselves. Kashyap is a master at writing characters and finding impeccable actors to bring them to life. The lack of make up combined with many improvised scenes give a ""real life"" rawness and experience you are not used to in Bollywood movies. The movie ""Apocalypse Now"" where the character played by Marlon Brando talks about ""the horror"" is a scene that resonates deeply with audience. That was an improvised scene played by Brando who hardly could remember the lines and thus improvised in front of cameras to give us arguably the greatest scene ever. Kashyap obviously understands the positives of improvisation and lets his extremely talented cast do their thing. I only hope these actors get the recognition they deserve.All in all, Ugly is the best Bollywood has to offer for the year 2014. I can confidently say that without even watching 99% of Hindi movies that came out in 2014. It is entertaining and inspiring. I wish I could meet Mr. Kashyap in person and thank him for all the wonderful creations. He is one of the very few reasons I still bother with Bollywood. I wish he managed to squeeze in Kay Kay Menon and Manoj Bajpai somewhere, that is the only (silly) complaint I have about this movie.",ugly ugly state affairs lives ordinary people,anurag kashyap yet again proves that he is league by himself among accomplished bollywood directors lately bollywood there has been surge talented writers directors creating movies that steer away typical bollywood glitz glamor grandeur these glamorous movies appeal delusions most indian audience but audience who take movies as form art source inspiration can see through bling realize that substance is utterly lacking writers directors like kashyap do not have audience their mind when they create movies they cater their work themselves which my opinion brings best out any creator art ugly is tale ordinary lives involved extraordinary circumstances it starts out with missing child followed by sequences that will make you utterly hate some characters initially but as movie unfolds characters develop screen opinions most characters will gradually change this is rarity bollywood movies because many them have characters that are purely good or evil there is no middle ground everything is looked as black or white 30 minutes into movie you can predict plot by connecting dots between good bad characters but what if you start watching movie where characters are constantly evolving screen every character has some evil some nobility him that is when things become unpredictable keep you edge your seat if it is thriller like this story is greed desperation combined with poverty has way bringing out monsters people you would usually deem as normal let me go ahead say that you will find no character likable movie correction i liked all characters but i could not root any them but if i had make exception i would say one character would come out positive light by end movie even if there is some evil him her this movie is very condensed concentrated with many raw heavy hitting scenes that prompt vivid reactions expressive audience plot is captivating progresses linearly with some retrospection between kashyap manages have his audience edge their seats 15 minutes into movie if you are sucker suspense thrillers like i am you wont be leaning back rest movie kashyap also compels you empathize cringe at plight despair characters lot which is brought onto them by themselves kashyap is master at writing characters finding impeccable actors bring them life lack make up combined with many improvised scenes give real life rawness experience you are not used bollywood movies movie apocalypse now where character played by marlon brando talks about horror is scene that resonates deeply with audience that was improvised scene played by brando who hardly could remember lines thus improvised front cameras give us arguably greatest scene ever kashyap obviously understands positives improvisation lets his extremely talented cast do their thing i only hope these actors get recognition they deserve all all ugly is best bollywood has offer year 2014 i can confidently say that without even watching 99 hindi movies that came out 2014 it is entertaining inspiring i wish i could meet mr kashyap person thank him all wonderful creations he is one very few reasons i still bother with bollywood i wish he managed squeeze kay kay menon manoj bajpai somewhere that is only silly complaint i have about this movie,0.6182863490675992,0.07739328379953381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,Kashyap's Darkest & Finest Hour!,"Anurag Kashyap delivers a disturbing & unsettling tale with 'Ugly', a film that's raw & realistic. Kashyap also aces with superb performances, led by Ronit Roy & Rahul Bhat. 'Ugly' Synopsis: A terrible tale of corruption, indifference, and systemic violence starts when 10 year old daughter of an aspiring actor disappears.Throughly engaging & interesting, Kashyap creates a world of deception & cruelty, with absolutely no inhibitions. 'Ugly' is entirely grim & bleak, a film that has an atmosphere of its own. The characters are Grey, while the narrative is blunt & on-your-face.Kashyap's Screenplay is excellent. Its entirely twisted & serious. I'd like to point out, the last scene of the film, it's haunting & the Screenplay peaks itself then. Kashyap's Direction is suitably creepy & eerie. Cinematography & Editing are perfect Performance-Wise: Ronit Roy is outstanding as the cop. Displaying anger & frustration, with zeal. Rahul Bhat is a revelation. His performance here, deserves distinction marks. Tejaswini Kolhapure is brilliantly restrained. Vineet Kumar Singh is fabulous, yet again. Girish Kulkarni is highly effective. Surveen Chawla is effective, in a brief role. Siddhanth Kapoor is impressive. Late Abir Goswami is decent. On the whole, 'Ugly' is a massive winner from Kashyap! He ends 2014, with a roar!

9.0,"Dark, Intense and Disturbing : A tale of wretched human motives","It is one of the best to have come out of the Kashyap factory in terms of script and characters. It is one taut, dark, intense and disturbing tale of wretched nature of the human motives and how the grand plan has it's own way of laughing at those.Interestingly Ugly through each of it's elements will take you back to Kashyap's previous works and remind you why he is truly the king. The brilliant script writing will remind you of Black Friday, Kashyap's first masterpiece. The excellent visual treatment, even though it's not a feature throughout the film is something without which any of AK's films is incomplete. The trippy background score by Brian Oncomber is the stand out feature in the second half of the film when the film begins to approach the tipping point.Without doubt, the hero of the film is it's characters. Rarely would you come across a film full of complex characters, where the motives of every action of those characters get automatically clear as the story progresses. You do not know what to appreciate more, the courage with which the director is bluntly showing the depraved complexion of human nature or the ease with which that has been knit in a story.The non linear nature of the storytelling in the first half brings the necessary variation which adds to the build up.Rahul Bhat who is seen on screen after a long gap tells you why there is no dearth of excellent character actors in the country, it's just that there are not enough roles for them. Vineet Singh, aka Danish Khan from GOW, will make you cringe and laugh with the expletive chain reaction. Ronit Roy, in his second powerhouse appearance in a Kashyap production, is perfectly cast. And one performance which is straight out of life is of Girish Kulkarni, as the police inspector. There is as much sincerity in his laugh as is in his sombre face. The one liners are so on mark that you would forget that there is a reel rolling.Surely, the film has some of it's elements similar to that of Fargo, the classic Hollywood dark comedy, but it never plays on your mind, so it wouldn't qualify as lifting. Kashyapwa has done it again. Can't believe what made them to hold the film for so long.Dear AK, you are the dark shining light of Bollywood.

10.0,Ugly - The Requiem for the Dreams,"So what is UGLY? Is it something like SHAITAAN, everyone has a UGLY side ..blah blah?? Or is it like Black Friday, pure reality of the system?? The best Kashyap's movie??I would say it shows how great Anurag Kashyak is as a film maker. It is a cocktail of intensity and emotional finesse from the Korean Movies, the craziness from the Brazilian, the shock from the Italian and the Caos from Fincher.The movie is so real, for an Indian audience he would not be surprised with a lot of things as he/she know the system, but he would definitely be surprised to see the limit of it, and to see what could be wrong. The movie shows the limit of efforts one can put and how desperate one gets. The humans are shown as parasites surviving on others, and how UGLY can they get for their survival and dreams. And when these dreams don't fulfill as planned things get UGLYThe movie is a really well written mystery thriller, the screenplay is amazing, the characters are real, and the acting is wonderful. Amazing work at the casting and background score.There is no shaitaan side of people they are actually like that to the core -UGLY",ugly requiem dreams,so what is ugly is it something like shaitaan everyone has ugly side blah blah or is it like black friday pure reality system best kashyaps movie i would say it shows how great anurag kashyak is as film maker it is cocktail intensity emotional finesse korean movies craziness brazilian shock italian caos fincher movie is so real indian audience he would not be surprised with lot things as he she know system but he would definitely be surprised see limit it see what could be wrong movie shows limit efforts one can put how desperate one gets humans are shown as parasites surviving others how ugly can they get their survival dreams when these dreams dont fulfill as planned things get uglythe movie is really well written mystery thriller screenplay is amazing characters are real acting is wonderful amazing work at casting background score there is no shaitaan side people they are actually like that core ugly,0.6696969696969698,0.0021645021645022074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,"A brilliantly scripted, extraordinary directed & perfectly executed movie.","The year 2014 has its last release on its last Friday, named Ugly, a suspense thriller movie by Anurag Kashyap. He is known for his dramatic, unique, bold and dark flicks. I have mostly seen all his films, but, however this film is very different and so much dark. In trailer, we can conclude the storyline of Ugly. A girl is missing from the market, whose parents are not staying together. She lives with her mom and her step father. Everyone except this girl has dark sides, dark past. So when the girl got missing the girl's step father who is an IPS, starts finding her among her relatives. The story is very very fast, no one can move their eyes from the screen not a single second. Will the girl be found ? Who kidnapped her - her father, mother or anyone else? In the end, you will get the answer. & I'm sure, the answer will be so disturbing for all of you. As per my experience, you can not able to stand up instantly after the end. Ronit Roy as an IPS & as a step-father & as a woman's second husband - in all three shades, he is just outstanding. His expressions when he shows his anger are too good. Rahul Bhat is an impressive actor, he plays the lead role brilliantly. Dark shades under his eyes and beard face look describes the dedication from him towards his role. Tejaswini perfectly suits in her role. Vinit Singh is as usual fantastic. Surveen Chawala is good. Others are also good. I have to mention an actor, who plays the role of DCP Gupta, Abir Goswami. He is just fabulous in his role. The 4-5 minutes scene where Rahul and Vinit explain the incident in the police station, is just hilarious. I couldn't control myself & just laughing. OMG! What a scene! This scene deserves 5/5 from my side. Anurag Kashyap again proved that he is the king of making dark and period films. His direction as well as writing is very sharp. Screenplay, dialogues, background music - everything is extraordinary. Specially that music when the police is catching the man dancing in underwear. So, brilliantly scripted, extraordinary directed & perfectly executed film Ugly deserves 5*/5*. But, this film is not for family audiences or those who can't see Ugly things.",brilliantly scripted extraordinary directed perfectly executed movie,year 2014 has its last release its last friday named ugly suspense thriller movie by anurag kashyap he is known his dramatic unique bold dark flicks i have mostly seen all his films but however this film is very different so much dark trailer we can conclude storyline ugly girl is missing market whose parents are not staying together she lives with her mom her step father everyone except this girl has dark sides dark past so when girl got missing girls step father who is ips starts finding her among her relatives story is very very fast no one can move their eyes screen not single second will girl be found who kidnapped her her father mother or anyone else end you will get answer im sure answer will be so disturbing all you as per my experience you can not able stand up instantly after end ronit roy as ips as step father as womans second husband all three shades he is just outstanding his expressions when he shows his anger are too good rahul bhat is impressive actor he plays lead role brilliantly dark shades under his eyes beard face look describes dedication him towards his role tejaswini perfectly suits her role vinit singh is as usual fantastic surveen chawala is good others are also good i have mention actor who plays role dcp gupta abir goswami he is just fabulous his role 4 5 minutes scene where rahul vinit explain incident police station is just hilarious i couldnt control myself just laughing omg what scene this scene deserves 5 5 my side anurag kashyap again proved that he is king making dark period films his direction as well as writing is very sharp screenplay dialogues background music everything is extraordinary specially that music when police is catching man dancing underwear so brilliantly scripted extraordinary directed perfectly executed film ugly deserves 5 5 but this film is not family audiences or those who cant see ugly things,0.6505361192095886,0.14317055393586006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.23}"

4.0,Too Many Loose Ends and Unanswered Questions,"Typical AK movie focusing on the dark and the ugly in the world, yet gripping to watch. However, I was disappointed with a number of unanswered questions and illogical events. Spoilers Ahead*The mask seller who died had to be the prime suspect all along. Yet the police are so inept that they never mount a serious investigation into his and his aunt's antecedents till the end of the movie. The police even mount a nationwide hunt and recover many abducted children, yet they choose not to pursue the most logical line of investigation till the end. How convenient for the director! Rahul and Chaitanya commit several serious crimes such as armed robbery and assault and buying illegal arms. Yet they walk around free. The robbed jeweler presumably did not lodge any FIR, in order to not make things difficult for the director!It is not clear why Chaitanya had been such a help to Rahul earlier but now wants to help himself to ransom money? He is a prime suspect in the eyes of the police after his first ransom bid, yet the police allow him to walk away, and then make a second bid. The police does not put him under surveillance or confiscate his computer or search his office immediately after the second ransom bid, even though they know he had attempted this earlier. How convenient for the director!Shalini gives away the ransom money but makes no attempt to secure the child in exchange or even convince herself that the child is alive and she will be returned. Who behaves like that?Her father is shown to be well off and loving. She is herself educated and from a good family. Yet she endures ill-treatment from her husbands for herself and her child but does not seek her dad's help.Rahul kills Chaitanya in a rage supposedly because he realizes that Chaitanya has been lying to him about Bose abducting the child. Yet he does not ask himself why would Bose do this for ransom and assuming he did so, why would he release the child later, because his motive is supposedly to frame Rahul and not lay his hands on money.There are many other illogical details such as these. This is the main grouse I have with films and directors that purport to be realistic and intelligent, yet assume that their audience does not have a brain and will accept anything.

6.0,An above average thriller with all ugly but realistic characters offering quite less than what was being raved about.,"Before moving into the review, I would like to give you the story behind this latest Anurag Kashyap film UGLY, post the mediocre UNGLI and FUGLY having confusingly rhyming names. Ready long before these two films, UGLY made into Cannes and other festivals around the world early last year and got some extreme mixed reviews from many reputed names. So for records, it was not any unanimous applause received by the film which was largely being speculated & discussed here at the social media before its release. Perhaps this has become another norm of promoting the films here in India, when it comes to off-beat cinema not exactly targeting the masses.Anyway even after its completion, the film could not release for so long due to probably more than one reason including Kashyap's fight against the compulsory insertion of ""Statuary Smoking Warning"" with the Censors. But since the torrent of the film was reportedly out before its official release and the court case also failed to deliver the desired results, UGLY was planned to be released just one week post PK since many a times only one choice of new film in the theaters, apart from the bigger one, does bring in the viewer trying the odd one out. Coming on to the review, I frankly found myself standing among those who couldn't find it as brilliant as was being raved about since long and enjoyed it only as an above average thriller featuring a director's personal indulgence more than anything else. For instance, discuss it with a viewer or read any review in the media, they all would emphasize on three major points of the movie unarguably in the exact sequence mentioned below.First, it has to be the 8-10 minutes long sequence of Police Station when a puzzled father and his friend is there reporting a missing girl child conversing with the station officer. The scene is surely one of the best interpretations of real life situations on the screen in the recent times superbly played by Girish Kulkarni as the ignorant inspector weirdly chatting about mobiles, computers and incoming call pictures instead of writing a complaint. And the way his attitude changes knowing that its about the step daughter of his own senior officer, simply points towards the questionable functioning of our police and their rude behavior.Second comes the final shot of the film, revealing the cruel ugliness behind the mystery shaking you real hard as it has never been so brutal on the Indian screen before, in any 'crime thriller' or 'who done it' movie to be straight. In fact such is the jaw dropping impact of this particular aerial shot that it doesn't let you ponder back on the entire film catching its various flaws and one comes out of theater pretty impressed recovering from the unexpected shock received all of a sudden.The third common point in any view or review would be the worth praising realistic performances by almost the entire cast led by Tejasvini Kolhapure from the front along with Ronit Roy and Rahul Bhatt. The supporting cast plays its own important role worth noticing in the tense proceedings. Still despite Ronit's flawless portrayal, he plays nothing fresh and now sadly is being offered the same roles of an angry father/officer one after another by our talented film-makers following the sick, ages-old pattern of Bollywood.Revolving around all ugly but truthful characters that evidently are an unwanted part of our social structure, UGLY takes no time to come to its basic storyline dragging you in. But then keeps stretching on the thin plot with many interesting angles of wicked relationships thrown in failing to make any emotional connect with the viewer. As a result post intermission the erratic ego clashes, ill ambitions and extreme graphical violence takes over the basic theme dropping its overall pace and the director gets too much indulged in these all forgetting the poor soul kidnapped. Meanwhile, within this tension he also finds time to mock the use of item girl/songs in our Hindi films, inserting the 'must- have' skin show too featuring Surveen Chawla who is fast becoming the 'ready to shed her clothes girl' of the industry willfully. The camera-work gives the desired eerie feel to the film perfectly depicting the poor locales of Mumbai and Background score/Soundtrack is as raw as required with a fine mix of pop and rock both designed and used efficiently.Hence UGLY stays an above average dark thriller mainly because it keeps exploring the cunning, greedy characters throughout missing that emotional touch one should feel thinking about the kidnap of that helpless kid girl. Following his fixed feature of ridiculing the system (found in his every movie), AK gets more involved in this very mission diluting the overall suspense factor in the film which returns only in its final five minutes and the closing shot providing that much needed shock to the viewers. In short watching all its twists and turns revealing the hidden nasty side of its various characters, the one person you forget to think about completely in those two hours is the poor girl kidnapped in the beginning.Sharing honestly, I always see a bit of AK's first film PAANCH, hiding somewhere in his every attempt intentionally or unintentionally. Probably the fact that his first baby remains unreleased till date, not reaching the audience as he wished for, gives him immense pain affecting his thought process even today. And that makes me think that had PAANCH released normally more than a decade before, we would have had an entirely different Anurag Kashyap as a director, coming out of his own gritty shell of dark realism with more love, warmth and meaning in his exceptional films.",above average thriller with all ugly but realistic characters offering quite less than what was being raved about,before moving

reportedly out before its official release court case also failed deliver desired results ugly was planned be released just one week post pk since many times only one choice new film theaters apart

8.0,More about the characters than the kidnapping,"You know I have always believed that films which are for everybody are for nobody in particular, that being said Anurag Kashyap's Ugly isn't for everybody unlike PK or other big releases. Ugly is filled with dark, complicated, insecure characters wherein everybody is either a flawed husband/ wife/ parent/ friend/ lover this makes the characters instantly relatable even though there is some exaggeration in the film. The story starts with the kidnapping of a little girl which sets into motion a chain of events where her new step father and her biological father engage in a game of upmanship and try to be the ""hero"" as the movie likes to put it by finding their daughter but they care more about satisfaction of their egos and their history dating back to college than about the girl herself. In between the movie throws in a suicidal wife who has been loved by both the men, an item girl whose claim to fame is a song called mujhko nichodley jhinnjhodley, technologically challenged cops, some really dark but really funny scenes and this film is already brimming with top notch quality. The direction is excellent and the sets are claustrophobic and uncomfortable in tune with the film and all the actors deliver. My only gripe with the film is that it fails to be a decent kidnapping story, it's so focused on character development that the kidnapping events at points seem illogical and improbable and the Alfred Hitchcock fan in me can't forgive that though the Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritichie fan in me doesn't mind.",more about characters than kidnapping,you know i have always believed that films which are everybody are nobody particular that being said anurag kashyaps ugly isnt everybody unlike pk or other big releases ugly is filled with dark complicated insecure characters wherein everybody is either flawed husband wife parent friend lover this makes characters instantly relatable even though there is some exaggeration film story starts with kidnapping little girl which sets into motion chain events where her new step father her biological father engage game upmanship try be hero as movie likes put it by finding their daughter but they care more about satisfaction their egos their history dating back college than about girl herself between movie throws suicidal wife who has been loved by both men item girl whose claim fame is song called mujhko nichodley jhinnjhodley technologically challenged cops some really dark but really funny scenes this film is already brimming with top notch quality direction is excellent sets are claustrophobic uncomfortable tune with film all actors deliver my only gripe with film is that it fails be decent kidnapping story its so focused character development that kidnapping events at points seem illogical improbable alfred hitchcock fan me cant forgive that though quentin tarantino guy ritichie fan me doesnt mind,0.6267115600448935,-0.049733445566778896,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,Black Humor Crime Thriller - True Ugliness,"This movie left you with the feeling of numb .Ugly sets a new dimension to the Indian Cinema . I am not a frequent watcher of Bollywood movies.But ugly movie is just beyond the ugliness of everything. A grungy, dark police procedural set in motion by a little girl's kidnapping, Ugly has few discernible auteur touches to set it apart from standard genre fare. Gone are the farcical, hyperbolic violence and the larger-than-life, tongue-in-cheek gangsters who modeled themselves on the movies. Gone is the wacky humor. Here the pettiness, egotism and corruption of modern Mumbai rule and the characters are all cheap and small—even the kidnapping victim is annoying. There may be a method here but if so, the result is very dark and downbeat for general audiences. The film's Cannes outing and Kashyap's cult standing could give it a little shelf life at festivals before it heads into genre venues. The cast of characters is presented haphazardly. Shalini (Tejaswini Kolhapure) is a desperate, middle-class housewife kept at home as a semi-prisoner by her macho police-chief husband Bose (Ronit Roy). She's about to blow her brains out with his gun when a knock on the door stops her. It's her daughter Kali (Anishika Shrivastava), whining for her to call her estranged father. This is Rahul (Rahul Bhatt), a down-and-out actor still waiting for his big break, who comes to take her for a drive. He's so distracted with phone calls he barely looks at her, and then he ominously leaves her alone in the car while he goes to talk business with his friend and casting director Chaitanya (Vineet Kumar Singh). Within minutes the girl is missing. Rahul becomes the hero by default as he searches for the girl, first through the police, then following the kidnappers' ransom messages. What little sympathy he inspires in the audience comes from his terrifying interview with local police captain Jadhav (played with gusto by the fine comic actor Girish Kulkarni). Instead of launching a manhunt for the girl, the captain absurdly chats about CELL PHONES and computers while the distraught Rahul chafes and Chaitanya attempts to cajole him into action. All at once, Jadhav realizes the missing girl is the stepdaughter of police honcho Bose, and his attitude switches to FBI pro. At this point the stone-faced Bose, who hates his wife's ex, orders him to accuse Rahul of the kidnapping and be beaten senseless. The rest of the film is a battle of wits between Bose and Rahul to find the girl while tripping up the other. Rahul and Chaitanya are monotonously arrested and rearrested. Police violence is graphic and frightening. They use the ""latest"" gadgets in their investigation— computers, CELL PHONES and GPS—like they were major novelties on CSI: Miami, which makes it seem the film is aimed mainly at local audiences. There is, however, a continuous sense of vitality and movement in the film, whose action scenes are foot chases filmed from a distance. Kashyap's nasty point is that, between violence, greed and corruption, just about no one is innocent in the end. Certainly all the characters are selfish beyond belief. This existential cynicism hits home in the horrific crime revealed in the last shot, but by that time, the emotions feel light-years away.",black humor crime thriller true ugliness,this movie left you with feeling numb ugly sets new dimension indian cinema i am not frequent watcher bollywood movies but ugly movie is just beyond ugliness everything grungy dark police procedural set motion by little girls kidnapping ugly has few discernible auteur touches set it apart standard genre fare gone are farcical hyperbolic violence larger than life tongue cheek gangsters who modeled themselves movies gone is wacky humor here pettiness egotism corruption modern mumbai rule characters are all cheap small even kidnapping victim is annoying there may be method here but if so result is very dark downbeat general audiences films cannes outing kashyaps cult standing could give it little shelf life at festivals before it heads into genre venues cast characters is presented haphazardly shalini tejaswini kolhapure is desperate middle class housewife kept at home as semi prisoner by her macho police chief husband bose ronit roy shes about blow her brains out with his gun when knock door stops her its her daughter kali anishika shrivastava whining her call her estranged father this is rahul rahul bhatt down out actor still waiting his big break who comes take her drive hes so distracted with phone calls he barely looks at her then he ominously leaves her alone car while he goes talk business with his friend casting director chaitanya vineet kumar singh within minutes girl is missing rahul becomes hero by default as he searches girl first through police then following kidnappers ransom messages what little sympathy he inspires audience comes his terrifying interview with local police captain jadhav played with gusto by fine comic actor girish kulkarni instead launching manhunt girl captain absurdly chats about cell phones computers while distraught rahul chafes chaitanya attempts cajole him into action all at once jadhav realizes missing girl is stepdaughter police honcho bose his attitude switches fbi pro at this point stone faced bose who hates his wifes ex orders him accuse rahul kidnapping be beaten senseless rest film is battle wits between bose rahul find girl while tripping up other rahul chaitanya are monotonously arrested rearrested police violence is graphic frightening they use latest gadgets their investigation computers cell phones gps like they were major novelties csi miami which makes it seem film is aimed mainly at local audiences there is however continuous sense vitality movement film whose action scenes are foot chases filmed distance kashyaps nasty point is that between violence greed corruption just about no one is innocent end certainly all characters are selfish beyond belief this existential cynicism hits home horrific crime revealed last shot but by that time emotions feel light years away,0.50246890083097,-0.14913631387769316,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,No one's really beautiful...,"(...there are just mediocre men)When the movie ends, you just know what ""Ugly"" stands for. Another missing-child movie? Hey, wait. Since Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"", we know that there is still something new to bring to this film genre. Two references came immediately to my mind when watching ""Ugly"": ""Fargo"" and Korean thrillers. The movie borrows a nice set of money-hungry losers from ""Fargo"" and a frantic pace and plot from Korean detective movies. Add a pinch of dark humor and social critique and you're bound to have a startling piece of work that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the even more startling ending. Sometimes you'll get the impression that everything goes way too fast, but be patient, each erratic behavior, each twist in the narration has an explanation. The story starts with the kidnapping of an aspiring actor's daughter. This aspiring actor (Rahul) has a suicidal ex-wife married to a temperamental police captain, once Rahul's rival when they were kids. Rahul has also a best friend who is ready to stab him in the back whenever he can. Now, imagine how the situation becomes exacerbated by the aforementioned relationships, then add a fair amount of scheming, double crosses and triple crosses, laced with a good dose of police corruption. You can start to imagine how the situation will evolve and you won't be even close to reality. Because on top of everything, believe it or not, the plot is based on actual facts.If you want to check if truth can be indeed stranger than fiction, try this one.

,Gone girl OR Puppa calling (with the snap),"A breath of fresh air! Finally. After the gamut of crappy potboilers unleashed relentlessly throughout the year (with many more to come, we might be sure), for some reason, the industry has saved the best for last. I'm not sure if this was sent for shortlisting to the Oscars, but if it wasn't, it should have been. All that apart, I'm not being thankful enough for it's eventual release, after being stuck in censor hell over the anti-smoking ads. I won't even get into that, since its been discussed about till the horse died, and then died again, and again.The movie itself is a statement on how one event sets in motion an juggernaut that spares no one in its path, especially from their trying to profit from it, regardless of the outcome for the protagonist/victim. Which is typical, though our hero-worshiping stories often adopt a holier-than-thou approach, oftentimes borrowing from the deity-like treatment we, as a people, as a community, accord such individuals/groups, based on which lens we use to view their acts.It also touches on the way things came to be, clearly outlining, without ever talking down to us, visually tracing the trajectory of each character, and their own motivations for having done something 'ugly', or planning on the same. It shows that there is no respite from such machinations, and Anurag Kashyap, for sure, has no faith in the human race. Not criticizing his lens, since I quite agree with the way he chooses to view humanity as a whole, as those lacking humanity in any form - kinda ironic, yet fitting.The performances, as from any Kashyap movie, are all uniformly fantastic, and never take away from any of the events unfolding on screen. The humor is appropriately dark, and as for the darkness that pervades every sequence, what more to be said than for observing that this is perhaps Kashyap's darkest entry to-date, perhaps even beating 'That girl in the yellow boots'.Reminded me a lot of Kamal's 'Mahanadi' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140348/combined), and in a good way too, since that was a top quality movie, other than for those instances where Kamal went overboard as only he can. But this is a good comparison to make, since in that flick, the sum total is still lesser than the thespian that Kamal was at the time (he has not made a movie as great as he used to for a while now, and while 'Vish..' was a sorta return-to-form, it still falls short of his great ones), while in this one, the movie is greater than the sum of all its players - yes, even those that almost walk away with their scenes. However (and some might think this is the pretentious person in me awakening), this ain't all perfect, not by a long shot. There are sequences that almost lean into the aspect of suspension-of- disbelief by events that unfold later not holding up a few (corresponding) sequences that came before, from a storytelling viewpoint, making us question why certain twists were put in play in the first place. Was it just for effect? I don't remember Kashyap succumbing to that mainstream feeling, and would like to attribute it to my not comprehending the red herrings that led to one/more(?) of those. Having said that, a repeat viewing might st that right. The soundtrack has to be one of the more powerful ones used, and it is interesting to note Kashyap's return to the urban milieu after the GOW movies, almost like he was missing this. Also love that he works with newer and newer actors, who also benefit from the introduction to their audiences, and even mayhaps, new fans. Vineet Singh in particular, though not very well served (or perhaps from the same lack of complete comprehension) by the screenplay, acquits himself the best, since he seems to (IMO, inconsistently) possess shades of gray, and shades of extreme noir, and rolls with the punches, so to speak.Once again, write this off to my having missed certain aspects while they unfolded, but I also felt that a few sequences would up being quite abrupt. While I sometimes understand the purpose of a few of those decisions, I missed the point of the tool as such. Maybe, 1 more viewing might set that right as well. I can give Phantom that much. :-). Something else interesting - one of the key strengths of good storytelling, and I've held this opinion for a while now, is relentless pacing, whether one is being minimalist or otherwise. This flick, on the other hand, has so many things crammed into it (and not in a bad way, mind) that it actually feel lengthier than its 127 minutes. For any other flick, by any other helmer, that might be the opposite of a compliment, but for this one, it can wear it as a badge of honor. Almost as in, I can watch a version of 'Mahabharatha' made by Kashyap, and I'm sure he'll tell the whole saga without any edits within a couple of hours. If anyone can pull that off at all, its Kashyap working in GOW/Ugly mode.Goes without saying - big screen only, in spite of the fact that this theatrical cut is not what Kashyap wanted screened.

8.0,This Ugly is Beautifully Grim,"Ugly is a dark, disturbing tale that twists and turns on itself like an Escher print. Just when you think you know where this thriller is going, Anurag Kashyap throws back the shroud to reveal another face to the madcap and demented mystery. The rusty knife that is stuck in your gut gets twisted into angles you never thought possible.Synopsis A divorced aspiring actor draws a formal agreement with his wife enabling him to spend time with their daughter on Saturdays. One such day when he is busy discussing possible acting opportunities with his casting director, he leaves his daughter in his car. Within minutes, his daughter goes missing from the car. The abducted kid's stepfather - a police officer, joins her parents in a three way lookout for her. Who cares more among the father, stepfather, mother and what ends they are ready to explore is what makes Ugly.Review Although it is as grim as death, I found great sick dark humour. Initially the film has no fats, then it reaches a scene where the absentee dad and his friend are recording their statement at a local police station. The dialogue just goes on and on with loads of irrelevant details which made me laugh and laugh. It feels like a dialogue typically written by Tarantino to build up nail-biting suspense. But Kashyap has higher aspirations than that. As I LOL I realized it is a damning critique of bureaucracy and how people of authority sees the lower denominator of the population.The only misstep is a meandering middle act but the final OMG shot made up for it a hundred times over. An awesome morality tale with no innocent persons (except the little girl) and a sharp critique of the modern society that judges people before finding out the truth. I have not seen a lot of new Hindi releases this year but I must say this one is the best. For the more adventurous cinephile out there.",this ugly is beautifully grim,ugly is dark disturbing tale that twists turns itself like escher print just when you think you know where this thriller is going anurag kashyap throws back shroud reveal another face madcap demented mystery rusty knife that is stuck your gut gets twisted into angles you never thought possible synopsis divorced aspiring actor draws formal agreement with his wife enabling him spend time with their daughter saturdays one such day when he is busy discussing possible acting opportunities with his casting director he leaves his daughter his car within minutes his daughter goes missing car abducted kids stepfather police officer joins her parents three way lookout her who cares more among father stepfather mother what ends they are ready explore is what makes ugly review although it is as grim as death i found great sick dark humour initially film has no fats then it reaches scene where absentee dad his friend are recording their statement at local police station dialogue just goes with loads irrelevant details which made me laugh laugh it feels like dialogue typically written by tarantino build up nail biting suspense but kashyap has higher aspirations than that as i lol i realized it is damning critique bureaucracy how people authority sees lower denominator population only misstep is meandering middle act but final omg shot made up it hundred times over awesome morality tale with no innocent persons except little girl sharp critique modern society that judges people before finding out truth i have not seen lot new hindi releases this year but i must say this one is best more adventurous cinephile out there,0.5840422077922077,-0.023927218614718637,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"
