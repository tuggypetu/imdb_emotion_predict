1.0,"God awful camera work. Ok acting, trash story riddled with errors.","Once you get through the entry setup it quickly jumps right into the bank heist. The are portrayed as clueless, yet the Boss Jake has loads of expensive toys from his successful robbing career.The robbery is super simple, and it's over in 10 mins. The rest of the movie, the remaining 2 hours, is the chase. Each bag has 8Mil in 100s, which weighs 176 pounds. Both actors carry them around like they are empty. The constant erratic unstable camera work will give you a head ache, needless and annoying.Tons of character issues. The female paramedic fleeing the ambulance with a person in critical condition. Armed gunman refuse to leave an ambulance and stays in an emergency vehicle. Lead investigator is gay and in marriage counseling at the time he gets a call. Lead cop calls off a 15 car police chase cause his dog is in one of the cars?? Wtf. Jake is making calls and arguing about party favors.And of course it has to get even more outrageous. Lets try open chest surgery in the back of a moving ambulance rocking down the highway. More unnecessary shaky camera work. Phone battery dies.So the same hero EMT who flees, jumps into the line of fire to prevent the group from being shot. Just so many terrible character decisions. Two brothers get into a front seat fight while driving. Ugh. Let's spray paint an EMT vehicle to disguise it.The entire movie is based on the fear of shooting/killing a cop, then an entire attack is designed to kill cops. Unreal. Ending is just unappealing as they come.

3.0,"Dumb, dumber, and even more dumber!","Dumb, dumber, and even more dumber! Ambulance is one those thrill rides you watch for the thrill for the first time. Years latter or the second time you watch Ambulance and says this is so stupid. Ambulance is a mix of the movie Heat and Speed all in one. There is the Woke characters, and the brothers from different mothers theme which is shows Hollywood is dying from running out of ideas. There is a bank robbery turned into a Ambulance jack. With chases with Ambulance surgery done online by an E M T. After that a drug cartel workout with a plan of several Ambulance as an escape plan. This over top attempts tires to over come flat characters from the usual Hollywood stereotypes. Drug cartels guys, tough E M T women, the army vet black guy trying help his family, which has the same old just done over and over in so many different ways. In spite of this a thrill ride which is fun to watch for first time, Ambulance is a desperate attempt to re do another Lethal Weapon, Taken, and Die Hard type movie. So over the top it's different, but the usual flat characters mixed with little story makes this a B movie. 3 stars.",dumb dumber even more dumber,dumb dumber even more dumber ambulance is one those thrill rides you watch thrill first time years latter or second time you watch ambulance says this is so stupid ambulance is mix movie heat speed all one there is woke characters brothers different mothers theme which is shows hollywood is dying running out ideas there is bank robbery turned into ambulance jack with chases with ambulance surgery done online by e m t after that drug cartel workout with plan several ambulance as escape plan this over top attempts tires over come flat characters usual hollywood stereotypes drug cartels guys tough e m t women army vet black guy trying help his family which has same old just done over over so many different ways spite this thrill ride which is fun watch first time ambulance is desperate attempt re do another lethal weapon taken die hard type movie so over top its different but usual flat characters mixed with little story makes this b movie 3 stars,0.4068965517241379,-0.011542145593869724,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,More Exhausting Than Exhilarating,"Stylishly directed, jam-packed with chases and keeping the fun aspect alive for the most part if not all the way, Ambulance moves into top gear relatively quick and never takes the foot off the pedal once it gets going but the road it takes to reach its destination ends up being longer than what the gas in the tank can handle, thus resulting in a ride that's running on fumes way before the end is in sight.Directed by Michael Bay, the premise is simple, setup is quick & thrills are endless even if much of the narrative elements seem underdeveloped. Bay utilises his usual unabashed over-the-top approach that provide his standard blockbuster fares an explosive, extravagant flavour and he amplifies the nonstop action some more with kinetic camerawork, chaotic vibe, frenetic editing and wicked character interplay.The energy & passion is evident in execution and the use of drones to film the chase sequences is undoubtedly inspiring but this would've been an even better action-thriller if it was trimmed to a tight & tense 90 mins ride. Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II & Eiza Gonz√°lez remain in sync with the craziness on display. And while the interest & momentum isn't lost, one does start to feel its 136 mins runtime in the remaining half.Overall, Ambulance is amusing, entertaining & preposterous in all the ways a Michael Bay film is expected to be but it is also a whole lot of fast fun & furious frivolity that manages to get plenty of mileage out of its barebone premise. The lack of restraint isn't an issue since it is one of the fine qualities of a Bayhem production but its overlong length does leave you feeling more exhausted than exhilarated in the end. In short, a gleeful & enjoyable delight.",more exhausting than exhilarating,stylishly directed jam packed with chases keeping fun aspect alive most part if not all way ambulance moves into top gear relatively quick never takes foot off pedal once it gets going but road it takes reach its destination ends up being longer than what gas tank can handle thus resulting ride thats running fumes way before end is sight directed by michael bay premise is simple setup is quick thrills are endless even if much narrative elements seem underdeveloped bay utilises his usual unabashed over top approach that provide his standard blockbuster fares explosive extravagant flavour he amplifies nonstop action some more with kinetic camerawork chaotic vibe frenetic editing wicked character interplay energy passion is evident execution use drones film chase sequences is undoubtedly inspiring but this wouldve been even better action thriller if it was trimmed tight tense 90 mins ride jake gyllenhaal yahya abdul mateen ii eiza gonz lez remain sync with craziness display while interest momentum isnt lost one does start feel its 136 mins runtime remaining half overall ambulance is amusing entertaining preposterous all ways michael bay film is expected be but it is also whole lot fast fun furious frivolity that manages get plenty mileage out its barebone premise lack restraint isnt issue since it is one fine qualities bayhem production but its overlong length does leave you feeling more exhausted than exhilarated end short gleeful enjoyable delight,0.4556628056628056,0.20756113256113257,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.29}"

4.0,Crazy Action Flick with Uneven Pacing,"Lately, Jake Gyllenhaal had been tackling very high-strung excitable characters, like supervillain Mysterio in ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" (2019) and the troubled 911 operator in ""The Guilty"" (2021). His character Danny Sharp here was really a scary, crazy guy who simply snapped as things did not go his way on this particular day, when his perfectly-laid plans miscarried and was unraveling in the worst possible way.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II turned heads as the charismatic Black Panther head Bobby Seale in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" (2020). His William Sharp is a considerably more vulnerable character -- a man driven to crime by sheer desperation. In her biggest role since her breakthrough in ""Baby Driver"" (2017), Eiza Gonzalez's fearless EMT Cam is quite attention-getting, especially for her ""successful"" surgery using her hair clip as a vascular clamp.This remake of a 2005 Danish film was one big, over-the-top, exaggerated hyperbole, a Bay trademark. To add more chaos, he made sure that the ambulance had fruits or flowers or dresses to hit and scatter around. The camera was in constant dizzying motion, coming in and out from various angles. Running at a hefty 136 minutes, the whole thing felt bloated and can actually be tiresome to watch with all the medical absurdities and manic energy it had.",crazy action flick with uneven pacing,lately jake gyllenhaal had been tackling very high strung excitable characters like supervillain mysterio spider man far home 2019 troubled 911 operator guilty 2021 his character danny sharp here was really scary crazy guy who simply snapped as things did not go his way this particular day when his perfectly laid plans miscarried was unraveling worst possible way yahya abdul mateen ii turned heads as charismatic black panther head bobby seale trial chicago 7 2020 his william sharp is considerably more vulnerable character man driven crime by sheer desperation her biggest role since her breakthrough baby driver 2017 eiza gonzalezs fearless emt cam is quite attention getting especially her successful surgery using her hair clip as vascular clamp this remake 2005 danish film was one big over top exaggerated hyperbole bay trademark add more chaos he made sure that ambulance had fruits or flowers or dresses hit scatter around camera was constant dizzying motion coming out various angles running at hefty 136 minutes whole thing felt bloated can actually be tiresome watch with all medical absurdities manic energy it had,0.6749421101774042,-0.032117647058823535,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Lame.,"No idea why the talented Jake Gyllenhaal would want to be in this mess of a movie. Cardboard cutout characters who utter painfully stupid dialogue in an underdeveloped plot. Its attempt to pay homage to paramedics, police officers, and surgeons is obvious and eye roll worthy. The most laughable scene is an operation being performed in the back of the ambulance while FaceTiming with a surgeon who is on a golf course and he's walking them through it.

3.0,Bad is an understatement.,"You can see they had a budget for this movie, with big action scenes that must have cost a lot, but that's not a guarantee for success. Quite the opposite I would say, as Ambulance started okay to quickly lose every credibility it might have had. The story is full of holes or scenes that just don't make much sense. Whomever wrote this plot, these dialogues, should just stop immediately with that and find himself another job. I heard McDonalds is hiring so maybe that's an option for him. Michael Bay should just quit movie making, it's just awful what he does with that much money. I normally do like Jake Gyllenhaal but this must be the worst movie he ever appeared in. The cast wasn't bad but with a script like that it's just impossible to do something good. The more the story went on the lesser stars I was going to rate it. Three stars is actually still too much, but considering the cast I'll leave it at that. In short, Ambulance looks like a high budget movie but feels like a very low budget movie. The only really good thing about this movie is when the end credits appeared. Finally I could start forgetting everything about this monstrosity.",bad is understatement,you can see they had budget this movie with big action scenes that must have cost lot but thats not guarantee success quite opposite i would say as ambulance started okay quickly lose every credibility it might have had story is full holes or scenes that just dont make much sense whomever wrote this plot these dialogues should just stop immediately with that find himself another job i heard mcdonalds is hiring so maybe thats option him michael bay should just quit movie making its just awful what he does with that much money i normally do like jake gyllenhaal but this must be worst movie he ever appeared cast wasnt bad but with script like that its just impossible do something good more story went lesser stars i was going rate it three stars is actually still too much but considering cast ill leave it at that short ambulance looks like high budget movie but feels like very low budget movie only really good thing about this movie is when end credits appeared finally i could start forgetting everything about this monstrosity,0.5134567901234568,-0.006419753086419749,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.44, 'Fear': 0.25}"

1.0,Michael Bay at his worst,"I had a really hard time convincing myself to stay and finish this movie when I saw it. The story & plot itself is silly, which I expected based on the trailers and how paper thin the setup is but visually this was headache inducing.The basic plot of this movie is that Jake Gyllenhall & Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are brothers who go on a bank heist that goes wrong. The crew they rob the bank with gets picked off one by one by the LAPD until something goes sideways as the brothers try to make their escape. Due to an unfortunate mishap, both brothers are forced to commandeer an ambulance and make a run for it. One long car chase ensues with lots of crashes, screeching tires, bullets flying and explosions.Again, this is fine because I expected it from the trailers. Also it's a Michael Bay directed film, so I expected it to be mostly style over substance and spectacle.Unfortunately the movie is visually shot with non-stop shaky cam & drone-like aerial and swirling shots. And I mean NON-STOP. It's like Michael Bay & his cinematographer shot gunned a 6-pack of Red Bull, snorted a Ziploc full of cocaine, busted out a smartphone and turned off all visual stabilization and started shooting while running.There are almost no shots where the camera isn't swooping up or down or rotating around people or things and shaking like crazy. It made it difficult to follow the action. Even in an early scene where Jake & Yahya's characters are talking, the camera is constantly revolving around them!Perhaps if Michael Bay controlled himself & shot this movie in a way where it was easier to follow the action and the camera wasn't constantly moving, I'd like this a lot more. Nothing could be more mind numbing or boring than watching a camera shake or move all over the place for nearly 90 minutes! I get that some of things being done visually are the director's trademarks but it's dialed up to 11 and just non-stop.I wouldn't recommend paying to watch this unless you absolutely have nothing better to do. The story is too silly and visually this movie is too much of a mess to be entertaining in my humble opinion.

2.0,Don't Chase It,"I don't think this was the worst Michael Bay movie. I think it's a Michael Bay Parody of a Michael Bay movie. Bay's Lady in the Water, if you will.I'm super glad I didn't see this in theatres. I may have needed an ambulance myself afterwards thanks to all the jerking around the camera did. I think I got a headache in the first 20 minutes and then it just got progressively worse.Lemme get the one-sentence plot out of the way: A ""good"" bank robber's master plan goes south right after he recruited his down-on-his-luck brother's help and hijacked the movie's title for one incredibly long cop chase that would never happen in real life.Or at least, for the love of God, I hope it wouldn't. These cops certainly caused more damage than the money the bank robbers stole and most definitely cost innocent bystander's lives.The rating for this never really peaked above 5 stars as, for the most part, it's just a dumb callback to the 90s action movies but surprisingly, the movie earned one star less as the climax came to a close. I literally hated this more and more as the last few minutes rolled into the credits.I DO appreciate this all looked practical, but at the same time, whenever anything happened, like cars flipping/crashing every couple of minutes, the camera would do its obligatory, and predictable, cutaway. Kinda like what they did to Godzilla in his 2014 reboot only...this contained 50x as many cutaways than the big green lizard's film.If you're way better than me at leaving your brain at the door and you just love a movie that prides itself on 60-edits-per-minute, more power to you. Ironically, this Ambulance nearly gave me a heart-attack.***Final Thoughts: JAKE! What's wrong with you? You MOSTLY have a solid career, but you keep taking roles like this and Velvet Buzzsaw and you're gonna end up like a joke most older actors become when they can't stop saying YES.",dont chase it,i dont think this was worst michael bay movie i think its michael bay parody michael bay movie bays lady water if you will im super glad i didnt see this theatres i may have needed ambulance myself afterwards thanks all jerking around camera did i think i got headache first 20 minutes then it just got progressively worse lemme get one sentence plot out way good bank robbers master plan goes south right after he recruited his down his luck brothers help hijacked movies title one incredibly long cop chase that would never happen real life or at least love god i hope it wouldnt these cops certainly caused more damage than money bank robbers stole most definitely cost innocent bystanders lives rating this never really peaked above 5 stars as most part its just dumb callback 90s action movies but surprisingly movie earned one star less as climax came close i literally hated this more more as last few minutes rolled into credits i do appreciate this all looked practical but at same time whenever anything happened like cars flipping crashing every couple minutes camera would do its obligatory predictable cutaway kinda like what they did godzilla his 2014 reboot only this contained 50x as many cutaways than big green lizards film if youre way better than me at leaving your brain at door you just love movie that prides itself 60 edits per minute more power you ironically this ambulance nearly gave me heart attack final thoughts jake whats wrong with you you mostly have solid career but you keep taking roles like this velvet buzzsaw youre gonna end up like joke most older actors become when they cant stop saying yes,0.4649499654934437,0.12397342995169082,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"
6.0,Absolutely surreal,Remake of a Danish comedy in an attempt to make an action movie where the only good thing is the performance of all its actors.The director in his terrible line of not allowing the film to breathe without any break.

3.0,What can you say when it's Michael Bay?,"Don't expect anything really new (or, for the most part, exciting or accurate) from Michael Bay. This movie is no exception to that.Like his many other movies, the plot is so thin you can see daylight through it. It's mainly an excuse to wreck as many vehicle as possible and kill as many people as you can allow on film.Don't expect ""character development,"" either. There are snippets that seem to be thrown is to give an excuse for making this movie. A wife needs an ""experimental operation"" that insurance won't pay for. A rookie cop is careless as his partner seeks revenge on those who injure him. An EMT was a 3rd year resident in medicine, but had to quit because she used ""speed"" and had to quit. That last one was especially disturbing since she completely forgot anything of human anatomy.The saddest things about this film are that Jake Gyllenhaal, a gifted actor, is reduced to playing a crazy stereotype in the last half of the movie, and Garret Dillahunt, an actor who has given a slew of amazing television performances, is reduced to playing a cop who leads probably the most incompetent undercover team of the LAPD.The one actor who DOES give a decent, nuanced performance, is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Unfortunately, his role is the yin to Gyllenhaal's yang: the good brother who's caught up in crazy brother's insane plot to steal money (because it's there, I guess) and who accidentally shoots a police office who is carried off in the ambulance, and later gets hijacked.ZZZZzzzzzz.",what can you say when its michael bay,dont expect anything really new or most part exciting or accurate michael bay this movie is no exception that like his many other movies plot is so thin you can see daylight through it its mainly excuse wreck as many vehicle as possible kill as many people as you can allow film dont expect character development either there are snippets that seem be thrown is give excuse making this movie wife needs experimental operation that insurance wont pay rookie cop is careless as his partner seeks revenge those who injure him emt was 3rd year resident medicine but had quit because she used speed had quit that last one was especially disturbing since she completely forgot anything human anatomy saddest things about this film are that jake gyllenhaal gifted actor is reduced playing crazy stereotype last half movie garret dillahunt actor who has given slew amazing television performances is reduced playing cop who leads probably most incompetent undercover team lapd one actor who does give decent nuanced performance is yahya abdul mateen ii unfortunately his role is yin gyllenhaals yang good brother whos caught up crazy brothers insane plot steal money because its there i guess who accidentally shoots police office who is carried off ambulance later gets hijacked zzzzzzzzzz,0.5358191287878787,0.0050426136363636576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
3.0,Terrible,"I should have known what to expect with a Michael Bay film. But this was just ridiculous. So many plot holes and character decisions that just made no sense whatsoever. Example...they enter a seemingly deserted bank via an underground parking lot (that's just holding $32 million in cash on a table) and the plan is to walk out the front door onto the Main Street with bags of money on their backs, despite them already realising there is a policeman outside. This is just one example, but there are dozens.Absolutely terrible.",terrible,i should have known what expect with michael bay film but this was just ridiculous so many plot holes character decisions that just made no sense whatsoever example they enter seemingly deserted bank via underground parking lot thats just holding 32 million cash table plan is walk out front door onto main street with bags money their backs despite them already realising there is policeman outside this is just one example but there are dozens absolutely terrible,0.6472222222222223,-0.27777777777777773,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.6}"
