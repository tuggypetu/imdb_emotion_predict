10.0,Impactful Masterpiece!,"I was eagerly waiting for this movie for ages and it has finally arrived after getting several laurels around the world. I won't reveal the story much but it is all about the scapegoat technique handled by the cops. Right from the start, the screenplay was very gripping and there was no clue about what is about to come next. The performance of the whole cast is very surprising as everyone acted to their core and brought the very best in them. Although the movie is very intense, there are some humor elements through some body languages and silly comments. It may take some sweat off our head but another scene will be right behind to take you to the edge of the seat.I haven't watched such an intense movie with so much quality content in it, delivered in a very grippy manner. Easily, this is the most impactful movie of this decade!I sincerely thank Vetrimaran for making such a masterpiece!!Cast-performance-BGM-screenplay-content = Visaranai.",impactful masterpiece,i was eagerly waiting this movie ages it has finally arrived after getting several laurels around world i wont reveal story much but it is all about scapegoat technique handled by cops right start screenplay was very gripping there was no clue about what is about come next performance whole cast is very surprising as everyone acted their core brought very best them although movie is very intense there are some humor elements through some body languages silly comments it may take some sweat off our head but another scene will be right behind take you edge seat i havent watched such intense movie with so much quality content it delivered very grippy manner easily this is most impactful movie this decade i sincerely thank vetrimaran making such masterpiece cast performance bgm screenplay content visaranai,0.5533219954648526,0.2345124716553288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Visaranai - Pinnacle of filmmaking!,"There comes a movie like Whiplash once in a while where there is lot of action primarily due to intensity of performances and absorbing screenplay. Then there are movies like Haider where the movie atmosphere is dense and disturbing that you are left cold and horrified at the very end. Visaranai is a movie that has successfully blended both these aspects in order to present a practical, rational view of the system that is part of our livelihood. I cannot remember the last time I watched such an intense, nerve chilling, baffling movie in Thamizh.As I have now noticed, Vetrimaran's films have two different halves but which are part of the same story. In Polladhavan, we see the happy, everyday youth Dhanush living a jolly good life in the first half while in the second, things take a sudden turn and he gets exposed to a world of ruthless criminals. In Aadukalam, we see Dhanush's involvement in the rivalry between 2 rival gangs in the first half, while in the latter we turn audience to how one man's greed changes his surrounding people's lives. Similarly in Visaranai, as the title suggests we are presented with 2 separate interrogations with different scenarios in both halves of the movie. The movie attempts at one thing as beautifully explained by Kishore in one scene - The system is the boss and we are just pawns playing a game in it. The powerful always prey on the powerless and there is no way that one who has been nabbed in the web escape out from it. This is explained through layers of tightly scripted scenes with lots of crude violence, not to a forced extent of skipping the movie but watching it as if the horror where happening in front of your eyes. Few minutes into the movie the story starts unraveling and you start feeling a slight chilling fear which later keeps intensifying exponentially until the very end where you are left distraught. The range of emotions portrayed by the variety of villains torturing the innocents affect you up to a level that you start trembling as if watching a horror movie. Off late we have been seeing great improvements in movies like Thani Oruvan where a lone hero fights corrupt, antisocial elements in the society and this one breaks all those clich√©s to state a point that the system cannot be won over. I was particularly reminded of the Brazilian film duology 'Tropa De Elite' where the story ends with an unstated ""moral"" that criminals, politicians and police are of the same circle and you end up on the losing side if you mess with them.Performance wise, Dinesh continues with an impressive tough role which might prove as a highlight in his career. I somehow feel convinced that Samuthirakani must be considered the real protagonist as his role portrays how a honest person becomes prey to the system and is left torn without options at the crux. The music, camera and editing cuts add more intense chill to the atmosphere. Special mention to Dhanush for continuing to surprise us by producing such top class movies. It is highly unlikely that any other Thamizh movie can beat the class of this in 2016!Vetrimaran sir, you are not a director now but a visionary. This is not a movie but a well learned and constructed, flawless piece of art about the society. Feeling proud of you and the growth in your class of movies. Take some more national and international awards! I would have been glad if I could rate 12/10 for this movie!",visaranai pinnacle filmmaking,there comes movie like whiplash once while where there is lot action primarily due intensity performances absorbing screenplay then there are movies like haider where movie atmosphere is dense disturbing that you are left cold horrified at very end visaranai is movie that has successfully blended both these aspects order present practical rational view system that is part our livelihood i cannot remember last time i watched such intense nerve chilling baffling movie thamizh as i have now noticed vetrimarans films have two different halves but which are part same story polladhavan we see happy everyday youth dhanush living jolly good life first half while second things take sudden turn he gets exposed world ruthless criminals aadukalam we see dhanushs involvement rivalry between 2 rival gangs first half while latter we turn audience how one mans greed changes his surrounding peoples lives similarly visaranai as title suggests we are presented with 2 separate interrogations with different scenarios both halves movie movie attempts at one thing as beautifully explained by kishore one scene system is boss we are just pawns playing game it powerful always prey powerless there is no way that one who has been nabbed web escape out it this is explained through layers tightly scripted scenes with lots crude violence not forced extent skipping movie but watching it as if horror where happening front your eyes few minutes into movie story starts unraveling you start feeling slight chilling fear which later keeps intensifying exponentially until very end where you are left distraught range emotions portrayed by variety villains torturing innocents affect you up level that you start trembling as if watching horror movie off late we have been seeing great improvements movies like thani oruvan where lone hero fights corrupt antisocial elements society this one breaks all those clich s state point that system cannot be won over i was particularly reminded brazilian film duology tropa de elite where story ends with unstated moral that criminals politicians police are same circle you end up losing side if you mess with them performance wise dinesh continues with impressive tough role which might prove as highlight his career i somehow feel convinced that samuthirakani must be considered real protagonist as his role portrays how honest person becomes prey system is left torn without options at crux music camera editing cuts add more intense chill atmosphere special mention dhanush continuing surprise us by producing such top class movies it is highly unlikely that any other thamizh movie can beat class this 2016 vetrimaran sir you are not director now but visionary this is not movie but well learned constructed flawless piece art about society feeling proud you growth your class movies take some more national international awards i would have been glad if i could rate 12 10 this movie,0.5258528784648188,0.06390073442312248,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,The dark side of the Indian police force.,"Another sensational movie from Dhanush K. Raja, the producer of 'The Crow's Egg' that I recently reviewed in this site. This time he joined the hands with the writer, director who bought him a best actor award at the Indian Academy Award for the movie 'Playground'. The film was based on the novel 'Lock Up' that loosely inspired by the experiences of the author who is an autorickshaw driver now.I already mentioned that Indian cinema is waking up, knocking the doors of the international film critics, films festivals and film buffs. Thanks to the young generation in the film industry, looking for the international market expansion. It's time for you to check it out some of the Indian parallel cinemas, not the masala films. If you think you're totally in an unfamiliar territory, then it will be good to you start with this one.India is like the European Union, where each nation speaks a different language and its own culture, likewise each Indian state has a different language and culture. That's why it might be called the Indian subcontinent. This story begins when three Tamil labourers who are illegally living in a city park to save rent money from the work in the neighbor state Andhra, will be taken to the police custody without letting know them the reason. The rest of the film exposes the law enforcement agency's brutality on these young innocent men to force to accept a crime that is not committed by them which is a violation of human rights.""The influence is more important than skill when it comes to promotions.""The film has two phases and they were not focused on any particular characters. It is a couple of different events based flick that connected to each other by the characters. But everything is about corruption in the police force and common people who affected by that. Kind of unpredictable scenes with the decent twists. The first half takes place in Andhra Pradesh with the backdrop of some robbery case and then in the next half it moves to Tamil Nadu with once again a cop tale, but different scenario.Welcome to the Indian police's torture chamber. The dark side of the Indian police force. Not all about the bad cops, but also involves those honest ones caught between dishonest ones from the higher power. There was a small romance plot in the opening, later it vanished when entire story focus shifted to police interrogation. The pace had many up and down, that helped to turn things around like transforming from one state of condition to another.This theme was exactly opposite to the old saying 'lightning never strikes the same place twice'. You can call it a bad luck, but for some people like the youngsters from this movie who came from the poor families from the rural without proper education, it is a matter of life and death and injustice. I won't be surprised if international remake are made. It won this year's Indian Academy Awards in the three categories including the supporting actor which was one of the important cop roles. So I won't be surprised either if it was picked to represent India for the 2017 Oscars.This is a Kollywood film, but watching it feels like a some dark tone Korean crime-drama- thriller. I have seen some of Indian cop films, but so far this one was the best when it comes to the realism yet not depicted them in a good way. I highly recommend it, but don't expect a genuine screenplay with a grand twist. It makes you feel how the innocence was taken away from the poor by the people with power, really heartbreaking.9/10",dark side indian police force,another sensational movie dhanush k raja producer crows egg that i recently reviewed this site this time he joined hands with writer director who bought him best actor award at indian academy award movie playground film was based novel lock up that loosely inspired by experiences author who is autorickshaw driver now i already mentioned that indian cinema is waking up knocking doors international film critics films festivals film buffs thanks young generation film industry looking international market expansion its time you check it out some indian parallel cinemas not masala films if you think youre totally unfamiliar territory then it will be good you start with this one india is like european union where each nation speaks different language its own culture likewise each indian state has different language culture thats why it might be called indian subcontinent this story begins when three tamil labourers who are illegally living city park save rent money work neighbor state andhra will be taken police custody without letting know them reason rest film exposes law enforcement agencys brutality these young innocent men force accept crime that is not committed by them which is violation human rights influence is more important than skill when it comes promotions film has two phases they were not focused any particular characters it is couple different events based flick that connected each other by characters but everything is about corruption police force common people who affected by that kind unpredictable scenes with decent twists first half takes place andhra pradesh with backdrop some robbery case then next half it moves tamil nadu with once again cop tale but different scenario welcome indian polices torture chamber dark side indian police force not all about bad cops but also involves those honest ones caught between dishonest ones higher power there was small romance plot opening later it vanished when entire story focus shifted police interrogation pace had many up down that helped turn things around like transforming one state condition another this theme was exactly opposite old saying lightning never strikes same place twice you can call it bad luck but some people like youngsters this movie who came poor families rural without proper education it is matter life death injustice i wont be surprised if international remake are made it won this years indian academy awards three categories including supporting actor which was one important cop roles so i wont be surprised either if it was picked represent india 2017 oscars this is kollywood film but watching it feels like some dark tone korean crime drama thriller i have seen some indian cop films but so far this one was best when it comes realism yet not depicted them good way i highly recommend it but dont expect genuine screenplay with grand twist it makes you feel how innocence was taken away poor by people with power really heartbreaking 9 10,0.4612088837088837,0.10988668738668736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"

9.0,Brace for impact of reality!,"The movie revolves around four youths who went out of their homes to a foreign place for working, but what it takes in it's course of orbit is pretty heavy. It takes the entire system that's been there for decades in a country and more to it is there is no hiding from showing how flawed it is. Having such high intensity in subject, there is nothing less that you can expect visually! The core cast has defined nothing but the definition for reality on screen. Their hard work is visible in every frame. Introducing a pair and a love bud to the lead wasn't really needed, if it was for making the climax more powerful then I feel the effect was meager. The BGM by GV is very subtle to grasp during the watch(First time at least). But it helped in a great way to reduce the intensity, without which it could be intense a few folds more. This movie will stay with you! This movie will affect you! This movie will make you think about the entire system! This movie can make you get obsessed !So I would say to be prepared for all of it before you decide to watch it.",brace impact reality,movie revolves around four youths who went out their homes foreign place working but what it takes its course orbit is pretty heavy it takes entire system thats been there decades country more it is there is no hiding showing how flawed it is having such high intensity subject there is nothing less that you can expect visually core cast has defined nothing but definition reality screen their hard work is visible every frame introducing pair love bud lead wasnt really needed if it was making climax more powerful then i feel effect was meager bgm by gv is very subtle grasp during watch first time at least but it helped great way reduce intensity without which it could be intense few folds more this movie will stay with you this movie will affect you this movie will make you think about entire system this movie can make you get obsessed so i would say be prepared all it before you decide watch it,0.5342307692307693,0.02602564102564103,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Harsh reality show casing the corrupt system that can change lives,"Visaranai (Interrogation) captures the harsh truth behind Police department corruption, thirst for Power, urge to close cases and how it affects the life of four runaway youngsters in a non-native state. It is just not that actually the plot traverses to the native state to show that no mercy is left in the department on handling the poor guys. It is based on true incidents which became a novel named ""Lock Up"" by M. Chandrakumar. Well that explains the crux of the tale but what makes it more solid and interesting is the chilling screen play and 100 % pure cinema type of handling where there was no absolute space for commercialism. Hats off to Director Vetrimaran who has dared to experiment this genre which reflects the ruthless, impolite, merciless, callous nature of some police officers. The plot gets enhanced by the performers like Dhinesh, Samuthirakani, Kishore, Adukalam Murugadoss and some more actors whom we hardly know by their names. The thrashes that these boys take up looks so vivid, raw, brutal, inhuman and clearly I understand this movie will be a hard to digest fact for soft or weak hearted audience. So people of this sort you are warned better try some comedy in the next screen. On the technical front the cinematography and BGM also shows the pain. This movie is a clear warning that there is a corrupt system out there waiting for innocent prey and if we are caught it is like the hell's hole and no escape. I didn't find anything as such which ruins the flow or script. So pure award category no scoring required.

10.0,Should be made Oscar entry from India!,"Visaranai is a movie with the highest level of filmmaking (no songs, no heroism, no nonsense) coming out from Tamil cinema.. Director Vetrimaran of Aadukalam, has done brilliant depiction of novel 'Lock Up' based on a true story(great end credits)..

From the very first scene he will arrest your attention and what follows, is a riveting narrative and gripping cinematic experience!! The casting is first class, Attakathi Dinesh and his 3 friends(Aadukalam Murugan), the supporting cast of Samuthirakani, Kishore and Policemen In the custody, given top notch performances.. Dinesh(one of the most underrated actor) another effortless, heart- wrenching performance while the terrific Samuthurakani finding himself stuck in between this brutal system but trying to act fair for god sake, he was excellent to describe!! The private interrogation part between Samuthurakani and Kishore one of the best part of the movie.. Vetrimaran made it a classic encounter against the painful, merciless lockup scenes.. And when you think things get better for Dinesh and friends, misfortune struck again, inevitably.. Move on from there, Afsal execution scenes will make you breaking inside.. Spell bounded!! The intense climax ended in the dark, intentionally he wants us to know nothing can be justified that ill-fated Dinesh character, very well crafted by Vetrimaran..

,"Visaranai : A Visceral treatment on cops, the system and everybody else caught in between","The first few montages of the yet-to-dawn nocturnal life is enough to invite the film festival community to engage in the story. Visaranai is the big screen transformation of Chandra Kumar's documented novel Lock Up; a true story about how police brutality and inhuman interrogation techniques go into tormenting innocents to admit false crimes. A group of migrants from Tamil Nadu working in Andhra Pradesh are taken into illegal custody by local police . What follows is a gruesome police drill involving batons, boots and banana stems. All they want is a confession; a fake confession. 'Attakathi Dinesh' as Pandi is the stand-up guy unwilling to surrender fearing a larger force at play and more importantly, he wants to do a great many things in life. 'Aadukalam' Murugadoss as Murugan can be easily tricked, Afsal is innocent to the core and Kumar is severally battered at an early stage. The characters we meet on screen are controlled and manacled by the System in ways unprejudiced. Ajay Ghosh as the vicious Guntur chief Vishweshwar Rao is one such police officer with a disappointing career profile, a face like death and a body trained to beat the life out of others. But still, Attakathi Dinesh does a great many things as he aspires to do so when he is set free. There is a point of saturation in the film where even Vishweshwar Rao runs out of breath. If apathy, personal gain and atrocity ever had a threesome, mishaps like Ajay Ghosh tend to happen. The harsh acoustics of yelling can get on your nerves at some point. This was a necessity made by the film's structure to facilitate such relentless thrashing and torture. With so many battered souls locked up, it puts you in their place and raises questions. But Vetrimaran is not here to preach, his screenplay and dialogs stay direct, relaxed and procedural. Neither the water- boarding nor the vicious slow paced thrashing had any effect on Pandi, it was hope, his tenaciousness, his trickiness and a chance TN police intervention that puts an end to their misery. Played by the ever obstinate Samuthirakani, Murugavel is a TN police officer on a special mission to trap an elite white collar auditor. Pandi and his friends return a favor and help Murugavel. The second half travels to familiar grounds of Tamil Nadu. The rich and fraudulent auditor KK (Kishore) who spurts money philosophy is the victim of the another brutal interrogation. It is his adage on 'System' that links the background events. All this talk about the System being the Kingmaker and that 'your actions have set things in motion' establishes a thick premonition. Thankfully, this talk is kept to a minimum. Had it not, then a part of audience's imagination would have reached heights of hype expecting a Brobdingnagian revelation of some sort. There is calmness meandering in all scenes. The casual statement of the lawyer and the video logging of reconstruction scene shows the normalcy of situation and sheds light on how police practices defy law and makes you wonder on the number of cases solved by false/forced convictions. Taking a few incentives, Visaranai achieves a gritty cinematic leap. There is also a half baked romantic connection that is left to rot much like the irrelevant voiceless lives in jail. There is coherence of how the middle class working community from lower backgrounds are taken for granted. The abuse of Shanthi in the hands of her owner, the case of 4 street vagrants picked up from a Nellore park, the provision store owner who is blackmailed - a constant living in fear and hardship. 'Attakathi Dinesh' channels Pandi vehemently. He has the 'Andy Dufresse kinda' reluctance to give in. Pandi sure does suffer a hell lot in comparison. Both wrongly captured. One convicted and the other unwilling to get convicted. Maybe there can be more to say about these characters in contrast. That will be for another day. For a brief period in the last sequence of the first half, it felt like it was going to be a complete escape and survivalist episode.The movie is a genius thriller in the making. Although not as tension seeking as Michael Mann-esque film, we feel the trap Pandi, Murugan & Afsal walk into as they accept the shameless duty of domestic help. Secondary characters make a lasting impact especially the promotion ignored officer in TN station. Muthuvel is an upright police pushed by higher officials and disoriented by the System into pursuing Pandi. Personally, my fondness for cinematography has grown rather exceptionally over the past few years. A film devoid of creative and meaningful visual strategy doesn't excite me. There were a few; very few parts in the film that meant visually nothing but then, this emptiness perfectly defines realism - through the dingy corners of highways and the wandering nightlife patrols, the blurry hope of escapism emanates. The final moments are as tense and seems like a cliffhanger until the camera zooms out to the fullest. The sudden pull and push of camera; this shift in movement noticed at a pivotal stage grounds the approach in realism as the hand-held camera becomes a secret surveillance tool, an all seeing eye - the eye of the system. As it looks down upon Pandi and Murugavel standing through knee-deep murky water, it signifies the troubled position of two candidates with no evil tendencies irrelevantly chosen by the powerful.

9.0,Edge of the seat experience for a movie that sends fearful chills down the spine.,"Vetrimaaran deserves allocates for having given the best from the team. The extent of enduring pain is as plain as water as they stutter and fumble with their bloody bruised bodies. The hard- riviting screenplay is unstoppable, making no move to shield you from the bitter realities of the merciless world. cameraman S Ramalingam perfectly complements the script by depicting the pain, torture and humiliation while GV Prakash's haunting background score makes it happen like real, The sound of flesh being torn apart by brutal lathi blows will make one finch and even experience it. The story portrays as how innocents are often brought in to fill cases which cant be solved. The extent of torture they undergo to make them underwrite the crime they have never committed is painful and morally awakening. The film brings out how gruesome our criminal justice system is, and the lack of transparency, access to judicial services and no signs of accountability at the cutting edge level is making the common man suffer more every day. It is not to say that all police functions are gruesome. But the movie brings up how the dark side can be and how dangerous it can be to the life of a common man when the power is uncontrolled.I sincerely hope that lockup deaths and police encounters will no longer be mere flash news after watching this movie, as the film sends across a spine chilling message which needs every ones attention.",edge seat experience movie that sends fearful chills down spine,vetrimaaran deserves allocates having given best team extent enduring pain is as plain as water as they stutter fumble with their bloody bruised bodies hard riviting screenplay is unstoppable making no move shield you bitter realities merciless world cameraman s ramalingam perfectly complements script by depicting pain torture humiliation while gv prakashs haunting background score makes it happen like real sound flesh being torn apart by brutal lathi blows will make one finch even experience it story portrays as how innocents are often brought fill cases which cant be solved extent torture they undergo make them underwrite crime they have never committed is painful morally awakening film brings out how gruesome our criminal justice system is lack transparency access judicial services no signs accountability at cutting edge level is making common man suffer more every day it is not say that all police functions are gruesome but movie brings up how dark side can be how dangerous it can be life common man when power is uncontrolled i sincerely hope that lockup deaths police encounters will no longer be mere flash news after watching this movie as film sends across spine chilling message which needs every ones attention,0.6715079365079366,-0.25946031746031745,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8.0,Seen as a non-Indian ...,"This film was on the competition list of the 2016 'Bildrausch' ('Image Inebriation') Filmfest in Basel, Switzerland. It did not win the 1st price ...Since all reviewers so far stem from the Indian cultural space, which will have a positive effect on the rating of any artwork from that area, I permit myself to add my modest review as an European, trying to be more neutral.The film comes technically perfect. Content-wise, it cannot reach the quality of the major Western directors, though. So don't expect too much.The background of the acting is always an urban area - lots of police stations and jails. The lacking of any natural environment (except in the end scene with a swamp surrounded by apartment houses), together with the lack of humour and irony, make the film a bit desperate and breathless to look, although corresponding to the reality. There is a lot of violence, beatings, going on nearly all the time. These actions look often exaggerated, like punching a ball.As the director revealed in the discussion following the watching, the story was composed of two different real stories, hence its extraordinary length.Overall certainly worth to see (not for children or fainthearted).",seen as non indian,this film was competition list 2016 bildrausch image inebriation filmfest basel switzerland it did not win 1st price since all reviewers so far stem indian cultural space which will have positive effect rating any artwork that area i permit myself add my modest review as european trying be more neutral film comes technically perfect content wise it cannot reach quality major western directors though so dont expect too much background acting is always urban area lots police stations jails lacking any natural environment except end scene with swamp surrounded by apartment houses together with lack humour irony make film bit desperate breathless look although corresponding reality there is lot violence beatings going nearly all time these actions look often exaggerated like punching ball as director revealed discussion following watching story was composed two different real stories hence its extraordinary length overall certainly worth see not children or fainthearted,0.4560606060606061,0.10512941919191919,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.29}"

7.0,A good movie,"A stark departure from the run of the mill gravity defying stunts, ping pong color costume, queer hand, leg, body gesture by central characters in slow motion, Visaaranai is a bold, realistic, gripping ddrama on police brutality and corruption. If you are a great admirer of Santosh Sivan and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, you will miss that lyrical romanticism in frames, in storytelling and in treatment. Instead what the director's command over the treatment overpowers you and transports you to a the world of four hapless Tamil daily-wage earning laborers who have made the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh their home. Four time national award winning director Vetri Maaran hits it hard with realm of realism, there are gruesome violent scenes which border around torture p**n shows you violence at its harshest best. Tight gripping story, excellent acting, good screenplay make it great to watch, but I am not confident about its Oscar success (though every year I hope India gets a best foreign movie award).

8.0,A heart wrenching and disturbing tale which shows the ugly black side of Corrupt system and Police Force.,"Visaaranai (2015) : Brief Review -A heart wrenching and disturbing tale which shows the ugly black side of Corrupt system and Police Force. Visaaranai is truly a revolutionary film in Crime drama genre and of course trendsetter in many ways for quality filmmaking. It is unbelievable to accept that the same Tamil industry who always go cheap even with High budget films has made this clinical and experimental film with no cheapness at any end. Four innocent labourers are arrested and beaten up till half dead to cover up failure of Police Force but they do not put their prestige down. Truth prevails and they are released just to get into even bigger conspiracy set by Corrupt System of Politicians and Police officers. In the first half Vissaranai literally test your patience that how much violence and torture can you bear watching and then in the second half it goes terribly evil. I can still feel those jitters from all those brutal beating scenes and how powerfully all of it is showcased on screen. The background score providing the feel of chills and bone cracking moments is excellent. Even the cinematography for the same is uniquely done yet regularly drafted not to give it over-artistic touch. All the actors deserve praise here and not just specific one because everyone has got almost same screen space although it was just about what kind of scenes they got. This is my second film of Vetrimaaran after 'Asuran' and his direction skills seems quite effective. Asuran was still very much of an action saga than this but despite less mass elements, less caste issues and less social awareness tonics Visaaranai tops his filmography on the basis of seriousness of the content. Like i said it is a disturbing and very much a negative film to watch but not all Politicians and Police Officers are Honest as we see in Films, TV serials, Shows and News channels so let's face the cruel reality and accept the bitter truth.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",heart wrenching disturbing tale which shows ugly black side corrupt system police force,visaaranai 2015 brief review heart wrenching disturbing tale which shows ugly black side corrupt system police force visaaranai is truly revolutionary film crime drama genre course trendsetter many ways quality filmmaking it is unbelievable accept that same tamil industry who always go cheap even with high budget films has made this clinical experimental film with no cheapness at any end four innocent labourers are arrested beaten up till half dead cover up failure police force but they do not put their prestige down truth prevails they are released just get into even bigger conspiracy set by corrupt system politicians police officers first half vissaranai literally test your patience that how much violence torture can you bear watching then second half it goes terribly evil i can still feel those jitters all those brutal beating scenes how powerfully all it is showcased screen background score providing feel chills bone cracking moments is excellent even cinematography same is uniquely done yet regularly drafted not give it over artistic touch all actors deserve praise here not just specific one because everyone has got almost same screen space although it was just about what kind scenes they got this is my second film vetrimaaran after asuran his direction skills seems quite effective asuran was still very much action saga than this but despite less mass elements less caste issues less social awareness tonics visaaranai tops his filmography basis seriousness content like i said it is disturbing very much negative film watch but not all politicians police officers are honest as we see films tv serials shows news channels so lets face cruel reality accept bitter truth rating 8 10 by,0.5281162393162392,-0.07757777777777775,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.38}"
