,The Movie [0/10] The Experience [10/10] A TRUE CINEMATIC PARADOX!,"Okay - quality of the movie [0/10] Enjoyability of the movie [10/10]Total paradox, right?This is the absolute pinnacle of bad story, bad dialogue, bad editing, bad plot.. I mean, I'm saying 'bad' like there actually is any of these elements within the film. The editing makes no sense, it seems randomly cut with continuity errors, there are lines like 'What's going on with the candles and the music' when there ARE NO candles or music.. The entire thing is absurd. But what makes it truly unique is that it was done entirely seriously, this is not a tongue in cheek production like low budget bad movies that know they are catering to an audience who expect to laugh at the poor effects and story.. No, this man, Tommy Wuseau, honestly, genuinely thought he was crafting his magnum opus, masterpiece of cinema.Is it good? Absolutely, definitely not.However - as a movie EXPERIENCE. I watched this with some of my family, warning them it was terrible, but we had one of the funniest, most incredible bonding experiences in cinematic history - As we collectively picked apart every camera angle, wobbly set, insane use of props, costume, music that skips, repeats, continuity, edits, plot and dialogue. There is not one redeeming moment in the entire movie. Even if there is a single well crafted line (there isn't) it would have to be spoken by either a terrible actor or by Tommy himself, who's accent sounds like it was in a European car crash . We all laughed until it HURT, and for that.. I have to give the experience a 10/10. I've never enjoyed a movie more with friends and family more than this one.. EVER.I head that the experience is similar in theatres that still show this film for precisely this reason. Everybody dresses up as their favourite character, recites every line and throws spoons at the screen every time one inexplicably ends up on screen (it's a lot.. is there a reason behind this 'artistic' decision. No. There is no reason for anything)There is more and more to notice about this film every time I watch it.. Most recently, how the architecture of the building makes no sense whatsoever. They appear to be on the ground floor, but exiting from the other side causes them to end up on the roof - at night. It's things like this that could inspire a PhD in studying the intricate insanity and entirely non sequitur values of every moment in The Room.Do I recommend it? Well.. how can I not. Everyone needs to see this movie at least once, after a couple of drinks and with friends. It's even funnier than Weekend at Bernies after taking magic mushrooms.I almost died laughing from a hypoxic brain injury, unable to catch my breath - narrowly avoiding giggling myself into a coma.The finest abdominal workout video ever made.",movie experience true cinematic paradox,okay quality movie enjoyability movie total paradox right this is absolute pinnacle bad story bad dialogue bad editing bad plot i mean im saying bad like there actually is any these elements within film editing makes no sense it seems randomly cut with continuity errors there are lines like whats going with candles music when there are no candles or music entire thing is absurd but what makes it truly unique is that it was done entirely seriously this is not tongue cheek production like low budget bad movies that know they are catering audience who expect laugh at poor effects story no this man tommy wuseau honestly genuinely thought he was crafting his magnum opus masterpiece cinema is it good absolutely definitely not however as movie experience i watched this with some my family warning them it was terrible but we had one funniest most incredible bonding experiences cinematic history as we collectively picked apart every camera angle wobbly set insane use props costume music that skips repeats continuity edits plot dialogue there is not one redeeming moment entire movie even if there is single well crafted line there isnt it would have be spoken by either terrible actor or by tommy himself whos accent sounds like it was european car crash we all laughed until it hurt that i have give experience 10 10 ive never enjoyed movie more with friends family more than this one ever i head that experience is similar theatres that still show this film precisely this reason everybody dresses up as their favourite character recites every line throws spoons at screen every time one inexplicably ends up screen its lot is there reason behind this artistic decision no there is no reason anything there is more more notice about this film every time i watch it most recently how architecture building makes no sense whatsoever they appear be ground floor but exiting other side causes them end up roof at night its things like this that could inspire phd studying intricate insanity entirely non sequitur values every moment room do i recommend it well how can i not everyone needs see this movie at least once after couple drinks with friends its even funnier than weekend at bernies after taking magic mushrooms i almost died laughing hypoxic brain injury unable catch my breath narrowly avoiding giggling myself into coma finest abdominal workout video ever made,0.5709848484848483,-0.0426948051948052,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,It's so bad that it becomes good,"This film tells the story of a man who will be marrying his girlfriend of seven years. However, his girlfriend seems not to settle for what she has.I would not have known about this film if not for ""The Disaster Artist"". Seriously, the sets are bad, the lighting is bad, the camera angles are bad, the camera is mostly static, the acting is horrible, and the story is just bad. The plot is so thin that it almost appears to be a soft core film. It is worse than a B film. It is so bad that I laughed out loud several times, such as the infamous bottle throwing scene, or when Jack throws the girlfriend on the sofa, or the fight in the party. And could they have at least filmed on a real rooftop, instead of the fake computer generated scenery? The acting is so bad, most of the characters are wooden, except the mother who has a quite a character. The film is so bad that it becomes good.

10.0,It's like sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode,"I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room' three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where The Room ends and I begin. It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging. Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark. Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life. It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no, there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment in The Room. The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself. Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been anything else like him. Nor will there ever be. The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly evil fiancée 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny, who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends, says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very special movie. After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him. Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely devoted fiancé, Johnny. Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again. But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of the fact that she, according to her mother, ""cannot survive on her own in the cutthroat 'computer business'"". But not before they recycle the sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage. A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to catch a football thrown by Mark. All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time. And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The Room, 'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!' The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel. See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching the gospel according to Johnny. My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream as well.",its like sitting atom bomb thats about explode,i have now seen mr tommy wiseaus cinematic tour de force room three times with each viewing room becomes more

1.0,"The ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of chamber dramas","Forget all the three-line raves this movie has received (which all seem to be suspiciously similar in tone). THE ROOM is one of those rare laugh-riots that is so fantastically inept as to border on genius.

10.0,You're Tearing Me Apaaaaaart!!!!,"I have to believe I'm not the only person who was prompted to see ""The Room"" in preparation for James Franco's well-received ""The Disaster Artist,"" the story of the cult classic's creation.Called the worst movie ever made by many, what I think people mean is that ""The Room"" is one of the most entertaining bad movies ever made. It's certainly not the worst; just try watching a movie like, say, ""ThanksKilling"" for an example of a movie so bad that it's unwatchable. No, ""The Room"" belongs to the same category as something like ""Battlefield Earth,"" films so earnestly made yet so poorly executed that they become more entertaining than they would have been had the filmmakers been able to make a legitimately good movie.One can't really provide a description of ""The Room"" that will come anywhere close to approximating the experience of watching it. Tommy Wiseau, the film's legendary and strange creator, plays Johnny, who's been dating Lisa for something like six or seven years and who he refers to throughout the entire movie as ""my future wife."" The problem is that Lisa hates Tommy and doesn't want to marry him, despite bonking him repeatedly. It never seems to occur to Lisa that she could just tell Johnny she doesn't love him anymore, so she instead complains to everyone who will listen to her how bored she is by him and even makes up stories about him getting drunk and beating her. No one seems especially bothered by this prospect, perhaps because Lisa is such an unpleasant person that we don't understand why Johnny wants her in the first place. O.k. maybe it's not so far fetched, since Johnny isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, and his prospects for female companionship that he doesn't have to pay for are probably limited. He clearly is drawn to Lisa's formidable intelligence, because he thinks her suggestion that they invite a bunch of friends to a birthday party she plans to throw for him (despite hating him) is ""a great idea,"" which I guess is if the alternative idea is to invite a bunch of random strangers. And Johnny isn't alone; at said birthday party, she suggest that they should all eat some cake, and the party goers act like that's an idea no one's ever had at a birthday party before.Complicating matters is Johnny's best friend Mark, who gives a brilliant discourse on gender politics in which he categorizes all women as stupid or evil. Given the women in this movie, he may be on to something. Lisa has the hots for Mark, and they pick the least comfortable spot in the apartment (the bend of a spiral staircase) on which to consummate their passion (though I'm not sure if anything was actually consummated since Mark appears to be humping Lisa's knees). Mark seems like a bit of dim bulb himself, since every time thereafter that Lisa initiates sex his first question is ""What are you doing?"" The most mysterious character in the movie is Denny, an orphaned kid who lives God knows where but who pops in all. the. time. and who we're told thinks of Johnny as a father figure, though, given the fact that the first scene with Denny finds him wanting to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex, he might have wanted to shop around a bit more. Denny is always carrying either a basketball or a football and acts like he's twelve despite the fact that the actor playing him is about twenty-five. Once in a while, some combination of guys will actually play ball with him, which involves standing about three feet from each other and gently tossing the ball around like it's an explosive device. After some ball tossing on the roof of Johnny's apartment building, and then some more ball tossing in a cramped alley, I started to wonder whether or not San Francisco had any parks these guys could go to, and then later in the film when they actually go to a park, I wondered why they didn't go to one sooner.My favorite character is Lisa's mom, who walks into every situation and expresses disbelief that she's surrounded by dipsh*ts, a sentiment I shared. Nothing phases this woman, not breast cancer, not drug dealers, not random people using her daughter's apartment for a booty call. Whatever's going on, she's just so over it. And another supporting character is Johnny's psychologist friend, who looks like the bald Nazi from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and lurks in the background, lit by the camera man like a serial killer.Every scene in ""The Room"" feels like the intro to porn sex, no matter what combination of people are present. There are actually a couple of soft core scenes, both featuring Johnny and Lisa, though it actually only counts as one scene since the second one uses the EXACT SAME FOOTAGE as the first. Needless to say, they're not very erotic unless you find weirdly veiny men of an indeterminate age erotic, or are turned on by the sight of rose petals mashed into a woman's back like giant ticks.I don't know why ""The Room"" is called ""The Room."" There is a room in the movie, in which almost all of the action that doesn't occur on the roof takes place. The set decorator clearly thought that Johnny and Lisa are the kind of people who decorate their apartment with giant candles and bowls of fruit, which comes in handy when Denny needs to eat an apple as a way of managing the sexual frustration that occurs when Johnny and Lisa aren't up for a menage a trois.Maybe he should have played some football in the alley instead.

,Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!,"""I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bulls***t! I did not hit her! I did NOTTT. Oh hi, Mark."" – Tommy Wiseau (The Room) Released in 2003, ""The Room"" would have faded into obscurity had it not, like most of Ed Wood's films, possessed the right mixture of sincerity, god-awful ineptness, and unintentional humour. Within months the film had become a cult classic, playing in packed Los Angeles theatres to legions of screaming fans.What makes the film hilarious is Tommy Wiseau, a talentless and egotistical auteur, who wrote, directed, produced, financed and starred in this six million dollar flick. The classic self-important European artist, Wiseau sees himself, not only as a serious actor, but a serious writer and director. He thinks he's written a Shakespearean plot, when in reality this is a childish love triangle. He thinks his dialogue flies like Tennessee Williams, but in reality it is worse than that offered by the Disney Channel. He thinks his direction rivals Cassavetes, but in reality...well, he was so confused, he shot the film on both HD and celluloid cameras, mounted side by side because he didn't know which camera was which.And yet there is something captivating about Wiseau's performance. His accent is odd, he approaches each word from a strange angle, he puts emphasis on the wrong syllables, he structures sentences in off kilter rhythms, he inserts punctuation in the wrong places and has his dialogue branch off in weird tangents. Listening to Wiseau speak is like watching the English language being re-invented. It should be god awful, but it's strangely interesting. Like David Mamet, his intonations, his verbal tempo, is almost balletic.Whilst all the actors in the film are bad – soft-core porn bad – Wiseau imbues the film with a kind of transcendent badness. He's not bad, so much as he is unaware of the rules of good. He's so earnest, so confident that his performance, that his art, is the epitome of quality, that his ineptness renders the whole production farcical.With regards to the film's plot, there are themes of cancer, betrayal, drug abuse, and infidelity, but it's all handled in an awkward way akin to a kindergarten play. At times whole lines of dialogue are dubbed over, often with no regard to the actor's lip movements. Like Ed Wood's ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", characters are also oddly replaced by other actors half way through the film, no explanation given. Throw in countless shots of the Golden Gate Bridge, an epically stupid ending, some hilariously badly written dialogue – ""Leave your stupid comment in your pocket!"", ""Chocolate is a symbol of love!"", ""What kind of money?"", ""I definitely have breast cancer"", ""I needed money so I bought drugs!"", ""I'm fed up of this wur-urld!"" - and you have the funniest ""so bad it's good"" film since Ed Wood.7.5/10 – Comedy gold.

8.0,Awful was never this funny,"It's not every day that a bad movie can be life-affirming. And that's what makes ""The Room"" such a treasure. It's an exercise in shoddy filmmaking, but there's something about it that's just . . . well, it's just a whole lot of fun. And yes, I do mean it's a lot of fun to bag on this hot mess, but doing so has never felt so satisfying.If you boil this movie down to its base elements, Johnny loves Lisa, Lisa cheats on Johnny. Why does she? Ehh, not really sure. It's not like he deserved it, really - I mean, he's a super nice guy. He's not the best looking guy, but she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And the rest of the movie is just Lisa being a galactic hussy (seriously, they don't come more arbitrarily two-timing than this).There's a lot here that goes unanswered. What happened with the mother-in-law's cancer? Will Denny get off drugs? Why does Mark turn on Johnny? You can tell this is supposed to be a big tragedy, kind of an inept Tennessee Williams joint. But nothing about this comes off like it should. Subplots are introduced and then forgotten, the dialogue's full of non-sequiturs, and there's not really any meaning to anything. Add to that the bad green-screening and the Skinemax production values, and you're witnessing a veritable trainwreck.But, my god, is it entertaining. Ninety minutes chock-full of unintentional hilarity. The reputation is there for a reason, and it's definitely earned.

8.0,Your tearing me apart! An interesting and compelling soap opera like drama that twist with life and love while leading to tragic means.,"Finally after all these years finally watched the cult classic ""The Room"" as it's a favorite for many art houses and independent movie chains as the film still has countless midnight showings. Many consider it the worst movie ever made, however after watching I disagree, as I liked it the film was blended with drama and twist of love and lust that lead to bad means for all involved as really it was a good black hearted comedy.Set in the city by the bay ""San Francisco"", Johnny(Tommy Wiseau) is a successful investment banker who enjoys life and love as he plans to marry his younger and sexy girlfriend Lisa(Juliette Danielle). However this is the game of life it's not always a bed of roses(unlike the love making scenes!)as lust, passion, lies, and betrayal take over.Johnny has a best friend named Mark(Greg Sestero) and all three become involved in a web a deadly game of temptation as these games slowly, but surely lead to loss for all involved. This film is a great take and spin on life, love, and friendship, as can anyone be trusted? It proves love runs deep, yet when lust and passion mix it's a deadly combination. Overall well done movie that teaches lessons in a painful way, and the movie is spiced up by love making scenes and the acting and on screen chemistry between the actors is good for a low budget independent that would become a historical cult classic.",your tearing me apart interesting compelling soap opera like drama that twist with life love while leading tragic means,finally after all these years finally watched cult classic room as its favorite many art houses independent movie chains as film still has countless midnight showings many consider it worst movie ever made however after watching i disagree as i liked it film was blended with drama twist love lust that lead bad means all involved as really it was good black hearted comedy set city by bay san francisco johnny tommy wiseau is successful investment banker who enjoys life love as he plans marry his younger sexy girlfriend lisa juliette danielle however this is game life its not always bed roses unlike love making scenes as lust passion lies betrayal take over johnny has best friend named mark greg sestero all three become involved web deadly game temptation as these games slowly but surely lead loss all involved this film is great take spin life love friendship as can anyone be trusted it proves love runs deep yet when lust passion mix its deadly combination overall well done movie that teaches lessons painful way movie is spiced up by love making scenes acting screen chemistry between actors is good low budget independent that would become historical cult classic,0.5118686868686869,0.171969696969697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,The Greatest Film in the History of Western Civilization,"Tommy loves Lisa, his future wife. But Mark, Johnny's best friend, is sleeping with Lisa. And Lisa's mother has breast cancer. And Denny, Johnny's adopted son, has a drug problem, or at least a money problem. What does all this have to do with each other? Not much.Could ""The Room"" be the greatest film ever made? Writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau thinks so. The rumor is he submitted the film to the Academy for consideration as best picture. Sadly, he was turned away. ""The Room"" may not be the best picture of the year, but is probably the single greatest film of all time, at least from a purely entertaining point of view.Yes, the love scenes are recycled. Yes, some of the dialog makes no sense. Yes, there are countless subplots that go nowhere. Yes, one of the main characters disappears halfway through and is replaced by another guy. Yes, the music is bad. Yes, yes, yes. But somehow, the more things that seem to be wrong with this film -- a film that Wiseau assures us was ""meticulously"" made -- the better it gets.I was laughing so hard, I was in pain within fifteen minutes and cried. All of the ""Oh, hi Mark"" lines, and the epic ""you're tearing me apart"" were too much for me. I ended up spewing my guts, and several bottles of Coors Light, all over the place. The intensity of the awesome in the picture just blew me away.I have a new favorite film, and that film's name is ""The Room"". What other film could make me want to play football in a tuxedo or sing the ""Full House"" theme song? Only one film has that power... for the full effect, you really need to see a midnight screening of this film with the audience participation.

10.0,The work of a genius Auteur,"Contains SpoilersThe Location - The film is set in San Fransico, as we are reminded several times throughout the film, with good reason. San Fransico represents the city that gave birth to free love - and this is subtly juxtaposed with the theme of the film, that love is not free. Johnny's apartment has a spiral staircase indicating that the path to meaningful congress isn't straight forward, as evidenced by Lisa's liaison on the stairs. The many scenes on the roof top actually represent reaching a higher level of understanding. The transcendental if you will.The football - the football represents Lisa, a woman who is prepared to be passed from man to man, and indeed those that are not prepared for her suffer a literal downfall. It is symbolism and beautiful metaphor.The dress - this is Johnny's subconscious awareness of Lisa's true reality expressed in Jungian terms. He is bestowing on her the role of the Scarlet Woman.The rose - When Johnny places the rose on the bed next to Lisa he is saying "" I am replacing one prick in this bed with several pricks"" How true he is! The white car - this is in fact Johnny's white steed. Symbolism for him being the good guy.The repeated scene - don't believe all you read. The lovemaking scene is repeated, not for budgetary reasons or the actress' dislike of Tommy; rather it indicates that the lovemaking has become boring and literally repetitious.The Tuxedos - these symbolise Johnny's identity loss and awareness of mass consciousness.The Psychologist - forsaking the R.D Laing school of thought, he is unable to identify the existential angst of the other characters and after his symbolic downfall plays no further part in their lives.Chris R - this is in fact a scathing critique of the American Health Care system. Denny is obviously using him to get extra supplies of the Ritalin he so badly requires.The alcohol - the Scarlet Woman Lisa tempts Johnny away from the path of virtue by intoxicating him with the noxious substances of two cultures - whiskey and vodka, representing the intoxicating combination of their pairing.The names - Johnny, the 'everyman', a name used in countless films in the 40's and 50's. His everyman status is reinforced by the florists failure to recognise him until he removes that which alters his perception of the world. His sunglasses. Lisa represents 'everywoman'. Notice how the other characters have lovers called Betty and Elizabeth. Claudette - literally 'Claw Debt' - a woman obsessed by her own and others financial situation.Genetic determinism - Lisa was born out of a loveless relationship and is therefore doomed to repeat such behaviour. Her mother's breast cancer represents the transmission of this through suckling.The spoons - one is reminded of Heideggers contemplation of the representation of boots in art. The spoons are there for aesthetic rather than utility purposes. This shows that one does not always get 'one's just desserts' ( Get your coat, you're fired - Ed)",work genius auteur,contains spoilersthe location film is set san fransico as we are reminded several times throughout film with good reason san fransico represents city that gave birth free love this is subtly juxtaposed with theme film that love is not free johnnys apartment has spiral staircase indicating that path meaningful congress isnt straight forward as evidenced by lisas liaison stairs many scenes roof top actually represent reaching higher level understanding transcendental if you will football football represents lisa woman who is prepared be passed man man indeed those that are not prepared her suffer literal downfall it is symbolism beautiful metaphor dress this is johnnys subconscious awareness lisas true reality expressed jungian terms he is bestowing her role scarlet woman rose when johnny places rose bed next lisa he is saying i am replacing one prick this bed with several pricks how true he is white car this is fact johnnys white steed symbolism him being good guy repeated scene dont believe all you read lovemaking scene is repeated not budgetary reasons or actress dislike tommy rather it indicates that lovemaking has become boring literally repetitious tuxedos these symbolise johnnys identity loss awareness mass consciousness psychologist forsaking r d laing school thought he is unable identify existential angst other characters after his symbolic downfall plays no further part their lives chris r this is fact scathing critique american health care system denny is obviously using him get extra supplies ritalin he so badly requires alcohol scarlet woman lisa tempts johnny away path virtue by intoxicating him with noxious substances two cultures whiskey vodka representing intoxicating combination their pairing names johnny everyman name used countless films 40s 50s his everyman status is reinforced by florists failure recognise him until he removes that which alters his perception world his sunglasses lisa represents everywoman notice how other characters have lovers called betty elizabeth claudette literally claw debt woman obsessed by her own others financial situation genetic determinism lisa was born out loveless relationship is therefore doomed repeat such behaviour her mothers breast cancer represents transmission this through suckling spoons one is reminded heideggers contemplation representation boots art spoons are there aesthetic rather than utility purposes this shows that one does not always get ones just desserts get your coat youre fired ed,0.5016666666666667,0.09249999999999999,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.46}"
1.0,Tommy Wiseau used me and I am the fool,"Oh, wow, um, where do I even begin with this movie? I suppose I could tell you how I heard of it, like most people I heard about this movie from an internet reviewer(the Nostalgia Critic). I honestly would've never heard of this film either, probably would have never seen it. But after the clips I saw, I HAD to see this movie, I went on Amazon.com immediately afterwards and ordered it. Now I knew this movie was going to be bad, but I HAD NO IDEA! I think it's one of those movies that had to be handled in clips because I cannot tell you all the safety precautions you should take before watching this movie. My boyfriend tried to commit suicide while I just wanted to find Tommy Wiseau and do some things that even the Dark One would look at me and say ""geez, take it easy on the guy"". I cannot even describe how this movie is bad. The acting is like the actors are literally reading the script for the first time. Tommy Wiseau's acting, I don't know if there's a word for how bad it is so we'll just say it's ""aguwaba"", also it seems his voice was dubbed over. Now I thought this was because maybe he only speaks one language that isn't English, but he speaks with this stupid indefinable accent all the time, so why is his dubbing the same way? Where is he from? Brazil, Romania, France? I have no idea.Lisa has become inexplicably dissatisfied with her fiancé Johnny, confiding to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds him boring. Lisa seduces Johnny's best friend Mark, and they begin an affair that continues throughout the film, even as Mark more than once tries to break it off. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa gets closer to leaving Johnny for Mark. When Lisa throws Johnny a surprise birthday party, she flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, and Johnny and Mark get into two altercations. Johnny has also attached a tape recorder to the telephone, recording an intimate call between his future wife and Mark. Now that Johnny is ""fed up with this world"", feeling like he cannot trust anyone, he pulls the ultimate punishment in self loathing to himself but a true gift to the audience.This movie is just incredible that it was made, I didn't think it was possible to make a film so bad. It's like it's a new genre, just a bad movie. Sub plots get brought up out of no where in this movie and never get brought up again. Characters get brought up and again never mentioned. The script, story, characters, editing, setting, everything was just wrong with this movie. Also Tommy Wiseau's name is mentioned 6 times before the film even begins and his character is of course ""perfect"" that everyone should just love him. Lisa, who is very odd looking, is constantly called ""sexy"" which either has a new definition or is ironic. Mark is a doof ball that probably thinks that penguins are fish, because he's just that stupid. Denny is a perverted 15 year old who wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make love and constantly says how in love with Lisa he is and how he loves Johnny. Also there is so many pointless love scenes, football scenes, gift giving scenes, lines, if there was a drinking game on the pointless scenes for this film, you'd die of alcohol poisoning by the end of this movie. I don't know, it is one of those films you have to see to believe, but I can tell you one thing for sure, if Tommy Wiseau thinks we're laughing with him, he should check that we're actually laughing at him.1/10",tommy wiseau used me i am fool,oh wow um where do i even begin with this movie i suppose i could tell you how i heard it like most people i heard about this movie internet reviewer nostalgia critic i honestly wouldve never heard this film either probably would have never seen it but after clips i saw i had see this movie i went amazon com immediately afterwards ordered it now i knew this movie was going be bad but i had no idea i think its one those movies that had be handled clips because i cannot tell you all safety precautions you should take before watching this movie my boyfriend tried commit suicide while i just wanted find tommy wiseau do some things that even dark one would look at me say geez take it easy guy i cannot even describe how this movie is bad acting is like actors are literally reading script first time tommy wiseaus acting i dont know if theres word how bad it is so well just say its aguwaba also it seems his voice was dubbed over now i thought this was because maybe he only speaks one language that isnt english but he speaks with this stupid indefinable accent all time so why is his dubbing same way where is he brazil romania france i have no idea lisa has become inexplicably dissatisfied with her fianc johnny confiding her best friend michelle her mother claudette that she finds him boring lisa seduces johnnys best friend mark they begin affair that continues throughout film even as mark more than once tries break it off as wedding date approaches johnnys clout at his bank slips lisa gets closer leaving johnny mark when lisa throws johnny surprise birthday party she flaunts her affair front johnny johnny mark get into two altercations johnny has also attached tape recorder telephone recording intimate call between his future wife mark now that johnny is fed up with this world feeling like he cannot trust anyone he pulls ultimate punishment self loathing himself but true gift audience this movie is just incredible that it was made i didnt think it was possible make film so bad its like its new genre just bad movie sub plots get brought up out no where this movie never get brought up again characters get brought up again never mentioned script story characters editing setting everything was just wrong with this movie also tommy wiseaus name is mentioned 6 times before film even begins his character is course perfect that everyone should just love him lisa who is very odd looking is constantly called sexy which either has new definition or is ironic mark is doof ball that probably thinks that penguins are fish because hes just that stupid denny is perverted 15 year old who wants watch johnny lisa make love constantly says how love with lisa he is how he loves johnny also there is so many pointless love scenes football scenes gift giving scenes lines if there was drinking game pointless scenes this film youd die alcohol poisoning by end this movie i dont know it is one those films you have see believe but i can tell you one thing sure if tommy wiseau thinks were laughing with him he should check that were actually laughing at him 1 10,0.5762675777381661,0.04979203802733217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
1.0,"""I DID NAAAAGHT! Oh hi, Mark.""","Johnny, a man thanks to whom a bank makes lots of money, did not get his promotion but he's way too busy trying to be American by throwing footballs around at any given opportunity to really mind that. And he's also about to get married to Lisa who's in some computer business of some kind but she's having an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, who does not want to hurt Johnny but clearly can't help himself. Danny, Johnny and Lisa's young sexually confused neighbour who has problems of his own somewhat related to drugs and football fetching, doesn't suspect a thing although he's always hovering about and is also in love with Lisa but would rather watch Lisa and Johnny in bed when he's not fetching Johnny's balls. The only person who knows what is afoot between Johnny and Lisa is Lisa's mother who begs her daughter to come to her senses but in vain since no one listens to her and... she's dying... since she DEFINITELY has breast cancer (which is okay since ""they're curing people everyday""). Confused? Well don't be...And welcome to the wondrous world of ""The Room"". This is a world from the breathtaking lack of imagination of Tommy Wiseau, the least appealing man ever to walk this Earth; a world where people play football in tuxedo, have the same conversations again and again due to their 5 minutes memory, make babies by humping belly buttons in the middle of rose petals and finally enter and exit places without any other reason than to do just that.Indeed, this is probably one of the worst film ever made but as opposed to any other cinematic turd, this one is hardly ever dull (except for the ""sex"" scenes maybe), the aimless plot driven through one stupidity to the other by the on-par grammar-school writing delivering gems galore (""I'm so happy I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much"", ""I'm tired. I'm wasted. I love you darling""), the final broth served by inept performances (for want of a better word) from its cast. This is truly the most inspired disaster ever committed to screen.But what I find the most interesting about the ""The Room"" is its maker Tommy Wiseau. ""The Room"" is a window into his confused psyche because make no mistake folks: Tommy IS Johnny. And what are we told about Johnny? Well that ""he's very caring about the people in his life"", provides for his girlfriend, ""is very sensitive"", ""doesn't drink"", ""has a very secure situation"" and has nice pecs. Quite a catch wouldn't you say ladies? On paper possibly... Because everything about his persona seems phoney: his accent which is a mix of anyone's that ever walk this planet whom couldn't speak English, his over-sized suit, his dark, long and way too greasy hair, his geriatric body posture, his re-shaped and re-muddled face and, above all, his completely dry and humourless laughter (and not in a sarcastic way either). Such a penchant for dissimulation is downright creepy and I must admit, the physical repulsion he exerts on me is the stuff fascination is made of.The fact that ""The Room"" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. In the oh-so jaded times we're living in, celebrating the mediocre, talentless and pointless have become all the rage with the recipient of the mockery confusing infamy with fame. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.Mind you, I suppose Mr Wiseau can take pride in the fact that ""The Room"" will go down in Cinema history. But as what?",i did naaaaght oh hi mark,johnny man thanks whom bank makes lots money did not get his promotion but hes way too busy trying be american by throwing footballs around at any given opportunity really mind that hes also about get married lisa whos some computer business some kind but shes having affair with mark johnnys best friend who does not want hurt johnny but clearly cant help himself danny johnny lisas young sexually confused neighbour who has problems his own somewhat related drugs football fetching doesnt suspect thing although hes always hovering about is also love with lisa but would rather watch lisa johnny bed when hes not fetching johnnys balls only person who knows what is afoot between johnny lisa is lisas mother who begs her daughter come her senses but vain since no one listens her shes dying since she definitely has breast cancer which is okay since theyre curing people everyday confused well dont be welcome wondrous world room this is world breathtaking lack imagination tommy wiseau least appealing man ever walk this earth world where people play football tuxedo have same conversations again again due their 5 minutes memory make babies by humping belly buttons middle rose petals finally enter exit places without any other reason than do just that indeed this is probably one worst film ever made but as opposed any other cinematic turd this one is hardly ever dull except sex scenes maybe aimless plot driven through one stupidity other by par grammar school writing delivering gems galore im so happy i have you as my best friend i love lisa so much im tired im wasted i love you darling final broth served by inept performances want better word its cast this is truly most inspired disaster ever committed screen but what i find most interesting about room is its maker tommy wiseau room is window into his confused psyche because make no mistake folks tommy is johnny what are we told about johnny well that hes very caring about people his life provides his girlfriend is very sensitive doesnt drink has very secure situation has nice pecs quite catch wouldnt you say ladies paper possibly because everything about his persona seems phoney his accent which is mix anyones that ever walk this planet whom couldnt speak english his over sized suit his dark long way too greasy hair his geriatric body posture his re shaped re muddled face above all his completely dry humourless laughter not sarcastic way either such penchant dissimulation is downright creepy i must admit physical repulsion he exerts me is stuff fascination is made fact that room has gathered such cult following is no surprise oh so jaded times were living celebrating mediocre talentless pointless have become all rage with recipient mockery confusing infamy with fame there is something both pathetic little unsettling about how tommy wiseau regards cynical interests his movie has attracted genuine recognition his talent mind you i suppose mr wiseau can take pride fact that room will go down cinema history but as what,0.5550242504409173,0.06120756172839503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,The Best Movie....EVER!!!,"OK, that may be a stretch, but I have inside knowledge into the facts. You see, I was fortunate enough to have worked on the film. As I read the reviews here, especially the last one, which I am sure was written by our amazing Director/Actor/Producer/Writer, I felt I had to respond. Having the dubious honor of saying I worked on this film, has also brought with it the responsibility of telling the truth about what happened on set. Apparently Tommy had a lot of money sitting around and decided he needed to make a film. Not being able to decide what to shoot, film or video, we shot both. Side by side. Both cameras on the same head, being operated by one camera operator. We shot almost the whole thing in the parking lot and back storage shed (read- sound stage) of a camera rental house in Hollywood. I got the call to work on the show after they had already tried to start with another crew that ended up all being dismissed. I believe that we ended up being crew 2 of 4. The show never had much organization to it from the start. We were told it would be a 3 week shoot. At the end of 3 weeks we were exactly 1/2 way done. Crew calls were usually 8 a.m. tommy would show up around 10:30 or 11. Because he would take the HD video camera home with him every night, we had no choice but to wait for him. Since we were only in one room or outside the door in the parking lot, we did not have anything to do but sit around and wait every day. When Tommy arrived we would have to see if he was in actor mode or director mode. If he was in actor mode, you were not allowed to talk to him so he could ""stay in character."" Since he was in almost every scene, he was always in his ""actor"" mode. This also meant that he could not direct. Noting the huge delays every day and the fact that we were never seeming to get anything done, our wonderful script supervisor stepped up and became the director...at least he tried. One day he had to go off and do another show and asked if anyone else wanted to step up and direct and keep some script notes. When nobody volunteered, I stepped up. I loved it. It was my directorial genius that had tommy bump into Lisa as they were taking the bad guy off the roof! I will also take credit for the now famous line ""You are tearing me apart, Lisa!"" In the first 10 takes, tommy kept saying ""You are TAKING me apart!"" As the crew tried to keep it together, I felt I should right the situation and corrected the line. The crew was also instrumental in keeping the chicken line in. ""CHEEEEEPPPPPPP, CHEEP, CHEEP, CHEEP, CHEEP!"" We begged our scripty/director to keep him doing it take after take. Though the crew ultimately followed the original DP out the door and quit, we are all proud to have taken part in the making of this film. Amongst the film crew realms, we are minor celebrities. ""Dude, you worked on that thing?"" is a phrase that is often heard when The Room is mentioned.I have the pleasure of driving through Hollywood every day and still seei ng the billboard for the film up and Tommy glaring at me as if to say, ""I telled you I could make movie."" For those looking for a photo op, it's on Highland, a few blocks south of Sunset. I know that tommy took out an ad in the trade papers asking ""For Your Consideration"", I only wished that I could see him on stage accepting an Academy Award. It would be well earned. Rumor has it that he has a vampire film in the works... let's hope so... I only hope I get the opportunity to work on it. I can only hope that The Room becomes a cult classic with midnight showings. I'll put my tux on and bring a football. Perhaps I'll stand up for a Q&A afterward and tell the stories I have so fondly tried to burn from my memory. My other dream is for the DVD.

1.0,Deserving of being regarded as one of the worst movies of all time,"Johnny and Lisa are engaged and in a month will be married. Everything seems idyllic but Lisa is finding Johnny boring and has an affair with his best friend, Mark. Things start to escalate...Regarded as one of the worst movies of all time, and rightly so. Written, directed and starring Tommy Wiseau, the crappiness is largely a solo effort. Incredibly badly written: the dialogue is so bad to be quite bizarre at times. The central plot - the Johnny-Lisa-Mark love triangle - has no depth at all and really just goes around in circles. The lack of substance in the central plot is padded by random sub-plots and scenes that add nothing. Acting is about as bad as the writing, with Tommy Wiseau to the fore, again. He is so bad he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Marlon Brando. ""Hammy"" doesn't even come close to describing how bad he is, sometimes looking like he is just reciting lines that he is wholly disinterested in (which he wrote!) and then delivering in a ridiculously melodramatic manner (""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"" launched a thousand gifs). The remaining cast aren't great but aren't anywhere near as bad as Wiseau. They are helped by being in the same scene as him as he's so bad he makes them look okay.Direction is pretty much uninspired paint-by-numbers, though is not as laughable as the script or acting.There are no redeeming qualities to this movie.

1.0,"This cost $6.000.000 to make and ""Plan 9"" only cost $60,000....Mr. Wiseau needs to take some lessons from Ed Wood.","Tommy Wiseau...who is this guy? The IMDb biography is pretty scant and his vaguely Eastern European accent is not at all explained. What also isn't explained is how he was able to somehow get $6,000,000 to make this film--as well as HOW it could cost that much to make this movie. After all, none of the actors are professionals (and it shows), the sets look like they are the homes of Wiseau or his friends and Wiseau himself wrote/directed/starred in the film. So where did all the money go?! Perhaps some could have been spent on TVs (see the end to know what I mean). I think most young filmmakers could do just as well with $47 and a HandyCam and chimp actors! ""The Room"" seems to have nothing to do with a room. Instead, it's like a soft-core porno film where the camera gets blocked anytime you are about to see most of the nudity. I counted something like 6 sex cenes--3 of which were in the first 25 minutes!! So is the film therefore sexy--God no!! I will be nice and not make any more comments about this--you just have to see the writhing bodies to know what I mean. After all, I'm a middle-aged chubby guy and so I don't have much room to talk. But wait, I am NOT starring in a film...so yes, I can say that they were kind of scary looking--particularly Wiseau. So, if there was an award for least sexy film, this one might win....unless Ernest Borgnine made a porno.So why has this film become a cult favorite? It's the dialog....and the acting to a lesser extent. It's as if much of the dialog were written by someone with only a limited knowledge of the English language. So often the same catch phrases are repeated again and again. And often what characters say seems very, very random. And, to make it worse, the post-production dubbing is hilariously out of sync at times. Honestly, the dialog in ""Plan 9"" is no worse--especially since Wood was not trying to make a serious film--whereas ""The Room"" is deadly serious.Is it ONLY the dialog and acting? Well, no. The writing is god-awful--inconsistent, with missing plot lines AND the inexplicable need for all the men to suddenly break into a game of tossing the football--even though they are only 3-5 feet apart and even when they are in tuxedos! I can clearly understand why at L.A. showings of the film, crowd members reportedly bring footballs and toss them about during the film! And, the musical dubbing is occasionally terrible. And, the plot is dull. And, there's the problem with Wiseau's character being the greatest yutz in film history--knowing that his girlfriend is cheating on him near the beginning of the film yet continuing to stay with her AND doing the funniest temper-tantrum scene in film history late in the movie (he should have yelled ""Hulk SMASH!!!"").By the way, the film says the couple in the film have been together five years and then later in the film it says seven. Either way, considering the age of Wiseau's co-star, she would have been between 11 and 13 when they first became a couple.Also, on the DVD there is an interview with Wiseau. You must see this--the dubbing was hilarious even for this 'making of' mini-films! Plus it tries to explain the repeated use of footballs in his film! And, he wears a nice suit.In conclusion, I must quote the film.

7.0,An astonishing movie experience,"Sometimes it's difficult knowing where to start in reviewing a movie. This film is perhaps the ultimate example where words are simply not enough. The Room is a film that almost defies description. It really has to be experienced in order to understand why it has garnered a reputation as the most celebrated bad movie of the last decade. Unlike previous so-bad-their-good flicks such as Plan 9 From Outer Space or Troll 2 and countless others, The Room is not a sci-fi, horror or action flick. It is pure and simply a melodrama. This explains part of its huge impact in that it sort of appeals to both male and female audiences alike, while it is really quite unusual to see a film in this genre being quite do spectacularly bad. The Room is undoubtedly one of the funniest things I have seen in a long, long time.I'm not going to go into specifics here as to individual moments that make The Room the comedy classic that it has become, simply because there are far too many and it really needs to be seen to be believed. However, it would be remiss to not mention the character Johnny played by Tommy Wiseau. Johnny is the central character in the story. He is an overly nice character who others take advantage of. He seems to either be retarded or is recovering from a stroke. Wiseau is a very unusual central character, while his sex scenes are deeply disturbing – almost like scenes from a scary sci-fi horror film. Wiseau is of course the auteur behind this thing, he wrote and directed it and so therefore needs to be given some credit for producing something that is simultaneously so bad yet so committed and so deadly serious. He has attempted to claim after the event that The Room was intended as a black comedy. Don't be fooled by this for a second, this movie plays it completely straight. It's so very funny because of this fact. It is an absolute impossibility to make the specific anti-genius of The Room intentionally.I have seen it a couple of times. The second of which was at a public screening and I have to report that I have never witnessed anything like it. It was the closest a movie-going experience ever got to the feel of going to a gig. The sense of excitement beforehand was palpable and once the movie started rolling the audience was extremely lively throughout with no let up from start to finish. It ended with a standing ovation.

Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals.

It's kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion - random, incoherent, disastrous, accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what's happening on screen, which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.The camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas, nor would the script and plot, but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau's artistic integrity.

1.0,No Room Available,"No, no, no, no, no, no, NO! The Room is not a black comedy as arrogant writer, star, distributor, producer and obviously blind director, Tommy Wiseau would want you to believe.

Keanu Reeves?(Okay, those last four weren't movies, but damn you, World, for those.)Well, I had to ask myself: Is this really a movie? Is this a joke and I got the wrong ""film"" that people are talking about?Believe it or not, I had to consult with a professional critic and he actually confirmed that this is, in fact, a movie. And that he's seen it. And then I heard a gunshot and a loud thud. His poor, poor children.While he didn't actually die, you'll want to roughly 10 seconds into The Room. Die laughing, perhaps, at its amazing lack of direction and incredibly, there are two men fighting over the director credit: Wiseau (huh. WISEau?) and Sandy Schklair. Hmmm. Would you have fought with Pilate when he claimed to be the murderer of Jesus?In a ""movie"" (from here on out, that word will be very loosely associated with The Room) that even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed à la Rumble in the Bronx, even though everyone's speaking English – if you can call it that, you'll quickly learn what NOT to do. Such as the ever so comical ""shots"" of San Francisco and the unfortunate Golden Gate Bridge which probably would've asked for a cut if this made more than a tenth of a penny.Recently I re-watched and reviewed the brilliant The Big Lebowski, and I stated towards the end that it should be actually studied in film school, if not already. I'll say the same here, but obviously at the other end of the spectrum.You almost feel sorry for the labeled ""director"" Wiseau, if not for his arrogance – SEE: poster for proof. Ironically, his follow-up was Homeless in America, and if America did have anything to do with it, he would be. But can you really be mad at the guy for this atrocity? Well, if he stayed in the background, and not in more than 75% of screen-time, you might feel some pity.And his writing? It's as if he was a stone-cold foreigner who watched a lot of American Sitcoms of the 1950s and used an English Translating Dictionary to produce the words spoken on screen. Sure, it's hilarious to hear him, or any of them speak, but it's also sad when someone who apparently isn't familiar with the language, culture or modest enough to hire someone to even take a 30-second peek at the screenplay. Personally, I wouldn't jump over to Paris and write a movie on the life and times of the natives using both a French for Dummies guide and my memory of French class in High School nearly two decades back. Is Paris is Burning already taken? Oh.The ""movie"" follows a confused blonde (duh) named Lisa (Danielle) who unsure of her pending nuptials to Johnny (Wiseau.) Who would be when you're about to marry the love child of Gérard Depardieu and Bob Dylan? Soshe sleeps around and shows the camera she's not ashamed of her (probably bought) breasts.That's pretty much the plot. Throw in some laugh-out-loud 15-second subplot of a boy, Denny (Haldiman) who both likes to watch and do daaaangerous narcotics and a mother who looks as confused as George W. Bush without a speech to read.The actors, unbelievably, took this seriously. I would show more compassion for them, but even with a $1,000,000 scholarship to the New York Film Academy, they'd still fail later on.I've been told this is a great midnight movie experience, i.e. the astonishingly superior The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Perhaps. But, even at 99 minutes, it drags and my laughter nearly died, from pure exhaustion, towards the end. Fortunately, the SURPRISE! ending brought me back up to laughing hard.That all said, wellthis entire review, I'd still recommend this ""movie."" How could you miss an opportunity like this? I seriously thought Troll 2 could never ever happen again. Improbably, lightning struck twice. First with a movie that's called Troll 2 that doesn't even involve trolls and now with The Room that's not even about one.",no room available,no no no no no no no room is not black comedy as arrogant writer star distributor producer obviously blind director tommy wiseau would want you believe heck it doesnt even have single black person much less anything but unintentional humor could room be absolutely worst movie ever made world that gave us manos hands fate eegah troll 2 sharp teeth shark attack mediterranean another gay sequel gays gone wild sound thunder furry vengeance boat trip basic instinct 2 good luck chuck piranha part two spawning glitter remember me stan helsing leonard part 6 texas chainsaw massacre next generation all about steve deathbed bed that eats pieces paranormal activity raspberry reich curtains axe superman iv quest peace batman robin twilight series vampires suck any howling sequel terminator 3 rise machines friday 13th part viii jason takes manhattan jennifers body plan 9 outer space 88 minutes beyond reasonable doubt lucky you jaws revenge 2012 empire ants food gods jurassic park iii halloween iii season witch halloween curse michael myers halloween resurrection grown ups year one toxic avenger either i spit your grave s blood beach last airbender happening freddys dead final nightmare tvs viva laughlin saddam hussein paris hilton keanu reeves okay those last four werent movies but damn you world those well i had ask myself is this really movie is this joke i got wrong film that people are talking about believe it or not i had consult with professional critic he actually confirmed that this is fact movie that hes seen it then i heard gunshot loud thud his poor poor children while he didnt actually die youll want roughly 10 seconds into room die laughing perhaps at its amazing lack direction incredibly there are two men fighting over director credit wiseau huh wiseau sandy schklair hmmm would you have fought with pilate when he claimed be murderer jesus movie here out that word will be very loosely associated with room that even dialogue sounds like it was dubbed la rumble bronx even though everyones speaking english if you can call it that youll quickly learn what not do such as ever so comical shots san francisco unfortunate golden gate bridge which probably wouldve asked cut if this made more than tenth penny recently i re watched reviewed brilliant big lebowski i stated towards end that it should be actually studied film school if not already ill say same here but obviously at other end spectrum you almost feel sorry labeled director wiseau if not his arrogance see poster proof ironically his follow up was homeless america if america did have anything do with it he would be but can you really be mad at guy this atrocity well if he stayed background not more than 75 screen time you might feel some pity his writing its as if he was stone cold foreigner who watched lot american sitcoms 1950s used english translating dictionary produce words spoken screen sure its hilarious hear him or any them speak but its also sad when someone who apparently isnt familiar with language culture or modest enough hire someone even take 30 second peek at screenplay personally i wouldnt jump over paris write movie life times natives using both french dummies guide my memory french class high school nearly two decades back is paris is burning already taken oh movie follows confused blonde duh named lisa danielle who unsure her pending nuptials johnny wiseau who would be when youre about marry love child g rard depardieu bob dylan so she sleeps around shows camera shes not ashamed her probably bought breasts thats pretty much plot throw some laugh out loud 15 second subplot boy denny haldiman who both likes watch do daaaangerous narcotics mother who looks as confused as george w bush without speech read actors unbelievably took this seriously i would show more compassion them but even with 1 000 000 scholarship new york film academy theyd still fail later ive been told this is great midnight movie experience i e astonishingly superior rocky horror picture show perhaps but even at 99 minutes it drags my laughter nearly died pure exhaustion towards end fortunately surprise ending brought me back up laughing hard that all said well this entire review id still recommend this movie how could you miss opportunity like this i seriously thought troll 2 could never ever happen again improbably lightning struck twice first with movie thats called troll 2 that doesnt even involve trolls now with room thats not even about one,0.48901108832687784,0.041728639781271365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,This Is Really a Very Bad Movie,"After watching James Franco´s ""The Disaster Artist"", it is mandatory to any curious viewer to see ""The Room"" (2003) despite the bad expectations. ""The Room"" is a terrible amateurish movie that becomes hilarious and cult so bad it is. The story is absolutely silly, without continuity and laughable dialogs giving the sensation that was written by a high-school teenager. The cast is amateurish and ham, probably ashamed and embarrassed with their lines and their names in the credits. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Not Available",this is really very bad movie,after watching james franco s disaster artist it is mandatory any curious viewer see room 2003 despite bad expectations room is terrible amateurish movie that becomes hilarious cult so bad it is story is absolutely silly without continuity laughable dialogs giving sensation that was written by high school teenager cast is amateurish ham probably ashamed embarrassed with their lines their names credits my vote is one awful title brazil not available,0.8165384615384615,-0.44230769230769224,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.56}"
