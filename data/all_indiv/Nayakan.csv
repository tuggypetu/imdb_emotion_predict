10.0,One of the best Indian movies I have ever seen.,"The film draws heavily upon Mario Puzo's Godfather, however, the Indian adaptation of the well known story is simply superb. Manirathnam has done a wonderful job in re-creating the life and times of a local mafioso in the slums of Bombay. The art direction is flawless, and captures the time period perfectly. The music by Illayaraja is haunting, and reflects the nostalgic music of the early 70s. However, the high point of the movie is the excellent performance of Kamal Hassan. His potrayal of Velu-Nayakan is by far the best I have seen in Indian movies. The Hindi remake of this movie is sub-standard and poor.

,"The Godfather comes to Tamil, with a difference","Even though Nayagan seems like a compressed version of The Godfather series and despite the fact that a lot of the scences in the movie give you sense of deja vu(after you've watched Godfather. Nayagan is probably one of the best movies made in Tamil(and may be in any Indian language). Apart from changing the very face of movie making in India, it had send so many refreshing trends.Nayagan is the story of a boy(Velu), who loses his father(a Trade Union leader) and runs away to Bombay, after assualting the Police who kills his father. In Bombay he is brought up by a pious Muslim fisherman. By turn of events, Velu is pulled into committing Crime(and fighting too). Velu grows into a Don and slowly the power of it takes him to a different world, where he is the command, but he slowly losses his dear ones and it finally ends with his death at an old age, with a moral message that one who lives by the sword(gun), dies by it.Kamal had given one of his best performances in this movie, for which he rightfully won the National Award for Best Actor. The Music of Illayaraja, Photography of P C Sreeram and the Art of Thotta Tharani were other High points of the movie, not to mention the magical touch of Manirathnam, who made a permanent name for himself after making Nayagan.A must watch movie, for anyone who hasn't seen it.",godfather comes tamil with difference,even though nayagan seems like compressed version godfather series despite fact that lot scences movie give you sense deja vu after youve watched godfather nayagan is probably one best movies made tamil may be any indian language apart changing very face movie making india it had send so many refreshing trends nayagan is story boy velu who loses his father trade union leader runs away bombay after assualting police who kills his father bombay he is brought up by pious muslim fisherman by turn events velu is pulled into committing crime fighting too velu grows into don slowly power it takes him different world where he is command but he slowly losses his dear ones it finally ends with his death at old age with moral message that one who lives by sword gun dies by it kamal had given one his best performances this movie which he rightfully won national award best actor music illayaraja photography p c sreeram art thotta tharani were other high points movie not mention magical touch manirathnam who made permanent name himself after making nayagan must watch movie anyone who hasnt seen it,0.4626470588235294,0.23147058823529415,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,Mani Ratnam & Kamal Hassan create history with this masterpiece,"""Nayagan"" is akin to a rare astronomical event wherein the constellations form a perfect alignment to create a spectacular extravaganza. Mani Ratnam, Kamal Hassan & Ilayaraja weaved magic that captured the heart of audience by storm. There cannot be a second opinion if I were to state that this role was destined for one and only Kamal Hassan. You cannot fail to notice the subtle changes in the body language, mannerism, gait and dialogue delivery that go about with the ageing process of the Sakthivelu. Starting with the rebel youth and all the way to the ageing Godfather, the natural transformation was effortlessly essayed by Kamal. Saranya, Ravi, Kartika, Nasser and Tinnu Anand leave a mark otherwise there isn't much scope for supporting star-cast. Ilayaraja compositions were a raging hit back then. P C Sriram (cinematography) & Thota Tharani (art direction) ensured to give a distinct Mani Ratnam feel to the visuals (a spillover of ""Agni Natchathiram""). Though the plot rests on the basic premise of Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"", top notch writing narrating the biography of Mumbai based Tamil gangster of the 80s, Varadarajan Mudaliar stands to its own.If ""Mouna Ragam"" and ""Agni Natchathiram"" got him noticed then ""Nayagan"" stamped the title of maverick to Mani Ratnam. It goes without saying that while ""Nayagan"" set a precedent for fellow film-makers, Mani Ratnam started the revolution in the Tamil cinema.

A fantastic star cast(Kamal Haasan, Nasser, Janakaraj), splendid direction(Mani Rathnam) and excellent music score by the maestro Illayaraja made the movie do wonders in the box office.

8.0,Mani Ratnam improvises multiple masala movie cliches in this Classic Semi-biographical Crime Drama with the help of Kamal Haasan's Iconic 'Velu Naikar'.,"Nayakan (1987) : Brief Review -Mani Ratnam improvises multiple masala movie cliches in this Classic Semi-biographical Crime Drama with the help of Kamal Haasan's Iconic 'Velu Naikar'. Nayakan was an early classic in crime drama genre, a genre which was not explored fully till then in India. Hollywood had been making same films since 30s and most of them were Crime Noirs which still look superior even after long time. 'The Godfather' recieved universal acclaim for some valid reasons, one of the major factor was its timing. Hollywood was losing its shine after the golden period of 1930-1960s, then Musicals took over in the next decade and then 70s needed a change. The Godfather provided that, otherwise there are many better Classics made it in Old Hollywood but only some chunk of movie buffs Know it. What The Godfather did for Hollywood, Nayakan does for Tamil Cinema or to some extent, to Indian Cinema. It wasn't like every scene or frame in Nayakan is absolutely class or something like that, it has many references from 70s Masala Films of Bollywood and South industries. It is always said that Nayakan was based on the life of Gangster Varadarajan Mudaliar but even his life events differs so much from the film hence, that Semi-biographical tag. Actually, Nayakan is a film which has created those cliches we have been seeing in all gangster/crime dramas in last 30 years. Kamal Haasan as Velu Naikar will always remain iconic. His charisma in that role will never get old. Mani Ratnam's improvisation tactics of typical masala elements looks interesting and the reason is, an early attempt to discover something powerful in this 'not so good' genre. Nayakan is a complete package of a cinematic experience which does not disappoint you in any aspect, rather it gives you those first-time showcases of multiple cliches. Overall, a Classic Crime Drama and highly effective for its time.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",mani ratnam improvises multiple masala movie cliches this classic semi biographical crime drama with help kamal haasans iconic velu naikar,nayakan 1987 brief review mani ratnam improvises multiple masala movie cliches this classic semi biographical crime drama with help kamal haasans iconic velu naikar nayakan was early classic crime drama genre genre which was not explored fully till then india hollywood had been making same films since 30s most them were crime noirs which still look superior even after long time godfather recieved universal acclaim some valid reasons one major factor was its timing hollywood was losing its shine after golden period 1930 1960s then musicals took over next decade then 70s needed change godfather provided that otherwise there are many better classics made it old hollywood but only some chunk movie buffs know it what godfather did hollywood nayakan does tamil cinema or some extent indian cinema it wasnt like every scene or frame nayakan is absolutely class or something like that it has many references 70s masala films bollywood south industries it is always said that nayakan was based life gangster varadarajan mudaliar but even his life events differs so much film hence that semi biographical tag actually nayakan is film which has created those cliches we have been seeing all gangster crime dramas last 30 years kamal haasan as velu naikar will always remain iconic his charisma that role will never get old mani ratnams improvisation tactics typical masala elements looks interesting reason is early attempt discover something powerful this not so good genre nayakan is complete package cinematic experience which does not disappoint you any aspect rather it gives you those first time showcases multiple cliches overall classic crime drama highly effective its time rating 8 10 by,0.363125,0.20656249999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.18}"

In 2005, Time Magazine included Nayagan in its ""All-Time 100 Best Films"" list.[1] The film was remade in Hindi as Dayavan in 1988, with Vinod Khanna playing the part of Saktivelu and with Feroz Khan and Madhuri Dixit playing the roles of Selvam and Neela. A dubbed version of the film was released as Velu Nayakan in 1999.Plot: Sakthivelu Nayakar (Kamal Hassan), the protagonist, is born to an anti-government union leader. The child, Velu, is tricked by the police into locating his father, and then witnesses his father's death in a police shootout. Then after doing the final rites for his father, he kills the person who was the cause for his father's death. Orphaned, he escapes to Bombay.Stranded and homeless in the big city, he is rescued by a kind-hearted Muslim fisherman who takes him into his home in the sprawling suburban slums of Dharavi. His foster-father is also a small-time smuggler known for his generosity in the slum. Upon his running afoul of a senior crime lord, the corrupt local police officer Inspector Kelkar arrests the fisherman on smuggling charges, and is later murdered. Velu Naiker, now a young man who has come into his own, goes in search of the officer and bludgeons him to death.With this act, he is seen at once a saviour and a man to be feared amongst the slum residents. As their godfather and protector, he flourishes by resuming his dead foster-father's local smuggling activities. He marries a destitute school-girl-turned-prostitute (Saranya) and has two children. Conflicts and power struggles occur in the competitive web of the smuggling world, in which Velu's wife becomes a casualty. Velu's kids are sent away to Chennai as a result and return years later to their father's home, as young adults.The son, Surya (Nizhalgal Ravi), is eager to join his father in his activities, despite his father's reluctance. For his first real test, he is required to eliminate a potential witness against his father; he does this by hiring outside thugs. They succeed in eliminating the witness, but their failure to cover their tracks leads police to him at a petrol bunk and an accident costs him his life. Velu is heartbroken. Velu's daughter (Karthika) is at odds with her father over his form of justice and killings. To this he replies Ellariyum nerutha solu, appuram naan neruthuran. The death of her brother was the last straw for her and she cuts off her relationship with her father and leaves him.A newly appointed Assistant Police Commissioner (Nassar) starts afresh the hunt to bring Velu Nayakar to justice over his alleged activities and manages to secure an arrest warrant. This Commissioner is unknowingly Velu's son-in-law, as his daughter had secretly married him. After continued pursuit resulting in the beatings by police and self-immolation of slum dwellers, Velu surrenders to the police to spare the lives of the residents of his slum. He is tried in court but is released due to the lack of adequate evidence for his alleged nefarious activities. A supportive and emotional crowd gathers at the courthouse, awaiting Velu's release. Velu emerges to greet the tumultuous crowd but unexpectedly gets shot by Inspector Kelkar's retarded son, whom Velu had adopted, after he learns that Velu had killed his father long ago.The film has some very emotional moments: when Velu's wife his shot and he covers his children's eyes with her scarf, which eventually slips from his hands. When Velu visits his daughter's house for the very first time and is not allowed see his grandson. And towards the end when he learns that his daughter has given her son his own name. He wants to give his grandson some money as a gift to him, he reaches into his pocket and finds none. The final scene in the movie shows Velu dead lying on the same street in which he fought for the people and which he grew up on. I broke down crying when I saw that scene.Buy this great film on DVD, and watch it with your family and friends.GOD BLESS KAMAL HASSAN.Write to me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com if you are a Kamal Hassan fan like me and we can chat about his films.Thanks for reading.",kamal hassan is my hero till day i die,i am very privileged write this review my hero actor kamal hassan i have seen most his well known films sadma ek duje ke liye saagar appu raja hindustani puspak k love chariot 1988 chachi 420 i adore all above films his you can collect above movies it will be good collection start with this film written directed by mani ratnan got rave reviews across india kamal hassans performance this film earned him best actor award maniratnam earned accolades all over india became popular overnight film also earned national award best cinematography best art direction nayagan which means hero or leader is based real life bombay underworld don varada or varadarajan mudaliar sympathetically depicts struggle south indians living bombay now mumbai lead character is played by kamal haasan film also stars saranya karthika nassar delhi ganesh janagaraj soundtrack film was composed by ilaiyaraaja film was nominated by india as its entry best foreign language film academy awards 1987 2005 time magazine included nayagan its all time 100 best films list film was remade hindi as dayavan 1988 with vinod khanna playing part saktivelu with feroz khan madhuri dixit playing roles selvam neela dubbed version film was released as velu nayakan 1999 plot sakthivelu nayakar kamal hassan protagonist is born anti government union leader child velu is tricked by police into locating his father then witnesses his fathers death police shootout then after doing final rites his father he kills person who was cause his fathers death orphaned he escapes bombay stranded homeless big city he is rescued by kind hearted muslim fisherman who takes him into his home sprawling suburban slums dharavi his foster father is also small time smuggler known his generosity slum upon his running afoul senior crime lord corrupt local police officer inspector kelkar arrests fisherman smuggling charges is later murdered velu naiker now young man who has come into his own goes search officer bludgeons him death with this act he is seen at once saviour man be feared amongst slum residents as their godfather protector he flourishes by resuming his dead foster fathers local smuggling activities he marries destitute school girl turned prostitute saranya has two children conflicts power struggles occur competitive web smuggling world which velus wife becomes casualty velus kids are sent away chennai as result return years later their fathers home as young adults son surya nizhalgal ravi is eager join his father his activities despite his fathers reluctance his first real test he is required eliminate potential witness against his father he does this by hiring outside thugs they succeed eliminating witness but their failure cover their tracks leads police him at petrol bunk accident costs him his life velu is heartbroken velus daughter karthika is at odds with her father over his form justice killings this he replies ellariyum nerutha solu appuram naan neruthuran death her brother was last straw her she cuts off her relationship with her father leaves him newly appointed assistant police commissioner nassar starts afresh hunt bring velu nayakar justice over his alleged activities manages secure arrest warrant this commissioner is unknowingly velus son law as his daughter had secretly married him after continued pursuit resulting beatings by police self immolation slum dwellers velu surrenders police spare lives residents his slum he is tried court but is released due lack adequate evidence his alleged nefarious activities supportive emotional crowd gathers at courthouse awaiting velus release velu emerges greet tumultuous crowd but unexpectedly gets shot by inspector kelkars retarded son whom velu had adopted after he learns that velu had killed his father long ago film has some very emotional moments when velus wife his shot he covers his childrens eyes with her scarf which eventually slips his hands when velu visits his daughters house very first time is not allowed see his grandson towards end when he learns that his daughter has given her son his own name he wants give his grandson some money as gift him he reaches into his pocket finds none final scene movie shows velu dead lying same street which he fought people which he grew up i broke down crying when i saw that scene buy this great film dvd watch it with your family friends god bless kamal hassan write me vivekmaru45 com if you are kamal hassan fan like me we can chat about his films thanks reading,0.41491696627289854,0.16987245334702963,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,A Sprawling Gangster Epic,"A sprawling epic crafted with gusto & told with finesse, Mani Ratnam's Nayakan follows the journey of a man who takes a stand against injustice and becomes a messiah to the poor & impoverished, and captures his ascent to the top and the eventual downfall that always awaits men with too much power & influence.Brilliantly directed by Mani Ratnam, the film breathes authenticity in atmosphere with its era-appropriate backdrop, and aptly covers the constant struggle of poor against the powerful & corrupt. Ratnam is never in a hurry, letting several scenes play out in their entirety to paint a realistic portrait, and his direction is excellent throughout.The real show-stealer however is Kamal Haasan whose commanding performance brims with both formidable quality & emotional sincerity. The film never for once shies away from showing the moral dilemma he faces several times and the heavy toll he pays for taking the mafia road. And the notable actor articulates all that & more with exactness.On an overall scale, Nayakan remains one of Indian cinema's finest achievements and is still more than capable of surprising the newcomers. The customary songs & dance numbers do hamper the ride slightly but Mani Ratnam's controlled work behind the camera & Kamal Haasan's impressive act in front of it makes Nayakan a must-see for anyone venturing into India's filmmaking scene.",sprawling gangster epic,sprawling epic crafted with gusto told with finesse mani ratnams nayakan follows journey man who takes stand against injustice becomes messiah poor impoverished captures his ascent top eventual downfall that always awaits men with too much power influence brilliantly directed by mani ratnam film breathes authenticity atmosphere with its era appropriate backdrop aptly covers constant struggle poor against powerful corrupt ratnam is never hurry letting several scenes play out their entirety paint realistic portrait his direction is excellent throughout real show stealer however is kamal haasan whose commanding performance brims with both formidable quality emotional sincerity film never once shies away showing moral dilemma he faces several times heavy toll he pays taking mafia road notable actor articulates all that more with exactness overall scale nayakan remains one indian cinemas finest achievements is still more than capable surprising newcomers customary songs dance numbers do hamper ride slightly but mani ratnams controlled work behind camera kamal haasans impressive act front it makes nayakan must see anyone venturing into indias filmmaking scene,0.5114942528735632,0.20344827586206896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8.0,The best Tamil movie I have ever seen,"I have lived most of my life in North India watching both Bollywood and Hollywood cinema. The first Tamil movie I saw was Roja (dubbed in Hindi) by director Mani Ratnam. The director's class was apart from any other Indian director. Clearly Ratnam was able to mix two genres of Indian Cinema that are the opposite ends of each other. Roja was both Art and Commercial (some would say neither.) I saw two more Ratnam movies and a lot of other Tamil movies before I saw Ratnam's Nayakan.Before I saw it, Nayakan was the kind of movie you hear people talk about with a certain air of sophistry. My Tamil friends showed me a lot of Tamil movies and then we would judge them. Mostly they tried to convince me the movie I just saw was good even though according to me it was not by any standard. I was beginning to feel Tamil cinema is about as bad as Hindi cinema. Hindi Cinema at least had a golden period; Tamil movies seemed to get worse as you went back in time. I blamed it on my lack of understanding of both Tamil language and Tamil culture. Ratnam I was starting to believe was a Hindi director.Nayakan was the first Mani Ratnam movie I saw in Tamil (subtitles.) By the end I was convinced that Nayakan is probably the best Tamil movie I have ever seen. It is impossible not to notice how much this movie is inspired from Godfather. The theme is similar, the movie follows the life of Velunayakan as he rises on to become an influential smuggler and fighter of people's cause in the slums of Dharavi (Bombay.) Nayakan is Indian version of Godfather both in its setting and its message (emphasis on Indianess). Though I am told that it is based on someone's real life. So mostly Ratnam is paying homage to The Godfather. Nayakan suffers from the cheesiness of most Indian movies, it suffers from what is called the item number - the rain dance, featuring a supposedly sexy dancer. How someone does anything but laugh at a dancing obese woman is only for Tamil movie buffs to explain. Since they explained it to me I will explain it here: the context that this mediocrity should be seen in is this - Tamil audience wants everything from a movie action, laughter, morality, and sex - but not really, sex is taboo. So they end up tantalizing themselves with glimpses of it in a dance. But as soon as you fast forward through this one song, Nayakan comes back to showing its strength again - and this time with a vengeance. What I saw of Nayakan in the first half was an average movie, if only you sit through till the end do you realize how strong the movie is. The direction the acting and the story all begin to mature in the second half of the movie.Nayakan is a very Indian movie and that too very Tamil. If you have never seen a Tamil movie you will not be able to appreciate Nayakan in one viewing. What will stand out will be the differences from the kind of movie you have seen. Those differences will over shadow the qualities that Nayakan has.I have said a lot of things about Tamil movies that paints a shoddy picture of Tamil cinema. But my views may suffer from a skew introduced by the small sample size. There probably are many good Tamil movies that I have not seen.**By the way, Nayakan was in Time Magazine's list of 100 best movies.
