9,One of the best scripted cop thriller,"I was Dumbstruck when I saw this movie at theater. M.Raja has indeed grown a long way from being a 'remake' director to his 'own make' director. The base script is usual one - good vs bad. But the way it has been scripted especially the bad part, deserves standing ovation!PROS:Aravind Samy - dashing stylish villain is everyones favorite and he doesn't disappoint you ! This villain is very unique! He didn't lay his hand on the protagonist at all! not even for a single shot. He carried the bad role in a subtle but powerful manner! You will surely fall in love with this character!Thambi Ramayyah - humour is different from comedy and he is the trump card in this movie who keeps on giving us some enjoyable part with his innocence. Jayam Ravi - He worked very hard for this movie! It is evident from the word go itself. This is a tailor made role for him and he did exceed the expectations.Atlast, Raja - scripting a detailed cop thriller with pacey screenplay is very difficult and he succeeds very much here!Very good movie after Thuppaki which should be watched in theaters purely for its excellence in story telling!This is a smartly made movie though not a genius film!Kudos to the whole team!

10,One of the best stylish thrilers,"The movie title itself gave me goose bumps. A thriller is expected after all the promotions. But a thriller with a true meaning and less illogicalstuffs is Thani oruvan. The twist in the beginning scene itself will make you understand what you will watch for the next 2 hours. More than Ravi his brother deserves the applause for scripting something original and keeping the audience thrilled till the end. That's something very rare. But he managed to do that in this flick. But the next main person who should be saluted,awarded,appreciated,loved,and of course all the other synonyms is Aravind Swamy. Can a villain be so loved by everyone?. I think that has happened now. Performance to a next level. Ravi has done a commendable job in first choosing such a script which has more importance to the villain than the hero. And of course at the end everyone will appreciate the only performance which stands out that is Sidharth Abimanyu. An enjoyable ride. I am sure all will love it...",one best stylish thrilers,movie title itself gave me goose bumps thriller is expected after all promotions but thriller with true meaning less illogicalstuffs is thani oruvan twist beginning scene itself will make you understand what you will watch next 2 hours more than ravi his brother deserves applause scripting something original keeping audience thrilled till end thats something very rare but he managed do that this flick but next main person who should be saluted awarded appreciated loved course all other synonyms is aravind swamy can villain be so loved by everyone i think that has happened now performance next level ravi has done commendable job first choosing such script which has more importance villain than hero course at end everyone will appreciate only performance which stands out that is sidharth abimanyu enjoyable ride i am sure all will love it,0.5082175925925926,0.30583333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7,It has got everything to make a perfect cop thriller,"A well enacted thriller with a racy screen play portrays the war between the good and the bad (evil). Jayam Ravi's brother Director M.Raja has given so many hits but most of them would be remakes of success films in Telugu. This time he has took quite time to pen his story and screenplay after his last venture Velayudham starting Vijay which has worked quite well even though the basic concept is the same cat and mouse game. Corruption, Corporate mafia, underworld, Pharmaceutical Company's illegal research, Goons, Strict and straight forward IAS, IPS officers working with anti corruption motto, realistic fight with corporate Dons, A Solo Hero with a vision and a supportive lead lady some of the keywords that can describe this movie's plot. The ultimate show stopper of the movie was the performance of the antagonist played by none other than the yester year's charming hero Aravind Samy. He plays Siddharth Abimanyu a suave middle aged notorious scientist and has lifted the role to a different level with his charisma in a sophisticated set up. His comeback as a good hearted priest didn't work out in Kadal but sure this negative role will be a break through character in his career. Mithran (essayed by Jayam ravi ) is the best cop ever who shadows his aim case and moves exactly with his supporting team of friends. Mahima (played by the beautiful dusky Nayantara) who is head over heels with Mithran supports him with her skills. The overall love sequences seemed sensible and mature didn't bore us with instant dream sequences except the one and only song which was bearable. Other than these leads we have Nasser, Thambi Rammaiah (don't know how many movies he will play the same innocent character with the same tone), Vamsi Krishna, Ganesh Venkat Ram, Jay Prakash, Mugdha Godse (of the Hindi movie Fashion fame). On the technical bit like cinematography, editing, BGM, Arts was in place and gave what was needed for a script like this. Except a bit on editing would have made it look perfect. At times it would make you feel and compare portions with Kakha kakha and similar cop movie series, plus Ramana, Nimirndhu nil, E, Thupakki etc Verdict: A good thriller with an over shadowed antagonist which is the current trend where villain takes over easily.",it has got everything make perfect cop thriller,well enacted thriller with racy screen play portrays war between good bad evil jayam ravis brother director m raja has given so many hits but most them would be remakes success films telugu this time he has took quite time pen his story screenplay after his last venture velayudham starting vijay which has worked quite well even though basic concept is same cat mouse game corruption corporate mafia underworld pharmaceutical companys illegal research goons strict straight forward ias ips officers working with anti corruption motto realistic fight with corporate dons solo hero with vision supportive lead lady some keywords that can describe this movies plot ultimate show stopper movie was performance antagonist played by none other than yester years charming hero aravind samy he plays siddharth abimanyu suave middle aged notorious scientist has lifted role different level with his charisma sophisticated set up his comeback as good hearted priest didnt work out kadal but sure this negative role will be break through character his career mithran essayed by jayam ravi is best cop ever who shadows his aim case moves exactly with his supporting team friends mahima played by beautiful dusky nayantara who is head over heels with mithran supports him with her skills overall love sequences seemed sensible mature didnt bore us with instant dream sequences except one only song which was bearable other than these leads we have nasser thambi rammaiah dont know how many movies he will play same innocent character with same tone vamsi krishna ganesh venkat ram jay prakash mugdha godse hindi movie fashion fame technical bit like cinematography editing bgm arts was place gave what was needed script like this except bit editing would have made it look perfect at times it would make you feel compare portions with kakha kakha similar cop movie series plus ramana nimirndhu nil e thupakki etc verdict good thriller with over shadowed antagonist which is current trend where villain takes over easily,0.4771990740740741,0.18958333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.37}"

Jeyam Ravi is doing the finest job over here as the hero while Arvind Swamy doing a magnificent role over the villain. Nayanthara is bit small character in here as Mithran's girlfriend & the director should focus to take much more from her. And a word about the director, M. Raja has proved that he can do many things more than re-making old movies. And the musics were very good & synchronized with the movement of the movie. and the finally, I would say that this movie is worth watching. You have to spent 2hours and 37 minutes. but it deserve it.",cant imagine but can happen,few years back tamil movies were junk but now time has gone they had grown up at once i can say this movie is excellent worth watching jeyam ravi is doing finest job over here as hero while arvind swamy doing magnificent role over villain nayanthara is bit small character here as mithrans girlfriend director should focus take much more her word about director m raja has proved that he can do many things more than re making old movies musics were very good synchronized with movement movie finally i would say that this movie is worth watching you have spent 2hours 37 minutes but it deserve it,0.4485714285714285,0.32571428571428573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,Box Office hit needs Out-of-the-Box Thinking,"As we all witnessed during the past 10 days or so, 'Thani Oruvan' got rave reviews and has been accepted by the film industry and audience as a benchmark movie. There is a transition happening in the Indian movie industry; that is driven by the audience. Today movie goers are well aware of the worldly events. The life-cycle of audience taste is short, meaning audience preference is undergoing change at a higher rate than ever before. The typical romance movie is no longer going to pull the audience. It had been already exploited by the uncountable number of movies in all the possible formats. So what is next? That is called 'Thani Oruvan' way! - A strong theme, embedded with authentic data & logic. How it all started? Way back in 2013, director Mr. Mohan Raja met with a group of consultants from Fhyzics Business Consultants Pvt. Ltd., specializes in business consulting and business analysis (An EEP of International Institute of Business Analysis, Canada and REP of International Requirements Engineering Board, Germany). By that time, Mr. Raja was thinking about the story for at least 3 years. The one question he asked the group of consultants was ""I want to make the movie authentic and different, how you could contribute?"" Fhyzics was also looking for opportunities to explore the movie industry. Subsequently, Fhyzics team met the director few times and demonstrated how they can make it different. It clicked, and Fhyzics got its maiden movie project. The assignment given to Fhyzics team is data and logic research for the movie project. The team researched the IPS training, minute-by- minute daily routines of IPS probationers and officers, costumes, usage of words & terminologies, technologies, background, analysis methods etc. The team also did intensive research on crimes both at national and international level from 1990 onwards to till-date. Organized the crimes under different heads and drawn the linkages. Prepared crime charts, time-to-time emotional graphs, hero vs. villain rise & fall maps etc. Even Fhyzics created a PPT that was presented to the producers by Mr. Raja to give them a holistic view of the movie. Massive amount of data and information were collected, organized in SharePoint (a Microsoft technology), then distilled and presented on weekly basis to the director for the entire duration of the movie making and it has been judiciously consumed in the movie without affecting the entertainment element of it. At Fhyzics, we profoundly thank Mr. Raja for the opportunity and helping us in launching our services in the movie industry with this landmark movie, 'Thani Oruvan'.

7,Average film,"Currently rated 8.6 on IMDB , just too much. Votes from local audience might be the reason. It's strictly okay film.Overall story is good but first 25 minutes are just too fast. So many things happen in just no time and we have seen them all before. The film becomes grippy from the scene where Mithran shows his research to his friends. But whenever story starts holding, there comes some inspirational and jingoistic dialogue.The director is not shy of using almost every possible existing cliche . Whether it is the unnecessary love story or the over patriotic characters . The cat and mouse game was among the best but at times the focus shifts away from it.I have heard from many that Arvind swamy has given a lifetime performance in this movie but for me, it looks like he has no role other than smiling and looks almost same in every frame .And Jayam Ravi looks too serious and didn't even change his expression in the 1st half .Although, it's good but not worthy of 8.6.",average film,currently rated 8 6 imdb just too much votes local audience might be reason its strictly okay film overall story is good but first 25 minutes are just too fast so many things happen just no time we have seen them all before film becomes grippy scene where mithran shows his research his friends but whenever story starts holding there comes some inspirational jingoistic dialogue director is not shy using almost every possible existing cliche whether it is unnecessary love story or over patriotic characters cat mouse game was among best but at times focus shifts away it i have heard many that arvind swamy has given lifetime performance this movie but me it looks like he has no role other than smiling looks almost same every frame jayam ravi looks too serious didnt even change his expression 1st half although its good but not worthy 8 6,0.4861111111111111,0.16909722222222223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.24}"

8,A cop vs an evil scientist! The ultimate clash!,"This is definitely your regular Indian style film, but the script was top notch, that's the vast difference you would find in this. It was a cop-thief clash theme something like the Korean film 'Veteran'. Initially I thought it might be a remake of some Korean film, because it looks like a Korean thriller, but after learning that it was an original, I was amazed. Because, you know, the director has a nick name called remake Raja. He's known for bringing the Telugu blockbuster to the Kollywood. That's not bad and I'm not against remakes, he sure did do a wonderful job with those projects to succeed.The actors were brilliant, especially like everybody saying Aravaind Swamy in a negative role stole the show. The plus point was minimizing the musical track. I mean the narration was not interrupted by unexpected and unnecessary musics and dances like usual Indian films does, except on one occasion I think. The two and half an hour was too long, but that's the average Indian film length and totally worth it.Not easy to predict, but in a few segments you would know what might come in the next scene. Because it might be an awesome film for the Indian audience who are seeing it for the first time, but in the world stage it is just an above average with partial cliché. There were a couple twists, the ending was excellent too, and looks like a follow up might come. My only disappointment was they missed a wonderful opportunity to make this film more realistic in the line of 'Unnaipol Oruvan'. Instead, they opted to narrate it more commercially appealing way.So if you are an Indian or watch regularly Indian films, you would find it great. I was impressed with the film's promotions and it did well at the box office. Now it is getting remade in a couple of other languages, I hope they would as well do well. The brothers; the lead actor and the director did many projects together, but this one was a very special and will be a game changer for their respective career. So you might need to check it out if you haven't seen it yet. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but if you know Indian cinemas, then would learn how unusual it is.7/10",cop vs evil scientist ultimate clash,this is definitely your regular indian style film but script was top notch thats vast difference you would find this it was cop thief clash theme something like korean film veteran initially i thought it might be remake some korean film because it looks like korean thriller but after learning that it was original i was amazed because you know director has nick name called remake raja hes known bringing telugu blockbuster kollywood thats not bad im not against remakes he sure did do wonderful job with those projects succeed actors were brilliant especially like everybody saying aravaind swamy negative role stole show plus point was minimizing musical track i mean narration was not interrupted by unexpected unnecessary musics dances like usual indian films does except one occasion i think two half hour was too long but thats average indian film length totally worth it not easy predict but few segments you would know what might come next scene because it might be awesome film indian audience who are seeing it first time but world stage it is just above average with partial clich there were couple twists ending was excellent too looks like follow up might come my only disappointment was they missed wonderful opportunity make this film more realistic line unnaipol oruvan instead they opted narrate it more commercially appealing way so if you are indian or watch regularly indian films you would find it great i was impressed with films promotions it did well at box office now it is getting remade couple other languages i hope they would as well do well brothers lead actor director did many projects together but this one was very special will be game changer their respective career so you might need check it out if you havent seen it yet im not saying it is masterpiece but if you know indian cinemas then would learn how unusual it is 7 10,0.5496209289576637,0.1527575315840622,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.34}"

5,The usual cop cliché but will not appear so..,"To tell the truth I got hype by seeing 9.0 in IMDb by users.I was not very satisfied when I was watching,I thought maybe it will get interesting when Aravind Swamy comes but not so...The usual police investigation cliché and nothing so new.I didn't feel anything new in this movie probably the only scene worth watching was for the music score and the climax scene kinda was watchable after bored of the repeated things like I said. The characterization of Jayam Ravi's friends was not completely used in the movie. Maybe I found the movie bad because I had high expectations especially because when my friends started comparing The Joker from The Dark Knight to the antagonist in the movie.so,I suggest you to watch this movie only if you have watched ample amount of cop movies.",usual cop clich but will not appear so,tell truth i got hype by seeing 9 0 imdb by users i was not very satisfied when i was watching i thought maybe it will get interesting when aravind swamy comes but not so usual police investigation clich nothing so new i didnt feel anything new this movie probably only scene worth watching was music score climax scene kinda was watchable after bored repeated things like i said characterization jayam ravis friends was not completely used movie maybe i found movie bad because i had high expectations especially because when my friends started comparing joker dark knight antagonist movie so i suggest you watch this movie only if you have watched ample amount cop movies,0.5856658896658897,-0.0573053613053613,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.18}"
9,Extremely Good Concept But...,"There are so so many things that could have been done better, but hey let me take the time to say a great step in the right direction. If you are someone who is not willing to be emotionally indulged and love a social subject with a bit of typical cinematic stuff, then yes this is it, you may not get many such movies please watch. Personally I would like movie makers to control the itch to add the artificial fights and the out-of-screenplay songs. Imagine the depth of the movie without those and a bit more of logical screenplay wow, then we are talking of a masterpiece. But it was a genuinely good feeling coming out of the movie and yes not everyone in the audience would enjoy a total logical package so I think its a class 1 entertainer and Arvind Swamy and Ravi have done exceedingly well. The lead actress Nayanthara to her credit also supports very well to the plot.

9,Worth Spending - Best of its type,"Minimally the movie is a must watch experience for all class cinema lovers.Thriller,Action,Some piece of Social message.The movie has quite good characterization from the 1st level characters to the final level supporting characters are perfectly and beautifully mannered.Aravind Swamy portrays the villain character as 'Never before in Kollywood'.From his mannerism,body language,attitude he has shown much of evilness more than hat of the script wanted which suits the character perfectly.My favorite scene of the movie would be the pre-climax sequence where Siddarth Abimanyu (Character) hears to his father's words,The scene in the investigation room.The movie totally emphasizes our Indian society and a battle of a 'Single Man'(Thani Oruvan) who want to protect the society and a 'Single Man' Who knows only about 'Money'However, you have shown interest in the screenplay.The message of the movie will catch you surely! Go for it!There is no speed breaker & a perfect song placement The Villain's character is well designed and more special from other negative characters of Kollywood Cinema.This movie is totally different from M.Raja's earlier movies.Unexpected turnings and easily catch-able screenplay.The best movie of this kind ""GOOD vs EVIL"".You'll have no reason to hate this film.

10,A perfect handicraft,"Imagine a cop, who keeps a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable (?), Realistic, Time bound) goal to demolish one bigwig criminal in his lifetime and secretly maintains a R&D center to study the latter. He has a skill developed since his childhood to read media news between the lines and strongly believes every small-time crime news item appearing has at its back hidden an organised crime. His skills of reading between lines, connecting the dots & of course the never dying passion, brings him into the battleground with one Siddarth.Also imagine a criminal, who plans more on covering himself from the crimes he masterminds, than on the crime itself. He is one helluva opportunist, who takes birth in a minister's car with the siren on, does an unimaginable cease of an opportunity at age 15, and controls the powerhouse of politics, business and research together through his allies and alas, he is a renowned scientist. His smooth flow gets perturbed on one Dec. 10, when his plan to discourage announcement of generic drugs by a swiss pharma owner lady gets deviated for a while, and he is in the battleground with our cop Mitran.Thani Oruvan is likable for every aspect of it. I generally judge a Director's capacity in creating the unique personality for his characters and ensuring the character maintains the same throughout the plot. M Raja & SuBa get 5 star on this aspect. The way the traits of both Ravi & Aravind are etched and maintained through shows the efficiency.Aravind Swamy (of Roja fame) is a real discovery in the role of Antagonist (or should we say, the protagonist? I wonder, why not?). He will actually make us like the villain of the movie more than the hero. Quiet a contrary. The crisp & slow delivery of simple, yet powerful dialogues between him & his father (played by Thambi Ramayya) are treat. Of course, Ravi & Nayantara have done their best as usual. Never loses curiosity. No loopholes in the story. No mediocrity in production values. Limited but essential use of CG.

7,Acceptable to be called the Best Cop Drama recently but only if you can overlook multiple Functional loopes.,"Thani Oruvan (2015) : Brief Review -Acceptable to be called the Best Cop Drama recently but only if you can overlook multiple Functional loopes. Thani Oruvan is deserving acclaimed cop drama as fas as mainstream filmmaking is concerned but if you really want to look after quality and sensibility then this one is trapped badly while trying to look extra smart. You see some films try to be over smart and then in the same process they leave many loope holes behind which have lost the basic sense. Thani Oruvan is about an honest cop who has only one Mission in his life and that is of course to destroy crime sections. The officer decides to take on the king so that puppets would go off silently and his mission will be accomplished. But we call antagonist the King for a reason, of course he is one step ahead of protagonist and so as expected he loses his control and anger (so cheap and outdated it was). While making this one look advanced cop film i mean adding some technical advances, gadgets, devices etc. Thani Oruvan really looks lavish and innovative but only to lose the basic sense after some time. See, a cop is being traced but only when director wish to show the scene otherwise he's doing everything fine without being traced. I mean what the hell? If a person is being traced 24x7 then all his activities must be traced by so called genius antagonist, right? But that doesn't seems like scene here and like I said there are lots of functional theories and loop holes in the film which you have to overlook to enjoy this cat and mouse fight. But come on, when you see a film having IMDb rating almost at 8.5/10, you can't just accept so many loopes, so it's better to call it Highly overrated in that sense. Otherwise, as a mainstream cop drama this one is a fantastic film by margin. If you've had enough of hard-core hero vs Villain face offs then this one is somewhat intelligent and Advanced to be preferred over other cop dramas. Thani Ovuran is lifted by technical support otherwise it is so typical. That unnecessary Romance, useless backdrop of villian, typical climax and trying to have something intentional in the name of patriotism is just so not cool. I don't see any logic in the writing when you destroy your own fine and solid character childishly without even thinking of where did you begin it, on what level you introduced him and what are you doing to him now for no strong reasons. The acting, cinematography, background score, action, direction everything is upto the fine line but nothing goes beyond. Overall, a Nice film and recommendable but not as a Classic.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",acceptable be called best cop drama recently but only if you can overlook multiple functional loopes,thani oruvan 2015 brief review acceptable be called best cop drama recently but only if you can overlook multiple functional loopes thani oruvan is deserving acclaimed cop drama as fas as mainstream filmmaking is concerned but if you really want look after quality sensibility then this one is trapped badly while trying look extra smart you see some films try be over smart then same process they leave many loope holes behind which have lost basic sense thani oruvan is about honest cop who has only one mission his life that is course destroy crime sections officer decides take king so that puppets would go off silently his mission will be accomplished but we call antagonist king reason course he is one step ahead protagonist so as expected he loses his control anger so cheap outdated it was while making this one look advanced cop film i mean adding some technical advances gadgets devices etc thani oruvan really looks lavish innovative but only lose basic sense after some time see cop is being traced but only when director wish show scene otherwise hes doing everything fine without being traced i mean what hell if person is being traced 24x7 then all his activities must be traced by so called genius antagonist right but that doesnt seems like scene here like i said there are lots functional theories loop holes film which you have overlook enjoy this cat mouse fight but come when you see film having imdb rating almost at 8 5 10 you cant just accept so many loopes so its better call it highly overrated that sense otherwise as mainstream cop drama this one is fantastic film by margin if youve had enough hard core hero vs villain face offs then this one is somewhat intelligent advanced be preferred over other cop dramas thani ovuran is lifted by technical support otherwise it is so typical that unnecessary romance useless backdrop villian typical climax trying have something intentional name patriotism is just so not cool i dont see any logic writing when you destroy your own fine solid character childishly without even thinking where did you begin it what level you introduced him what are you doing him now no strong reasons acting cinematography background score action direction everything is upto fine line but nothing goes beyond overall nice film recommendable but not as classic rating 7 10 by,0.47118012422360245,0.08875776397515527,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.22}"
